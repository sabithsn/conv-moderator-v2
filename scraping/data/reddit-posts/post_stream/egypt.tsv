dpvaw7o	Hi everyone, I am a grad from computer engineering and have been working for 4 years now in both start ups and corporate in various roles, most recently tech sales. I got inspired by the question I always find here about CS vs CE so I made a tiktok account to answer questions about tech in egypt and how the work life is here and how to prepare for it, my format is basically AMA and I relate the answers to egypt and my experience.

7ucybjle	I’m 20f & i’ve never had a boyfriend. I’ve been told many times that i’m fairly good looking & fun to be around and many showed interest but for some reason they never really do any effort for us to be anything..   لا عمري ارتبطت ولا صاحبت ولا اي حاجة ونفسي اعرف ازاي اصلا اتنين بيتصاحبوا؟ كل اللي حواليا بيصاحبوا ويفركشوا مرتين تلاتة في الشهر وانا لوحدي عمر ما حد فكر يصاحبني. السؤال بقى هل العيب فيا؟   هل انا المفروض اروح اقوله مثلا نرتبط ولا بتقضوها تلميحات ولا اقوله نخرج ولا هي بتيجي ازاي عشان انا فترة المراهقة كلها راحت ومعيشتهاش. يا ريت الولاد يقترحولي كيف اصطاد رجلاً.

8151p6d8	Ok, the fact that people are making such a big deal out of this movie to the point that it is being discussed at مجلس النواب is literal proof that we are spiraling way down. Seriously? It's just a fucking movie. Instead of promoting young entrepreneurs or discussing things that actually matter, we're sitting here judging a NON-EGYPTIAN MOVIE, on national fucking television.   The problem will always lie with الامر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر an ideology that will consistently set us back, while the entire world is moving forward. You can have your beliefs about LGBTQ+ or sex, etc etc, its your right, but keep it to yourself. Why take time to judge others when they have done absolutely nothing wrong to you. Thats it, the value of time, a concept that people in general even me sometimes fail to understand. If you spent two minutes of your time cussing out someone on the internet and god-forbid something happens and you die, you will beg to take those two minutes back to say goodbye to your family/friends or whatever it is that you wanted to do.  Learn to be kinder people, we are all humans, yes we have different beliefs, but thats what makes us unique, because we can learn from each other. You like something, do it, if you don't acknowledge, ignore it, and teach your children to do the same. Again, it's your right, but keep it yourself, and if you really feel the need to let your beliefs out, then provide ADVICE, not attack someone else for simply being them.

8m8q3ery	Hey Guys. I think a few of you are confused 🤔 as to what Netflix is.  Netflix isn’t one of your constitutional rights and it’s not a public service.  It’s not القناة الاولى.  What it is, is a private corporation that offers a subscription service to its catalogue of films, some of which it produces.  YOU PAY 💰 💰 💰 NETFLIX MONEY TO CONSUME THEIR CONTENT.  So… I guess… just don’t give them your مية و خمسة و ستين جنية كل شهر if you don’t like what they have to offer?!  This would be like me travelling abroad and visiting a strip club, paying to get in, only to come screaming out that they have naked women in there trying to shove their asses 🍑 in my face.  AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I STILL VISIT THE SAME STRIP CLUB, PAY TO GET IN, ONLY TO COME OUT SCREAMING AGAIN.   Surprised. That. They. Still. Have. Naked. Women. In… THE STRIP CLUB.  I guess what I’m trying to say is…  I know everyone has different opinions on just about everything, that’s FINE.  Your values matter, they really do.  But they only matter to YOU.  I don’t give a f*ck about your values and I don’t expect you to give a f*ck about mine.  The world is a big place and you can’t please everyone. If Netflix tried to make films everyone found agreeable, we would probably end up with a ton of cat 🐈 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 movies — and nothing else.  Feel free to never watch Netflix again.  Personally, I’ll keep enjoying Mona Zaki’s awful acting.	1643042010.0	sbq5ra	/r/Egypt/comments/sbq5ra/netflix_is_not_one_of_your_constitutional_rights/	Netflix Is NOT One Of Your Constitutional “Rights”

h1klkmag	Hi, so it's been roughly 1 year since I landed here and to this day I haven't made any connections mostly due to the language barrier and mindset barriers as well    although I like talking with the gatekeeper next to my house he listens a lot to me and offers advice he's a cool old man, usually I shown him illustrations , maps and writing of my novels since I'm a Sci-Fi fantasy writer   I tend to keep to myself a lot mostly because I'm extremely passionate towards these things, I can go on so many hours of talking on how beautiful the cosmos of the galaxy is and how mysterious the unknown is! It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.   Therefore, we ought to praise their success and ensure that our future is not like theirs.	1643103330.0	sc9w1f	/r/Egypt/comments/sc9w1f/afghanistan/	Afghanistan

Why's no one mentioning the anniversary of 2011's revolution (the greatest revolution in modern history) which was only 11 years ago??  They're ignoring it like it never happened or like if it was a "bad" memory which they don't want to remember which is *completely* ridiculous.  How's uniting people to revolt aganist injustice and corruption smth bad?

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.	1643119478.0	scehs7	/r/Egypt/comments/scehs7/i_have_a_general_question_for_yall_but_please/	I have a general Question for y'all, but please, easy with the pitch forks.

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.

i9o5ose7	Hi everyone. I'm from M\*nsoura and I'm having a bit of an issue that seems ridiculously intractable. I'm trying to translate a utility bill (فاتورة الغاز to be precise) to present to a foreign bank as a proof of address. I went to an approved translation centre and they said they couldn't translate utility bills. Now I'm stuck. I do know how to translate it on my own but I don't know if there should be a special formatting, special vocab, etc.   Would genuinely appreciate any help with this.

h1klkmag	Hi, so it's been roughly 1 year since I landed here and to this day I haven't made any connections mostly due to the language barrier and mindset barriers as well    although I like talking with the gatekeeper next to my house he listens a lot to me and offers advice he's a cool old man, usually I shown him illustrations , maps and writing of my novels since I'm a Sci-Fi fantasy writer   I tend to keep to myself a lot mostly because I'm extremely passionate towards these things, I can go on so many hours of talking on how beautiful the cosmos of the galaxy is and how mysterious the unknown is! It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.   Therefore, we ought to praise their success and ensure that our future is not like theirs.	1643103330.0	sc9w1f	/r/Egypt/comments/sc9w1f/afghanistan/	Afghanistan

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.      EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I definitely understand that ones experience in Egypt has a direct correlation unfortunately to ones financial and social status, where you live who you know, etc, which fuggin sucks, people should be able to have a good life no matter what.       I feel like I'm gonna have a bad time living there overall, but I still plan on visiting for a week or so to visit family and friends and perhaps maybe even meet some of you?

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.  Ill be drinking one for you.   Remember those who gave their lives to a lost cause. Remember those who still suffer the consequences. Your death have been in vain, we failed you.

hhur186x	Years ago I used to buy from concrete and they were great but they got expensive and my family got poorer (middle class on the edge of being poor)... I mean they jumped from like 300 l.e during sale to a freaking 700-1000 l.e.   Anyways I tried town team and gave it many chances but their pants are easily ripped and the color fades pretty easily.  I just need a good pair of jeans with a fair price because I'm still a college student and I don't want to put much pressure on my family.

It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.

6p4sw5vi	One thing I realized about living in England is that a lot of British people romanticize the colonial past and almost all of them agree that they shouldn’t return the artifacts back to Egypt because it’s unstable country and the artifacts aren’t safe there and they say because we are high on the corruption index and ruled by a dictator and they always use the 2011 artifact looting that happened in cairo when there was political instability and the police was focused on the protestors rather than the museums and the treasures.

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.   Therefore, we ought to praise their success and ensure that our future is not like theirs.	1643103330.0	sc9w1f	/r/Egypt/comments/sc9w1f/afghanistan/	Afghanistan

Why's no one mentioning the anniversary of 2011's revolution (the greatest revolution in modern history) which was only 11 years ago??  They're ignoring it like it never happened or like if it was a "bad" memory which they don't want to remember which is *completely* ridiculous.

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.      EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I definitely understand that ones experience in Egypt has a direct correlation unfortunately to ones financial and social status, where you live who you know, etc, which fuggin sucks, people should be able to have a good life no matter what.       I feel like I'm gonna have a bad time living there overall, but I still plan on visiting for a week or so to visit family and friends and perhaps maybe even meet some of you?

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.

I'm trying to translate a utility bill (فاتورة الغاز to be precise) to present to a foreign bank as a proof of address. I went to an approved translation centre and they said they couldn't translate utility bills, for whatever fucking reason. Now I'm stuck. I do know how to translate it on my own but I don't know if there should be a special formatting, special vocab, etc.  Would genuinely appreciate any help with this.

h1klkmag	So I was going to work and I had a funny encounter I thought to post about it today for entertainment   I ordered an Uber today and as usual I waited 10 minutes til he came through but he was one street away i brushed it off since locations tend to glitch a couple times, I walked to him and the car was in a questionable  Condition and he was parked in the middle of a puddle so idk what was going through his mind but then again I said fine maybe he's not from Cairo or something maybe idk  When i ushered him to come forth and I got in the car my doubts were confirmed, he had an old Samsung phone that glitches every 5 secs so I didn't give him a hard time at all, because I been there back when in my home place  Later that ride the guy started a conversation and in my mind I was like *Oh fuck not one of these talkative ones* bear in mind I got autism and a terrible experience with some drivers so my hairs on my neck all stood up.  Anyways the dialogue goes like this..  *"Are you from here?"* The driver asked menacingly I didn't wanna give away that I'm Greek despite me looking like a Jesus clone. I had zero time to react  *"Yeah Cairo is my home I just come and go"* I replied  He later on carried the conversation forth, it appeared that my short responses weren't working to kill it off, poor attempt but admirable effort I suppose  *"So where did you live before"* he asked menacingly  *"uh Dubai"* I replied while screaming internally  Jesus fucking christ on a bicycle I keep digging myself a hole but anyways I had to keep the conversation going  *"did you graduate here or there"* he asked  *"I graduated there"* I replied  *"what did you major in?"*  he asked  *"uh game developer"* i replied, my brain hates me  A GAME DEVELOPER ? ARE YOU STUPID? the dude probably thinks I'm a mommy's boy doing a shit major tf man I mean I am Sci-Fi writer for almost 5 years but still I guess a game developer was close enough to that lmaoo Keep in mind my Arabic is very basic so If you tune in enough you'd definitely know I suck at it terribly   luckily the ride came to an end before he could notice that and funnily enough the guy was a young genuine dude maybe he was inappropriate by asking personal questions but then again that's Egypt so I guess it's fine  Usually with people on the spectrum such as myself I tend to lie on these particular exchanges because you never know what might happen plus I don't give out personal information that easily but you know..   one thing it is funny how there's multiple Ubers in Egypt each one of them knows me with a different profession that makes me giggle when I think about it sometimes	1643223002.0	sdd8sc	/r/Egypt/comments/sdd8sc/awkward_uber_exchange_storytime/	Awkward Uber Exchange (Storytime!)

50u76tc9	A honest message from me and I would love and appreciate anyone who read it because it kinda affect my mental health I went to take commerce diploma by force "دبلوم فني تجاري" however my dad are not living with me now and my mom died and I'm now almost living by myself, and now I'm in first year in Cairo university's facility of commerce and I feel like I did the best thing anyone with the same diploma can do. However, now I'm grown up more and understand things more, I feel so bad so mad and so sad I feel like I missed a lot, I really wished if I could go to normal high school and study biology and chemistry and whatever they study there, I feel like I'm below average and have an abnormal urge to study in highschool, actually if I could I would probably do it and abandon the university all together, at least I will have more choices to choose what I want When I see students like me who are in commerce like me and they came from highschool it make me feel better because it feels like I'm more normal  But I can't help it, I keep feeling like I missed a lot lot lot I missed high school math and chemistry I mean the fact that I never had chemistry in my life after middle school make me go insane  I get it I can study online and stuff, I try but it's never the same feeling, you are not young anymore you're not with your fellow friends and people like you anymore. I read as much books as possible I look online and study as much as possible about whatever I can  But there's always that feeling I'm missing, I feel part of me is missed, I thought I got along with that but that feelings started to hunt me again when I got accepted in Cairo university What the fuck is going on with me?	1643239744.0	sdjo92	/r/Egypt/comments/sdjo92/anyone_went_to_any_of_دبلومات_الثانوية_الفنية/	Anyone went to any of "دبلومات الثانوية الفنية"?

xwbom	Today, the subreddit has reached 150k members. Thank you all for the years of content and the sense of community on the sub, for the laughs and the memes, for the up-to-date news and discussions, for sticking around and watch the subreddit grow.   The subreddit has gone through several revamps since it's making in 2008, all for building a better community for Egyptians to ask questions, check the news or even watch relatable memes, but throughout the changes, a lot of things were just not fully done, either under development or ignored for a while as it wasn't as important, but we've realized that with a larger community, everything is needed, and we're happy to announce some changes that has been done to improve the subreddit even further and make it complete  # The wiki  The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/wiki/index) has been in the making for a while now, trying to enhance it with the user's help and add as much useful information as possible. A new and a revamped travel guide has been added, and it isn't only for foreigners but for you too, from hotels to pubs to places you'd want to visit. We will be adding more as time goes on. What about some common questions? We've made an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/about/wiki/faq) page to answer the most common questions on the sub, but **here's where you can come in**. We're asking the community to post the most common questions being asked around, so we could add it to the FAQ page (any user who answers the questions and has his answer added in the page will be credited).  # Appearance  Building a community needs something special, and what's more special than the iconic snoo icon. We've also revamped the banner to give it a more special feel to it. The upvote/downvote buttons have also been changed to be aligned with the subreddit's theme (switch to light mode to view it).  # Top 10 posts  The sub has come a long way, especially the last 2 years and 5 of the 10 top posts on the subreddit were only done this year, which shows how much the community has grown and became more active.   1.

7cw1q7qt	Long story short I'm 17, born into a below middle class family, I used to be a straight A student, able to study all day and usually was at the top of my class however since 2 years ago when corona started my family and I have been through a lot of shit which has greatly affected my mental health.  Because of those 2 years I spent not studying, I seem to have lost my ability to concentrate more than 30 minutes, I'm barely able to finish one task a day but since my family isn't rich the only way I can be successful is through academic success. My parents also have a lot of expectations for me.   I can't seem to study anymore and my grades are fumbling hard, can't even find the motivation to get out of bed or even eat due to all of that my relationship with my parents is horrible, they don't seem to care about me and as much as they care about my grades.   The education system is also disgustingly out of order nowadays so I have no idea what to expect for my tests meaning I don't even know how to prepare myself.  I don't know what to do so any advice will be greatly appreciated.	1643276311.0	sduncr	/r/Egypt/comments/sduncr/how_do_i_survive_thanwia_3ama/	How do I survive thanwia 3ama ?
13vbod	I'm putting this here as a comparison to that Russian tourist guy who went to a "rotten neighborhood" in Egypt and discovered that people didn't treat him like a king or something.  So this video of a Chinese lady in Egypt who bought tea, and the guy didn't take money from her, so she went and bought some sweets and tried to gave it to him, and he refused, so she distributed the sweets to the people in the street, and these people invited her to eat breakfast with them.  She is saying that before she came to Egypt, everyone was telling her that Egypt is full of theives, but she saw that there are good people.  I couldn't find the original video or her channel on tiktok, so this twitter post is my only source.  https://twitter.com/jazzmine92_/status/1486009611161415690?t=qPF6DYla2AdWYSkRofBEcg	1643277201.0	sduus8	/r/Egypt/comments/sduus8/chinese_lady_in_egypt/	Chinese lady in Egypt

You're telling me that the best team in africa cant even compete in the prem?  Im also lowkey tired of people shitting on the NT cause they arent up to salah's "standard."

3ya6vtxc	So I am 18 and I was raised in a muslim conservative family. No one knows my true beliefs except for one close friend. The problem is I cant pretend, I cant hide what I think. My father already sees that I avoid religious rituals and that I always have different opinions about controversial trends as that Mona Zaki movie for example and our relationship isnt very good lately but I cant tell him what I truly think, for the most part I just stay silent or avoid him in general. He is very judgemental and he really gave me traumas when I was kid so there is that as well. If I one day just tell him (which I know that its very likely because pretending is really tiring for me) he will just hate me forever, I am not certain tbh but what I am certain of is that he is not the understanding type at all so what should I do? One final thing before these comments come in : I did my research, I didnt leave the religion to follow my lust and desires, I dont even smoke because I simply dont want to and I hate everything that might affect my health or turn into an addiction. I am open for discussion as well so if someone thinks he can convince me otherwise he/she can contact me, thanks.	1643300966.0	se2baa	/r/Egypt/comments/se2baa/how_to_manage_being_an_agnostic_in_such_a_society/	How to manage being an agnostic in such a society ?

What do you think he will do? Defend himself So the guy punched him back after that a kid came with a fucking knife and opened the guy face (he penetrated 4 out of 7 layers of skin) and ran away  There was people who recorded and witness  Now to the important part in the court the teen said he didnt but people came with literally vids and photos so what do you think happened? He got jailled nah he payed for the surgery for the teen that has has cutted nah He didn't get any thing he got out of the fucking court without a fucking day in the jail You wonder why?

9iad6yz0	First off, the israeli’s are not all bad and alot are actually like Egyptians who don’t support the ruling regime so you can’t show all of them hate for the acts of their government and army (yes, almost all of them join the IDF at one point or another but its compulsory for them so its no different to us. “But they still often kill our palestinian siblings while in service” “what about the children” yes thats true and yes it happens and this is actually the point I’m building up to, if you were to be infront of an enemy soldier would you fight and kill him or would you withdraw so you don’t confess to their existence and just run? I’ll leave the answer to you. Israel as a country very well exists and we should acknowledge this instead of turning a blind eye, acting like a country simply doesn’t exist so you don’t worry about it is childish, lazy and stupid. I want to hear your opinions on the athlete and others who lately withdrew from fighting israelis and gave them a free ticket to the finals.	1643375164.0	seqdx0	/r/Egypt/comments/seqdx0/i_think_arab_athletes_withdrawing_from_fights/	I think arab athletes withdrawing from fights with their israeli counterparts is stupid and here’s why

Hands them to the bigger officer - goes through my phone - looks into Telegram, browser history, (gallery?) I’m not sure - he found nothing, obviously, but I gathered it’s got more to do with national security issues (?), I totally accept that Egypt’s being Egypt.   Then he takes a picture of my ID on the phone and asks for my phone number - this felt kinda weird to me.   Is this really NORMAL?   I feel slightly violated and feel like changing my number - but I wouldn’t want THAT turning into another pointless investigation if I’m ever stopped again - since personal privacy seemingly isn’t even on the bottom of the priory list here.	1643389126.0	sev93c	/r/Egypt/comments/sev93c/mobile_phone_inspection/	Mobile phone inspection?

9rhgu9gj	Does anyone here know Nassim Nicholas Taleb? If you do? Have you read or watched any of his work?   I have read some of his work, and I am fascinated with the concept of "antifragility." And how antifragility is the opposite of fragility and not robustness, where it gained its strength from disorders, errors, randomness, volatility. And finally, why every society should be antifragile more than robust.   Here is a quote of the concept "Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet."     He predicted the 2008 financial rescission, In 2007 when he wrote "The Black Swan."  He also said that Egypt would pay the price just after the revolution because our economy didn't have any volatility, stressor, or any ani fragility. It went through the robust category for 40 years.      If you are familiar with him, Share your thoughts.	1643446826.0	sfe6gw	/r/Egypt/comments/sfe6gw/nassim_nicholas_taleb/	Nassim Nicholas Taleb

1qf7ksh8	Hello,   My mother was born and raised in Cairo, met my father (American) and moved to America with him.   I am 32 year old male visiting Egypt for the first time, I will be traveling with my wife.     I want to meet my family.... however all the conversations with them have been kind of weird.  I do not speak Arabic, and it seems their English isn't good.   My female cousin makes remarks that seem romantic in nature.   Her brother has told me to meet him alone, and won't provide the address to my uncles home.   I think it might be translation, but I get a weird feeling.   My second cousin speaks better English, and has been eager to pick us up from the airport and to take us to see everything.   This seems very nice... but I have never met any of these people.   Is this normal?  Am I reading too deep into this?  Is it just an issue with translation?	1643470161.0	sfke2y	/r/Egypt/comments/sfke2y/lost_in_translation_or_just_weird/	Lost in translation or just weird?

I know most of Egypt is Muslim, but there are non-Muslims living in Egypt.  Is it fair for non-Muslims to live under Muslim rules just because we are the majority?   Freedom of religion means that we should all be equal, but I don’t think we have religious equality in Egypt.

1vh8nkq9	هبدأ من أول الكشف الطبى، انا عندى حكاية أغرب من الخيال بس مش هينفع أقولها لان حاسس ان ممكن ناس هنا يعرفونى لانها very odd، المهم رحت كشفت والمفروض ان عندى حاجة ممكن تتطلعنى بس مطلعتش والدكتور كتبلى انى عندى حاجة تانية مشتكتش منها اصلا ودخلت لائق أ فى الاخر.  فى البداية، انا انطوائى شوية او شويتين ومش بتكلم كتير، اول يوم لقيت نفسى ماشى فى طوابير ومعايا ناس كتير اوى وناس عارفة بعض وناس بتواسى بعض وانا قاعد وحدى بفكر ازاى ادخل القفل من التفتيش علشان اقفل الدولاب بتاعى بقفل كمبيوتر.  المهم الناس البتفتش خدوا من الناس الأدوية والاقفال الكمبيوتر وأول ما جه دورى علشان اتفتش، العسكرى قالى انت خريج كلية ايه؟ قولتله هندسة قالى عدى ومفتشنيش، مش عارف ايه الفكرة بس الحمد لله انى عديت. المهم كان فى فقرة مش ظريفة وبعدها رحت علشان أستلم المخلة، بالرغم انى رحت بدرى إلا إن المخلة استلمتها على المغرب تقريباً وملحقتش أقيس حاجة، أستلمت المخلة ولقيت الكوتش الباتا أصغر من مقاسى فقولت للظابط المسئول على المكان ان الكوتش ضيق راح قالى نعم قولتلوا حضرتك الكوتش ضيق قالى ده مش اسمه كوتش ده اسمه باتا كان موقف غريب بس كان ظابط محترم وحاول يساعدنى.  رحت الكتيبة بتاعتى وكان هناك عسكرى أمن مش بيحبنى لله فى لله مش عارف ليه هههه، قال المعاه قلم فلماستر يطلعوا وانا كان معايا واحد ومش بعرف أخبى بيبان عليا علطول لو حد سأل على حاجة وانا مش بعرف أكدب المهم العسكرى جه وقالى طلعه فعطيتهولو كده كده مكنش فارق معايا غير القفل الكمبيوتر والدوا هههه.  دخلت العنبر لقيت معايا 60 واحد بس لحسن الحظ، السرير الفوقيا كان لواحد كان معايا فى الكلية وبرده القدامى كان لاتنين أعرفهم فقولت الجمد لله. فتحت المخلة وقعدت أدور على الترينج علشان البسه وكان مقاسى الحمد لله، روحت أخدت الفوطة ورحت علشان ادخل الحمام لقيت فى طوابير وكان الجو ساقعة اوى كنا فى الشتا والماية فى الحنفية نازلة تلج، أستنيت دورى ودخلت وكانت حاجة مقرفة فعلاً لان فيه ناس معندهمش انسانية ولا جزء صغير من الرقى، أكيد انتوا فهمتوا قصدى مش لازم أكمل. رجعت العنبر علشان أنام كانت الساعة تقريباً 11 بليل والمفروض أصحى 4 الا عشرة علشان طابور اللياقة واليوم ده منمتش كويس لان ريحة البطانية مكنتش حلوة وكمان الناس كانت بتعمل صوت من مناخيرها مزعج اوى وكان مفيش أى Sync بينهم فطول الوقت لازم تسمع الصوت ده تحس انهم كانوا بيتخانقوا مع بعض.  جه العسكرى يصحينا الساعة 4 الا عشرة وأنا مش قادر أقوم ملحقتش أنام اصلاً بس كان لازم أقوم علشان أتفادى طابور طويل لدخول دورة المياه، كنت فى الاول بنام بترينج كنت جايبه من البيت واصحى اغير الترينج والبس ترينج اللياقة الاستلمته بس لقيت الباقى بينام بترينج اللياقة وبيسبقونى فكل حاجة فقلت فاكس هنام زى باقى الشعب. لبست الباتا وخرجت على الطابور والجو كان ساقع جداً وقعدت على الأرض مستنى دورى علشان أدخل الميس وكنت أول مرة أدخله، دخلت مع واحد وأخدت العيش وطبعاً مكلتش من الفول، كلت علبة المربى بجزء من العيش وانطلقت على طابور اللياقة عند المنصة، المنصة كبيرة جداً وبيتجمع عندها كل الفى مركز التدريب، وكان فى طابورين، طابور لياقة وطابور تدريب عسكرى.  كان عندى تظلم طبى فى مركز التدريب، المهم رحنا مستشفى نتعرض على دكتور وكان معايا حوالى 200 واحد مثلاً، كانت احسن حاجة فى المستشفى ان كان فيها كنتين وكانوا عاملين سندوتشات طعمية وبانيه وكفتة تقريباً، طبعاً البانيه والكفتة من المعلبات بس كان بقالى 14 يوم مثلاً مش باكل كويس فجبت سندوتشات بانيه وكان شعور جميل، كنت حاسس انى اكتشفت حاسة التذوق تانى. فى موقف وانا بكشف ان كان بيشرف علينا عساكر قبل ما ندخل للدكتور والمفروض كمان انهم دكاترة فشوفت عسكرى وسألته الحاجة العندى دى ممكن تتطلع، رد عليا قال بكلام مكنتش مركز معاه لان اكتشفت انه معلق بادج إدارة الخدمات البيطرية، طلع دكتور بيطرى حسيت انى سألت سؤال غلط لشخص غلط هههههه.  طبعاً أخدت لائق تانى، ورجعت للكتيبة حكيت لصاحبى عن سندوتش البانيه الكلتله، الناس كانت بتحسدنى على السندوتش ده هههه. وفى يوم اطعمنا فيه كلنا، اخدنا حقنة تقريبا ضد البرد او حاجة مش فاكر، المهم اخدتها ولقيت مناخيرى بتنزل دم رحت لظابط مشرف قولتله انا اخدت الحقنة ونزل دم من مناخيرى يا فندم قالى انت كتيبة كام قولتله كتيبه كذا قالى روح على كتيبتك ههههههه. كان موقف غريب بصراحة.   كان فى يوم بينادوا علي المهندسين علشان التوزيع على الوحدة الأساسية فالظابط نده على المنصة كل المهندسين يجمعوا فرحت عند المنصة وقعدت شوية وبعد كده دخلنا لظابط، طبعا مينفعش تبص للظابط لازم تكون واقف وقفة عسكرية، الظابط سألنى انت خريج قسم ايه قولتله مدنى قالى تقدريك ايه قلتله امتياز مع مرتبة الشرف (ياريت كانت مرتبة كنت نمت عليها فى الجيش كويس ههه) قالى مرتب على الدفعة قولتله كان ترتيبى كذا (كنت من أول 10 بس مش هقول ترتيبى بالظبط) قالى اتعينت فى الجامعة قولتله لأ يا فندم بيعينوا أول 2 او 3 بس راح قايلى ما انتا فاشل (طبعاً كان بيهزر بس انا مكنتش بضحك لو ظابط هزر احتياطى يحسن يكون بيتكلم جد) واخد اسمى معاه.  الناس الحمد لله كانوا بيحبونى لله فى لله، وانا مش بتكلم كتير ومعرفش حد بس كتير أوى كانوا بيقلولى انت يا إما مهندس يا إما دكتور مش عارف ليه اخدوا الانطباع ده حتى فى الوحدة الأساسية كتير بردوا قالولى كده مع انهم اول مرة يشوفونى، المهم اتعرفت على ناس كتير مع انى انطوائى ودى حاجة كنت مبسوط منها الحمد لله، ونزلنا أجازة 6 أيام وطبعاً النزول مكنش لمركز التدريب كله مره واحدة كان ناس وبعدها بيوم ناس تانيين، اليوم  ده مكنتش اعرف انى نازل اجازة ولا أصلا حد من الكتيبة كان يعرف فنمت الساعة 8 بليل وكنت بنام بدرى فى الجيش فلقيت العساكر بتصحينى الساعة 2 تقريباً وبيهزوا فيا جامد أصحى احنا نازلين اجازة النهاردة طبعاً اتبسطت جداً صحيت ظبت الدنيا ونمت لحد ما نزلنا اجازة ومكنتش قايل لأهلى انى نازل اجازة لانى مكنتش اعرف اصلا، نزلت اجازة وقبل ما اروح عديت على مطعم فول وطعمية مشهور وجبت سندوتشات للبيت وطبعاً البيت اتفاجىء انى جيت كان شعور جميل أوى.  فى المجمل مركز التدريب كان أحسن فترة فى الجيش بالنسبة ليا واتعرفت على ناس كتير اوى واستفدت جامد فى التواصل مع الناس وازاى تتصرف فى ظروف صعبة، لو أنت داخل الجيش حاول تستفيد بالسنة بتاعتك ومتعملش مشاكل وافتكر فى النهاية انك بتعمل حاجة لبلدك وفى يوم من الأيام ممكن تتطلب علشان تدافع عن أهلك ففكر بالطريقة دى دايماً هتلاقى الموضوع جميل.	1643490666.0	sfrtfa	/r/Egypt/comments/sfrtfa/يوميات_فى_مركز_التدريب/	يوميات فى مركز التدريب

h1klkmag	Hey there! While I am a foreigner having fun here. Since I am a Sci-fi Fantasy author I am currently working on a franchise trilogy since 2018 and will publish it around 2023 back home. So I figured while I am here I've been inspired to write something related Egypt. I'll work on it after I'm done with the project at hand currently.  *"An ancient Egyptian priest discovers time travel and ends up in modern in Egypt. Being shocked and  having to Struggle to find his way back due to language barriers and difficulty coping ,he goes on a long adventure instead"*  I'm excited to write or refine that concept even though ancient Egypt has been butchered by Sci-fi writers, I'll give it a shot and see how it ends up!

8ilnce6x	[Cross posted this on Facebook]   Hello everyone   I've been meaning to ask this for a long time all because I know nothing about the Egyptian economy or the real estate market there. What I know is that I've fallen in love with the country and want to be a part of its investment sector as a foreign investor. My goal is to rent it and not live. Perhaps when the time comes I'll change my mind. But for now, I'm looking at a small vintage or modern villa home somewhere outside Cairo, preferably Hurghada, Alex, Sharm, Port Said, or by the coastal lines of the Red Sea. But where do I start? Is there an investor guide to read up on the laws, prices and the whole process? Your advice is greatly appreciated!	1643522370.0	sg2cyi	/r/Egypt/comments/sg2cyi/whats_the_way_to_invest_in_the_egyptian_real/	What's the way to invest in the Egyptian real estate market as a foreigner?

3z29epyr	بصراحه انا بحاول افهم تعامل الدوله مع الدين بشكل عام. الواقعه دي لما الواحد يحطها جنب قانون ازدراء الاديان مثلا و ان ممكن ستاند اب كوميديان يتشد من الدوله عشان حك بس في الدين. الموضوع بيسبب كونفيوچن عجيب.  هي الحاجه الوحيده اللي واضحه بالنسبه لي علي الاقل هو ان تصنيف مصر بانها دوله اسلاميه تصنيف ساذج حبتين.  الدوله المصرية بتعتقل الملحد زي شريف جابر و الملتحي زي احمد سبيع. (مع العلم بان الاولاني خرج و كمل في عمل فيديوهات و التاني لسه معتقل.) و العجيب ايضا ان المتدين و نقيضه بيقولوا انهم بيتم خنقهم من الدوله و ان الدوله بتساند الطرف التاني. يعني هتلاقي الليبرالي العلماني بيتكلم عن التنكيل بيه من طرف الدوله المسلمه اللي حطاله قانون بيضيق علي حريته. و المتدين بردو بيتكلم انه بيتم التنكيل بيه من طرف الدوله الكافره اللي سيباها مليطه.  حد ممكن يضيفلي او يصلحلي وجهه نظري؟  شكرا	1643537730.0	sg67n1	/r/Egypt/comments/sg67n1/ممكن_نتكلم_عن_امام_المسجد_الي_تم_وقفه_و_تحويله/	ممكن نتكلم عن امام المسجد الي تم وقفه و تحويله للتحقيق بسبب تصوير المسجد و هو فاضي وقت مباراة لمنتخب مصر؟

4l28zo	**Is Coptic the language of the Christians?**  &#x200B;  [Actually the word Coptic means \\"Egyptian\\". In the Coptic language to refer to the Coptic Christians is used \\"NiRemnqëmi NQrëstianos\\" which means \\"Christian Coptic\/Egyptians\\". In fact, Muslim Egyptians are also Coptic, they are simply Muslim Coptic, \\"NiRemnqëmi NMouslim\\"](https://preview.redd.it/fcxhgb5k8ue81.jpg?width=165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2226b0454906b8daf38028b36da5b0f76d158ea4)  The short answer is NO, coptic is the language of all the egyptians wherever they are christian, muslim, atheist, pagan or from every other religion.   In fact, coptic language is more ancient that christianism itself (ancient egyptians start to write the egyptian language with greek letters almost since the time of King Alexander the Great in 332 BC), so it's imposible to be "the language of the christians".   Coptic language in bohairic coptic (the main dialect) is "**ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ**", transliterated as "tiMetRemNQëmi", and it means "the language of the egyptians":     * **ϯ** (ti) means "the". * **ⲙⲉⲧ** (Met) means here "language". * **ⲣⲉⲙ** (Rem) means here "person". * **ⲛ̀** (N) is a genitive letter "from". * **ⲭⲏⲙⲓ** (Qëmi) means "Egypt" (Kemet -> Kemi).  That said, it is true that by a historical accident the Coptic language has been closely linked with the Christians of Egypt in recent centuries.  This has been so because when the Egyptians adopted the Christian religion they continued to use their language (the Egyptian language written with Greek letters), and what they did was translate the bible and religious texts into that language, Coptic.   However, when the Egyptians adopted Islam they began to speak in Arabic, as the Qur'an should not be translated, it should be read and recited in Arabic. In addition, Egypt was ruled by an Arab elite and the people always imitate the elite (before Islam, Egyptians used to be bilingual Greek-Coptic).  &#x200B;  [Diagram showing the use of the various lects of Egyptian by time period and linguistic register.](https://preview.redd.it/yqw2makl8ue81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=33893870da7c1a7c903c2733499a5b6d3e6531fb)  The Coptic language continued to be spoken during the first centuries of Islam, Egyptians used to be bilingual Arabic-Coptic. But with the passage of time, little by little it was lost, until at the end of the Middle Ages it was only spoken in small and remote villages.  &#x200B;  [Coptic is our language. It's the language that egyptians have spoked since prehistoric times.](https://preview.redd.it/myp5betm8ue81.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=2555a9fad733d15f623558792128d39773ff5af8)  At the same time, Arabic in Egypt evolved to form the modern Egyptian Arabic dialect, which has many influences from Coptic, and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Egypt, both by Muslims and Christians.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian\_Arabic#Coptic\_substratum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic#Coptic_substratum)  However, Coptic would not disappear completely, because, although in their day to day they spoke Arabic, the Christians of Egypt (the Egyptians who did not convert to Islam) continued to use the language in their rites. This is because their bible was in the Coptic language, as well as multiple hymns (recitations). It is for this reason that the Coptic language is often associated with Egyptian Christians.  &#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Ls1takorM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Ls1takorM)  *A hymn sung in Coptic. The Coptic church still uses the ancient Egyptian language in its rites.*     As we have already explained, this does not mean that coptic is a christian language, or a language for christians. Coptic is ancient egyptian written in greek letters, and it existed before the birth of Jesus. Today many pharaonists (both christian and muslim) learn and speak coptic because it is the language of their ancestors, the ancient egyptians.  &#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3uZMl4t6g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3uZMl4t6g)  *"I'm muslim and I speak coptic language because I'm Egyptian" - Ahmad Atteya.*	1643554142.0	sgapjd	/r/Egypt/comments/sgapjd/is_coptic_the_language_of_the_christians/	Is Coptic the language of the Christians?

8mab7xlc	I need some career advise please. So my major was Spanish language and literatures, graduated almost 3 years ago and ever since I've been working as a customer support, I needed to get out of my parents house so I took the first thing that came up.  The thing they do not teach you at college is that language alone is never enough, I speak three languages and the opportunities for me are translation: pay is terrible, tourism: unstable, customer service: and it's a temporary job not a career   There is nothing that I LOVE or want to learn, even if I'm gonna start from zero but there's none. Here I am changing jobs for the third time, getting paid almost the same as the first job and not moving forward, there is technically no difference between me and a fresh grad.  So my question is how did you choose a carrer? Do you think seeing a counselor would help? If yes do you recommend a specific place/ person?	1643559947.0	sgcpyr	/r/Egypt/comments/sgcpyr/career_advise/	Career advise

7at32t2o	Any civil country that sees its men as actual human beings with rights and not some slaves or piles of meat for them has already abolished conscription. It's not only a violation of basic human rights. It also reduces the amount of enrollment for higher education and self improvement, which consequently increases the notion that men are supposed to be the mindless dumb idiots who are only there to be the "muscle" for a certain job. It doesn't build "real men" it only creates illiterate uneducated idiots who are living in the writhing depth of poverty.

Egypt is supposed to be a major power, how did that happen? With Nasser at least there was a sense of hope, l think, of better times to come.

I know Super Jet has a station nearby just outside the airport but I just don't know if by the time I get there, they'll have any bus going to Alex.   Has anyone got a clue about their timings?

eqy9qxp7	I am a very religious teenager and everyday I see the weirdest things ever in egypt and I'd like to say that many of the harrasers on the streets and rapists etc claim to be religious and I see them doing awful things such as cussing which has been very normalized. For example, our religion teaches us to respect EVERYONE and by that I mean no excuses for no one. for example, we have LGBTQ people that get insulted daily, and I don't support neither insulting them nor supporting them we should just encourage them with peace and kindness to force them to like us and respect us we should respect everyone even if we don't like them and even if we absolutely hate them, this isn't what our prophet taught us he taught us to be forgiving and filled with kindness. I know this is going to get alot of hate because of uneducated people trying to justify their actions but I'm just saying the truths and I can provide u with all the sources and I also see that people take fatwas from anyone and the use it to justify awful things such as rape in marriage and rape in general and sex slaves and even BEATING UR WIFE??????! Wake up people this isn't the ummah prophet Muhammed pbuh would've wanted, I myself have seen many people on YouTube having extreme hate towards us Muslims and insulting us but I always reply with a loving introduction and inquire about their choice of words and never have they replied back with another insult.

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.   What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them.

I know the famous places like moez St, old Cairo مجمع الأديان، the museum...etc  So you guys and gals know any hidden places that are worth visiting? also I'd appreciate it if someone told me the order of visiting these places (because I don't live in Cairo so i don't know the shortcuts or means of transportation and we don't wanna spend half of the day on the road)  Thank you all in advance.	1643667727.0	she37y	/r/Egypt/comments/she37y/hidden_places_to_visit_in_cairo/	Hidden places to visit in Cairo

For this generation I'd like to come back to Xbox as Gamepass provides great value.  One important issue I'd like to enquire about though, is Xbox Live still not working properly in Egypt? I remember struggling with buying games or subscriptions through Xbox Live store, this happens to be a big deal breaker for me if its still a pain in the ass.  Any Egyptian Xbox gamers out there care to chime in? Can you please tell me what's your experience with Xbox Live and Gamepass this generation so far?	1643702956.0	shpsxz	/r/Egypt/comments/shpsxz/question_about_xbox_xbox_live_in_egypt/	Question about Xbox / Xbox Live in Egypt

owkp1g5	It has been around a year since the r/PersonalFinanceEgypt was inactive and while the days when the subreddit was active were short-lived, it was a great place to discuss our finances. Egypt's economy is different from the other developed countries that have their personal-finance subreddits, we suffer from high inflation, high-interest rates, poverty, and a large unbanked population which is probably one of the reasons personal finance is not so popular in Egypt.  I would like to try and revive this subreddit again, and I am sure that I can not do it alone, and would appreciate this subreddits help. I want to make multiple posts with a theme about "Introduction to personal finance" where we can discuss these three topics:  * Budgeting * Opening a bank account * Investing	1643708190.0	shr1qb	/r/Egypt/comments/shr1qb/revival_of_rpersonalfinanceegypt/	Revival of r/PersonalFinanceEgypt

Egypt is supposed to be a major power, how did that happen? With Nasser at least there was a sense of hope, l think, of better times to come.

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.  What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them. I also have B1 German certificate and I'm currently studying for a C1 certificate; however, I also can't afford to travel to Germany. As for public universities, I think they're gonna be much more stressful than private universities like AASTMT.	1643654336.0	sh8id7	/r/Egypt/comments/sh8id7/im_sick_of_uni_aastmt/	I'm sick of uni (AASTMT)

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.  What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them. I also have B1 German certificate and I'm currently studying for a C1 certificate; however, I also can't afford to travel to Germany. As for public universities, I think they're gonna be much more stressful than private universities like AASTMT.	1643654336.0	sh8id7	/r/Egypt/comments/sh8id7/im_sick_of_uni_aastmt/	I'm sick of uni (AASTMT)

I have been thinking on getting an iPad here in Cairo. So, my Egyptian friends, how do you buy such stuff here?

awgbqiai	i just came across the "عذاب القبر للاطفال" post, and i it seems to me that,   ppl who got more friction with religion as kids either become non religious as adults or leave it all together, ppl whose main ideas about religion growing up and into their adult hood is just do good and be kind to others seem to have a better relationship with it.   given this, i think the best thing you can do for your child is to keep them out of the religion cycle at young ages and only tell them the main outliers like, god is good..when we die we go to heaven or better yet don't indoctrinate them at all.  this has been like my philosophy for a really long time and i'd like to see what others here think on that matter.	1643762689.0	siaoc5	/r/Egypt/comments/siaoc5/are_you_goin_to_indoctrinate_your_kids_on/	Are you goin to indoctrinate your kids on religion stuff when you're older? if so to what extent?

I just finished residency as a doctor. I lived in both the US early childhood and egypt pre-college. The years I spent in egypt are those I cherish the most but I know my life will be in the US. Ill be honest and admit that my family is upper middle class american and hence was able to live very well in cairo in the 5th settlement district. Im looking for a community in america that resembles something like that. Professional muslim arab community in america that has their shit together. Most Egyptians in america dont really come from the same background (in egypt) as I do and I feel like I need to hide things. Is anyone aware of such communities in the US. Im from NYC. I heard there are nice communities in areas like dallas and orange county california.

67o6behe	Hi all, I'm doing a little research on Egypt and was hoping to have a couple of questions answered by people from there.   Recently the hashtag #Leave\_Sisi had been trending on Twitter ahead of the 25th of January. Do you guys imagine that expression of dissent on social media provides any opportunity for social or political change in the case of Egypt?   How safe do people feel in expressing their opinions online?   How is the sentiment in Egypt now? Since there seems to be an increasing crackdown on dissent, do you guys expect that there will be mobilization of any scale?   With food cards and subsidies being eliminated, how much of an impact is this expected to have on people who rely on them?   Does the recent increase in minimum wage carry any positive impact? Was this increase announced to show "improvements"?

hupqc	I’m in Sharm right now, I’m meant to meet my partner she’s Egyptian. Currently she’s in a taxi coming from Suez but the police stopped her at عيون موسي. They are also turning a lot of people away, they won’t let her pass and won’t give a specific reason.  At first they said her taxi driver may be kidnapping her. They want to contact her parents but they have passed away, they won’t accept speaking to her uncle or sister and have forced her the driver to turn around and won’t even let them park nearby threatening to remove his license.  I don’t understand why is there strict rules here preventing people from travelling? Is this specifically for entry into Sharm and the surrounding area or is this all over the country? Neither my partner or the driver were aware this could be a problem.  Is there anything we can do? She’s thinking to take the taxi all the way to Cairo to take a bus all the way here but she has no idea if this going to be allowed either it seems insane.	1643808564.0	siopo1	/r/Egypt/comments/siopo1/advice_entry_into_sharm_elsheikh_through_عيون_موسي/	Advice entry into Sharm El-Sheikh through عيون موسي

I'm going to kill myself if no one helps me.   I've been struggling with depression for 15 years, my life has been just a series of misfortunes. My current situation is that I feel like a second class citizen here, or a prisoner. I'm an Iraqi refugee in Egypt. I've been here for 3.5 years. The UN is not doing anything to help me. They hung up on my face. I do not have residency here, meaning I can't legally work, I can't travel anywhere even if I had the money, I can't do anything on my own. Multiple employees in the government told me you can't have a residency here because you're from Iraq. And told me to go back home. So, okay. I should just go back home right? I submitted a request to close my file with the UN and lo and behold, they told me I can't go back as it's too dangerous in Iraq and we don't allow refugees from Iraq to go back home.  So now, I don't have residency, I can't go back home, And I can't travel. Am I supposed to waste here? If so I might as well end it here and now. why wait? I'm so sick of it all.	1643816129.0	sirk6n	/r/Egypt/comments/sirk6n/i_need_help_otherwise/	I Need help otherwise..

7jhevr2k	Now with the Egyptian National Team in the Semifinals of AFCON, and the World Cup Qualifiers coming up soon, I wanted to bring up a topic of discussion here.   As we know the Egyptian National Team is 100% Muslim players. This is stating a fact. Not a single Copt/Christian on the team roster. And unfortunately this has been the case for decades and nothing has changed.   If Coptic Christians represent 15-20% of the Egyptian population, surely there must be 1 or 2 players that are talented enough to play professional football and represent their country?  What boggles my mind even more is that the Egyptian Clubs like Al Ahly and Zamalek and others bring in players from Africa, Brazil, etc who are actually Christian, but an Egyptian Christian player? “Error 404 not found”.   My question is simply, why?  Some theories I’ve come across is that the Egyptian National team administration want to keep the entire team Muslim so they can pray together, kneel down together when they score a goal, etc. But this seems really shallow and silly.   I believe the problem is also present in the scouting at the club level. I’ve heard many stories of very talented Copts who were in training camps with Egyptian clubs only for the scout to ask for the boys name and if it’s a Coptic name they tell him “Sorry ya Mina/Kyrillos/Bishoy, there’s no room for you on the team”. And since the problem lies in the Club scouting, the National team has no one to choose from because the Copts don’t get a chance to show their talent to begin with. Yet somehow Christians being scouted from Africa/South America are not being discriminated against.   It’s just an overall frustrating situation for the 20 million Copts in Egypt, who don’t get any representation in the National Team or Clubs. What’s also heartbreaking is that Copts still LOVE and SUPPORT the National Team and Clubs despite this discrimination, while quietly hoping for a better future.	1643822635.0	siuagr	/r/Egypt/comments/siuagr/coptic_christians_in_egyptian_football/	Coptic Christians in Egyptian Football

y9cr5	I have subscribed with Orange since Jan 2021 and decided to buy the Tp-link AC2100 archer vr600 and use it. It worked GREAT for months til October came and everything went to complete shit whenever the router gets restarted it takes forever to connect again -half an hour to 3 hrs- still not fixed yet. Is there an config to fix it?

4gl27qca	I've been very excited in the past period to have a cat to take care of. Finally, I've taken the decision to actually have one but I dont know how? Is it better to have a young kiddo or older one that has learned to pee in a sandbox? My family really hates it peeing on our stuff as we had a cat years ago. If someone's cat has given birth and cant take care of all of the kittens can you give me one to take care of?   What do you usually feed your cat and how much does it cost in a month?

He's now very receptive to contact from me; he used to get easily scared and not let me get close at all.  Unfortunately, I can't take him inside my place because I'm very allergic to cats. I want to take him to a good shelter or at least somewhere he can find food and warmth. Does anyone know of any such shelters in Cairo? I'd appreciate help.

e0rbwvta	Hey there, I am writing in this sensitive issue because I am really desparate and needs a solution. I have a homosexual desires, since my puberty and I always have the attractions to men of my same sex, and I did not know what to do with these feelings and Would they go by themselves? Then when I got 18 I discovered the gay pornography, and I actually enjoyed it, it was an escapism tool to fantasize myself without having sex. I got addicted to this type of pornography and to masturbation too. I am muslim and know this is haram and against the normal human nature, but I have grown up and found myself with these desires. I visited few psychaitrists, but none of them could help me, all they just do was excluding any depressive/anxious episodes, and then tellin me they couldnt deal with such conditions and I have to visit another one, and then the loop began.  It has been a year since I have last visited a psychaitrist, and throughout these years and the whole journey from the start of discovering my desires, I am in up and down days,  In the up days I am away from sins, porn, masturbation, and stuck to my salah.. In the down days I go back to the porn and masturbation.. and the loop continues I have never had sex because of my fear of Allah swt, but I am not satisfiee with whom I am and these desires I have which I can not stop btw,  I like to have love and get married, making a family and leading a normal live like anyone else..  Sometimes I say okay it is my affliction in dunyah and I have to be patient, but I am afraid of losing my iman ,which hinders me from doing the great sin till now, and lose my dunyah and akhrah. Sorry for bothering u with such a topic, but my mind is lost and I cant talk to anyone in such issue as nobody knows, you all know how Egyptians would see it! May I live just a normal life and have a family?	1643840535.0	sj1sm6	/r/Egypt/comments/sj1sm6/same_sex_attraction/	Same Sex Attraction

2gwx9kir	I saw a post on r/all that made me realize how much men all over the world are being ignored emotional support, and I realized, that in Egypt, this problem is thriving in the form of "استرجل".   I personally as a male have never received any compliment about my (looks, taste in music, taste in fashion...etc) from someone outside my family (and even in my family it's rare) even tho I try to be as appealing as I can be.  I noticed as a kid I've always been told "مفيش راجل "بيعيط and I've always seen kids get bullied by other kids for simply, crying.  Everytime I was in a tough spot and needed a shoulder to cry on I was always told to just "man up" or the Egyptian version "استرجل".  I'm sorry for ranting I just wanted to get this off my chest, please tell me your thoughts on whether or not this culture needs to die.	1643847641.0	sj4ljt	/r/Egypt/comments/sj4ljt/the_استرجل_culture_in_egypt_needs_to_die/	The "استرجل" culture in Egypt needs to die...

We have to stand and watch our culture being handed to someone else just because a fucking grandkid of a slave owner feels guilty, and nobody gives a fuck about the Egyptian, Imazighen, nor any North African civilization ever.  The irony here is that the term Africa was first used to describe North Africa and it later grew to include the whole continent.  There's a lot of studies out there that suggests Egyptians nowadays are easily connected North Africa, with lesser connections to sub-saharan Africa, Middle East and Europe respectively.  So why the fuck do we stand and watch this pseudo-scientific idea grew to the point where they organize conventions in Egypt?

78b02prf	One Friday morning, I woke up early to go to work (at 10:00 AM). Mom's usually the one who takes me there but she got a little busy so I went with an Uber. It was expensive af because I live in New Cairo and my work is at Zahraa Al Maadi. The distance is kinda long and Uber is making it worse. Anyways, Mom said she'll be the one to pick me up so I won't have to pay twice. I agreed.  Now here is the thing: Mom's all about being classy. She used to tell me as a kid that يا لهوي was an inappropriate word and always wanted me to call her Mommy 😂 obviously going ANYWHERE with public transportation was off limits to her and she never allowed me to try them because she thinks they're filthy (she used them in college so I really don't get why she's saying that).  Back to the story: I was done with work at 12:00 PM. Then, I called my mom to let her know I was done. She told me to get back home with an Uber because she got busy. I was like "wtf I'm not wasting my entire salary on Uber." That's what I thought, but then I saw some public buses moving here and there at the ring road. I thought, "hmmmmmmmmm that's just 5 pounds worth, right? What could possibly go wrong?"  I walked up the bridge and went to where the bus to New Cairo comes, paid for a ticket and got on the bus. I always send my mom a screenshot of the Uber driver's details (the driver's name, car plate number, car make, etc.) whenever I get into one. This time it was a bus soooo no screenshot ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  Mom obviously got worried and called me after the bus started moving, asking about the screenshot. The conversation went as follows:  Mom: where's the screenshot? Where are you?  Me: don't worry, Mom. I'm on the bus.  Mom: bus???? What bus? Where are you???  Me: I'm in a public bus.  Mom: A PUBLIC BUS?  Me: Mom I'll call you later. Gotta pay for my ticket. Bye!  Mom: ...  Then I ended the call and I was nervous lmao. The bus then went to New Cairo and dropped me off at another place full of vans which take you to specific places in New Cairo (Rehab City, Madinaty, etc.). I got into one and then just waited while people were getting into the van. The van was SUPER tiny which got me paranoid about getting robbed or something. I was sitting at the row behind the driver's seat, so the seat that gets folded was next to mine.  Then...there he comes...  A HAWT DUDE.  He had emerald green eyes that were *wild.* He also looked young like he was in college or something. He was also quite tall, slim and had a perfectly trimmed blond beard. Lol he also had a deep, sexy voice hahahaha 😂 (don't call me a simp please I don't need to hear it lmao). He looked like some Turkish actor or something lol. Aaaaaaand he sat on the folded seat next to me :)  Anyways I ended up going home safely and, as for Mom, I couldn't hear the end of it with her lol got scolded and she told me not to get into public transportation again cuz it's not safe and because it's gross (oh, really?).  What are your thoughts on public transportation?	1643920768.0	sjtp29	/r/Egypt/comments/sjtp29/am_i_lucky_that_my_experience_with_public/	Am I lucky that my experience with public transportation wasn't bad?

8khle258	 The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African autosomal (both maternal and paternal) ancestry in three Ancient Egyptian individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is significantly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the modern Egyptians from Abusir el-Meleq, who "range from 14 to 21%.   Egyptians' Sub-Saharan African ancestry on their paternal side also increased from 0-5% to almost 20%, though it is only from the paternal side and is insignificant compared to the Autosomal ancestry shown earlier. In short, scientists concluded that Modern-day Egyptians are almost indistinguishable from their predecessors phenotypically.  ''Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward Sudan.''  The Sub-Saharan African influx that happened after the Islamic conquest of Egypt in the 7th century may have been caused by more connections with Sub-Saharan Africa, including the infamous Trans-Saharan slave trade.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/x6nwd97eqof81.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=247740973aeb0f46944aabe0321e25f5246cc754  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459999/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459999/)	1643923705.0	sjuvpi	/r/Egypt/comments/sjuvpi/a_genetic_study_concluded_that_modernday/	A Genetic study concluded that Modern-day Egyptians have 8% more Sub-Saharan African ancestry than the Ancient Egyptians.

o6g2a	Hey guys, I visited Egypt back in 2019 for about two months and really enjoyed my experience. I'm hoping to return again soon one day, but looking to do more day-long walks/hikes from a city or town to the next.  How feasible/safe would it be to say walk from Cairo to Beni Suef? It's only about 75 miles and I would spread it out over maybe 4 or 5 days. What about for Qena to Edfu?  I definitely would be planning to do this in the winter time though, as I remember June and July in Egypt being a literal furnace. Thank you so much for any and all advice, I really appreciate it.

5yse0h8f	I'm currently a D1 finishing my first semester in dental school. I find myself preferring and excelling in the subjects that are related to the body more than the teeth. I found that I am generally more interested in General Anatomy, General surgery and General medicine than Dental surgery and medicine .. etc.  I entered Dental school because both my parents are dentists (Orthodontist and GP) and they encouraged me to do so, but I didn't realize or had an idea that the school will be heavily focused on the practical aspect rather than studying, which is a downside for me because I prefer to study than do practical/clinical work.  Now some of you might ask, since you are leaning more towards med school, why not just switch ?? The answer is basically I'm hesitant and slightly scared because of what people/my med students friends keep saying about how hard and stressful med school is, another reason is that if I continue in dental school I'll have the help from my parents whether it was more training, clinical experience, and overall guidance for when I graduate and start working, I won't have that if I switched to med school.   So, what do you guys think, and is Med school really that stressful / worth switching ?

zp3kp	البوست ده محاولة للتعبير عن شعور دايمًا فشلت في وصفه وتوضيحه للآخرين. الشعور هو الضجر بالتغوّل الديني على كل مجالات الحياة، بس مش من ناحية الحرام والحلال أو التشدد بشكل عام، بل من ناحية «المحتوى». مع كامل الفهم لدور الدين وأهميته للمؤمنين بيه، بس فيه ظاهرة في مصر أو ظاهرة مصرية المنشأ هي إن كل ما يفكر فيه الناس هو الدين، وكل كلامهم ومصطلحاتهم ومرجعياتهم الثقافية والأخلاقية وحتى اللغوية هي الدين. مفيش محتوى غير الدين. الدين هو الخامة الأساسية لشخصية الإنسان في مصر وكل حاجة تانية هي مجرد طباعة عليها وعناصر مضافة.  في مداخلة من طبيب مصري على قناة عربية، الطبيب مقالش جملة واحدة مفيهاش إن شاء الله والحمد الله وربنا يسهل. نفس الكلام بيحصل في أي موضوع من أي نوع. الدعاء والاستغفار والخشوع والمناجاة ماليين الكلام حتى على مستوى الحديث العادي اليومي بين الناس. أكيد الغالبية العظمى مش شايفين مشكلة في حاجة زي كدة وده من حقهم، ومن حقهم يعتقدوا إن كلام زي كلامي هو مجرد بذاءة وقدح في الدين بلا مبرر، بس افتراض حسن النية لثانية واحدة كفيل إنه يوضح نقطتي. لو أزحنا هالة القدسية عن الدين أعتقد من الواضح غرابة واقع إن ملايين من الشعب المصري ماشيين في شتا 2021 بمعلومات دقيقة جدًا عن تصرفات ونوايا وأفكار ناس عاشت في شبه الجزيرة العربية من 1400 سنة. ملايين من البشر مكرسين حياتهم وعقولهم لدراسة هذه الفترة من التاريخ السعودي (معلش، خلّي هالة القدسية متشالة سطرين كمان) دونًا عن أي موضوع أو فكرة أخرى. فيه مستوى متطور جدًا من البحث والتدقيق والتفسير والفلسفة حوالين الموضوع. طاقة روحانية هائلة وتضحيات مادية شخصية وجماعية غير معقولة تم بذلها في استكشاف الدين وخدمة للدين.   الدين نجح تمامًا في تطويع أدوات التواصل الحديثة، ودلوقتي فيه ملايين من ساعات البث التلفزيوني والإذاعي مكرسة للديم، وأرشيف هائل من تناول الفقه والسيرة. أول إم بي ثري مسكته في حياتي كنت في نادي سبورتنج في إسكندرية من حوالي 18 سنة، وكابتن الجيم شافني وأنا داخل وماسك الإم بي ثري وسألني إيه ده، قلتله بسمع فيه موسيقى، قاللي يعني مينفعش يتسمع عليه قرآن؟ ده شكل مبسط وعابر جدًا من الزحف متنوع الأشكال ومتفاوت السرعة للدين على المحيط العام وتفاصيله.   خلال السنة اللي فاتت كنت بركب أوبر أكتر من مرة كل يوم، ومفيش عربية واحدة ركبتها إلا وكان القرآن شغّال على الراديو، أيًا كان شكل وعمر وهيئة الشخص اللي سايق، وبقعد أتخيل الواحد من دول سايق مسافات طويلة لوحده وفيه برنامج ديني شغّال على الراديو فيه واحد بيتكلم عن موضوع الحلقة: من هو الصحابي الفقير الذي لم يملك دارًا أو نسب؟ ساعتها بسأل نفسي: معقول الدين قادر على فصل الناس عن الأشكال المتنوعة من التعبير و«المحتوى» الآخر، لدرجة إنهم يسمعوا الكلام ده طواعية أو بالقصد والرغبة، دونًا عن أي شكل آخر من أشكال التعبير والتواصل؟   طبعًا كلامي مش معناه إني مش فاهم أسباب هذا الواقع أو إني عايز الناس يغيروا عقولهم عشان يبقوا كوول ومحايدين، بس هي شكوى حابب أفهم إذا كان فيه ناس كتير مقدرين أسبابها. مشكلتي مش إن الناس تآمن أو يتحمسوا للي مؤمنين بيه. مشكلتي هي إني داخل مطعم وقاعد بغمّس قرن الفلفل في الطحينة وأنا بسمع ماذا فعل ربك بمن بغى واستكبر.  ليه في استسلام تام لفكرة إن حتى الأسانسير وشركة الطيران بيشغلوا دعاء الركوب؟	1643942890.0	sk25fw	/r/Egypt/comments/sk25fw/مظاهر_سيطرة_الدين_على_كل_تفاصيل_الحياة_في_مصر/	مظاهر سيطرة الدين على كل تفاصيل الحياة في مصر

xwbom	We've recently started a mission to expand the subreddit's features further by making community awards. Currently, we have four Community Awards: the "**A thank you note.. in Egyptian**" (500 coins, giftable by members), the "**Heinz Koshari"** (500 coins, giftable by members), the "**Ancient gold**" (1000 coins, giftable by members), and "**The obelisk**" (1800 coins, giftable by mods only).  # What are Community Awards?  There are two types of awards, the first and site wide of which being the Regular awards which are purchased with **coins**,  a mechanism of Reddit that ultimately requires real money to purchase packs of coins that can then be spent on awards for posts and comments. r/Egypt  does not receive any money when they are purchased, but it does receive coins when users gift Community Awards.  >Community Awards are unique to each community, and members can give them to each  other. Moderators can design and name the Awards however they want.A  portion of Coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited to  the community’s Coin balance. Moderators can use Coins from that balance  to reward members with Mod Awards. The Coin balance is shown only to  moderators in the community’s sidebar.  ***Moderators do NOT have access to the*** r/Egypt ***coin bank other than to give Community Awards on this sub to quality posts and comments. Moderators do NOT receive any coins personally.***  The second type is **Community Award:**  Any user can gift this award for an amount of Coins (min. 500) to a post or comment. Each of these awards will also gift coins to r/Egypt itself, allowing mods to give mod-exclusive awards. For example, a 500 Coin Community Award also gives the subreddit 100 Coins.  **Mod-Exclusive Community Award:** These awards are exclusive to the community and purchased using the coins available only to mods from the r/Egypt Coin bank, and give a certain amount of Reddit Premium to the  recipient. For example, a 1800 Coin Mod-Exclusive Community Award will  grant one month of Reddit Premium(*Reddit Premium gives 700 monthly coins, access to Premium Awards, and more. Learn about it here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium)). Useful for contests and such to reward the users officially.  ^(There may be an official contest later to expand the awards, and details will be given out when it's ready.)  # Powerups subscribers  You've decided to Powerup this subreddit and community and for a while you've had access to the basic features, but we're trying to change it up by adding custom emojis (That's all we can do). We're open for any ideas by you to expand the emojis' library.  #  What are Powerups?  >Powerups are community  subscriptions that provide redditors with a way to give back to select  communities by coming together to unlock community perks. All it takes  is 25 powerups to unlock perks for the whole community—25 members can  band together to unlock perks for everyone, or one community member can  purchase all 25 powerups.  Note: once unlocked, you can still powerup  the community to unlock perks exclusive to Powerup supporters.      **Powerups perks include:**  * Community achievement flairs that recognize community members  who are Powerup supporters, top users by karma, top posters, and more  * GIFs in comments * Custom community emojis and Reddit emojis  * The ability to upload HD 1080p videos (up to 2Gb in size)  >Those who apply a Powerup also unlock an exclusive achievement  flair and a spot on the community heroes list, so the community can see who unlocked perks.    >   >Once you become a Powerup supporter you can immediately enjoy  all the perks. Once a community receives 25 powerups, the perks are then unlocked for the entire community.   # How can I apply a Powerup?   Currently, you can access Powerups in two ways:   * By purchasing a [Reddit Premium subscription](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043034412-What-is-a-Reddit-Premium-subscription-), which includes a monthly powerup you can apply to the community of your choice.  * By purchasing a Powerup subscription for a specific community starting at $4.99 USD- web only.	1643965225.0	sk8s0e	/r/Egypt/comments/sk8s0e/community_awards_and_powerups/	Community Awards and Powerups

pf06d	Hello, I have a bank account with NBE one in EGP and another in USD.  Originally I would use TransferWise to get my salary in from USD to my EGP account.    I would like to keep the dollars instead of transferring it and going through the exchange rates every time, I'm not sure how to proceed from there.  I tried placing my NBE USD account info on transfer wise but it is requesting a routing number which doesn't exist in Egypt.    If I choose EGP currency account on transfer wise and place the IBAN of the USD account I can create it but I'm not sure how will that work.    Hopefully I'm not extremely confusing lol, any help would be appreciated	1643984661.0	skehn1	/r/Egypt/comments/skehn1/help_with_receiving_salary_in_usd_from_an/	Help with receiving Salary in USD from an offshore Company.

I'm hoping to return again soon one day, but looking to do more day-long walks/hikes from a city or town to the next.  How feasible/safe would it be to say walk from Cairo to Beni Suef? It's only about 75 miles and I would spread it out over maybe 4 or 5 days. What about for Qena to Edfu? I definitely would be planning to do this in the winter time though, as I remember June and July in Egypt being a literal furnace. Thank you so much for any and all advice, I really appreciate it. (I'm a 26-year old male if that makes a difference)  Edit: I really enjoyed the Egyptian countryside and rural life, but didn't really get the chance to take it in when I was in Egypt last time.	1644002608.0	sklvm2	/r/Egypt/comments/sklvm2/walking_from_cairo_to_beni_suef/	Walking From Cairo to Beni Suef?

fmo6mxk7	I'm at that age (23F) where most of my male relatives are getting married, I myself got married a couple months ago. And all they do is complain about how impossible it is to get married.  To that I would like to tell you: YOU are making it impossible. Both of you, men and women.   Let's start off with the men: you're constantly complaining about how it costs a fortune to get married to your dreamgirl. Then we take one look at your dreamgirl and it's obvious why. Guys, seriously I don't know whether attraction makes you lose the ability to think but stop wifing women who have unrealisitc financial expectations. There are plenty of women out there who know that it's a tough economy, work, don't expect to own a house or waste money on jewelry and weddings. Yet for some reason you choose women who's trip to Muhammed El Sagheer alone costs as much as your monthly salary - go figure why it's hard to get married.  Also, you gotta let go of the delusion that marrying wa7da Agnabeya is what you need. They look better than all of us - I know, but they will never ever submit to the Egyptian lifestyle of caring for home and children. If you ask her to get you a glass of water she would much rather throw it in your face. And that's fine, different cultures have different merits. But this illusion is something you gotta let go of for your own sake.  My husband and I met when I was studying in Switzerland as a med-tech student. And he was relieved that he could marry an Egyptian after dating Swiss women. We went back to Cairo, read the Fat7a, we skipped the wedding because of Covid (and money), skipped the whole shabka stuff and I insisted to my parents I'd rather have that money spent in things that made sense, like a roof over our head. We're renting, living life and elhamdulilah it's super easy. This isn't something you can achieve with a foreigner, also the whole virginity topic and sexually transmitted diseases come into mind since this is also something most egyptian men wouldn't be comfortable with.  The point is, no one is forcing you with a gun to your head to spend millions of pounds to marry a girl. And if your partner-to-be is not standing up to her parents and telling them to stop exploiting you then it's already a sign of a shit marriage. YOU will be together for a longer time than she will stay with her family, so if she's not willing to put her foot down in order to protect your future finances together then keep looking. Because then she will also not say no to her family when it comes to what school your kid goes to, where your house will be, what car you drive and the list goes on.  My relatives go for the next best girl who said yes. This shouldn't be your standard.   Now let's get to my favorite part. Women: honestly the only thing I can say is our society is turning us into gold diggers. If you think its reasonable to expect a young man who's around entry-level to pay for extravagant nonsense that lasts literally 1 day?  What do you want from a marriage? Do you want pictures of a DAY that cost half a million pounds in a white dress where you look happy? Or do you want a sustainable future where you're actually happy for a long time? And your family interventions. I don't care what your dad says about you "being worth more than XY pounds of a shabka", YOU know the financial capabilities of your partner and if you truly feel something for him you'll stand up to your family and think about what your priorities are. A clunky ring on your finger or a pissed off husband who'll start his life with you in debt. Have more courage to make the process go smoothly, and your husband-to-be will be thankful for it.  We didn't have much before we got married, because we were both entry-level employees but elhamdulilah we were blessed and suddenly lived a very generous life in Egypt.   We're happy as can be and I'd rather smile in front of my future kids than show them pictures of a wedding where I'm smiling.   Someone needs to say this and this is a throwaway account so I'll say it. Stop. Postponing. The. Marriage. Men have sexual needs. He will be thankful if you don't make it take longer if it's unnecessary.   Now you're gonna think "wow what a money obsessed person". The majority of divorces occur due to financial issues. Of course money is not the focus point of marriage and you need to be a good, kind, faithful partner but when you have that very serious talk about finances you at least eliminate the biggest factor for divorce.   TLDR; prioritize long-term happiness when it comes to marriage instead of the unnecessary cultural events. men, prioritize decency over looks and have no fear to reject a woman because she's too materialistic. This is just my two cents, yalla hate.	1644008535.0	sko8fr	/r/Egypt/comments/sko8fr/to_everyone_who_wants_to_get_married/	To everyone who wants to get married

We were neighbors in Saudi Arabia in the 90s but unfortunately we lost contact with them many years ago after we both moved. So these are a few details about her:  Name: Hala Taha Shahawy and she was from Dokki Giza in Cairo. She's probably in her 50s or early 60s. Husband's name: Mokhtar Children: Hossam (Simsim), Khulood (Loodi), Shaza  She may have had more children later, I don't really know. I also know her sister's name, it was Amaani and Amaani had twins.  It would be REALLY REALLY GREAT if I could connect with her or any of her kids.  I am not from Egypt so I don't really know how else to look for her.	1644059926.0	sl4qe8	/r/Egypt/comments/sl4qe8/looking_for_a_long_lost_friend_help/	Looking for a long lost friend. Help.

14syjgea	If you don't know what Zumra is, it's an online grocery store where you could buy specialty (primarily Asian) ingredients for your Asian dishes, whether that be a specific type of soy sauce, seaweed, oyster sauce, Chinese chili oil, Korean chili paste, etc.   But recently, it's been pushing itself as "Not just Asian", by bringing up a bunch of other stuff you can buy at a normal grocery store. There is no point to this. Like I can find this anywhere else, when I come to a place like Zumra I don't expect this, and I don't want this.  But that's whatever, right? I can still buy my specialty Asian ingredients and ignore the normal ingredients! I can even buy some on the side if I need something else.  But no! They've started to focus wayyy away from the Asian ingredients and they've basically stopped restocking them. Kikkoman soy sauce, the good soy sauce you find in literally every single sushi restaurant, is really expensive. Except for if you buy it in bulk, which I used to do.   But now it's not available! And so is everything else. Gochujang? Out of stock. Soy sauce? Out of stock. Chili Oil? Out of stock. Tom Yum paste? Out of stock MSG? Out of stock. Even if anything is in stock, it's 2x as expensive as it was a year ago or even a few months ago.  The instant Korean noodles, the thing they're most known for, has had it's price increased.   But guess what IS in stock? Bread! Oh what a joy that I can go to the specialty Asian store and get my overpriced bread and luncheon.   I really don't know what's happened to Zumra, and I don't know if they'll ever be what they once was, but until then, I'll be out of soy sauce.	1644069563.0	sl7kna	/r/Egypt/comments/sl7kna/zumra_has_become_so_terrible_and_im_not_sure_why/	Zumra has become so terrible, and I'm not sure why.

ih6uikis	Pardon me for writing the post in English so i can express my situation in a better way  I am, basically, gay, I'm 17.5 year old I don't want to be gay, i have never done anything in real Life, because I'm quite Religous No one irl knows about that, I've never been subjected to r*pe or "raised in a feminine way"  But since I'm young, i liked men, i liked playing with girls, i even when i was 8 years old, i knew nothing about sex, i got an orgasm for watching a movie and touching myself where male character was getting naked  I've tried watching straight or lesbian porn, i can't even get semi erect I can never see something desirable in females, i like strength in male, their body hair, their penis, their masculinity, I've always been alone in school because, i got so turned on staying with men, their "swearing words" and masculine way of talking prevented me from taking them as a companion so i don't get exposed, i wish to have female friends but i still don't wanna get exposed, i can't even speak to my family or especially my dad, because they're too conservative  Please don't delete this post  I am just asking for a Friend, i need someone to talk to before أني أطق , i really need advice, if you know a good psychologist or some way to treat LGBT traits in me , I'll be glad to here	1644078489.0	slav2i	/r/Egypt/comments/slav2i/مساعدة/	مساعدة

7a5yt	I have some Egyptian female relatives. I have noticed they never post photos where their faces show up.  I mean I have never seen their faces in a photo for years and if they are in a group photo, they mask their faces as in drawing on the face or putting flower photos on the face.     What's up with this habit!? These women live in Europe and are not like religious fanatics. They do wear the hijab. Is showing their face haram? Ashamed of how they look or what? They show their faces to strangers walking in the streets or shopping but to their friends and family they can't? What's the big deal?	1644090047.0	sleyn4	/r/Egypt/comments/sleyn4/why_do_some_egyptian_women_mask_their_faces_in/	Why do some Egyptian women mask their faces in photos on Facebook?

df7vsf8f	Anyone else think we are in a great danger ?   why our values are being demolished and mocked over and over and over ?   Mona zaki appears in a copied movie and people went crazy to defend that crap    claiming that this is our society while it's not,  not at all,  the movie writer is british and this is their social issues not ours,  and yet many many stupid egyptians are being very aggressive to prove that those are our problems and we are even worse! :D    I can't understand why anyone would have this very strong desire to prove that his community is the worst ever, while it's not !   Yes we are not perfect and Egyptians are annoying especially on the last 10 years    but this is because of the tremendous pressure they are dealing with !      And then you have this weird Riyadh season!    at the same time there is expo dubai and the israeli-emarati affair    all that while we as Arabic nation are leaving thousands of syrian families dying of the cold with no food or shelter ?   and still what matters to people is to prove that we encourage lgbt and adulteries !    very weird,  where is our culture?   where is our social values? yeah the so called "cool" guys are mocking them    Ignorant pieces of shi\*\* who are living on European scholarships and they are nothing in Europe and yet. they are speaking on social media like they are Einisteins :D    and people are buying it very happily !     Please people stop confusing the repetitive regimes failure with the culture    our culture didn't make us third world    Occupation did, dictatorships did,    and btw,  I am not a member of muslim brotherhood or any religious group    on the contrary,    And I am not the most follower to our values,  I mean not at all :D    I wish I can be though,    please remember that being culturally defeated to the west won't make us like them    the best shot we got on this is to be a copy cat,  fake nation and 2nd degree humans who are ruled by our dear neighbors in Israel !   Respect to Israel    they are standing tall and confident while being literally surrounded by enemies    they are not mocking their values or culture,    and that's why they became- hands down- the best country in this whole region.

g9bwzxee	I'm in my 20s so I didn't have a chance to watch anything good or even the normal status quo, from H1N1 to Jan. Revolution and all the blood we saw and the bodies of real people, people like me and those around me not visual effects like movies it was fucking real.  Then all the bad things that happened afterwards.  Than rab'a and elnahda (this is not a political post so let's not discuss this but we can't deny horrible things happened and many were killed and there was a lot of shed blood) then bombings and the other things that happened back in the day.  And what happened in Myanmar occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Turkestan and lately in Uyghur, India then we saw COVID and all the horrible stuff from all over the world and it all happened consecutively, I didn't witness a moment where things were normal and I refuse to believe that bad is the normal.  And now everytime I see something bad I just pray and feel a little to no sadness at all but something like rayan being stuck in a well should've had a bigger effect on me and many things before but I just don't!  It's not like I don't feel 'cause I know I'm usually sad and I feel when people need help and I try but what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?  Can all these traumatizing events turn us to loveless emotionless humans eventually and can we be even called humans then?  I don't know the answer for that neither do I have the ability to change what's going around me so I'll just pray for a better life and a better afterlife.	1644108011.0	sllh58	/r/Egypt/comments/sllh58/but_what_if_we_got_used_to_badness_to_the_point/	But what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?

fmo6mxk7	I'm at that age (23F) where most of my male relatives are getting married, I myself got married a couple months ago. And all they do is complain about how impossible it is to get married.  To that I would like to tell you: YOU are making it impossible. Both of you, men and women.   Let's start off with the men: you're constantly complaining about how it costs a fortune to get married to your dreamgirl. Then we take one look at your dreamgirl and it's obvious why. Guys, seriously I don't know whether attraction makes you lose the ability to think but stop wifing women who have unrealisitc financial expectations. There are plenty of women out there who know that it's a tough economy, work, don't expect to own a house or waste money on jewelry and weddings. Yet for some reason you choose women who's trip to Muhammed El Sagheer alone costs as much as your monthly salary - go figure why it's hard to get married.  Also, you gotta let go of the delusion that marrying wa7da Agnabeya is what you need. They look better than all of us - I know, but they will never ever submit to the Egyptian lifestyle of caring for home and children. If you ask her to get you a glass of water she would much rather throw it in your face. And that's fine, different cultures have different merits. But this illusion is something you gotta let go of for your own sake.  My husband and I met when I was studying in Switzerland as a med-tech student. And he was relieved that he could marry an Egyptian after dating Swiss women. We went back to Cairo, read the Fat7a, we skipped the wedding because of Covid (and money), skipped the whole shabka stuff and I insisted to my parents I'd rather have that money spent in things that made sense, like a roof over our head. We're renting, living life and elhamdulilah it's super easy. This isn't something you can achieve with a foreigner, also the whole virginity topic and sexually transmitted diseases come into mind since this is also something most egyptian men wouldn't be comfortable with.  The point is, no one is forcing you with a gun to your head to spend millions of pounds to marry a girl. And if your partner-to-be is not standing up to her parents and telling them to stop exploiting you then it's already a sign of a shit marriage. YOU will be together for a longer time than she will stay with her family, so if she's not willing to put her foot down in order to protect your future finances together then keep looking. Because then she will also not say no to her family when it comes to what school your kid goes to, where your house will be, what car you drive and the list goes on.  My relatives go for the next best girl who said yes. This shouldn't be your standard.   Now let's get to my favorite part. Women: honestly the only thing I can say is our society is turning us into gold diggers. If you think its reasonable to expect a young man who's around entry-level to pay for extravagant nonsense that lasts literally 1 day?  What do you want from a marriage? Do you want pictures of a DAY that cost half a million pounds in a white dress where you look happy? Or do you want a sustainable future where you're actually happy for a long time? And your family interventions. I don't care what your dad says about you "being worth more than XY pounds of a shabka", YOU know the financial capabilities of your partner and if you truly feel something for him you'll stand up to your family and think about what your priorities are. A clunky ring on your finger or a pissed off husband who'll start his life with you in debt. Have more courage to make the process go smoothly, and your husband-to-be will be thankful for it.  We didn't have much before we got married, because we were both entry-level employees but elhamdulilah we were blessed and suddenly lived a very generous life in Egypt.   We're happy as can be and I'd rather smile in front of my future kids than show them pictures of a wedding where I'm smiling.   Someone needs to say this and this is a throwaway account so I'll say it. Stop. Postponing. The. Marriage. Men have sexual needs. He will be thankful if you don't make it take longer if it's unnecessary.   Now you're gonna think "wow what a money obsessed person". The majority of divorces occur due to financial issues. Of course money is not the focus point of marriage and you need to be a good, kind, faithful partner but when you have that very serious talk about finances you at least eliminate the biggest factor for divorce.   TLDR; prioritize long-term happiness when it comes to marriage instead of the unnecessary cultural events. men, prioritize decency over looks and have no fear to reject a woman because she's too materialistic. This is just my two cents, yalla hate.	1644008535.0	sko8fr	/r/Egypt/comments/sko8fr/to_everyone_who_wants_to_get_married/	To everyone who wants to get married

14syjgea	If you don't know what Zumra is, it's an online grocery store where you could buy specialty (primarily Asian) ingredients for your Asian dishes, whether that be a specific type of soy sauce, seaweed, oyster sauce, Chinese chili oil, Korean chili paste, etc.   But recently, it's been pushing itself as "Not just Asian", by bringing up a bunch of other stuff you can buy at a normal grocery store. There is no point to this. Like I can find this anywhere else, when I come to a place like Zumra I don't expect this, and I don't want this.  But that's whatever, right? I can still buy my specialty Asian ingredients and ignore the normal ingredients! I can even buy some on the side if I need something else.  But no! They've started to focus wayyy away from the Asian ingredients and they've basically stopped restocking them. Kikkoman soy sauce, the good soy sauce you find in literally every single sushi restaurant, is really expensive. Except for if you buy it in bulk, which I used to do.   But now it's not available! And so is everything else. Gochujang? Out of stock. Soy sauce? Out of stock. Chili Oil? Out of stock. Tom Yum paste? Out of stock MSG? Out of stock. Even if anything is in stock, it's 2x as expensive as it was a year ago or even a few months ago.  The instant Korean noodles, the thing they're most known for, has had it's price increased.   But guess what IS in stock? Bread! Oh what a joy that I can go to the specialty Asian store and get my overpriced bread and luncheon.   I really don't know what's happened to Zumra, and I don't know if they'll ever be what they once was, but until then, I'll be out of soy sauce.	1644069563.0	sl7kna	/r/Egypt/comments/sl7kna/zumra_has_become_so_terrible_and_im_not_sure_why/	Zumra has become so terrible, and I'm not sure why.

What's up with this habit!? These women live in Europe and are not like religious fanatics. They do wear the hijab. Is showing their face haram? Ashamed of how they look or what?

g9bwzxee	I'm in my 20s so I didn't have a chance to watch anything good or even the normal status quo, from H1N1 to Jan. Revolution and all the blood we saw and the bodies of real people, people like me and those around me not visual effects like movies it was fucking real.  Then all the bad things that happened afterwards.  Than rab'a and elnahda (this is not a political post so let's not discuss this but we can't deny horrible things happened and many were killed and there was a lot of shed blood) then bombings and the other things that happened back in the day.  And what happened in Myanmar occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Turkestan and lately in Uyghur, India then we saw COVID and all the horrible stuff from all over the world and it all happened consecutively, I didn't witness a moment where things were normal and I refuse to believe that bad is the normal.  And now everytime I see something bad I just pray and feel a little to no sadness at all but something like rayan being stuck in a well should've had a bigger effect on me and many things before but I just don't!  It's not like I don't feel 'cause I know I'm usually sad and I feel when people need help and I try but what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?  Can all these traumatizing events turn us to loveless emotionless humans eventually and can we be even called humans then?  I don't know the answer for that neither do I have the ability to change what's going around me so I'll just pray for a better life and a better afterlife.	1644108011.0	sllh58	/r/Egypt/comments/sllh58/but_what_if_we_got_used_to_badness_to_the_point/	But what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?

And any info for a travel agency that provides nile cruises? I’m hoping to take a nile cruise from cairo to luxor, then to aswan, however I want to stay in aswan for (possibly) a week because I have some research to conduct and people to meet for a personal project. The Nile cruise is not my only option too, I know I can also take the train.. possibly car or bus so I want more details on these options too..  Things I want to visit: The Karnak temple, Abu Simbel, The Nubian museum, Heissa island in aswan  Any advice, or details would be helpful!

xwbom	As the sub has developed, we've seen more people break the rules, prompting the creation of this post.  Personal attacks in comment trees, including name-calling, provocation using passive-aggressive language with little indication of peaceful discourse, flame wars, and other uncivil behavior.  "Be civil" is the subreddit's first rule. It is, by design and placement, the most important rule and, as a result, the most strictly enforced regulation. It's what makes this platform worthwhile for everyone to invest their time in.  We guarantee free expression in this subreddit as long as it does not infringe on people's rights, thus we anticipate a lot of divergent viewpoints. Some of these viewpoints may differ from yours, resulting in passive-aggressive, dismissive, or simply chaotic discussions.  Such behavior is not tolerated on this platform because it contradicts the community's entire purpose. In the following weeks, expect tougher and longer enforcement of this specific pattern of offenses. Bigotry of any kind, including homophobia, xenophobia, racism, and other forms, is strictly prohibited.  Posts that are discriminatory to a certain group of people are not accepted under any circumstances. Race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, and mental or physical handicap are all examples of this, and the rules safeguard posts on any of these topics being discussed.   Regardless of one's religious beliefs or lack thereof, sexuality or race, members are expected to behave civilly, expressing civil viewpoints in a concise and non-offensive manner, breaking it will result in an immediate and permanent suspension.  **Another big problem that started to show itself is low-effort posts**  Examples such as [news that have no credible or reputable source like news off Facebook/Twitter/comics and memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/rpickt/posting_fake_news/); Title gore such as long titles, short non-descriptive titles or emoji-filled reactions.  Please don't downvote anything you don't agree with; the voting system isn't meant to be a popularity contest; rather, it's meant to promote interesting, high-effort contributions. "Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they aren't adding to the community debate or discussion" says the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) documentation. You may assure that your downvotes are provided for legitimate reasons if you simply take a moment to pause and reflect your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so because his opinion simply doesn't align with yours.  Even if they break the rules, we greatly encourage successful civil conversation when dealing with posts you disagree with. If you retaliate against someone by committing an offense yourself, both you and the other user will be banned. **If someone breaks the rules, report them instead of insulting them back.**   *^(Reporting posts, comments or users just because you don't agree with their opinions won't get their content removed.)*  TL;DR:  Many newcomers, a rapid review of the [rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/wiki/rules), and greater enforcement in the future: a few quick reminders of what you should know  1. Civility is one of the most important aspects of this community, and it is the cornerstone that allows Egyptians of all backgrounds to enjoy the sub - breaching this rule will result in bans. There are no exceptions or appeals. 2. Bigotry of any kind, regardless of personal convictions, is not tolerated. There is a way to express your personal opinions without being bigoted. 3. Low-effort posts, especially ones that quote news - require credible sources; Headlines must be concise and to the point  Thank you to anyone who has read this far, and we appreciate all of the users who have stayed with us and helped to grow and improve this community.	1644147703.0	slus48	/r/Egypt/comments/slus48/read_this_before_posting/	Read this before posting!

9w77hj5h	I need help understanding a few things about finances in Egypt.  The USD-EGP exchange rate hasn't changed much since December 2019, being roughly around 15.7 give or take a tiny bit. In 2020 the inflation in Egypt was around 6.5% and in 2021 it was around 7.3%.  My first question, how come the Egyptian pound maintained a fixed rate against the US dollar despite the high inflation in these past two years? When the currency is inflated, shouldn't it lose value against the USD? For example Turkey's currency is losing value against dollar due to inflation, so why didn't the Egyptian lose value vs dollar too?  Second though is about Egyptian bank rates. Right now some certificates of deposit in Egyptian pounds yield 11% per annum, and if you substract the annual inflation figure from that number you still get about 4% of REAL INTEREST, which is an astronomic number compared to what American banks give you on USD deposits (about 0.3% only).  My question here is how come Egypt gives that high REAL INTEREST (11%-7%=4%)? How is this sustainable? And why isn't everyone in the world rushing to invest their money in these high yielding Egyptian certificates of deposit?  &#x200B;  I need to understand because I have to make a choice soon, whether to continue holding to my USD savings, or whether I should just convert it to Egyptian pounds and buy those high yielding certificates whose duration is 3 years.  Any help is much appreciated	1644171170.0	sm3bkv	/r/Egypt/comments/sm3bkv/usd_vs_egp_exchange_rate_and_banks_interest_rates/	USD vs EGP exchange rate and banks' interest rates. What's going on???

3ht6hu90	I am not asking about blurting it out on national television or to strangers . What i am simply saying is can a dark person from an african origin say the n-word jokingly within his circle of close friends .  First , You have to understand that egypt is a third world country , and to racist people we are all considered a “sand n-word” .   In fact  we are an underprivileged minority group compared to the outside world .   The reason why white people shouldnt say the n-word is because of the painful history attached to it , however Egyptian never caused any such pain ,actually we were as much likely to face such prejudice .   So when you as an Egyptian argue that we shouldn’t even joke about the word , you have ironically detached yourself from your african origin and subconsciously believed we are white people .	1644173648.0	sm4brw	/r/Egypt/comments/sm4brw/can_a_dark_egyptian_joke_with_close_friends_by/	Can a dark Egyptian joke with close friends by saying the n-word ?

eow05t	During Egypt vs Morocco, there was a lot of tension. I am not a huge football fans. Usually, I just support my national team during big sport events like the world cup & the can.   What surprised me during Morocco vs Egypt was the aggressivity during the quarter-final. They fought after the game too which disqualified one of our best player (Boufal) from playing the world cup. I watched the final, with much higher stakes, & the tension was really lower. Much more friendly although losing at penalties must've been a real bitch.  Congrats to egypt & especially the goalkeeper for the outstanding performance. To be truthful, we have a way bigger budget (90 M $) than egypt for football although the country is poorer. Yet, Moroccan team didn't achieve anything for such a long time. I understand the frustration in our country but I feel it became much more toxic than before. Death threats sent to players all the time, Moroccan always complaining. Money doesn't buy cups sadly. Lot of posts here about being lucky just making it to the final, much better mentality.   See you in world cup qualifications !	1644226669.0	smma2o	/r/Egypt/comments/smma2o/as_a_moroccan_i_wanted_to_check_egypt_side_of/	As a Moroccan, I wanted to check egypt side of things in the CAN.
