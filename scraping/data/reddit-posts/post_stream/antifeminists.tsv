5pqmol6x	A common piece of feminist narrative I see frequently distributed is this idea that a male dominated government exists in most modern countries to inhibit the lives of women. While I can believe that idea for unindustrialized and totalitarian nations, I cannot help but call bullshit on that idea for western democracies. I don't have a problem with the idea of women in power, as having more perspectives in a government is not a bad thing. But this idea of some bogeyman male political who exists only to spite women is demonstrably false.  A lot of western feminists seem to forget exactly how those men got into power in the first place. In a democratic society, it is the people, both men and women, who take an active role in the election of government officials. While in the case of the United States you could argue that a male dominated electoral college enables anti-woman politicians to continue gaining power, it is also important to take note that the popular vote decides who is in the running in the first place, and the electoral college only controls the presidential election and not regional or state politics. If anything, [research has shown that women are more likely to participate in the electoral process to begin with](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/08/18/men-and-women-in-the-u-s-continue-to-differ-in-voter-turnout-rate-party-identification/). It could be argued that there is pro-female bias in the choosing of electoral candidates.  Furthermore, patriarchy theory and the idea of a male dominated government is reliant on a level of female solidarity that does not exist. For example, western feminists will cite abortion bans as an example of abuse of male power. This assumption relies on the idea that the majority of people in favor or abortion rights are women, and the majority opposed are men. [Over a decade of research and data has shown that not only do men and women house similar views regarding abortion, but in multiple instances, pro life women have outnumbered pro life men.](https://www.vox.com/2019/5/20/18629644/abortion-gender-gap-public-opinion)  Maybe, just maybe, if women didn't vote for supposedly anti-woman polices, then perhaps a male dominated government wouldn't be nearly as much of an issue. Now that's not to say it's entirely the fault of women, but to insinuate that western women are helpless victims of a patriarchal government is simply false.	1642388497.0	s5t7kv	/r/antifeminists/comments/s5t7kv/the_problem_with_the_idea_of_a_male_dominated/	The Problem With The Idea Of A "Male Dominated Government"

hzkkzoey	I was thinking about Cheryl Cole and Liam Payne's relationship a few years ago, which drew attention due to him being ten years younger than her. People were saying that if the genders/ages were reversed this would be paedophilia (despite the two of them being adults, seriously people need to look up the meaning of the word) and making excuses for Cheryl being hot (OK they're not wrong there). Apart from anything else I see it as Directioners (one of the worst fandoms I've ever encountered, though the Louis Partridge fandom is the worst IMO) using any and every excuse to hate on Cheryl for stealing the man of their dreams. The same thing happened with Harry Styles and Caroline Flack.   If I may be honest, people would have raised eyebrows a lot more if the genders were swapped because women can apparently get away scot-free.  Then there's the Johnny Depp/Amber Heard thing. Amber Heard is a vile woman who should be locked up and the only reason why she isn't is because she has boobs. Had the roles been reversed, Johnny Depp would have been sent behind bars almost immediately. Prime example of women getting away again. Males can be victims too.  What do you all think? Double standard?  I am a woman writing this, BTW.	1642428490.0	s64tpj	/r/antifeminists/comments/s64tpj/double_standards_in_celebrity_land_possible/	Double Standards in Celebrity Land: Possible Anti-Feminism?
