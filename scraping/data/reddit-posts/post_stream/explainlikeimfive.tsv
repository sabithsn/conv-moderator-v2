olpdv	My point of reference is from viewing the "live" energy use data from a Tesla's screen.  When the accelerator is pressed, it shows the rate of energy consumption depending on how far the accelerator is pressed.  When the vehicle is at a certain velocity, the accelerator can be throttled back since less energy is required to maintain that velocity and the data reflects this in the chart.  Here, the EV is consuming power.  During regenerative braking (accelerator released), the inertia from the vehicle turns the motors into a generator and energy flow is reversed, going back to the battery.  Here, the EV is generating power.  Let's say we're somewhere in between.  The vehicle is traveling at 70 mph (112 kph) at the top of a hill and begins the descent (assume a 7% grade).  If the accelerator is released, the battery will begin to recharge but the vehicle will also start to slow.  In order to keep the vehicle at the current speed, the accelerator still needs to be pressed - albeit a small amount - and provide power to the motors; however, because the car is now going downhill, gravity (potential energy) is contributing to the cars velocity and that the EV is recharging the battery, based on the energy consumption graph.  So in this case, some power is applied to maintain the velocity going downhill, but at the same time the battery is being charged.  Does this mean that the battery pack is simultaneously charging and discharging and, if so, how does that work?	1642700411.0	s8og24	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/s8og24/eli5_do_evs_charge_and_discharge_at_the_same_time/	ELI5: Do EVs charge and discharge at the same time?

7bllpt0q	I'm confused by this. So in order to record very high frequency signal, you need tape to travel very quickly past the write head, so that the very high-frequency signals wouldn't overlap. For SD analog video signal (up to 5-6 MHz), that means the tape has to travel at insanely high speeds, like 11 mph or something and you'd need crazy amounts of tape.  So to solve that problem, they invented helical scan, which uses heads placed on a drum. The tape wraps around the drum and then the drum spins fast, so it's the drum going past the tape very fast rather than the opposite, and the tape travels at a reasonable speed, and you don't need that much tape.  Okay, but... how does this help you use more bandwidth on the tape? The drum is spinning very fast but the tape is going past it slowly, so the heads are just recording stuff over the same piece of tape many times over. So how do you get more bandwidth out of the tape using this method?	1643066507.0	sbzmpc	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sbzmpc/eli5_please_explain_helical_tape_scanning_eg_in_a/	ELI5: Please explain helical tape scanning (e.g. in a VCR).

67y20m5p	I was wondering how ISPs connected to the internet, and I found many answers saying they either hosted many popular websites themselves, they connected directly to the servers, or they connected themselves to other ISPs. So I thought "hmm, why can't I connect directly to the server instead?" Well, because I'd need a wire connecting my PC with thousands of servers, but what if my PC was connected to my neighbour's PC, and his to his neighbour's, and so on until some PC is connected directly to the server? Every PC is a node physically connected to each other, creating a network.   This model is by no means something new. It's how LAN networks work, and taking torrents as an example, it's possible to see how it could be free and that people are willing to collaborate with each other to share content and resources. The question is, why hasn't this happened with WAN networks (i.e. the internet)? Why are we using ISPs? Why aren't there any alternatives? Is it because of costs? Because it's hard to organise?  Just to be clear *—*I had a conversation with one of the mods and I thought I should edit my post to clarify*—* this is not a *what if* question. This is a question of *why not* and *why do we use what we are currently using instead of P2P internet*. Also, I think it's worth saying that I know that LAN networks work as I previously stated *—a bunch of PCs wired together—* but the internet is not a LAN network, it's essentially a WAN network.

10x1kw	The ball can’t speed up after release, it can only slow down, right? Once nothing is pushing it any more, it has to slow down.

cpcfifry	I'm currently taking a finance module and we're discussing the "Off-Market currency swaps" that was used by Greece. However, I'm having a really hard time comprehending the situation.   The following text (what's in bold is what I don't understand) and [diagram is what imy referring to](https://i.imgur.com/rvW9HDP.png):  >“A more common type of off-market rate derivative transaction occurs when a debt office enters into a domestic IRS by receiving-fixed and paying-floating rates but asks that the fixed payment be lower than the swap market rate. This implies that the swap is not valued at zero, having instead a negative value for the sovereign borrower. **To complete the deal, the debt office will either need a lower (in algebraic value) spread on its LIBOR-linked payments, or will ask to be compensated immediately with an up-front payment.**  >The two alternatives are very different. In the first case, the remaining value of the swap is amortized over the life of the swap as a greater gain for the treasury, which compensates more or less equally over the life of the transaction for the lower fixed rate received with respect to the market rate. In the second case, up-front payments, if not amortized, might constitute operations meant to avoid the accrual principle for the purpose of window-dressing.”  Thanks!	1643136111.0	sckoab	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sckoab/eli5_how_offmarket_currency_swaps_work/	ELI5: How off-market currency swaps work?

ej5juz1o	I’m writing a novel and this vehicle needs to be burned in an emergency situation. My characters have almost nothing with them. They do have a zippo lighter.   It’s my understanding that petrol isn’t as flammable as movies make out so I can’t just shove a burning rag in the side of the car and hope for the best.  I’m wondering, if I got some petrol out, soaked fabric with it, spread it out across the seats, would the extra oxygen available help it burn better? Or is petrol just useless and I need something better? How are they doing this in Paris?  To everyone who helped with my hot wire question the other day, thank you!

aft156zt	I read an article recently regarding Elon Musks' concern for population collapse due to declining birth rates. The same sentiments have been echoed by others as well with predictions that we will reach approx. 9.64B by 2064 (weirdly precise predictions) then taper off to 8.8B by the end of the century.  As long as population decline is occurring across the planet and not just in certain regions/countries and provided the decline is proportional to the current population of a region then isn't it a good thing? I always thought overpopulation (or eventual overpopulation) was a bad thing for the environment due, in part, from competition of resources.. if we are already causing untold damage to the environment at 7B do you think we'll be any better at 10B or 20B - its not as if we'll all suddenly reach a utopian state of perfect equilibrium with our environment.   I understand its still important to understand the factors driving this decline to ensure it doesn't go too far but I feel like our current population size is already pretty large?	1643208451.0	sd7m9u	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd7m9u/eli5_why_is_populationbirth_decline_a_bad_thing/	eli5 Why is population/birth decline a bad thing?
