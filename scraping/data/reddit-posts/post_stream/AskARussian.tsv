Uber had been replaced with Yandex, which wouldn't accept my US-based credit card even if I entered it through Apple Pay; it wasn't being declined by my bank. I'm flying to Moscow soon and just tried to add my card to Yandex again - same problem. Gett did let me add my card, but I'm not confident it'll work until I actually try. At that point it'll of course be too late to ask you all for help.

aiqzuzme	Hello all, I’m living in Yekaterinburg for a year, and I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights.

i7lavsor	As a citizen of a country part of NATO:  • ⁠Western media does not talk about the fact that most of the population in Crimea identify as russians. They dont talk about the fact that most of the people living there were and are pro-russian. Anyway, ofc, the way Russia claimed Crimea is fairly subject to criticism. But would Ukraine ever give up Crimea freely through election? I dont think so. Crimea also happen to be a strategically important area with important natural resources… So yeah, that adds to the motivation from the russian side - which is obviously not what the russian media talks about - they focus about the right of self-identification and that people in Crimea are pro-russian…  • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia is an underdog against NATO. And noone talks about the fact that it is unpleasant for Russia to have next door neighbours being part of NATO, including delivery and placing of military missiles at the border to Russia - not far from Moscow.  • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia feels treathened by the geopolitical development and pro-US and pro-NATO european development.  … Yes, Russia can be critizised. But so can the US. How did the US react to USSR missiles being placed on Cuba? The US would go batshit if Russia attempted the same that the US is attempting with Ukraine…  …Anyway… In the end, this is about Ukraine… Not Russia, not the US… The US is not protecting Ukraine because they are being nice. They protect Ukraine because it is strategically smart and beneficial. This is a story not told by the western media… Russia, on the other hand, are protecting their own interests in not being military treathened at their border in case of conflict… In their fear, they treathen by allocating troops to the border to Ukraine - not because they want to invade, nor because they want war - but because they want to scare Ukraine from allowing the US to gain strategical territory…  The overall situation is super complicated… And there is a lot of propaganda and wrongdoing on both sides… The majority of russians are biased in direction of hating the west. While the west is biased towards hating Russia. The truth lies in the middle, and up - not in between… And the people who should be mad are all the countries and people affected by the geopolitical dick measuring contest by the US and Russia.  What are your thoughts on my perspective?       __Edit: Thank you all for very constructive comments, interesting facts, thoughts, opinions and so on. Please keep them coming!__        __Edit: adding these answers that I got from someone in r/nato (for an alternative perspective and balanced discussion):__  • ⁠Western media does not talk about the fact that most of the population in Crimea identify as russians  In fact 60% are of russian ethnicity. Ethnicity does not say anything about their political belief or what country they want to belong to. The referendum in 2014 was according to every non-russian media highly irregular, so that's not an argument for anything.   • ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia is an underdog against NATO. And noone talks about the fact that it is unpleasant for Russia to have next door neighbours being part of NATO, including delivery and placing of military missiles at the border to Russia - not far from Moscow.  Russia is one of the strongest nuclear powers and the aggressor as well. To use your words: the fact that it is unpleasant for europe to have a next door neighbor stationing thousands of troops near their borders, including delivery and placing of military missiles in kaliningrad - not far from vilnius, riga, warsaw, berlin and helsinki. The very existence of NATO is because of russias aggression.   ⁠Noone talks about the fact that Russia feels treathened by the geopolitical development and pro-US and pro-NATO european development.  This is naturally a minor concern, when in fact our allies feel threatened by russia who constantly violate european airspace, kill people on the open street in berlin and poison people in salisbury. Who are dedicated to their misinformation program for over 6 years now. Who attack a neighbor every 6-8 years since 1999.   … Yes, Russia can be critizised. But so can the US. How did the US react to USSR missiles being placed on Cuba? The US would go batshit if Russia attempted the same that the US is attempting with Ukraine…  Whataboutism and ancient history. Why am i even reacting to that. Cant be taken seriously.   Anyway… In the end, this is about Ukraine… Not Russia, not the US… The US is not protecting Ukraine because they are being nice. They protect Ukraine because it is strategically smart and beneficial.  This is about europe. The US is an ally and has an interest of not having a major war in europe while china is building naval bases close to their ally japan. Mentioning the US at all smells like whataboutism, especially if you take into account the way not only trump but also biden is playing is foreign policy cards.   The overall situation is super complicated… And there is a lot of propaganda and wrongdoing on both sides…  The situation is not overly complicated compared to other issues of our day and age. Ukraine is a sovereign country. Russia has troops inside it's territory since 2014. Russia annexed a large part of the country in 2014. It also now has more than 100.000 troops at their borders, plain to see for everyone. This is a threat to europe. In europe there is an alliance that was founded because of this exact problem. And putin is playing the victim card, while NATO is doing exactly what it's supposed to and what it said it would do.	1642701834.0	s8ozot	/r/AskARussian/comments/s8ozot/my_take_as_a_person_from_a_nato_country_what_do/	My take as a person from a NATO country… What do you Russians think about my perspective?

22gkf453	Context: My wife is Russian, one of my colleagues (Scottish) has an ушанка given to him "By a Russian-speaking Kazakh" 10 years ago.   This colleague is wearing this hat here (in Hungary, which looks super weird) because he says "this is fashionable. My wife laughed when I told her and she said she hasn't seen or heard of anyone wearing these in modern Russia - not even that much when she was a kid in Moscow back in the 80s.  Another colleague (American) likes this guy so she jumps in and supports him, that yes, she's seen "people on instagram" that wear these hats in Russian cities. I didn't, quite, laugh in her face (I mean, come on, it's Instagram; not exactly a representation of life anyway, right?).  So, thought I'd ask here! For those living in Russia in various places, anyone really wearing ушанка anymore? Is my wife right, and haha, no way? Or these two right and yes, it's high fashion and lots of people wear them?

Then I only recently learned that vk was not a porn site but a Russian fb...  So the question arised (if I can say so) : How does the Russian society perceive the pornography in general and it's consumption ? Also how do you view people producing porn ?  For exemple:  I m belgian and at last in public, most aged people will tell you that porn is bad even thought most people watch at least some. It would be highly unusual for a teenage not to watch it from time to time (up to a point a teenageboy tellingyou he doesn'twatch porn is highly improbable). It's pretty common for teenage boys to speak about it sometimes even thought it's between close friend they do so. In couple it's not uncommon to have at least one partner watching some porn sometimes.  On the other doing porn is badly seen and nobody would want it's daughter or son to do it.	1642738630.0	s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/	How does Russian perceive pornography ?

cz3m2wwe	I recently moved to Moscow from California. Most of my Russian friends live in Moscow the friend in question lives in St.Petersburg and they have  been inviting me to visit with them since I got here.   I finally spent some time with them the other day however I booked a hotel while there instead of staying at their house (they have a guest room) the issue for me was I didn't know if I would be extending my stay so I didn't want to impose on them if I chose to do so according to them I could've stayed as long as I wanted, but I know that sometimes people say that when they don't really mean it ( I told them this after the fact, see below which seemed to only dig a deeper hole for myself)  however they were mostly the reason for my visit aside from some mild site seeing. They seemed really distant and a little weird on the visit.   When I went back to Moscow they called to tell me that I really offended them by declining to stay at their home, even asking if there was some hidden meaning behind it.   Now I know that some people back home in the U.S. can be offend by things like this but I only ever ran into this issue with my Russian friends. This has happened a few times with others, once when a friend invited me to meet with them at their home and I opted for us to go to a cafe instead.  It seems to bother them a little more than it does my friends back home in the States.   I wanna note that I'm not doing it out of any negative place, I'm from California we always find an excuse to go out and as for the staying over at peoples house I just didn't want to impose on them.   If my behaviour is really something that is seen as weird here then, I don't mind compromising as not to offend my friends.  You know as they say when in Rome.  I also wanna say that I did go to their home and spent significant amount time there just that I didn't stay there.  So in the end is this a Russian thing or just a my friend thing?	1642776283.0	s9cb51	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9cb51/russian_friend_upset_i_stayed_at_a_hotel_instead/	Russian friend upset I stayed at a hotel instead of at their home was I in the wrong?

yzuvh	Something  I've  noticed  when following some  NATO  hardware  advances  is  that  how quickly they're developed especially since Poland has been cranking out some  nifty technologies for NATO like the  pl-01,and the  Fb  beryl, while the Italians  have their centauro  tank destroyer design,and  Germany with their leopard tanks. How confident are you in Russia's  current military hardware which from my perspective is decades behind European hardware since most Russian tanks have autoloaders which means most  NATO  armor operators are going to aim for the ammunition storage in the turret basket, subjectively  speaking the Europeans  have the cooler and better toys than the Kremlin  which is why the  US  wouldn't necessarily need to get  involved if  Russia invaded Europe because even the  US is  behind  NATO itself  in  some aspects of hardware development  essentially the Europeans are more than capable of handling the  Russian military.

(Thank you to everyone on here being honest & helpful with my past posts).  I was in the US Military for a while and would enjoy it again but in the RU military and I came across this online:   “The Russian Armed Forces accepts foreigners of any country to their ranks. Under a plan, posted on the ministry's web site in 2010, foreigners without dual citizenship are able to sign up for five-year contracts – and are eligible for Russian citizenship after serving three years. According to the amended law, a citizen of any foreign country aged 18–30 with a good command of Russian and a clean record can sign an initial five-year contract to join the Army.”   I was wondering how accurate that is as of this year and if that is possible!

ehomo9o8	Russia has managed a significant buildup near the Ukrainian border which rises extreme anxiety to Ukrainians and Europeans - uniting them in threat of Russia - which could make Ukraine NATO inclusion extremely fast. Otherwise it would take many decades for any theoretical inclusion, given border disputes and corruption in Ukraine.  Can you explain such moves given main thing russia don't want is Ukraine inclusion into NATO? It does no make any sense. Or is Russian government really setting up a soon invasion and occupation of more territories?	1642805448.0	s9nbf0	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9nbf0/why_is_russia_threatening_ukraine_if_it_is_the/	Why is Russia threatening Ukraine if it is the main factor increasing average Ukrainian support for joining NATO?

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.  I know the 25th is soon, I just thought it would be nice to know if this was true.  Thank you to anyone who answers.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places?

ahle7qv5	do you Russians think the comments that putin made about the collapse of the soviet union being the greatest tragedy in the 20th century have help fuel anti russian sentiments and made the situation in ukraine worse??, I have family in poland who like russian people but the older generation are not too fond of the memory's of growing up/living in the USSR and the younger generations like the cosmopolitan vibe of Europe now.  Imo the recent flocking of former soviet states to NATO and ukraine wanting to move closer to Europe is not so much US expansionism but a fear of the old Stalin days and living under the KGB scrutiny and tget seek NATO alliances to keep their national identities intact.  What could russia/putin do to maintain his sphere of influence in Europe with peaceful relationships rather than heavy handed tactics that could have European countries keep the US away from Russia's borders through good dialogue and mutual understandings and respect??  Edit, post may come of as western bias but I purely ask this as discussions with family members overseas as they are afraid of war but also going back in time 20 - 50 years.	1642948082.0	saut2n	/r/AskARussian/comments/saut2n/putins_comments_on_the_ussr/	Putins comments on the USSR

2th6gqmm	I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...   Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

1oph0ajc	So I (25F-ethnically Persian) recently moved to Moscow for my master’s degree, and although i’m not new to the dating scene, I’ve been facing difficulty with dating in Russia. Important notes are that I don’t speak any Russian. So far I’ve been using Bumble and Tinder (but mostly Bumble). I’m average looking, and noticeably fit.  Generally, my difficulty has been that conversations fade out. Personally, I try to be engaging, and I’m an expressive person in general. I’ve matched with a lot of people with whom I have things in common, yet conversations have gone nowhere.   So this made me wonder. What is the average sentiment on dating immigrants? & what is the sentiment on dating people who don’t speak your language? Is there something I should be wary about? Some etiquettes I should follow? Cause there are bold cultural differences between where I’m from and Russia, and I’m starting to think maybe i’m doing something wrong!	1642961219.0	sazovb	/r/AskARussian/comments/sazovb/problems_dating_in_russia/	Problems dating in Russia
bakftrjt	I have been reading a bit about the old "empire" Kievan Rus and was wondering what meaning it has to todays Russia and todays culture in Russia. So my questions are e.g.:  * Do you see the Kievan Rus as the "cradle" of Russia? Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians? If yes, which specific topics are important for Russians?  Thanks a lot for all responses!	1642962381.0	sb05qx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sb05qx/киевская_русь/	Киевская Русь
ah1vew4g	Hi, I'm from Greece and the media and most people here have good feelings for Russia and Russian people. Russia is always portrayed as a brotherly country.  After spending some time on this subreddit, I read on posts that Europe has treated and still treats Russian people in a bad way, for example the ones living in European countries now. Can you say more examples? Because honestly I want to know more sides of this, since I always thought that, because Greece thinks of Russia in a good way, it would be the same in the rest of Europe as well for some reason, it was just an impression I hadn't thought much about. (I don't put the whole of Europe in the same category, I just wanted to include all European countries.)

gizu5o34	Hey everyone - I am planning a trip to Russia to visit my grandma this summer. I was born in Moscow, but have lived in the US my whole life. That being said, I still speak, read, and write in Russian fluently at a college level. I haven't been back to visit since I was in my late teens. Mostly because of being scared that I would get drafted since I am a dual citizen. My grandma is getting old and I really want to go visit her, but I was just on the US Travel Advisory website and the warning is at a level 4. AKA avoid all travel to Russia. [Here is the link](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/russia-travel-advisory.html). Obviously, there is the huge issue of a potential war in Ukraine, but has anyone traveled to the US from Russia recently? If so, what was that experience like? If you're in Russia, do you think it's safe to travel there right now coming from America?   TL;DR: I really want to go see my grandma in Russia and am not sure if it's safe to do so given the current political climate.	1643008827.0	sbgay6	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbgay6/travel_to_russia_from_america/	Travel to Russia from America

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments. Not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.     https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

For exemple:  I m belgian and at last in public, most aged people will tell you that porn is bad even thought most people watch at least some. It would be highly unusual for a teenage not to watch it from time to time (up to a point a teenageboy tellingyou he doesn'twatch porn is highly improbable). It's pretty common for teenage boys to speak about it sometimes even thought it's between close friend they do so. In couple it's not uncommon to have at least one partner watching some porn sometimes.  On the other doing porn is badly seen and nobody would want it's daughter or son to do it.	1642738630.0	s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/	How does Russian perceive pornography ?
akit2qs4	I don't understand.  These stories sound made up when you look into them.  So I don't get why it got so many upvotes on the Georgian subreddit.  I don't even know why Vera Putina has a wikipedia article.  What's even stranger is how upset Georgians get when people point out they look middle eastern or if someone says they're not European.  Even worse if someone mentions the Bagratuni dynasty.

My question is: Do you actually walk around to every one of the men individually and shake their hands on arrival and departure or is it just the act of acknowledging everyone in your coming and going?   (E.g. In NZ its customary to just wave goodbye to everyone saying "Bye everybody! Nice to meet you all!" as you make your way out of the house and not just "slip" out unannounced.

Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

His music is absolutely amazing and legendary. I can't understand anything he says (can't speak Russian) but I love it, and it's making me want to learn.

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places? Is there more of an awareness of germs and bacteria over there? Is it part of the daily discussion? I'd love to know!	1642922764.0	sao24v	/r/AskARussian/comments/sao24v/are_russians_particularly_sensitive_to_cleanliness/	Are Russians particularly sensitive to cleanliness?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

bakftrjt	I have been reading a bit about the old "empire" Kievan Rus and was wondering what meaning it has to todays Russia and todays culture in Russia. So my questions are e.g.:  * Do you see the Kievan Rus as the "cradle" of Russia? Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians? If yes, which specific topics are important for Russians?  Thanks a lot for all responses!	1642962381.0	sb05qx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sb05qx/киевская_русь/	Киевская Русь

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

Or is one fake, and I applied to the second one and got a supposed “acceptance”, but I noticed that the person/company mailing me was called “Edugain Overseas”, and I’m not sure if it’s real or not, and they require me to pay 500 USD + first year tuition fees in order to send me an invitation letter, is that the normal procedure? I also was not asked to do any exams or nothing whatsoever. Please help me in this case.  EDIT: I’ve emailed the office/company edugain, and they informed me that the second link is for locals only and first is for international students? Could someone confirm or deny this? Thanks again  EDIT 2: When I applied through the first website, i received an email saying that I’ll be forwarded to the official representative “Edugain Overseas” which I thought at the time was an actual representative. However I searched the name on google and the company was located in India and it seems that they help students get into Ukrainian and Russian universities. This has all made me too suspicious and made me post this here.  EDIT 3: I’ve decided that I’ll not be paying and I’m the meanwhile I’ll email the second link which is real one about the issue and whether the office (edugain overseas) has actually got me an acceptance or not.

18npgz9d	From what I know it is very niche and not very famous, and for myself it is pretty much the "politically correct" version of Fascism.  But what interests me (as a concept, I'm by no means fond of authoritarianism) is the defense of the concept of multipolarity as a means to help the self-determination of peoples. Latin America has historically struggled to fulfill its objectives mostly due to U.S. interference. A multipolar world would surely be in our interests, as our northern neighbour would have to turn its eyes elsewhere, or nowhere at all, and I believe, for different reasons, that a new geopolitical organization such as this one would also be in Russia's interests.	1643119604.0	scejcl	/r/AskARussian/comments/scejcl/opinions_on_the_4th_political_theory/	Opinions on the 4th Political Theory?

2y5iebtw	Currently in the process of learning the Russian language and I've come to the point that I can start writing sentences to help commit words/phrases to memory better. So I'm wondering, should I just jump straight into learning cursive for writing? Is writing in "print" a thing? For example, most English speakers (at least here in the U.S.) are taught cursive in school but never actually use it. Everyone I know writes in "print" except for very rare occasions. I'm wondering if the same is true at all for Russian or if it would be best for me to just get used to it.	1643146262.0	scohp0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scohp0/how_common_is_cursive/	How common is cursive?

40qqp96b	The EU just passed a law that [makes it mandatory](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/statistics-and-analysis/statistics-and-analysis-archive/esafety/black-boxes-vehicle-data-recorders_en) for car manufacturers to install hardware, something like a "black box" that will track your movement and log every handling you make and it will make sounds and flashing lights when you surpass the maximum speed limit. It will be enforced within two years from now.   They say this is being done to minimize traffic-death toll and although obviously I think every causality is one to many, I just assume the real reason is to maximize the amount of control governments and companies will have on you is to maximize profits and to strive for something ~~we~~ they call prosperity.  Because to the general public, laws are being developed to eradicate terrorism, child porn, drugs and unnecessary death from the face of the earth, but since I'm closer to forty than thirty I start to understand that all of these phenomena's are just part of life, so you either have to cope or install totalitarian regime in where they can implement all the necessary tools to follow your every footstep, measures so drastically, it will interfere with the way you flow into daily life, as for instance we currently see in parts of China.   This might be quite a rant - the vibe I get from the current situation alongside the border of Ukraine and Russia is that, in the Western media that is available around me, everyone has something to say, except for Russia. The voice of Russia is never to be heard in our newspapers, so the only thing I get is that the West somehow is anxious about something that Russia does.   And because we, as kids, were raised with the narrative that 'the West' is of superior quality than the regimes in 'the (far) East', because regimes are baaaad and communism is baaad and everyone in the East is being suppressed and you people are poor and healthcare sucks and totalitarianism is awful. North Korea is shit and China right now is shit because of it's surveillance-state and sweatshops. Russia and the far East should shut the fuck up because you are always drunk fucks and let the Great West decide that you are shit and we are amazing, fuck you. If you plan to invade a country, we will fuck you up, goddamnit.  I have the feeling I'm missing out big time on some great cultural feats that reside in Russia and the Eastern part of the world and your woman are absolutely stunning and your food is great, you have great art and music and architecture and the way you people socialize is beyond how I grew up and what I observe. No random person in my vicinity ever invited me to lunch together while we were going down the same path.   People in the West are absolute entitled asshole individuals with a great arrogance, always looking at their phones, not giving a shit about the world around them, thinking they are amazing until they develop pancreatic cancer, then obviously it's the fault of someone else and Russia still sucks. Everything is focussed on maximizing efficiency and to get rid of that what is holding them down. If you don't have money or resources, you are a fucking loser, holy shit.   Now Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and all the other major platforms are making sure you will see what *they* want. Because instead of censoring like 'they' do in the East, locking people who are slightly criticizing the government, 'we' just flag it as 'fake news' and we ban you from the platform, effectively doing the same without locking up our people.   Google and Facebook are tracking you every moment of the day. They know where you are, what meds you take, your preferred snack and how many teeth you have. And that's no fucking joke. Because everything is linked to each other, every company is harvesting massive amounts of data. Not for your favour, to win the war on drugs or to downplay terrorism, but to maximize profits and to try and generate the maximum amounts of control they have on the citizens.   And now you might think "What the fuck does this has to do with Russia?"  Well, for ages I've been taught that everything about Russia and China is total shit, complete fucked up waste of space. You people completely suck at what ever you are doing and you are the scum of the Earth and we in the West are fucking amazing, right?  All while this fucked up indoctrination is turning itself against me and the only observation I make is that the European Union and USA is no fucking different and is implementing the same fucked-up doctrine that the West is accusing the East from doing so and it pisses me off.   The EU and USA will do everything they can to develop a system in where they are able to observe and track your sorry ass to see if you do what they demand from you. This is just the same as a Stalinist five-year plan but in the current day and digital age and they will fuck you up if you plan to steer away from their intentions.   I have a few questions and it revolves around how you as a Russian perceive this as being true or false in the way you've been raised as a kid. Do you share similar sentiment and observations but opposed to the West? Is Russia also doing its best to hoard as much as data from their civilians to try and suppress your ass with the belief it's against drugs abuse, child porn and terrorism?  Or am I making just a whole bunch of uneducated stupid assumptions and is this all just me being a paranoid schizo, drunk with resentment for something I can not get?

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.  I know the 25th is soon, I just thought it would be nice to know if this was true.  Thank you to anyone who answers.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

Now, I am preparing to immerse myself in the Russian culture and history, as I do want to master the Russian language in the next 2 years. So, I want to connect to Russians who are also in the same field and profession generally to enrich my language and history understanding, and to widen my knowledge of how things are done in my field there. Any tips?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?
q2eoay7	So I've come across this band on YouTube. It's called Kino and the lead singer, Victor tsoi was a really interesting character too, I'm not a massive fan of rock but there is something I just can't explain about his music, there are many millions of views of his music in YouTube now I wonder if he will go viral because I know if people here knew about him it would be massive. His music is absolutely amazing and legendary. I can't understand anything he says (can't speak Russian) but I love it, and it's making me want to learn.   My question is   How popular is kino now in russia?  bars, clubs still play his music?  Also side question do you know about any other bands that are similar, same style? Would love to know.

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places? Is there more of an awareness of germs and bacteria over there? Is it part of the daily discussion?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians?

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?
q2eoay7	So I've come across this band on YouTube.

His music is absolutely amazing and legendary. I can't understand anything he says (can't speak Russian) but I love it, and it's making me want to learn.   My question is   How popular is kino now in russia?  bars, clubs still play his music?  Also side question do you know about any other bands that are similar, same style? Would love to know.

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.  I know the 25th is soon, I just thought it would be nice to know if this was true.  Thank you to anyone who answers.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies? Please let me know because I have no clue if he is a ruthless killer or a man put in a less than ideal circumstance.	1642814208.0	s9qfks	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9qfks/what_are_russians_views_on_stalin/	What are Russians views on Stalin?

I’m doing a Russian themed dinner for my birthday with few friends : we’re gonna eat, listen to some music and we would like to taste an authentic vodka. I’m Italian and here we don’t have much choice in terms of vodka.  The web is filled with “commercial” vodka, even quality vodka, but that’s not what I’m looking for . I would love to try a real Russian vodka, a vodka that Russian recognizes as their own, and not a vodka produced only for export. I hope you understand what I meant despite my bad English.

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?
q2eoay7	So I've come across this band on YouTube.

His music is absolutely amazing and legendary. I can't understand anything he says (can't speak Russian) but I love it, and it's making me want to learn.   My question is   How popular is kino now in russia?  bars, clubs still play his music?  Also side question do you know about any other bands that are similar, same style? Would love to know.

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians?

43z74oz9	The Orthodox Church is probably one of the visible signs of Russian culture in terms of its liturgies, icons, worship, etc. From a Russian perspective:   * What role does the Orthodox Church play in the everyday social and cultural lives of many Russians.  * What are positive things that Orthodox Church leaders have done and are doing in Russian society that might not be well known outside * What are some negative things that Orthodox Church leaders have done or that Russians disagree with?  * Is the Russian Orthodox Church's relationship with Putin as close as portrayed in the international press?   An additional question I would add on top of that is what are some internal differences that exists inside the Russian Orthodox Church.	1642999995.0	sbdq9a	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbdq9a/what_role_does_the_russian_orthodox_church_play/	What role does the Russian Orthodox Church play in the social lives of Russians?

121ix9	Hi! So as the title says, is there a culture of spending time in nature, exploring off the beaten path, hiking etc? Is this a common hobby/pastime for Russians?   Also considering Russia has such vast areas of wilderness, what is the current narrative on the protection of wild areas? Are people generally in favor of development or conservation of nature? Are there any influential organizations focused on ecology? I remember some years ago a speaker at a conference was trying to sound the alarm on the rapid destruction of the Volga river delta, he very eloquently explained that it was more economically viable to preserve it, and it also had huge implications for Russia as whole (farming and food security etc). Even the president promised to prioritize the issue, did anything happen to protect the Volga river delta in the meanwhile?

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).  The only side we hear of is the Canadians, especially the pair who still feel they deserved the medal better but we never hear much of the Russian side of the story  Do you think the Canadians deserved to settle for silver or gold?	1643048893.0	sbstwx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbstwx/what_do_the_russians_think_of_the_2002_olympic/	What do the Russians think of the 2002 Olympic pairs skating debacle?

66fdxkq9	So I found two websites for the university: https://fmsmu.com https://www.sechenov.ru Are both of these websites real? Or is one fake, and I applied to the second one and got a supposed “acceptance”, but I noticed that the person/company mailing me was called “Edugain Overseas”, and I’m not sure if it’s real or not, and they require me to pay 500 USD + first year tuition fees in order to send me an invitation letter, is that the normal procedure? I also was not asked to do any exams or nothing whatsoever. Please help me in this case.  EDIT: I’ve emailed the office/company edugain, and they informed me that the second link is for locals only and first is for international students? Could someone confirm or deny this? Thanks again  EDIT 2: When I applied through the first website, i received an email saying that I’ll be forwarded to the official representative “Edugain Overseas” which I thought at the time was an actual representative. However I searched the name on google and the company was located in India and it seems that they help students get into Ukrainian and Russian universities. This has all made me too suspicious and made me post this here.  EDIT 3: I’ve decided that I’ll not be paying and I’m the meanwhile I’ll email the second link which is real one about the issue and whether the office (edugain overseas) has actually got me an acceptance or not.

18npgz9d	From what I know it is very niche and not very famous, and for myself it is pretty much the "politically correct" version of Fascism.  But what interests me (as a concept, I'm by no means fond of authoritarianism) is the defense of the concept of multipolarity as a means to help the self-determination of peoples. Latin America has historically struggled to fulfill its objectives mostly due to U.S. interference. A multipolar world would surely be in our interests, as our northern neighbour would have to turn its eyes elsewhere, or nowhere at all, and I believe, for different reasons, that a new geopolitical organization such as this one would also be in Russia's interests.	1643119604.0	scejcl	/r/AskARussian/comments/scejcl/opinions_on_the_4th_political_theory/	Opinions on the 4th Political Theory?

40qqp96b	The EU just passed a law that [makes it mandatory](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/statistics-and-analysis/statistics-and-analysis-archive/esafety/black-boxes-vehicle-data-recorders_en) for car manufacturers to install hardware, something like a "black box" that will track your movement and log every handling you make and it will make sounds and flashing lights when you surpass the maximum speed limit. It will be enforced within two years from now.  They say this is being done to minimize traffic-death toll and although obviously I think every causality is one to many, I just assume the real reason is to maximize the amount of control governments and companies will have on you is to maximize profits and to strive for something ~~we~~ they call prosperity.  Because to the general public, laws are being developed to eradicate terrorism, child porn, drugs and unnecessary death from the face of the earth, but since I'm closer to forty than thirty I start to understand that all of these phenomena's are just part of life, so you either have to cope or install totalitarian regime in where they can implement all the necessary tools to follow your every footstep, measures so drastically, it will interfere with the way you flow into daily life, as for instance we currently see in parts of China, which obviously does not exterminate illicit drug manufacturing or terrorism, but it will fuck up your life.  This might be quite a rant - the vibe I get from the current situation alongside the border of Ukraine and Russia is that, in the Western media that is available around me, everyone has something to say, except for Russia. The voice of Russia is never to be heard in our newspapers, so the only thing I get is that the West somehow is anxious about something that Russia does.  And because we, as kids, were raised with the narrative that 'the West' is of superior quality than the regimes in 'the (far) East', because regimes are baaaad and communism is baaad and everyone in the East is being suppressed and you people are poor and healthcare sucks and totalitarianism is awful. North Korea is shit and China right now is shit because of it's surveillance-state and sweatshops. Russia and the far East should shut the fuck up because you are always drunk fucks and let the Great West decide that you are shit and we are amazing, fuck you. If you plan to invade a country, we will fuck you up, goddamnit.  I have the feeling I'm missing out big time on some great cultural feats that reside in Russia and the Eastern part of the world and your woman are absolutely stunning and your food is great, you have great art and music and architecture and the way you people socialize is beyond how I grew up and what I observe. No random person in my vicinity ever invited me to lunch together while we were going down the same path.  People in the West are absolute entitled asshole individuals with a great arrogance, always looking at their phones, not giving a shit about the world around them, thinking they are amazing until they develop pancreatic cancer, then obviously it's the fault of someone else and Russia still sucks. Everything is focussed on maximizing efficiency and to get rid of that what is holding them down. If you don't have money or resources, you are a fucking loser, holy shit.  Now Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and all the other major platforms are making sure you will see what *they* want. Because instead of censoring like 'they' do in the East, locking people who are slightly criticizing the government, 'we' just flag it as 'fake news' and we ban you from the platform, effectively doing the same without locking up our people.  Google and Facebook are tracking you every moment of the day. They know where you are, what meds you take, your preferred snack and how many teeth you have. And that's no fucking joke. Because everything is linked to each other, every company is harvesting massive amounts of data. Not for your favour, to win the war on drugs or to downplay terrorism, but to maximize profits and to try and generate the maximum amounts of control they have on the citizens.  And now you might think "What the fuck does this has to do with Russia?"  Well, for ages I've been taught that everything about Russia and China is total shit, complete fucked up waste of space. You people completely suck at what ever you are doing and you are the scum of the Earth and we in the West are fucking amazing, right?  All while this fucked up indoctrination is turning itself against me and the only observation I make is that the European Union and USA is no fucking different and is implementing the same fucked-up doctrine that the West is accusing the East from doing so and it pisses me off.  The EU and USA will do everything they can to develop a system in where they are able to observe and track your sorry ass to see if you do what they demand from you. This is just the same as a Stalinist five-year plan but in the current day and digital age and they will fuck you up if you plan to steer away from their intentions.  I have a few questions and it revolves around how you as a Russian perceive this as being true or false in the way you've been raised as a kid. Do you share similar sentiment and observations but opposed to the West? Is Russia also doing its best to hoard as much as data from their civilians to try and suppress your ass with the belief it's against drugs abuse, child porn and terrorism?  Or am I making just a whole bunch of uneducated stupid assumptions and is this all just me being a paranoid schizo, drunk with resentment for something I can not get?  I would love to read bunch of your stories and viewpoints and thank you for reading.   TL;DR   Being raised by the doctrine that Pro-EU is great and Russia is bad, because oligarchic communism  is bad, because everyone is spying on each other and you are drunk fucks that are being suppressed by your totalitarian regime and you live in a surveillance state and you will get exterminated if you don't follow orders.   Of course that is a bunch of bullshit and according to new laws, Europe is doing exactly that what they accuse Russia and China for doing, by implementing laws that makes it possible to spy and hoard as much information about you only to be that slightly more secure with a shit argument that it's against terrorism or any other shitty reasoning while all they really want is control over your sorry ass so they can maximize profit that they call prosperity and EU is in no way better or worse than the East or what they want you to believe.   	1643182098.0	sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/	Cultural differences, narrative, privacy, and the current day and age governing the peoples

4rsb8161	The question derived from previous post. I'm Russian myself,  anytime someone brings up the discussion on "How are you?" being a form of a greeting and not a literal question - it puzzles me.   For one thing the concept was explained in "Brat 2" movie over 2 decades ago. Has been ridiculed by Zadornov for a while. And keep coming up in every youtube video titled "10 cons of living in the US". Wasn't there enough time to connect the dots? Secondly, even in the movie it was actually insulting to intelligence to assume that Russian can not understand that words do not always have to be taken literally. Have you ever bitten a granite (грызли гранит) or have your arms ever walked (руки доходили)? Thirdly, i'm pretty sure Russians are able to read the context. While in Russia, have you ever been asked "Как дела?" by a guy you barely know, say at a new workplace? Did you let him in on your medical record?  Furthermore, besides the context, tone needs to be considered, because "how are you?" can be a genuine inquiry.

orwx5	Hi guys, first post here, I want to be respectful just genuinely curious about this. My Russian roommate just moved out (we are friends too, or I thought we were haha). She left 4 things here that I gave to her as gifts. Like I went to a store and bought them specifically for her for different occasions.  Her reason is "I don't need them now, you can use them if you want!"   (She is moving into a completely empty apartment not so far away, so technically she does need them, but I guess doesn't like them.)  My first reaction is of course to get offended lol. But I'm wondering if this is just a cultural difference? Does she legitimately think she's doing me a favor by giving back gifts? Among American girl friends this would definitely be a very passive aggressive move, but I wanted to Ask a Russian before I get offended.

I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)     In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)     We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet     So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)     How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)     I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

I have no doubt that he was, but him emphasizing it for several times makes me curious if there is something interestingly implicit behind it?  We also chatted about my Russian friends.

I know that the KPRF has a *very small* level of power compared to the United Russia Party. How close is their ideology to that the of the Russian National Front?      My basic understanding of Putin is that he is a strong a pluralist between Tsarist and Soviet tradition.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?   I am writing an article on the Russian-Ukraine conflict for academic purposes, specifically how Russian and Ukrainian Canadians view the conflict. If you are Russian Canadian, would you be willing to provide your first name, and the city that you are in? Thank you for your time.  &#x200B;  Full disclosure.

9xcluxkb	To sum up the whole case : in October 2017, former olympic artistic gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused her compatriot and former olympic-winner gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of having raped her when she was 15.  She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :   >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*   By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*   Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.   Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.    Personally I doubt rapes rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.

1zviqa	Serbian actor who apparently made a solid career in Russia and also had a main role in one of the most highly grossing Russian films, Holop.   Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.  So i just wanted to make some things clear and distinguish his bullshitting from reality.

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.  I know Russia has  Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

744atkfk	Hi guys,  I am doing a masters in translation studies (ru>eng) and writing a paper on how lgbt people are represented through translation. I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

Case in point, the US Military used to kick men out of service if they were found out to be gay.

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.  I have heard sketchy things about Avito (unfortunately), so a trustworthy intermediary would be preferable...if possible.  I know this isn't a cheap item, so I don't want to lose coin to a scam. I've tried searching this item on other sites and I can't find it, so I'm assuming that it is only on Avito.  That being said, it would be immensely appreciated if anybody can find the seller on a more accessible source.  I'm aware that this is a long shot, but I am trying my best to obtain this storied item.  Thank you very much!	1643363303.0	sen682	/r/AskARussian/comments/sen682/need_help_buying_something_off_of_avitoru/	Need help buying something off of Avito.ru - American buyer

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)  In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc   NOT our Pilsners like Jupiler and Stella. Which are very popular, but not the reason people say Belgium has the best beer in the world. They're not even Belgian style and I've had better pilsner in Prague  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)  We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet  So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)  How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)  I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?   I am writing an article on the Russian-Ukraine conflict for academic purposes, specifically how Russian and Ukrainian Canadians view the conflict. If you are Russian Canadian, would you be willing to provide your first name, and the city that you are in? Thank you for your time.  &#x200B;  Full disclosure.

She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :  >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*  By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*  Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.  Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.  Personally I doubt rape rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.  So what is your whole point of view about the two gymnasts case and about the plausible taboo rape poses in your countries ?	1643502137.0	sfvxzg	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfvxzg/about_the_tatiana_gutsu_vitaly_scherbo_case/	About the Tatiana Gutsu - Vitaly Scherbo case

1zviqa	Serbian actor who apparently made a solid career in Russia and also had a main role in one of the most highly grossing Russian films, Holop.   Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.  So i just wanted to make some things clear and distinguish his bullshitting from reality.

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.   Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.  I have heard sketchy things about Avito (unfortunately), so a trustworthy intermediary would be preferable...if possible.  I know this isn't a cheap item, so I don't want to lose coin to a scam. I've tried searching this item on other sites and I can't find it, so I'm assuming that it is only on Avito.  That being said, it would be immensely appreciated if anybody can find the seller on a more accessible source.  I'm aware that this is a long shot, but I am trying my best to obtain this storied item.  Thank you very much!	1643363303.0	sen682	/r/AskARussian/comments/sen682/need_help_buying_something_off_of_avitoru/	Need help buying something off of Avito.ru - American buyer

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)  In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc   NOT our Pilsners like Jupiler and Stella. Which are very popular, but not the reason people say Belgium has the best beer in the world. They're not even Belgian style and I've had better pilsner in Prague  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)  We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet  So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)  How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)  I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?

9xcluxkb	To sum up the whole case : in October 2017, former olympic artistic gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused her compatriot and former olympic-winner gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of having raped her when she was 15.  She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :  >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*  By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*  Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.  Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.  Personally I doubt rape rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.  So what is your whole point of view about the two gymnasts case and about the plausible taboo rape poses in your countries ?	1643502137.0	sfvxzg	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfvxzg/about_the_tatiana_gutsu_vitaly_scherbo_case/	About the Tatiana Gutsu - Vitaly Scherbo case

1zviqa	Serbian actor who apparently made a solid career in Russia and also had a main role in one of the most highly grossing Russian films, Holop.   Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.  So i just wanted to make some things clear and distinguish his bullshitting from reality. Is he really a ''star'' in Russia, do people even know about him, is he respected or considered ''irritating'' as much as in Serbia, etc?	1643570939.0	sggqpw	/r/AskARussian/comments/sggqpw/thoughts_on_miloš_biković_the_actor/	Thoughts on Miloš Biković, the actor?

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.   Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

The Russians called it the Slavyanka River, meaning "Slav River".[1] (Slavyanka in Russian means "Slavic woman".)

As a 3rd year Psychology student it's such an amazing opportunity to complete my own study.   My study is going to be investigating the links between Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), Mental health and Life satisfaction.

Second, I read on the studyinrussia website that according to Russian law, universities do not accept transfer students. Which is fine… but the problem is that I have an associate’s degree from an American university. So.. would I need to start over as a freshman and do an entire 4 year bachelor’s program? Or would it be possible to have a year of the preparation courses to learn the language and such, then go into my junior year?   Any advice is much appreciated.

14mytb	Putin has brought every Russian region under his control with almost all of the presidents of the republics belonging to Putin's "United Russia" party....all apart from the Chechen Republic, an outpost of radical Islam in the middle of Putin’s Russia, why? ill break it all down for you.  So if we look to history then Russia had a huge problem with Chechnya in terms of terrorism all over Russia. Yeltsin could not handle it so Putin came in and offered Akhmad Kadyrov the then head of the republic a deal, Putin showers him in money, weapons, gold, power plus lets him rule Chechnya as he sees fit as his own personal kingdom in exchange for no more wars and no more terrorism or separatism, Akhmad agrees and used the money and weapons provided by the kremlin to smash all other Chechen warlords who were still organizing terrorist attacks on Russia. Things went well until Akhmad Kadyrov was killed, he was then replaced by his son Ramzan Kadyrov.  Under Ramzans control almost all of the Chechen terrorists vanished in Russia. Ramzan then organized a military parade at Grozny football stadium with tanks, bombs and 6000 Chechen troops supposedly according to him "as a show of loyalty to Putin" but in reality this served a duel message, it said "My troops are at your command best friend" but it also said "Hey Putin, if you ever stop being my best friend then come and get me if you dare".   On top of that enemies of the Chechen regime disappear no matter who they are and no matter where they are in Russia from journalists living in Moscow to political opponents hiding in St Petersburg all of his opponents have been killed again no matter where they are in Russia. This means that Kadyrov has his own personal KGB situated all across the entire country that can be activated at any moment further deterring Putin from touching him or his kingdom and keeping the money from the Kremlin flowing (90 percent of the Chechen budget comes directly from the Kremlins coffers).   Putin created Ramzan Kadyrov and now his creation has grown big enough to look him in the eye.  I hope this has helped you understand why Putin fears the Chechen leader, why he cannot touch him and why the Kremlin pretends that it doesn't see the gay concentration camps and child marriages in Chechnya.

1zviqa	Seems that they simply chose to surrender to local nationalisms and simply move to Russia, instead of grouping themselves into strong organizations both demographically and territorially in order to preserve their rights in those countries and maybe even link up with Russia.  Kazahstan - In 1992 Russian population was **equal** to Kazakh, and comprised most of the country's intellectual elite. How they simply gave in to Kazakhisation and dropped down to a minority of 18% is beyond me.  Estonia and Latvia - Russians made up 1/3 of population in those tiny countries, part of which was territorially grouped (and in Estonia's case, linked with Russian border) yet they allowed all the de-russification policies since then, instead of becoming important factors in those countries.

The Baltic states used to be a Russian stronghold full of military gear and the tip of the Russian nuclear spear, now they are in nato hands and are the tip of the nato nuclear spear. NATO is still expanding with the latest countries joining in 2017 / 2020 and with every new country added Russia gets weaker while nato gets stronger and stronger. Everything that Russia has worked for, all of its conquered territories, all of its military gains, its grip over eastern Europe, its carefully crafted security sphere, all of it lies in ruins. With all of this in mind HOW IN THE HECK DID RUSSIA NOT LOSE THE COLD WAR?   Dont listen to me listen to Putin. Even he says that everything Russia had worked so hard to achieve has been lost.

14mytb	Putin has brought every Russian region under his control with almost all of the presidents of the republics belonging to Putin's "United Russia" party....all apart from the Chechen Republic, an outpost of radical Islam in the middle of Putin’s Russia, why? ill break it all down for you.  So if we look to history then Russia had a huge problem with Chechnya in terms of terrorism all over Russia. Yeltsin could not handle it so Putin came in and offered Akhmad Kadyrov the then head of the republic a deal, Putin showers him in money, weapons, gold, power plus lets him rule Chechnya as he sees fit as his own personal kingdom in exchange for no more wars and no more terrorism or separatism, Akhmad agrees and used the money and weapons provided by the kremlin to smash all other Chechen warlords who were still organizing terrorist attacks on Russia. Things went well until Akhmad Kadyrov was killed, he was then replaced by his son Ramzan Kadyrov.  Under Ramzans control almost all of the Chechen terrorists vanished in Russia. Ramzan then organized a military parade at Grozny football stadium with tanks, bombs and 6000 Chechen troops supposedly according to him "as a show of loyalty to Putin" but in reality this parade served a duel message, it said "My troops are at your command best friend" but it also said "Hey Putin, if you ever stop being my best friend then come and get me if you dare".  On top of that enemies of the Chechen regime disappear no matter who they are and no matter where they are in Russia from journalists living in Moscow to political opponents hiding in St Petersburg all of his opponents have been killed, again no matter where they are in Russia. This means that Kadyrov has his own personal KGB situated all across the entire country that can be activated at any moment further deterring Putin from touching him or his kingdom and keeping the money from the Kremlin flowing in (90 percent of the Chechen budget comes directly from the Kremlins coffers).  Any serious attempt to challenge Ramzan Kadyrov’s position will lead to a third war only this time the Chechens have far more money and firepower provided by Russia itself. Putin created Ramzan Kadyrov and now his creation has grown big enough to look him in the eye.  I hope this has helped you understand why Putin fears the Chechen leader, why he cannot touch him and why the Kremlin pretends that it doesn't see the gay concentration camps and child marriages in Chechnya.

3mdheb9y	For a very long time, I didn't understand all this nonsense about Russia's alleged attack on Ukraine. But now everything has become obvious. Ukraine is preparing for an attack on Donetsk and Lugansk. And so that it does not work out as in Georgia 08.08.08, the information ground is being prepared to intimidate Russia. After all, if Russia starts defending the DPR, then the whole world will scream - that's it, Russia has treacherously attacked Ukraine. They're trying to tie Russian hands. The Olympiad has already begun. The President of Ukraine has already salted and peppered his tie, just in case.
