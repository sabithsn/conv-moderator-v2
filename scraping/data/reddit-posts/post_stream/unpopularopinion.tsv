oaby1vd	Spoilers for Dinsey Pixar's: the Incredibles.  &#x200B;  Early on in the movie, Bob (Mr. Incredible) saves a man who had comitted suicide by throwing himself off a building. Said man then sues Bob on the grounds that he "didn't want to be saved" and this would be the domino who's knock on effect would cause super heroes to become outcasts. While i'm aware this is a kid's movie and that this serves as a means to get the plot rolling, this has bothered me for as long as I was old enough to grasp the situation.  Was Bob suppose to let the man die? Any form of suicide is awful, but that one especially due to not only the clean up needed, but the emotional scarring it can have on passerby. Really think about this: the guy didn't sue Mr. Incredbile for breaking his bones or property damage, he did it because (and I quote) he "ruined \[his\] death!"  Bob's powers include super strength; he can't fly and so put his life as risk to leap over and save the man. But no, "supers" are menaces that needs to be abolished! Ok, lets look at what Mr.Incredible did earlier that same day:  * Stopped a bank robbery * Helped an old lady get her cat down from a tree * with the help of elastigirl, stops an armed mugger * Attempts to stop super villain: Bomb Voyage (Super villains exist btw) and is only unable to do so because he- * STOPS A CHILD FROM BEING BOMBED!  And he's being judged by both the court and the court of public opinion for saving a man from ending his own life? Also, while we're on the subject: Mr. incredible was sued by the people of the train he attempted to save. Nah you're right; he should have done nothing, let it carine off the bridge as i'm sure that would have ended WAY better.  &#x200B;  Also, Mr. Incredible and his family save the town of people who to this day see people like him and his family as outsiders.  &#x200B;  Like if you want to hold said supers more accountable, sure. But to abolish arguably one of the greatest assets the city has over criminals and SUPER-VILLAINS: people who have significant power over the populis and chose to use it for good because elements out of their control ended negatively is baffling.	1642773819.0	s9bfv4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bfv4/mr_incredible_did_nothing_wrong/	Mr Incredible did nothing wrong.

bmmha634	Food banks bad, Food PANTRIES good. As a certified poor person with lots of hungry teens to feed, everyone is all like, “Go to the food bank.” But the quality of the food is horrible.   Food banks advertise that they can produce a certain number of pounds of food per dollar donated, but at what cost? My dog won’t even eat the meat product (think far worse than Spam), and he’s not picky. A very minor food allergy in the home means that 3/4 of us can not eat 3/4 of the food. I give it away, of course, or make for guests, or just feed it to that one hardy soul, but I feel bad for “being choosy”, even though it is necessary.   Food pantries, on the other hand, give out actual produce, which is the most expensive thing to buy, and the most important for health. That is something that helps, a lot. I don’t mind picking out the bad apples or freezing something so that it won’t go bad before I can use it. And the other food items at the pantry are actual food, for people, not “food flavored product” that was produced as cheaply as possible, and is not actually edible or nutritious or even safe for most of us.	1642774632.0	s9bpwa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bpwa/food_banks_are_bad/	Food Banks are bad

However not all psychopaths are serial killers, they are not all like Ted Bundy, or what the movies portray them to be. Many of them claim to not be interested in violence and their actions match that statement.   Many of them due to their stunted emotional range are well suited for jobs that would deplete a typical person, such as a soldier, homicide detective, or surgeon.   And I don’t know about you but if I was having brain surgery I would want someone who would not be perturbed by their emotions if something goes wrong during the procedure. I would want someone who would be calm, collected, and focused on the task at hand instead of panicked and overwhelmed by emotions that distract them from focusing on how to keep me alive.	1642775703.0	s9c3t2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3t2/psychopaths_play_an_important_role_in_society/	Psychopaths play an important role in society.
1tx512p2	To be clear, I don’t think that a 70-180 minute movie isn’t a good length, or that stories can’t be told in that time. If anything, the constrictions of the medium often has made the story better because things need to be edited out and contained in a self enclosed context. So the length of movies we’ve become accustomed to is by no means super flawed or something that needs to change.   However, as the stories artists try to tell become bigger, more complicated, with wider casts of interconnected characters and plot lines, especially ones based on ridiculously expansive material such as comic book movies, that time frame just doesn’t work anymore. Although mini-series don’t bring in the revenue of movies, and don’t have nearly the industry to be build upon, if movie-quality time and effort were put into them, there would be more stories available for telling and worlds available for building.   I don’t think this will change because the film industry is pretty cemented, but even stuff like filming several movies simultaneously to make sequels more cohesive and releasing them separately seems like a step towards a new kind of media, in between tv shows and movies	1642775711.0	s9c3xa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3xa/movies_are_too_short_to_tell_the_stories_people/	Movies are too short to tell the stories people want to see these days
2bjcunu0	 I posted something like this on [r/movies](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/) a while ago and was met with stiff disagreement. That was before I knew this sub existed.  I feel the premise of people taking out their frustrations of the world by meeting up at midnight to beat the shit out of each other pathetic and cringey. Society is flawed and consumerist/capitalist attitude is poisoning the planet and people's brains. Anyone can see that and a lot of us end up working dead end jobs we don't like so we end up buying stuff we don't need in order to feel better in our lives.  That cycle is real and I have experienced it. I get the sentiment. It's the "the world is against me" attitude which the film seems to promote which is find not only disagreeable but damaging.   Anyway, I know A LOT of people love this movie, and there's many different interpretations of it. I actually think Ed Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are all excellent (and Meat Loaf RIP).

2akz56e	It's absurd that YouTubers and TikTokers monetize trash content aimed at kids which encourages them to go out and destroy things, like school bathrooms, city property, etc. Not only should content creators not be able to make money off these posts, local governments should fine these content creators as a disincentive, and potentially pursue criminal charges for especially dangerous content.   The other day I was out for a walk and I saw a boy (around 10 years old) bashing his scooter against a public trash can, hard enough to dislodge it from where it had been hung. He was unattended, but with a group of peers, and as I got closer he did it a second time, so I asked him why on earth he'd do that. The kid was actually very polite and told me it was a challenge from his favorite YouTuber, and how funny that person is, blah blah blah. I told him that person makes money off of those videos, but when he repeats those actions, all he gets is a broken scooter, while destroying something meant to keep our city clean. I doubt what I said had much of an impact, but it's really frustrating that what seems like a nice little kid can be influenced into such destructive behavior, because these videos are so prevalent, which normalizes this kind of thing.

e2hhsmf7	Pop artist are products organized by category and rotated periodically to cover the range of demographics ages 2-72 and it’s even got gender categories. Some are more memorable than others and although music can reach you in many more ways than the local record store and originate from legitimately gifted folks’ living rooms these days much of it holds true IMO. They throw knockoffs at us and some of the lazy/formula-missing efforts are hilarious and repulsive.  Ex.  Take what your local rock/alternative station threw at us in the 90’s - even commercial one’s that were genuinely trying to bring real alternative options to the airwaves. WFNX in Boston comes to mind.   So hear me out. Epic had Pearl Jam’s Ten so Atlantic had to have one of those new things over there and scrounged up STP and it went downhill from there. Interscope sharted out Bush with a handsome front man who’s forced, gravel-voiced utterings and intentionally odd/unrelated sentence fragments for lyrics under the guise of a beautiful tortured artist brought us to the basement of the hierarchy of the 90’s house of mainstream rock just what, 4 years in?   However if Bush was a shart in the basement then Geffen actually China Syndromed the foundation a hundred feet deep and released a hundred foot long, open-air shit in it with Counting Crows by openly antagonizing the listener - I Am The Rain King - He screamed! Yes outright SCREAMED at the listener!  Ahem the record company has informed me that my character is to be thought of as a poet. So I will insist the listener now call me a name oh-so similar to, you guessed it, an overrated try hard from days of yore!The Lizard King. Reselling a warmed over and ham-handedly, thrown together Tupperware version of an overrated yet memorable persona should be subtle not screamed. Geffen even got the formula wrong by sanding any suggestion of edge off the music and inserted some of the most contrived, Fisher-Price lyrics and imagery since the monkees.   Pick your product - you want shocking females? Let’s start off dunno 70’s? Patti Smith’s barely tempered madness becomes Maddona flopping around on the floor becomes Liz Phair’s lyrics on Exile in Guyland becomes Lil Kim’s whole persona becomes Nikki Minaj and her troop of current Kim clones. Just trot new versions out every 7-10 years or so and catch the next wave of consumers passin on by thru their demographic. It’s all so formulaic.   Sporadically there are exceptions - some spectacular, genuine and authentic. RUN/DMC/J  kicked a door open that had been created by hyper-talented predecessors just a few years ahead of their time but too far ahead for the mainstream. DMC cemented an entire genre’s permanence - that is big dickin on a categorical scale.   Yet I fall for it. Yes, I love my Tool and my Smiths, Public Enemy, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Cash, Elliot Smith and Rakim so to me I’m actually enjoying creative and talented people’s creations. However when now one’s around? Marc Anthony’s Need To Know comes on? I rip at that fucking volume knob tryin to get to 10 before the baseline hits Lol.   Ever get the feeling you been cheated?

1od8mybd	Most of the fan content I see for Star Wars is directly related to the prequels or to the extended Universe in general which shows that more hardcore fans engage with the content more. Yes I will acknowledge there are problems to the prequels, but way too many people have Nostalgia goggles whenever they make these critiques about the prequels and the original trilogy. Both of them have awkward dialogue at times especially in their Premiere movies. The people who complain about there being too much dialogue can never recite what's being said in the dialogue, name a scene and I can justify why the dialogue in that scene is necessary.

"Hey I work hard, there's nothing wrong if I enjoy a cocktail from time to time."  That's the very first sentence used in the very first step to a slippery slope that destroys businesses and lives.  However, every other person in the world thinks owning a bar would be the greatest thing ever. "It wouldn't even be work. I would love it so much".  Then reality sets in and they have to work.

8d0oxa1c	I’ve been a professional oldest sister for 25 years now and I just have to say. The amount of oldest siblings/oldest children I see saying essentially the equivalent of they don’t want any part in helping with their younger siblings is baffling to me. I helped raise my siblings especially as I got older and became an adult myself and it just wasn’t that bad, I’m not saying it should go so far as raising your siblings but if your parents need your help stop being little assholes and just help them without complaining about it. It’s really going to be okay if you watch them for a few hours while your parents do things they need to do, it’s just not that big of a deal if you have to make a few meals in your life for your siblings, or if you have to drive them to school. They will bitch about helping their siblings in any capacity and then wonder why their siblings want nothing to do with them later on.  And to clarify I’m not saying you should be doing the parenting of your siblings but helping should not be as big of an issue as it’s become for older siblings, you’re parents don’t have to pay you, your parents don’t have to go to extra lengths to get your help it’s just selfish. You should not be cooking every meal every single day, you shouldn’t be caring for them while your parents lay around, and if they’re going on dates and things you should be paid but if they ask you to watch them for 2-3 hours while they grocery shop is it really going to kill you?	1642780299.0	s9dsd5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9dsd5/you_have_a_responsibility_to_help_as_the_oldest/	You have a responsibility to help as the oldest sibling

3551d6xv	Don’t get me wrong, I know money isn’t everything, but a huge part of everyone’s life is controlled by money, and how much of it we have and are able to spend. The mentality that a job you love which pays significantly less than a job you hate, is better than living an unhappy work life, sounds illogical imo. Yes, your quality of life matters and you should be able to enjoy your work life to some extent, but this doesn’t mean you should sacrifice the potential to live a financially stable life. In the long run, if you worked the high-paying boring job, you’d have more than enough money to live off and from there it probably would be fine to leave the job and pursue your own interests, but going straight for a low-paying dream job that won’t cover all your expenses, seems foolish.	1642780983.0	s9e1o0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e1o0/having_a_job_you_hate_but_you_earn_a_gooddecent/	Having a job you hate, but you earn a good/decent living from it, is better than having your dream job and not making enough money to live at all
3qkq70lu	Before I start, I want to point out this isn't advice.  I'm so happy I never got to ask her out. Of course, there was still the pain of realizing she was taken, but I missed out on the fun of social activities because I was so focused on her. When I was with friends, my mind constantly shifted to her. I did well in school, but I feel like I could have done even better if I never had a crush. Even if I asked her out, the distractions would still be there. If I got rejected, I would be distracted by the heartbreak; I was not a good sport when it came to being comforted.  Another reason why I am so happy is that it helped me develop new insight into how the dynamics of a relationship work. My crush and I had many things different from each other, but I was only in love because I "felt" it. I loved affection, but that doesn't tell a lot when it comes to the actual character. Now that the high school years are behind me, I can say for certain that I can reenter the dating world with a new perspective on how a relationship is supposed to work.  Everyone says that having a crush feels awesome, and adults regret not asking out. The latter is exactly what I mean when I say having a crush is painful. The confusion, the fear of rejection, and the disappointment from those whose relationships didn't work out. If you married your high school sweetheart, awesome. I'm saying that having a crush shouldn't be as glorified as it is, and it should be more widely accepted to stifle these feelings if one wishes to do so.	1642781142.0	s9e3qf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e3qf/the_feeling_of_having_a_crush_is_so_painful_and_i/	The feeling of having a crush is so painful, and I wish I never had one in high school.
wikv3	I’ve been downvoted to hell for this in comments but like a Bat out of Hell, I return with this take.  I find American Pie to be the most annoying, whiny, self gratifying waste of 8 whole minutes of radio airplay. It’s one of the only songs I’ve ever heard that never once grew on me.

hpjuozsf	Not only are they intellectually inferior to those that don’t, they are also lacking in self-value. Worshipping others that are rich or famous infers that you believe they are superior and you yourself are inferior to them; otherwise, why would you be worshipping them?   Often, these people know more about a random actor than their own immediate family members. It’s sick and weird to care that much about people that don’t know you exist and you’ll never spend time with.  Furthermore, thinking you know anything about any of these people is proof of stupidity. “He is so kind and smart.” And how could you possibly know? You watch a few interviews and hear gossip at the office based upon an article in a magazine? Just stop lol.  EDIT: If you only plan on replying to state that I am an asshole or equally stupid for being judgmental, don’t bother. I am aware. I also don’t think I am smart, so you don’t need to mention that either. I barely graduated Highschool, never took the SATs, and have never taken an IQ test.

7ha5i8u4	So this weird ass opinion clicked into my head about a week ago. I remember all my life hearing stories from friends family and on the internet about how shitty it is getting you car broken into it’s scary it sucks you lose all your valuables etc….. then it happened me last week.     So maybe I’m weird but once it happened I realized oh wait nothing happened I literally have nothing to steal in the car then I realized “who is keeping valuables in their car and what are they”? I have heard of stereo systems getting stolen but I’ve also never met anyone with one of those.     Getting you car stolen sucks getting it broken into? Kinda not a big deal. I had a lighter and a disposable vape taken. Obviously still a pretty uncool thing for whoever did it and not a fun thing to wake up to. But it really isn’t as a big of deal as people made it sound.     Obviously I sound crazy and let me be clear still a crime and still not cool.

bihfx1bz	Just hear me out. I know it’s not actually but there are many similarities. Parents are actually kids that have been “murdered” by society and responsibility. Because they now miss the fun, they try to get revenge by making their kids get the same way like how the animatronics stuff the night guards in the suits to be like them. We as kids try to hide from them because we don’t agree with them, don’t want our “life” to be murdered. The parents “killer” are life problems(the way school is made, social norms, etc. They were forced to be a certain way and now learned to do the same with the kids(“programed”). Like when the ghosts of the kids confronted the killer, some parents try to confront these problems . For a while, it is changed, but after those parents are gone, it comes back, like when Afton says “I always come back”. In security breach, we have an ally, Freddy, who I think could be a family friend of some sort, like an uncle, aunt, cousin? They try to help us as kids be different from our parents and fix the problems once again.

oaby1vd	Spoilers for Dinsey Pixar's: the Incredibles.  &#x200B;  Early on in the movie, Bob (Mr. Incredible) saves a man who had comitted suicide by throwing himself off a building. Said man then sues Bob on the grounds that he "didn't want to be saved" and this would be the domino who's knock on effect would cause super heroes to become outcasts. While i'm aware this is a kid's movie and that this serves as a means to get the plot rolling, this has bothered me for as long as I was old enough to grasp the situation.  Was Bob suppose to let the man die? Any form of suicide is awful, but that one especially due to not only the clean up needed, but the emotional scarring it can have on passerby. Really think about this: the guy didn't sue Mr. Incredbile for breaking his bones or property damage, he did it because (and I quote) he "ruined \[his\] death!"  Bob's powers include super strength; he can't fly and so put his life as risk to leap over and save the man. But no, "supers" are menaces that needs to be abolished! Ok, lets look at what Mr.Incredible did earlier that same day:  * Stopped a bank robbery * Helped an old lady get her cat down from a tree * with the help of elastigirl, stops an armed mugger * Attempts to stop super villain: Bomb Voyage (Super villains exist btw) and is only unable to do so because he- * STOPS A CHILD FROM BEING BOMBED!  And he's being judged by both the court and the court of public opinion for saving a man from ending his own life? Also, while we're on the subject: Mr. incredible was sued by the people of the train he attempted to save. Nah you're right; he should have done nothing, let it carine off the bridge as i'm sure that would have ended WAY better.  &#x200B;  Also, Mr. Incredible and his family save the town of people who to this day see people like him and his family as outsiders.  &#x200B;  Like if you want to hold said supers more accountable, sure. But to abolish arguably one of the greatest assets the city has over criminals and SUPER-VILLAINS: people who have significant power over the populis and chose to use it for good because elements out of their control ended negatively is baffling.	1642773819.0	s9bfv4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bfv4/mr_incredible_did_nothing_wrong/	Mr Incredible did nothing wrong.

bmmha634	Food banks bad, Food PANTRIES good. As a certified poor person with lots of hungry teens to feed, everyone is all like, “Go to the food bank.” But the quality of the food is horrible.   Food banks advertise that they can produce a certain number of pounds of food per dollar donated, but at what cost? My dog won’t even eat the meat product (think far worse than Spam), and he’s not picky. A very minor food allergy in the home means that 3/4 of us can not eat 3/4 of the food. I give it away, of course, or make for guests, or just feed it to that one hardy soul, but I feel bad for “being choosy”, even though it is necessary.   Food pantries, on the other hand, give out actual produce, which is the most expensive thing to buy, and the most important for health. That is something that helps, a lot. I don’t mind picking out the bad apples or freezing something so that it won’t go bad before I can use it. And the other food items at the pantry are actual food, for people, not “food flavored product” that was produced as cheaply as possible, and is not actually edible or nutritious or even safe for most of us.	1642774632.0	s9bpwa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bpwa/food_banks_are_bad/	Food Banks are bad

However not all psychopaths are serial killers, they are not all like Ted Bundy, or what the movies portray them to be. Many of them claim to not be interested in violence and their actions match that statement.   Many of them due to their stunted emotional range are well suited for jobs that would deplete a typical person, such as a soldier, homicide detective, or surgeon.   And I don’t know about you but if I was having brain surgery I would want someone who would not be perturbed by their emotions if something goes wrong during the procedure.

1tx512p2	To be clear, I don’t think that a 70-180 minute movie isn’t a good length, or that stories can’t be told in that time. If anything, the constrictions of the medium often has made the story better because things need to be edited out and contained in a self enclosed context. So the length of movies we’ve become accustomed to is by no means super flawed or something that needs to change.   However, as the stories artists try to tell become bigger, more complicated, with wider casts of interconnected characters and plot lines, especially ones based on ridiculously expansive material such as comic book movies, that time frame just doesn’t work anymore. Although mini-series don’t bring in the revenue of movies, and don’t have nearly the industry to be build upon, if movie-quality time and effort were put into them, there would be more stories available for telling and worlds available for building.   I don’t think this will change because the film industry is pretty cemented, but even stuff like filming several movies simultaneously to make sequels more cohesive and releasing them separately seems like a step towards a new kind of media, in between tv shows and movies	1642775711.0	s9c3xa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3xa/movies_are_too_short_to_tell_the_stories_people/	Movies are too short to tell the stories people want to see these days

2akz56e	It's absurd that YouTubers and TikTokers monetize trash content aimed at kids which encourages them to go out and destroy things, like school bathrooms, city property, etc. Not only should content creators not be able to make money off these posts, local governments should fine these content creators as a disincentive, and potentially pursue criminal charges for especially dangerous content.   The other day I was out for a walk and I saw a boy (around 10 years old) bashing his scooter against a public trash can, hard enough to dislodge it from where it had been hung. He was unattended, but with a group of peers, and as I got closer he did it a second time, so I asked him why on earth he'd do that. The kid was actually very polite and told me it was a challenge from his favorite YouTuber, and how funny that person is, blah blah blah. I told him that person makes money off of those videos, but when he repeats those actions, all he gets is a broken scooter, while destroying something meant to keep our city clean. I doubt what I said had much of an impact, but it's really frustrating that what seems like a nice little kid can be influenced into such destructive behavior, because these videos are so prevalent, which normalizes this kind of thing.

e2hhsmf7	Pop artist are products organized by category and rotated periodically to cover the range of demographics ages 2-72 and it’s even got gender categories. Some are more memorable than others and although music can reach you in many more ways than the local record store and originate from legitimately gifted folks’ living rooms these days much of it holds true IMO. They throw knockoffs at us and some of the lazy/formula-missing efforts are hilarious and repulsive.  Ex.  Take what your local rock/alternative station threw at us in the 90’s - even commercial one’s that were genuinely trying to bring real alternative options to the airwaves. WFNX in Boston comes to mind.   So hear me out. Epic had Pearl Jam’s Ten so Atlantic had to have one of those new things over there and scrounged up STP and it went downhill from there. Interscope sharted out Bush with a handsome front man who’s forced, gravel-voiced utterings and intentionally odd/unrelated sentence fragments for lyrics under the guise of a beautiful tortured artist brought us to the basement of the hierarchy of the 90’s house of mainstream rock just what, 4 years in?   However if Bush was a shart in the basement then Geffen actually China Syndromed the foundation a hundred feet deep and released a hundred foot long, open-air shit in it with Counting Crows by openly antagonizing the listener - I Am The Rain King - He screamed! Yes outright SCREAMED at the listener!  Ahem the record company has informed me that my character is to be thought of as a poet. So I will insist the listener now call me a name oh-so similar to, you guessed it, an overrated try hard from days of yore!The Lizard King. Reselling a warmed over and ham-handedly, thrown together Tupperware version of an overrated yet memorable persona should be subtle not screamed. Geffen even got the formula wrong by sanding any suggestion of edge off the music and inserted some of the most contrived, Fisher-Price lyrics and imagery since the monkees.   Pick your product - you want shocking females? Let’s start off dunno 70’s? Patti Smith’s barely tempered madness becomes Maddona flopping around on the floor becomes Liz Phair’s lyrics on Exile in Guyland becomes Lil Kim’s whole persona becomes Nikki Minaj and her troop of current Kim clones. Just trot new versions out every 7-10 years or so and catch the next wave of consumers passin on by thru their demographic. It’s all so formulaic.   Sporadically there are exceptions - some spectacular, genuine and authentic. RUN/DMC/J  kicked a door open that had been created by hyper-talented predecessors just a few years ahead of their time but too far ahead for the mainstream.

Yes I will acknowledge there are problems to the prequels, but way too many people have Nostalgia goggles whenever they make these critiques about the prequels and the original trilogy. Both of them have awkward dialogue at times especially in their Premiere movies. The people who complain about there being too much dialogue can never recite what's being said in the dialogue, name a scene and I can justify why the dialogue in that scene is necessary.

"Hey I work hard, there's nothing wrong if I enjoy a cocktail from time to time."  That's the very first sentence used in the very first step to a slippery slope that destroys businesses and lives.  However, every other person in the world thinks owning a bar would be the greatest thing ever. "It wouldn't even be work. I would love it so much".  Then reality sets in and they have to work. But sitting around bullshitting and drinking is better and far easier.  So depressing how many people think alcohol is manna from heaven. When it really is just a potion that makes people act like childish idiots who enjoy humiliating themselves and arguing over things they know nothing about, loudly.	1642778298.0	s9d1k0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9d1k0/people_who_own_bars_or_taverns_should_not_drink/	People who own bars or taverns should NOT DRINK

8d0oxa1c	I’ve been a professional oldest sister for 25 years now and I just have to say. The amount of oldest siblings/oldest children I see saying essentially the equivalent of they don’t want any part in helping with their younger siblings is baffling to me. I helped raise my siblings especially as I got older and became an adult myself and it just wasn’t that bad, I’m not saying it should go so far as raising your siblings but if your parents need your help stop being little assholes and just help them without complaining about it. It’s really going to be okay if you watch them for a few hours while your parents do things they need to do, it’s just not that big of a deal if you have to make a few meals in your life for your siblings, or if you have to drive them to school. They will bitch about helping their siblings in any capacity and then wonder why their siblings want nothing to do with them later on.  And to clarify I’m not saying you should be doing the parenting of your siblings but helping should not be as big of an issue as it’s become for older siblings, you’re parents don’t have to pay you, your parents don’t have to go to extra lengths to get your help it’s just selfish. You should not be cooking every meal every single day, you shouldn’t be caring for them while your parents lay around, and if they’re going on dates and things you should be paid but if they ask you to watch them for 2-3 hours while they grocery shop is it really going to kill you?	1642780299.0	s9dsd5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9dsd5/you_have_a_responsibility_to_help_as_the_oldest/	You have a responsibility to help as the oldest sibling

3551d6xv	Don’t get me wrong, I know money isn’t everything, but a huge part of everyone’s life is controlled by money, and how much of it we have and are able to spend. The mentality that a job you love which pays significantly less than a job you hate, is better than living an unhappy work life, sounds illogical imo. Yes, your quality of life matters and you should be able to enjoy your work life to some extent, but this doesn’t mean you should sacrifice the potential to live a financially stable life. In the long run, if you worked the high-paying boring job, you’d have more than enough money to live off and from there it probably would be fine to leave the job and pursue your own interests, but going straight for a low-paying dream job that won’t cover all your expenses, seems foolish.	1642780983.0	s9e1o0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e1o0/having_a_job_you_hate_but_you_earn_a_gooddecent/	Having a job you hate, but you earn a good/decent living from it, is better than having your dream job and not making enough money to live at all
3qkq70lu	Before I start, I want to point out this isn't advice.  I'm so happy I never got to ask her out. Of course, there was still the pain of realizing she was taken, but I missed out on the fun of social activities because I was so focused on her. When I was with friends, my mind constantly shifted to her. I did well in school, but I feel like I could have done even better if I never had a crush. Even if I asked her out, the distractions would still be there. If I got rejected, I would be distracted by the heartbreak; I was not a good sport when it came to being comforted.  Another reason why I am so happy is that it helped me develop new insight into how the dynamics of a relationship work. My crush and I had many things different from each other, but I was only in love because I "felt" it. I loved affection, but that doesn't tell a lot when it comes to the actual character. Now that the high school years are behind me, I can say for certain that I can reenter the dating world with a new perspective on how a relationship is supposed to work.  Everyone says that having a crush feels awesome, and adults regret not asking out. The latter is exactly what I mean when I say having a crush is painful. The confusion, the fear of rejection, and the disappointment from those whose relationships didn't work out. If you married your high school sweetheart, awesome. I'm saying that having a crush shouldn't be as glorified as it is, and it should be more widely accepted to stifle these feelings if one wishes to do so.	1642781142.0	s9e3qf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e3qf/the_feeling_of_having_a_crush_is_so_painful_and_i/	The feeling of having a crush is so painful, and I wish I never had one in high school.
wikv3	I’ve been downvoted to hell for this in comments but like a Bat out of Hell, I return with this take.  I find American Pie to be the most annoying, whiny, self gratifying waste of 8 whole minutes of radio airplay. It’s one of the only songs I’ve ever heard that never once grew on me.   If radios really want to play 8-12 minutes of one song, then they should just play any of Meat Loaf’s epics (I’d do anything for love, Paradise by the dashboard lights).

hpjuozsf	Not only are they intellectually inferior to those that don’t, they are also lacking in self-value. Worshipping others that are rich or famous infers that you believe they are superior and you yourself are inferior to them; otherwise, why would you be worshipping them?   Often, these people know more about a random actor than their own immediate family members. It’s sick and weird to care that much about people that don’t know you exist and you’ll never spend time with.  Furthermore, thinking you know anything about any of these people is proof of stupidity. “He is so kind and smart.” And how could you possibly know? You watch a few interviews and hear gossip at the office based upon an article in a magazine? Just stop lol.  EDIT: If you only plan on replying to state that I am an asshole or equally stupid for being judgmental, don’t bother. I am aware.

7ha5i8u4	So this weird ass opinion clicked into my head about a week ago. I remember all my life hearing stories from friends family and on the internet about how shitty it is getting you car broken into it’s scary it sucks you lose all your valuables etc….. then it happened me last week.     So maybe I’m weird but once it happened I realized oh wait nothing happened I literally have nothing to steal in the car then I realized “who is keeping valuables in their car and what are they”? I have heard of stereo systems getting stolen but I’ve also never met anyone with one of those.     Getting you car stolen sucks getting it broken into? Kinda not a big deal. I had a lighter and a disposable vape taken. Obviously still a pretty uncool thing for whoever did it and not a fun thing to wake up to.

4zh37eb	Activision Blizzard's CEO is Robert Kotick. Robert Kotick was an (alleged) associate of Jeffery Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender who ran a pedophile ring on his private island. Robert Kotick's name is on Epstein's black book. It should come as no surprise then that Activision Blizzard has a very toxic work culture. Notable examples of Activision Blizzard's abusive culture includes low pay starting at $12 an hour, long crunch periods of having to work at least 10 hours a day for seven days with no overtime pay and turning a blind eye to constant sexual harassment such as one individual who signed all his emails with "1-800-ALLCOCK".   Even with the toxic work culture aside (or maybe because of?), Activision Blizzard's major franchises have been waning over the years. Call of Duty's latest title was down 36% in the UK and it seemed that sales were on the decline for years. Meanwhile, world of warcraft's popularity has also been declining as well with the latest expansion "shadowlands" been described as polarizing by many players. Warcraft III reforged and diablo 2 resurrected has also been negatively received due to false promises, poor design choices, with Warcraft having a hostile user agreement and diablo having major technical problems for online multiplayer.   Microsoft has the ability to purge the horrible work culture, revitalize call of duty and world of warcraft, bring back many of Activision Blizzard's older franchises and continue to expand xbox gamepass. Call of duty doesn't need to have annual releases and can become relevant again. Microsoft can bring in fresh blood for world of warcraft's development teams and reinvigorate the community. Toys for Bob (owned by Activision Blizzard) can work on other Microsoft owned properties like commander keen or even something original. Obsidian entertainment (owned by Microsoft) could work on a starcraft or warcraft rpg.  So for Sony and Playstation owners, they benefit from this too. It's high time that Playstation be given true competition. The ps1/2/4 have dominated their respective generations. Every generation, Sony has received timed/full exclusives with the ps2/4 in particular steamrolling the competition. Sony will need step up to compete with Microsoft. Make new franchises, develop their version of gamepass, introduce new console features to stay relevant.	1642784674.0	s9fggv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9fggv/microsoft_buying_activision_blizzard_was_the_best/	Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard was the best thing that could happen for game developers and gamers (even ps4/5 owners)

4judsaf9	I mostly play team based games like Dota 2, where disconnecting is punishable.  I understand some people play video games for fun after a day full of hard work, with their friends, just to chill and enjoy life. But for some of us, it's about someone winning and someone losing. I have been on the receiving end of complete mental breakdown and I have been on the giving end as well.  It feels good to make your enemy rage, to make them react like an animal, to make them cry. But he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword and I understand how stupid and cringy I look when I trash talk the enemy and then they snatch the win. It sucks, but I can live with that. It's part of the game.  What I can't live with is that in some games talking trash is more publishable than playing bad (maybe even deliberately). Like "we want this community to be a safe space for everybody and trash talkers are the worst of all people" (Overwatch), but I have to endure people who don't even try or throw tantrums at first glance of trouble and ruin the game for their entire team if they don't get what they want.   If I play well but talk crap, I don't ruin the game for my team. What's worse, I never talk crap at my teammates, that just diminishes my chances of winning.   It doesn't make sense to me that you can report people for it, I never did it. If you are a "grown adult" and don't give a flying fuck about what some "9yo edgy kid" has to say, why do you have to to tell everyone that you don't care what some "9yo edgy kid" just said and how you will report that "9yo edgy kid"? What do you want, for people to say "thank you for being a contributing member of the society"? Doesn't that prove that you all care?  You can already mute me, why do you need the option to cry about it to the company like a little brother that just got his ass handed to him and has no other option but to run to his mom? When I'm not in the mood to react I just watch people shit talking me or each other and it only makes the game more entertaining and memorable.	1642785240.0	s9fobp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9fobp/trash_talking_your_enemy_in_video_games_is_fun/	Trash talking your enemy in video games is fun

5uln56y8	I'm not sure why there is this obsession (in the US at least) to have to think of some original gift idea for all the loved ones in your life as if getting them exactly what they ask for is a cheap shortcut. Because even if you know someone really well, it's incredibly difficult to pick out a gift for them year after year.   If it's normal to have registries for weddings, it should be normal for birthdays, Christmas, etc. It's such a waste to always be receiving items that most likely you will not like or not use and then have to donate/return, or worse, keep because of guilt. I'm not saying picking an item off of someone's registry should be mandatory but it should at least be an option because no one knows you better than yourself.  Edit: saying people should be "allowed to" was the wrong terminology. What I meant is that it should be socially acceptable to do so. Of course anyone is technically allowed to make themselves a registry, but I have never seen or heard of anyone actually doing this in practice. It is definitely not common and not socially acceptable in most circles.

And they get violent, throwing tantrums when they are finally asked to move out.   Sometimes the back story is that the parents spoiled them since they were little and they never learned to function like an adult.   Parenting is essentially preparing kids ready to get out on their own and make their own living. Well the parents never taught them how to do that by spoiling them, not setting boundaries, tec. Children cannot be a proper adult without their own. I understand that thete are other circumstances and what I want to point out is cases like the ones I mentioned.

8cvjbz4m	I guess I'll start with a little anecdote. I've noticed a big group of my peers (stereotypical alt style kids) have began to indulge in a 'hobby' (I guess) of consuming a lot of monster energy. In their social media they flaunt walls they've made in their rooms simply of empty cans and together they're always guzzling it. Many of their drinks are confiscated in school because they seemingly always require one to be in reaching distance of themselves.  Now, why did I mention that they're 'steroetypically alt kids'? Well, on TikTok, other people in the alt scene are also heavily consuming monster on their pages. I look under the 'MonsterEnergy' tag and see a legion of these people drinking them almost religiously. I'm assuming its caught on because its seen as cool or 'different' to be an avid consumer of these drinks...but honestly, I think it shows how unoriginal and ignorant these people are.  You don't look cool or edgy for sucking every last drop of caffeine out of a monster can, you look like a fucking spice addict. And let's face it, that's what half of these people are - addicts. They use monster because they've made themselves dependant on the caffeine and mostly because their friends were doing it or people online were. And no, its not some issue to be blown over - having 4 of the buggers per night is a kidney stone waiting to happen - and that's if you're lucky. Killing your liver over this energy-inducing piss is not worth it.  These people just ignorantly consume, consume, consume; they gloss over the fact that they literally cannot go a day having not had one without having withdrawal symptoms. It's not a funny joke to say you get the shakes if you don't keep drinking them - it's your body telling you that "hey, I have become reliant on this fizzy drug juice, and if you don't give me more I'll begin to shut down!"  It's like we've normalised casually snorting cocaine out of a can and it's utterly, utterly stupid.	1642789012.0	s9h4fq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9h4fq/people_who_binge_drink_monster_energy_arent/	People who binge drink monster energy aren't quirky or 'alternative', they need help.
gtih2	When someone posts a selfie and all their friends shower them in over-the-top compliments, I feel second-hand embarrassment at them and I hate it when people do the same to me.  I know it comes from a good place and I'm sure some people need the validation, but to me, it's just so ridiculous. I just can't ignore the fact that people cannot possibly mean all the nice things they say. No, I'm not a superstar--I'm just a mediocre guy, and you know what? It's okay. I really don't need the compliments--I've made my piece, and reading obviously fake compliments just feels patronizing at this point.  And the worse is, sometimes I really want to vent and say  "I'm ugly", "I'm a loser", "I'm an idiot" or whatever, but I can't. I have to hold back because I know that if I say it publicly, people are going to think I'm just fishing for compliments; some misguided soul is going to try to lift me up and that's just going to make me upset, so instead I have to bottle it up.	1642789135.0	s9h603	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9h603/i_fucking_hate_being_lifted_up/	I fucking hate being lifted up

My school is very strict about phones with students, however, teachers have no repercussions for using their cell phone during instruction time.  Many adults always say that kids use their phones too much, but I find they use theirs way more than most children. Like come on, if a teenager can go an hour without using their phone during class, why can’t you, and adult, not use your phone too. It’s really not that hard and I find it incredibly disrespectful to the students and does not set a good example about following the rules.

f1wjagbj	When it comes to their drug being criticized, no drug user is whinier than an alcohol user. Pot users are close, but the fact that weed's illegal in most states and carries stigma (like people assuming people who smoke pot are stupid, unmotivated, etc.) justifies their whininess.  But alcohol is more mainstream, so people who are really into it don't face much if any criticism, making them have a thin skin. A skin so thin, that the mere presence of a person who doesn't drink and isn't being remotely preachy about it is enough to bother many of them. It's like lots of them hear "I don't drink" as "I am superior for not drinking. Bask in my glory, you inferior scum." I've worked in restaurants for the past few years, and I usually lie when people ask what alcoholic drinks I like because if I say I don't drink, people often treat it like I'm trying to flex.  Also, you can just look at reddit whenever alcohol is criticized or the bad effects are pointed out. Most other drug users are like "yes, it does x, y, z bad thing, but I'm careful and/or I enjoy it so I don't care." But alcohol users are like "wine is healthy" (it has stilbenoids and anthocyanins, which are found in lots of foods without alcohol, which [increases cancer risk even with moderate usage](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet)) or "everything causes cancer."

The questions asked are only able to be answered by the people that cheat or people that have some encyclopedic knowledge of the topic.

4ljsq7kg	This comment got a LOT of hate in another subreddit, where I was cursed at, belittled, and downvoted like crazy. So I thought it would be perfect here!  The main argument against this POV was that it is unethical for a spouse to ask their partner not to move on (and I agree to a certain extent) however the spouse who asked for this IS NOT what we are discussing.   If you make a promise of celibacy to your spouse, regardless of the situation, and you FULLY INTEND on keeping it at the time - you are in the wrong for going back on your word unless a significant amount of time has passed (upwards of at least 3-5 years) and you have given considerable consideration to the implications of breaking your vow.  1. How will this affect you emotionally? (Guilt is a heavy burden)  2. What are your religious beliefs? If you believe in an afterlife where you will meet again, it becomes a legitimate betrayal. It is your responsibility to live your religious beliefs like they are true.  3. Will this affect future romantic partners? Constant comparisons to a deceased spouse can be quite painful to an undeserving third party.  The only way out of this, IMO, is if you were lying at the time you gave your word. You did it to make your spouse happy, but you hoped one day to move on when you said it. This avoids the pain of points 1 and 3, but leaves you open to interpretation for point 2. It is also morally sketch, but that isn't the topic at hand.  People were particularly upset that I believe this to be true, even if the request was made on a person's death bed. They thought it unfair to ask such a thing during a vunerable time, which is not untrue. However, if you have the INTENTION of following through when giving your word, it is important to keep it.  Or at least honor it by holding a respectable mourning period.  As a side note: I am not a moral absolutist. Meaning OFC I think there are exceptions to this rule (literally listed a few). Please don't comment w "what if the vow was made at knife point" or "what if the person making them promise was abusive." Obviously there is nuance to the world.	1642790959.0	s9huas	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9huas/people_shouldnt_move_on_romanrically_after/	People shouldn't move on romanrically after promising their dead loved one they won't

55fnfe8k	Imagine you're hanging out at a friend's place, or over at a date's house, or at a dinner party, or whatever. Nature calls, and you blow up the toilet. Clogging ensues. There's no plunger, so you have two options (1) leave it, hoping you don't get blamed and forcing someone else to clean your mess or (2) admit to your crime and ask the homeowner for a plunger. Both are sh\*tty options.  Thankfully I've never actually been in this situation myself, and I think most of us know how to not clog a toilet. But it does happen by accident and I've definitely had this thought when unloading outside my own apartment.

In my opinion it is not only gives the bad example for the young people (Yeah, I know.. I sound like a boomer now even if I am a millenial) but also simply disrespecting the job of the people that put their effort in order to manufacture these items (many times underpaid) and last but not least undermines the whole values of sustainability and reusage that are so important for our greener future. The fact that some of those people who been involved in such an activities later got into some campaigns like tree planting or sea cleaning won't redeem them in my eyes.      I think that YouTube should not give a free pass for such an activities for all the reasons given above. And thus I believe that this kind of videos should be banned from YouTube.	1642794133.0	s9j1jk	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9j1jk/youtube_should_ban_the_videos_of_people/	YouTube should ban the videos of people destroying stuff for views

I’m not obsessed with my resentment, and I think that’s why people are so unhappy in these situations. They feel the need to constantly act on their hate.

7mrgna4z	As a kid everyone always told me I'd grow up and regret wishing I was a grown-up.  And that turned out to be complete BS. I'm 23 and am the happiest I'd ever been. (yeah yeah, still a kid etc. but whatever u get the point)  As a kid you're basically a lump of little shit that's being dragged around the world with no purpose or control over what's happening to you lol.  You basically have 2 options — you're either born privileged with enough food and good parents; then, you're mostly comfortable and have a pretty easy life. But you still neither really have a purpose, other than to grow up, nor freedom. It wasn't fun for me, I was just bored and knew there was more to life I had to wait before I could enjoy.  Or, you are born into a bad family or an orphan, in which case you're powerless in many senses of the word and have to take and deal with a lot of shit while having no say in the matter.  I have a suspicion that some people who claim that 8 is the best age are just lazy and don't want to have responsibilities. Life is about aspirations, some hardship along the way, overcoming which is the purpose of life and eventually makes you happy.  I know at 50-60 people wanna relive their life — that doesn't mean that being a kid per se is good.

5qkh89ho	I preface this by acknowledging that I am guilty of this myself.   I see so many people trying to assign meaning to almost everything. Even going as far as fabricating things to get upset about (might be why subreddits like these exist).   People contemplate the meaning of life, they take on and internalize certain characteristics because someone else did it, and as we know, misery loves company.   People are outraged by a flight delay or sitting in traffic, whether someone holds the same beliefs as they, whether they like the same food, whether someone agrees or disagrees with their sexual preference etc.   Modern society has become a soft, fleshy, and fat shell of its former self. I'm not condoning any past prejudice behavior, society has evolved in a lot of good ways for the most part, but a side effect of that has been society turning to cookie dough.   Its easy to be outraged and question the meaning of life when there are no real problems in modern society. For the most part, if you cannot afford food, the government will help, if you don't have a roof over your head, there are shelters, you don't have to worry (for the most part) about getting killed by some predator roaming around.   Contemplating the "meaning" of life becomes a lot harder when there is absolutely no food available with winter approaching and not having any shelter.   Ancestors spent months on boats, being malnourished, dying of all sorts of diseases that now have cures, while modern society gets their undies in a bunch when the drive thru gets their order wrong.   I'm grateful for modern society but I can't help but think that the world would be a better, more fun place if we had a more old school, tough as nails, kill a rattlesnake with your teeth, gravel in the guts, no padded corners society.

7ucmcawy	It never fails. Someone will post a picture of their hair, with the usual question of "Could my hair be curly? Is this a curl pattern?" Their hair is neither displaying a wave or curl, but it's doing something. Of course because the truth hurts, people will start saying "Yeah, you definitely have curly hair! Do the CGM (curly girl method) and you'll see those curls form!"  Although sometimes I am surprised that someone actually did have curly hair after a few months of doing CGM, but most of the time, they'll post a pic of their shapeless, greasy, and over-producted hair and ask "What am I doing wrong?" and people will respond with adding more products, less products, going for days without washing or brushing hair, diffusing on different temperatures, etc.  Maybe...its because you simply don't have curly hair?   I know proudly displaying your beautiful curly crown is now a thing these days (growing up with curly hair, having curls was seen as troublesome, and if not cared for properly, you looked like a mess) but I think this is the result of wanting to feel included in something.

5imde3xe	I love console wars! I think each console having their own exclusives is great. I remember as a kid visiting my friend who had Pokémon Stadium, Smash Bros, and Zelda on the N64 while I had the Final Fantasy games, Crash Bandicoot, Metal Gear Solid, and other games on the Playstation. Later on my friends got Xbox and played Halo, Splinter Cell, Star Wars KOTOR, and Jade Empire while I was playing Ratchet & Clank, God of War, Jak and Daxter, GTA and other classics on my PS2. PS3 had less console differences and the PS4 even less! With each generation these consoles lost more and more of their identity. It may be immature, but I genuinely enjoy the toxic fandoms and reading fun comments on social media ripping on each other and defending their console of choice. What's wrong with a little competition? I think it's great that Microsoft recently acquired Activision Blizzard.. Let's see if they can finally get some decent games out ;)  We need everybody doing their part to make sure the console wars continue for many years to come.

6qhtpwtm	 I'd honestly consider the one year wait if they gave us more episodes, but that's not the case. The average amount of episodes you see in series today is 8, and then you have to wait one year or more for the next season. After about year, you either lose interest in, or forget most of the storyline of the series. It gets more absurd when they release the next season of a series after 2 years or more e.g. Stranger Things (I've totally forgotten most of what happened).	1642798701.0	s9kri1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9kri1/one_year_is_too_long_of_a_wait_for_the_next/	One year is too long of a wait for the next season of a movie series.
akoko58x	This movie ruins so bad the meaning and rythm of the series I'm so sad.   The point of the movies is that they are only toys but they are so bonded and caring for each other as a gang it doesn't really matter if they're played with.  (Massive explications incoming)  When Andy gives the toys to Bonnie at the end of TS3 it is deep because Andy has grown up and doesn't "need" these toys anymore. But, he wants them to still be loved by someone, and still have a use. He'd rather know them in good loving hands rather than in the bottom of a box for years . The ending is really emotionnal and couldve easely been the ending of everything.  But no, the 4th movie comes in dares make us believe that "ok guys so Bonnie actually doesn't care about Woody and the others and she'd rather play with a stupid trash fork", also, Woody being Woody, tries to prove that fork that he can be a real toy if Bonnie sees him as one. So i'm not gonna lie I'm not fund of this character but at least his connection with Woody makes sense. But while you are gonna tell me "well you said it it doesn't matter if they're played with", the way 4 just puts it there like it's normal while TS3 ending was so uplifting just doesn't work with me.  But now you're gonna tell me that a pretty stupid looking and mean doll is gonna try to ruin all their plans booh and guess what ? I'm sure this character had more screentime than Buzz and Jessie combined. It's. So. Depressing.   Don't get me started on the ending. I do not accept it. Woody wouldn't leave all the others just for Bo Peep. Why ? Because while I love her, and her whole "strong independant woman" arc, we see Woody basically giving up on her in previous movies. She followed her way, that's all. He should have more reasons to be "in love" with Jessie than Bo peep who would only been that good old' partner. Having the single thought than Woody might not ever see Buzz or Jessie is, no. This is not real. You cannot tell me this movie was thought about beforehand and is not a massive cash grab over a popular franchise.  I feel like I need to end on the obvious point that despite my so low love for this movie, it is only my opinion and I am open for discussion, it's the point afterall.	1642798756.0	s9ks8s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9ks8s/toy_story_4_sucks_and_shouldnt_exist/	Toy Story 4 sucks and shouldn't exist
5ntaa68	The other children in the movie are kids of excess from families of means. We know that Veruca and Violet are wealthy already. The movie provides several clues that Mike and Augustus’s families are well-off too. Charlie is the only one from a poor family. A loaf of bread to split along six people in his house is considered a “banquet.” All he eats every day is cabbage water because his mother can’t afford anything better.    He’s offered $10,000 (nearly $70,000 in today’s dollars) for a piece of candy that would turn his family’s life around and out of poverty.      For Wonka to place a moral judgement like that on a poor child is quite unfair.

They shouldn’t!  Say what you will about religious zealots; At least they are carving out a place for themselves by having a lot of children. Meanwhile, some of the more mainstream subcultures have low birth rates.

I think that your sexual preference is a result of all the random events in your early life culminating to your ultimate sexual preference, and yes certain genetic things may PREDISPOSE you to a certain direction but that's it. I also believe that sexual preference is malleable to an extent, many people "discover" they actually have a different sexual preference after a traumatic (which doesn't make it any less valid by the way), exciting, or unexpected event.  Not that it matters lol, the end result is the same, but regardless- I think its nurture, not nature.	1642800942.0	s9lm7b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9lm7b/no_one_is_born_gay/	No one is born gay.

da56gtva	Not sure if this is the right sub, but I’m here to rant nonetheless…  So, curiosity got the better of me, and I took a scroll through the truerateme sub. I was intrigued by the concept that people are out there, rating the facial compositions of these poor, insecure people on the internet.   It was somewhat as I expected; a lot of beautiful girls & guys asking to be objectively rated. I clicked on a girl who was literally STUNNING, interested in what people were responding… I was shocked to see the numbers 5, 5.5, 6 ‘at a push’ populate the comments. It soon became apparent that not even the prettiest of women (and I say women specifically, men get less bad of a rap) exceeding a 7. The average person got a 4. This confused me, so I investigated further. The self-proclaimed ‘raters’ consult a rank-list of male/female faces to inform what ‘rate’ they give. This list has stunning women (not so much men) at a 4, which just demonstrates the complete lack of objectivity (and perhaps agenda) this sub has.   I was then upset to find a post from one girl who received a 4.4, to which her response was ‘why was I born’. This broke my heart. I understand that people are willingly subjecting themselves to this, but there’s something that doesn’t sit right with me at all. It seems to me as though the sub is driven by a bunch of bitter, chauvinistic guys desperate to inflict insecurity on these inferably  insecure women, perhaps because they’ve felt slighted by women in the past (?).

9wneiynq	So I've seen this come up a few times if you google search it and 90% of the comments are saying it's disgusting. I don't understand this opinion at all, and it just leaves me thinking people are really dumb.  Spit isn't that gross, it literally comes from your mouth which is the main place in your body that you don't want gross things. Now, I do understand the desire to not have it spread to other body parts, but I sure as hell would prefer my own spit to shit on my ass.  There's always a few counter arguments and they just don't hold up. Bidets are probably awesome but most people don't have access to one. Showering afterwards is also great, but it's not practical to shower every time you go to the toilet. With both these methods I would still spit so I don't have to wash as much shit down the drain anyway. Wet wipes aren't flushable, apparently even the ones that say they are biodegradable are no good, and it's not convenient to carry them every where especially for men with no hand bag.  Spitting is cheap, it is less abrasive on your ass, it gives a cleaner finish, and if you don't do it because you think it's disgusting I have two things to say to you:  1) you're a closed minded savage. 2) you're also a hypocrite because you're the real disgusting one with your shitty skid marky ass.	1642803421.0	s9mk87	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9mk87/spitting_on_your_toilet_paper_is_more_effective/	Spitting on your toilet paper is more effective and NOT disgusting at all.

xysbx	Constantly, you see people trying to discredit certain ideas and arguments by calling out on the person for being apart of the group, as if they can only argue because they're biased.  As an example, if someone even attempts to argue against quarantine regulations, people would just call them out on "you must be a government bootlicker", as if it's some sort of a "HA! GOTTEM" one liner that instantly obliterates and destroys the OP's argument. Or how in the other Reddit thread above, you have the argument that androids aren't for poor people, and then people in the comment section just reply "you must have an android lol, keep coping being poor while I use the superior apple device!!111!" or "found the peasant" without ever actually reading the contents of the post itself, and formulating an argument based off of that.  Just saying it out loud sounds fucking ridiculous. I mean seriously?

2ff65xe2	 If you use it recreationally, do not think it will provide you with any benefit.  It increases your risk for heart attack, stroke, addiction ( to weed, it’s not a gateway drug), brain damage, negative impact on fetal development, and testicular cancer.   I understand that it has its uses in medicine. It can help with PTSD, pain, and possible neurodegenerative diseases but as in any medicine, it has it’s place. If you are smoking weed, it can cause harm to you. I think people forget that it is a drug. It isn’t going to on its own cure your pain, anxiety, or depression. If you have issues, seek medical help, do not self medicate. It’s possible you don’t even have the condition you are trying to treat or you are making it worse.   Essentially, sure, you can smoke weed but don’t lie to people and yourself and say it isn’t causing you any harm or it’s helping you unless you have a prescription.   (Regular medications can cause harm too, if the benefits outweigh the negative/risks it’s okay to take, and that is why you need a consult with a doctor and maybe even a second opinion)	1642804881.0	s9n42z	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9n42z/weed_is_not_good_for_you/	Weed Is Not Good For You

digk6r0s	recently nick and priyanka announced that they have become parents via surrogacy (congrats to them) but some of the reactions to this news were so weird. people saying that “adoption was right there”, “dont buy babies but adopt kids instead” saying that surrogacy should be illegal, that why are they contributing to increasing human population (???)  while i do support adoption, i also think that we should stop telling “adopt instead” to people who choose surrogacy as an option. there are some couples where the women is unable to give birth so she cant conceive naturally, so they go for surrogacy because they want a baby of their own, and there is nothing bad with it. if they are willing to give money, if the surrogate is willing to help the couple, why are you getting so angry?  i understand that alot of kids need home but shoving that same thing to couples who choosed surrogacy as an option is bit too much, and this is not for nick-priyanka, its for every couple. plus adoption isnt even that easy. you are bringing a child home who got abandoned by their own parents at an young age, the child might have some trauma or psychological problems because of that, they will take alot of time to adjust to new family and new surroundings, which i think would be too much too handle for first time parents  this is not me opposing adoption, absolutely not. i just feel like in “just adopt” there is no “just” because its a very long and tiring process. if you choose to adopt instead of giving birth or surrogacy, then good. if you apply for surrogacy instead of adoption, then also good. its your life, your child, your money and YOUR choice, so dont let anyone else tell you what should you do, or dont tell anyone what they should do. if you dont like surrogacy then ok, just congratulate the couple and move on, and adopt yourself when you can. as simple as that	1642807070.0	s9nx1g	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9nx1g/stop_saying_adoption_was_a_better_option_when_a/	stop saying “adoption was a better option” when a couple reveals they have become parents via surrogacy
zpqxj	For well over a decade I've always seen people left and right complain about YouTube and ads. Especially now since they've increased the "skippable" ads from 5 seconds to 15 seconds.  It's pointless to get upset over having to watch a skippable ad though on a free platform, especially if you're not going to complain about the fact that there are streaming services out there that we pay for and still have to watch 2-3 minutes of unskippable ads, multiple times throughout even just one episode.  Now I get that these companies may use these ads to help keep costs down on subscriptions, but hear me out;  While I understand that no one likes ads whatsoever being thrown in their face when they're trying to enjoy something, I think that it's good to take a step back and remember that you're being shown ads that you can skip, on a website that is free to access nearly all of it's content, and that these ads (while not a whole lot) do also help pay these creators that you enjoy watching so you can continue to get more content from them and sustain the website that they call home. There's a lot of pros to YouTube's ads opposed to cons.  Now, the real enemy that people should be upset about, is paid for streaming services that you have ads that you can't skip.  I was watching a single episode of a show last night and had 4 ad breaks in the span of thirty minutes, all 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes long. I pay monthly for this service and still have to watch ads? In total I watched this show for maybe three to four hours last night. I spent between (roughly) 48 to 64 minutes total watching ads (the same ads at that) within the span of me watching my show. How is this not what people are complaining about instead??  Now while I get that most streaming services offer a version that doesn't have ads for a higher cost a month, it still feels bad that I'm paying this company each month to watch a few select things and am still being hit with ads that I can't skip for two minutes per ad break, with 3 to 4 ad breaks per 30 minutes.  So, all in all, when people complain about YouTube having upped their skippable ads to 15 seconds from 5 seconds before you can skip the ad, it just feels immensely stupid to complain about. It feels privileged and selfish to have any quarrels against considering the other streaming services that are out that that make us pay for them and give us no option to skip an ad. I think we should be grateful for YouTube's ad's when you compare them to other streaming services.  Feel how you want about YouTube itself and the people who are over it, because I'll admit that the company itself isn't the greatest company in the world, but they've given us this free to watch platform where we can find people we love to watch, that gives those people a place to create a career to continue to create free content for us to watch.  I'll gladly take a 15 second ad multiple times throughout a video to enjoy the entire website for free.	1642804240.0	s9mvay	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9mvay/complaining_about_ads_on_a_free_video_streaming/	Complaining about ads on a free video streaming service like YouTube is pointless when really we should complain about ads on streaming services that we pay monthly for, like Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, etc.

I empathise with them, and believe me that if there was a pill that men could take to prevent pregnancy, they'd take it in a heartbeat. But getting a vasectomy is equivalent to getting your tubes tied. And for most men, that's not an option. Especially, for people who people who plan on having kids in the future.

5so694et	the whole thing just rubs the wrong way. you have features & you surgically enhance features you don’t worthy. whole thing weird af & just screams “i am insecure & shallow”.   at a certain age people don’t generally mind your looks in a day-to-day basis. i know you can get terribly teased as a kid because let’s face it, kids are brutal.  but at a certain age (especially work environments) physical looks don’t matter on the day to day. unless you have a deformity your regular looks would pass in an adult setting.  going under the knife for your body. goddamn, it’s almost moronic typing it out.	1642807893.0	s9o7qd	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9o7qd/plastic_surgery_is_for_weirdos/	plastic surgery is for weirdos

But apparently as a young adult it is common for people to have first dates with multiple people at the same time?   I was under the impression that if you asked someone out that automatically meant that the two of you were dating. I personally wouldn't romantically pursue more than one person at once and had no idea people did such a thing. If I asked out someone and found out they had another date planned I'd probably be heartbroken.   Is this maybe an online-dating only thing?

Now many of us are unable to get the pills that would help us to function normally. Many of us get punished because of the others and now we have to suffer for their mistakes. If a person chooses to be a junkie and dies from drugs that is their choice. I’ve chosen to use these drugs responsibly to manage my pain.

Now I don't mind the actual plot of of Solar Opposites, Corvo and the family are fine and quirky, they have silly episodes but what I really look for is the wall plotline.  For those who don't know -Basically, the kid alien - Yumulack has shrunk a bunch of humans into tiny tiny people (via "sci fi shit") and built like a glass case for them to live in. This becomes their world and with that.....We have a storyline of power struggles, survival, revolution, love, and even life "outside the wall". It plays on classic parodies here and there as is usual with adult cartoons but I think it's graceful  personally.  I don't want to spoil anymore but I've come to the opinion this storyline alone has better writing than the most recent rick and morty episodes alone. I think it's Roiland and his team of writers finding a sort of second wind.	1642810595.0	s9p6xk	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9p6xk/i_think_solar_opposites_has_been_far_superior_to/	I think Solar Opposites has been far superior to Rick and Morty's last few seasons.
55mkqke8	And it shows how psychologically fucked many of us are down to our core.  How engrained are we in our consumerism that the only way we can give to those less fortunate is to buy something for ourselves and let some charitable organization receive a tiny kickback of the profits?  "If you buy this (Insert Item Here), we'll donate 5/10/20% of the proceeds to (Insert charitable organization here.)"  And then people have the audacity to talk about how they are helping out or doing their part when it is purely ego driven consumerist narcissist bullshit.  So I'll end with a solution. If you really want to help out, put your money and your time where your mouth is.  Go out and help the less forunate directly, donate directly to vetted outreach programs that are legitimate non profits, do a good deed for a stranger without putting it up on social media to be a fucking karma whore. Go volunteer at a soup kitchen, a veterans program, a care facility, an animal shelter. I could go on but I think you get my drift.  Those people are the real heroes. Not you with your special bracelet, or your new T-Shirt, or your 200k tik tok followers who watched you give 20 bucks to a stranger who is down on his luck. You are not a good person and no one should give a fuck that 2.00 of your purchase towards yourself went to someone who needed help.

c2klgjw6	I’m not American so I learned about her scandal at about the same time that I learned what legacy students are and I gotta say that as an outside looking in, it seems like both are really unfair (to other students), but one isn’t necessarily worse morally than the other  That’s why I think it was really unfair how she was singled out and attacked when rich kids all over the country have a huge advantage and everyone is somehow fine with that  So as I understand it “legacy students” are by default more likely to get in and if their parents also donate large amounts of money to the school it’s common knowledge that the kid will get accepted.  What Lori Loughlin did was illegal since she BRIBED people, I get that. But morally I don’t think it’s any worse than the system that is already in place and I don’t understand why people were so upset with her. It seems misguided to hate on one person when there are countless other rich people who also unfairly get their kids into university.

And it fucks me up as a teenager of 19 20 yrs of age that no matter what someone says to me Or does to me I tend to understand that person's situation and justify it instead of blaming them. It's very difficult to think about myself because nobody is black and white everyone has shades of grey but still I'm expected to pick sides and get mad instead to just pray to heal this person whatever he went through and give me peace to be selfish with no guilt attached to.	1642812333.0	s9pszr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9pszr/just_a_thought_i_feel_is_very_important/	Just a thought I feel is very important

9dwf1hpl	I'm in university and liked this girl I have as a lab partner for 2 weeks now. I confessed to the girl over text yesterday and asked if she wanted to get lunch after class that day. It was the first date I've had outside of high school and we hit it off great.  But towards the end she said, "I want this to be exclusive". I didn't know exactly what she meant at the time but said okay.  I searched online and apparently it's common got people to go on multiple dates without being exclusive. I get that people on tinder do this, but in real life? Do people not consider a relationship exclusive even after sleeping together?? If someone asked me out on a date and I knew it was non-exclusive I would decline. It's one of the main reasons I don't do online dating.  Does not want this and one night stands make me socially conservative and in the minority?

4wmoegib	I hate how 3D animation has taken over the animation world for children. It makes things look cheap, and feel less realistic. Not everything in life has rounded edges.   I just saw a trailer for a remake of The Little Vampire, which was one of my favorite childhood movies. But the thing is they botched the script, and the movie hadn't aged that much anyway. So like, why? Even after a short clip I felt like my head had been inflated.   What we don't need is children's programming being made so cheaply. Give something some quality, send it to a theater. It does no good to mass produce entertainment that has no wit for audiences of any age, because it will never be revisited time and time again, it will not grow with the viewer. No child understood the full extend of Lilo and Stitch, but watch it again now. It's like the fast fashion version of tv.   I understand that not all things can be works of art. But we are feeding some of the fastest produced with the least amount of though to our youngest and most moldable generation. And for what? It's not like there's not plenty of quality content out there for them. So 3D animators and script writers and producers and funders and Netflix: just stop. Or do better.

653p3vz6	I still think he's a good actor with a great sense of humor, and I enjoy the films he has been involved in, but I recently found out something a bit odd about him.  I just got into the Sopranos, and I'm a boob guy, so I looked up nudes of Aida Turturro (Janice Soprano) and found a few (they're quite nice, actually.) And I had discovered that Aida's jugs had been displayed on the silver screen in a 1998 film called "Illuminata"  And this film had been directed by her brother, John Turturro. And in this film, he directed a scene where his sister got groped and had her nipples sucked by her character's love interest.  Now, call me crazy, but I think that's a little creepy. He gave the greenlight on that, and was probably present when that particular scene was shot. I haven't seen the film, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that that wasn't a scene that HAD to be shot for the film to make any sense. I'm glad it happened, because her tits are quite nice, however the circumstances under which they were exposed were rather dubious.

f15oa1wp	Using a throwaway because this opinion may get me publicly crucified (and perhaps rightfully so, this is just a belief based on my knowledge of history and, given my public school education, that could be limited).  This isn’t saying I condone the way the United States has historically treated the Native Americans, because I don’t. Not one bit. I believe that the bad rap we get for that is well warranted and should never be forgotten. I also believe that the “savage” stereotype that was given to them in that time period is completely backwards, because they had every right to attack people who came onto their land, especially people with bad intentions.   However, in the earliest eras of civilization, so much land was stolen and conquered. There were genocides and wars over it, so much death and destruction and cruelty, but people don’t as often refer to other countries or republics as stolen like they do America. In a lot of places in the world, the entire state of their government is built upon a foundation created by those who conquered the land hundreds of years ago, yet there aren’t as many nationwide held controversies regarding them.   A lot of successful land conquering of the past did not seem fair or just, and America’s definitely wasn’t, but they did end up overtaking large portions of land and keeping them, and in a lot of cases with other places built on “stolen” land around the world, the fact is less controversial and the land is simply seen as the rightful home of those on it.   Why is this not the case with America? I believe that Native American reservations should be funded a lot more by the government, but I don’t understand why people use “colonizer” as an insult or get so genuinely angry about what has happened, talking about it in a way that suggests something should be done. I especially don’t understand the people who discredit particular aspects of the country due to it being “stolen” land. What are people supposed to do? At this point it has been The United States longer than the land it was when it was conquered, and there’s no possible way to give it back or something. What is the best possible case scenario of continuing to fight against anything regarding the subject that isn’t to do with properly tending to/funding/expanding Native American reservations, because I can’t think of a resolvable issue about this country being stolen besides that one.	1642816416.0	s9r5ac	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9r5ac/i_dont_understand_how_america_was_stolen/	I don’t understand how America was “stolen”

f766tod	So, I like plants.  I visit the plant subreddit often.  And people there be like “omg, is this where the new leaf will come out” or “omg, my plant is growing 2 inches left of where it should be! Will it be okay?”  It’s growing.  It’s green.  It’s fine.  I visit lego subreddit, “omg I discovered this new way of building this thing! But this move might be illegal!”  It’s a toy.  It’s a fun toy.  Did you have fun? Then you’re fine.  With the computer.  “Omg, my folders are sorted in a slightly different way than ✨famous computer guy✨! Will it be okay?”  Toilet paper people.  “The toilet paper is the wrong way!”  Like… what the fuck.  Just chill out.

8ebacrn6	this sounds reminds me of 2000s. i hate it when people say stuff like this reminds me of the 1980, 90, 20 musicians makes a sound with sounds a little bit like music from earlier days and everyone says omg this is so 1980 i love it. be quiet who said the artist wanted to make it like older stuff. they wear just influenced by that because trends come and go. for example nightcore which was popular in the 2012-2017 it used alot of songs from the 2000s but i never heard anyone said omg this sounds like the 2000s. Trends come and go and sometimes trends come back. but alot of artist take influence from music they hear. who sais music can only be popular for some years of course people get influenced by it especially with the internet where eveything kinda mix together. music constanly evolves and there are so many more musicians than ever before, there arent alot of new genres which are complitely new most new genre are mix of other genre mixed together. its not easy making new stuff that doesnt sounds like something before	1642817922.0	s9rmny	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9rmny/i_hate_nostalgia_culture/	i hate nostalgia culture

Some people have been able to eat "the best food in the word" and have a super wide scope of what "good" is...others have a super slim scope so it does not even make sense when we all are carrying different sized rulers. We need to switch to a pass/fail thumbs up or down system so people can't just waddle away their feels when comparing the local French bistro to their 4 years in France!

bn3u2lbh	A lot of people complain that they're working shitty jobs for low wages and it's not fair because they "want to college." If you do a little bit of digging you find out that they went to their local state school and graduated with a terrible GPA or a wildly expensive private college you've never heard of.  They learned no skills and they didn't distinguish themselves. It was basically high school 2.0 for them.   And graduate school? That's not very impressive either. Again, lots of small schools see graduate programs as a cash cow. They charge massive amounts, promise great opportunities, and admit everyone. Meanwhile nobody in the field has ever heard of them.   I was speaking with someone yesterday who had this exact experience. She has a graduate degree in a technical area she's never worked in from a junky school. All she's qualified for are entry level jobs she could have gotten years ago and she can't even get interviews for them. She complains non-stop about the "industry" being stupid when she's the sucker who made a terrible investment.   The systemic problem here is schools creating programs that will not help their students. Enrollment = money to feed their bloated ranks of middle managers. Schools need to cut that out. That's not an unpopular opinion.   My unpopular opinion is: as students of these programs it's time to wake up and realize you've been hoodwinked. You don't deserve a high paying job because you got a B- in microeconomics from South Montana State University. You are no better off than someone who went to work right after high school except with a lot more debt.

Now if the government steps in we could help make a change. We could make it so that if you're overweight you're not allowed to eat at restaurants and limit them to only certain grocery stores. That way people aren't exposed to peer pressure eating at all and won't be tempted to eat what the other person is eating.

5hgr8xam	As a fan of video games, I am extremely concerned with the direction the industry is heading.  My main point of conversation is the quality of video games on launch. I won't even be touching on many of the other commonly talked about gripes, such as micro-transactions.  I loved when a game released and that was it. No updates, no DLC, no patches. What you bought is what you got. This in itself is not an entirely unpopular opinions. I've seen many others share the same sentiment. This sentiment usually follows on the heels of a massive flop of a release like Cyberpunk 2077, or more recently Battlefield 2042. I strongly hold the opinion that releasing a broken shell of a game and then fixing it later is not only and extremely poor practice, but close to morally wrong. It's a major pitfall of the industry today.  **The way that I show this belief is in never buying a game, no matter how improved it is, if it was released in shambles.**  This is the major double standard that gaming as a whole has. Games can be released in a horrible state (FF14 and No Man's Sky) and then be praised by journalism and gamers later on as the "golden standard" or "darling" of gaming. No, the golden standard is a game that releases amazing and stays amazing and you will not convince me otherwise. Developers should not be praised for patching in things that were promised on launch or fixing their mistakes. I came here to talk about this, because seemingly no one is.	1642821353.0	s9spue	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9spue/patching_a_game_after_launch_into_a_goodplayable/	Patching a game after launch into a good/playable game is not praise worthy.

3mnikjlc	It’s the stigma not allowing people with addictions to get treatment, while those exist for alcohol. If someone becomes and alcoholic their family may even just accept it as a personality trait “omg uncle Elmer is such an alcoholic lol” or just try to help them but opiate addicts often get left in the dust and whatever.  The supply of alcohol is regulated, produced by publicly viewable and thus publicly accountable companies who if a product kills someone will be held to account. While opiates have none of this. Resulting in, just like during prohibition, concentrated and stronger versions of the vice to allow more efficient storage and transport. So people wanting the opiate equivalent of sipping a beer or two are forced to do the equivalent of mainlining pure 95% ever clear. This increasing the likely hood of overdose and addiction.  Makes no sense why I’m shamed and called insane for doing 1 or 2 hydro morphone every two weeks or so then even putting it down for months while all my buddy’s who drink damn near daily are seen as normal.

21xkywdk	Okay, iconic soundtracks by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer and others are good. But hearing them over and over and over again is really boring. And I probably will never understand why moviemakers and other Spider-Man media creators... and all the superhero media creators are so attached to orchestral music.   For example, hear [this classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3jnXxIH_s4). And [this forgotten one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLflJhtGFs). And especially [this emotional masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g8l0Bbbij8) that made me write this post. Don't forget about games: even though these are not main themes, check [this action maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJDiiXv0zIo), imagine [this](https://youtu.be/KX-TNHihYBA) like it's in higher quality and, of course, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m--phj25xt0) out. Yeah, I know, that posting YouTube links may be troubling for some people, but they describe everything in the best way.  When I hear rock or especially electronic Spider-Man soundtrack, I imagine myself not just a savior of the city, no... I imagine myself a mutant, a someone pretty... nasty, but nasty in a good, attractive way. And it's very, very sad that we don't see this Spider-Man. However, all we see is idealized hero and Peter Parker. There should be some dirt and slippery in Spider-Man like in Ultimate, and rock and electronic soundtrack is the best way to do this.	1642802877.0	s9mcok	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9mcok/orchestral_music_doesnt_fit_spiderman_franchise/	Orchestral music doesn't fit Spider-Man franchise that much.

8zxr15yc	Cars are safer than they ever have been. But even the safest cars can only help you so much if you get into a high speed collision. If you have a direct head-on with both vehicles at 60mph you are probably going to die regardless of what 2022 Volvo you drive. The best vehicles are only able to save your life in a head on if each vehicle is traveling a maximum of 40-45mph.  For freeways, these are safer for higher speeds than two lane highways. Most freeway crashes involve grazing the outer parts of a vehicle as it spins before it comes to a stop. (Stay in vehicle with seatbelt on until you’re sure it’s clear). Everyone travels the same direction.   On the freeway if you lose control while going 60-65mph you’re likely going to slow down before impact and often it’s enough slowing down to give you a fighting chance of survival if you do have a bad direct impact on something.   But if you lose control at 85mph…. The odds are much much worse if you have a bad hit on a pole, rocks, or barrier.   The safest cars in the world today still can’t save your life when you have a direct hit at high speeds.  It is my hope that 20 years from now the majority of cars on the road will be able to automatically avoid most collisions with their crash prevention tech.   But until that day comes, slow down. It’s not worth saving 5 minutes to have a much higher chance of death.	1642821990.0	s9sx1y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9sx1y/speed_limits_on_freeways_should_never_exceed/	Speed limits on freeways should never exceed 65mph.

8s3w7rhx	It’s a shame I even feel guilty typing that title. In writing it, i know immediately some people will assume an awful narrative and judge. But if i said I like the occasional beer after work to unwind with my family, those same people most likely wouldn’t bat an eye. There’s still a weird stigma surrounding THC use, regardless if it’s legal in your state or not (it is where i live).   Most importantly, I’m not talking about getting stoned and ever operating a car with my children. I’m talking scenarios where I’m home for the evening, not going anywhere. I’m more attentive. I’m interested in every and anything they want to talk about. I entertain every creative thought and impulse. Make up lyrics to a silly song! Let’s do it. Random dance party followed by tea party? Sounds amazing. You know what I did tonight? I took an edible and created a full blown race course in the basement with my kids. Complete with time trials and homemade trophies. We laughed for hours. Could i do this sober and still have fun? Absolutely.  Would i be as enthusiastic on the 48th time they wanted to race again? Most likely not.    I am more fun, caring, and overall a great dad. I’m still pretty kick ass dad sober and all around, all hours of the day.

870qw0ld	Surprise surprise, I work as a college donation caller. It wasn't my first application but it was the one that got back to me and hired me the fastest. I needed a campus job, I took what I could get.  I get it, you absolutely DESPISE being asked to give MORE money to a college you already gave thousands to. But you don't have to donate, and you CAN be put on Do Not Call lists, or removed from the calling list entirely. At least, my college has both of those options. You can also just persist through the asks and they won't call you again until the next billing cycle thing.  Blocking donation caller numbers doesn't make them stop calling you. They just have to keep calling the blocked number.  Being an asshole doesn't make them stop calling you.  Telling them you're "not interested" doesn't make them stop calling you.  Just. Be as polite as you can that day (remember, these are college kids, anywhere from 18-21 at the youngest), ask to be taken off the list or put on the do not call list, and BOOM. No more missed calls from your university asking for money. It takes callers at least a minute to set that up, and then you're done. Calls where you say you won't donate can be 5-10 minutes. If you're busy, let them know.  You'll save SO much headache on both ends.	1642824274.0	s9tmn6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9tmn6/people_need_to_stop_being_so_rude_to_college/	People need to stop being so rude to college donation callers.

No. They all have issues and they’re all bad. I find it so annoying when people defend their liking of bad things by acting like it’s good and that everyone else is an idiot for not liking it, and worse trying to tear down other pieces of media in their arguments as if that somehow makes what they like good if other things are bad as if there’s only so much good to go around (I’m looking at you sequel trilogy fans).

9i6gscem	   tech innovation is exponential and unstoppable unless stopped by the innovators themselves i.e. us humans. Many people say love the planet because it is unique when actually it is not its just another rock among this vast stretch of space unless we include life that is(that may also be abundant but we don't know yet)  to me the fact that we have achieved so much that was by any means impossible to people of the past so I don't think anything is impossible given enough time to learn and implement new scientific methods to achieve it so being protective of the planet doesn't make much sense when there are infinite resources flying around this piece of rock  I also believe that the Great filter may not be nuclear war or AI but actually the fact that we love the planet too much and don't want to leave it  the fact that people still cherish things like gold, silver, platinum when they are virtually abundant in the the universe seems to be the limiting factor for our species  Why cant our monkey brains accept the fact that rather than some people having something and others having nothing is pointless when EVERYONE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING....  So why don't we stop giving a shit about the planet and start using EVERY RESOURCE ON THE PLANET FOR THE BETTERMENT OF EVERYONE  plus the fact that Stephen Hawking once said "humans should leave earth in the next century to survive"  Why cant we just everything go to space and have everything for everyone with billions of planets and stars??  sorry for bad english tho:)	1642826253.0	s9u7kt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9u7kt/there_is_no_point_in_saving_the_planet_when_there/	There is no point in saving the planet when there are infinite out there.

gtso8mp0	Recently, I was given the opportunity to take an extended absence from work, several months, without financial penalty. My wife and I decided it would make sense for me to take advantage of the time and be a SAHP to take care of our child, saving us money on daycare. I was a bit worried because I had heard so many horror stories about how difficult it was to be a SAHP. Every SAHP in our age range (late 20s & 30s) we knew complained constantly about how they never had time to do anything, were unable to keep up with basic chores, were burnt out and exhausted, etc. but I agreed anyway because I was looking forward to spending so much time with my child.  Well after actually doing the job I can now say I firmly believe many of those people complaining are just lazy. I grew up with a SAHP and saw how seriously she took it, so I went into it ready for difficult job. I worked hard at being a SAHP, had plans and goals for every day, kept my kid on a schedule. Guess what? I never had problems keeping up with our household duties or my parent duties. I did 90% of the laundry, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, errands, scheduling, etc. for me, my wife and our kid and rarely found it hard to keep up with everything. I had plenty of time every day to play with our child, do developmental learning work, and take her on walks or to the park. Some days were tough, but never more so than a hard day at any other job. On top of all that, I never stopped exercising, doing my hobbies or having a social life. If anything, my time for those activities went up.   After thinking about it, I realized the difference between myself and other SAHP was I actually considered it a job, prioritized and held myself accountable, while they just made excuses. I would listen to them complain about having no time to do basic household chores and being “so busy” while they’re sleeping in and wasting half the day on Netflix or shopping. They say they don’t have time to do educational things with their kids or cook for their spouse but they binge reality tv and spend hours having boozy brunches every other day. Really what these people want is to be trophy husbands/wives, not equal partners with their working spouse.   Unfortunately, our society has this idea that SAHP are all martyrs and are above criticism. I’ve seen so many articles about how being a SAHP is equivalent to two or more jobs, how they’re so unappreciated and how you should never criticize a SAHP. Because of this, so many people are afraid to call out their significant other or hold them to any kind of standard. That really sucks because it delegitimizes being a SAHP and makes society look down on it when it should be treated like any other job. I think we need to treat being a SAHP like any other job, and that means calling out those who suck at it.	1642826448.0	s9u9m7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9u9m7/stay_at_home_parent_is_a_real_job_which_means_it/	Stay at Home Parent is a real job, which means it should be subject to real criticism.

igpipihy	Not sure if this is unpopular...  I want to preface by saying I don't hate the content of pop music. In fact, I love a lot of pop songs and pop artists.   The issue is not the music itself, but how how pop music as a whole has evolved. Ever since music has shifted from records to streaming, pop music evolved by mixing genres.  Pop music had another evolution when tik tok became very popular by making very short catchable hooks in snippets of songs. This led to the top 40 being filled with genre-bending one-hit wonders that are moderate until the catchy tik tok snippet comes.  That being said, a lot of amazing songs artists have came through this way, they are fewer and far between though! I do like seeing more independent artists and I do love the experimentation of genre mixing.  But pop music today is becoming less and less about popular catchy songs anymore, it honestly just seems like a completely outdated concept now.  I also want to say that any previous pop music eras are not particularly better per se, I just think today's pop music has transitioned into something else which I personally wouldn't classify as 'pop' music.  I would love to hear your thoughts on this though! I'd love to hear new perspectives!	1642827398.0	s9ujlr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9ujlr/pop_music_is_quite_an_outdated_type_of_music/	Pop music is quite an outdated type of music
1d3iu1k4	I see in the news "Woman throws puppy in bin" and "Neighbor shoots annoying barking dog" or something to that effect and all hell breaks loose and people get arrested for doing so. Fine then.  So what right do you have as a pet owner to take your pet to the vet and have them put down when they get sick or can't walk or eat? How can you one day decide, "Yea, he's not looking too good darling. I think it's time." Who made you god. It's a fucking animal, there's millions of animals in the wild, "Hey Pumbaa, Simba is 100 yrs old and not looking too good. Lets just take him to the edge of the cliff cause I can't see him looking like this." No, it's not like that. If you had to do this to a family member or friend you would go to jail. Yes I know there are places that you can do this but they have asked for this to be done under their own will. A pet can't talk, are you making yourself feel better by doing this or do you think you are making the animal feel better by doing this. Is the pet asking you to take him to the vet to be put down? How can one day you take it to a vet which most times is unfamiliar to them and have strangers around and most times people leave as they can't stand seeing them being put to sleep. Yes I do have pets, I house them, feed them, they have toys and more, I show little affection to them. When the time comes I myself will not be taking the pet to be put down. My wife or my kids can but not me. And they know what my feelings are towards pets and they knew what I thought before we got pets. Do I want the pet to suffer??? Most probably people will see it as "animal cruelty" or "neglect" or some crap and most probably will have to take them to the vet. I don't dislike pets, if you have great. Not a problem, but just make their last few days memorable, enjoyable, a favorite place (a park, at home, the beach) in the warm sun, their favorite toy next to or whatever and hopefully they slip away.	1642827642.0	s9umb8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9umb8/you_have_no_right_to_take_your_pet_to_the_vet_so/	You have no right to take your pet to the vet so you can have them put down (euthanised).

We have to feed ourselves, work, learn how to solve new problems, take care of our family, and still find time to enjoy life. Time is precious.   You should not feel pressured to use those precious moments stressing out over things you’re not affected by, especially when it seems like nobody is stressing about the things you care about.

People only want to make you feel that way because it’s a problem affecting *them.* They probably know/do little about other people’s problems.

33mh5ukw	 I  grew up very poor, I started a company in high school making aerial  photography drones that could pick up a DSLR on a 3-axis gimbal. (pre  2013, DJI didn't even exist yet). They were $1000-$2000 in parts  (covered by the down payment, so 0 overhead/investment) and I could sell  them for $16,000-$22,000. I've since started 6 more companies that also net $100k+ a year, before I was 22.  I  also predicted/invested in Nvidia, Netflix, Tesla, Disney, and others. I  also bought Bitcoin when it was $0.08.... about 2000 of them. Recently  made 1.2M off Doge from a bot I created years ago and I literally forgot  it existed till I got an error message after it sold all the doge. I  made $1.2 million by accident literally in my sleep.  It  is laughably easy to become a millionaire. And bc almost everyone I  shared this story with said, oh you got lucky, or your just smarter it's  not fair.  So I wanted to prove  how easy it is. So I started another company, a power washer, a can of  yellow paint (parking lot paint), and window cleaning supplies, $250 all  up bc I got a nice as power washer bc I did the math and it was 30% more  expensive but 75% faster, no brainier.  I  made $5,000 my first week (cash btw, taxation is theft) working 70  hours including travel. One of my opening lines is "how satisfying is it  to pay someone market rate and watch them work harder than you've ever  seen? How about for 20% less than market rate on the first 2 jobs?" And  then I fucking haul ass. My customers agree, they feel like it's too good  to be true. And the main reason I haul ass is to hit more jobs in a  day.  $5,000 times 52 weeks a year  is $260,000 a year. I had enough money to buy a van and hire 6 people  full time in under 2 months, and expanded to 6 vans and 17 employees, I  pay them $18 an hour but they have to haul ass like me, I work with  them. I hit $1.6 million net profit in under a year of starting.  Now  I'll say it again, people who are poor choose to be poor and deserve  it. I have a hard time starting a company that nets less than $200,000 a  year.  Especially with the  bullshit that is the current wage shortage (labor shortage my ass)  people should just start their own goods/service companies. And if you pick  an MLM, it's just natural selection at  that point.  The list goes on and  fucking on, this chain is easily possible. Power washing, landscaping,  hand for hire on Craigslist, reselling shit from China on Amazon with a  2000% mark up, wholesaling/flipping houses, and then renting single  family homes (currently the best return on investment and a bomb proof  retirement plan, passive income from appreciating assets)  And  these are all the legal ways to make millions, it's even easier if you operate like the people at the top do, it's a dog eat dog world, morals are something we pulled out of our clever little asses, power comes to those who take it and there are people that don't give a fuck about you taking yours RIGHT NOW, do something about it.	1642830537.0	s9vgbc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vgbc/people_who_are_poor_choose_to_remain_poor_and/	People who are poor choose to remain poor and therefore deserve it.

ip14603n	I truly believe your success in life is fate, IQ and intelligence have a very strong genetic component, In addition, most people who are rich inherited their wealth. Also, other factors that affect success are entirely based on luck and genetics people who are more attractive are more likely to get promoted and more likely to get hired in the first place. Not to mention if you look at places like new york, for instance, the majority of people who live in the poor areas are people of color. Your race is based of genetics, mental illness and learning disabilities are also highly based upon genetics and those things also greatly affect people's lives every day.   In addition, who your parents are also matters, for instance, if both your parents have a bachelor's degree you are far more likely to get a bachelor's degree in your lifetime. Success in life is based off genetics, and luck along with who your parents are people don't want to admit this because people believe in a just world fallacy. They think that poor people deserve to be poor because for lazy, or that women deserve the sexual assault because of the way they acted people refuse to accept that life isn't fair.	1642830739.0	s9vimi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vimi/your_success_in_life_is_determined_at_birth/	Your success in life is determined at birth
13yel6	I've seen a lot of hate towards people that cook something and changes a bit here or there (both rational and irrational levels of hate, this is food we're talking about). There's a special kind of hate among these towards people who cook differently foods that are culturally associated with other countries.  In my the sushi that can be found in my country you will eat ingredients that you'll never find in Japan. When I told this to an american friend, he was almost outraged because he likes his sushi done the japanese way, to the letter, and in America apparently it's easy to find japanese cooks that will make perfectly japanese-styled sushi.  Personally I couldn't have given less of a damn if I had actively tried.

They look fine to me, I don't understand why people are labelling this as some sort of "Go Woke, Get Broke" situation if the changes are so minimal that it doesn't make a difference.

6d5ub82p	First I'm just going to clarify the difference between graphics and art style, with Undertale as my example: Undertale has low-quality graphics, I mean look at it, but the character designs etc are really well thought out, so it has a great art style.  When Pokemon Legends Arceus was first announced, there were murmurings about how the trees didn't look great, and since then there have been other nitpicks when it comes to the graphics, like hisuian voltorb doing a jump that looked a little click-and-draggy.  But if you don't analyse it to the nth degree, this game has always looked like it's going to be beautiful!  I could understand complaints about the animations in Sword and Shield (indeed, this was a bandwagon I jumped in wholeheartedly), because "high quality animations" was the excuse they used for not including the national dex.  But now?  Give it a rest and enjoy yourself.  Yes, I know Breath of the Wild looks better even though it came out on the Wii U.  Yes, I know graphics that are pleasing to the eye can add to the magic of a game.  But I heard few of these complaints before the Sword and Shield controversy, and I heard NONE of them before the franchise transitioned to 3D.  Arguably back then, the graphics were lagging behind the rest of the gaming world even more than they are now, but the art style was so good that it didn't matter.  So let's realise what we're talking about here when we complain about 3D sprites - archeops's 3D sprite isn't badly rendered, its movements are fluid.  Not a graphical issue.  However, its feet now dangle pathetically, exposing it's big beige belly, decreasing the overall colourful effect of the original design.  THAT... is an art style problem!  And the new mon designs being over-designed?  Having listless expressions/poses?  Art style problem!  One that doesn't seem to be getting better.  The new leaked designs are awful to be honest.  When playing pokemon, how often have you thought "Yeah, Generation Blah was such a good gen because the trees were really well rendered"?  Pokemon is about the story, the gameplay, the world-building, and befriending amazing creatures.  Any graphical imperfections people have spotted in Legends Arceus aren't noticeable enough to impact your enjoyment of the game as long as you don't over-analyse it.  Overall, the game looks beautiful, except for the designs of the new pokemon, and even that is subjective.  (I've been vague about these designs in this post for spoiler reasons, but ew, I really don't like them.)  Finally, if anyone thinks these are actually popular opinions, let me assure you - I get downvoted on r/pokemon every time I express them.  So I came here, because I felt like whining to a different audience.	1642832145.0	s9vwn5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vwn5/pokemon_doesnt_need_good_graphics_however_the_new/	Pokemon doesn't need good graphics.

bjdmfkr8	Obviously depending on the type of work and the environments you're in make a large role into this, but this is from my personal work experience.  I've been working for a family owned hotel chain with 3 locations in WV for 3 years now, and it's been great. The owners are respectful, caring, and always willing to pay for your work and recognize when you go above and beyond. My starting pay was only $9hr but I was desperate and took it. It was made clear that the housekeeping job was part time, but for employees to get benefits and paid vacation they only need a yearly average of 30hrs per week. On top of this, as long as I was working she'd pay me as much overtime as I was willing to do, with the limit being 12hrs per day. As I was broke I took up that offer and they weren't lying. Within 3 months I was offered a managerial position and given a $1 raise for every position I learned how to do. This gave me a $3 raise in total for learning to supervise, work the laundry room, and run the breakfast bar. I was later pulled to work the Front Desk giving me another $1 raise and then another $1 for taking over the midnight shift as it's hard to find someone to do it. They later opened another hotel and I took over working night shifts at both locations, giving me another raise due to the extra travel. Other than the extra hours when I started, which I only did a couple days a week until my promotion, all I've truly done is the bare minimum of my job and taken the responsibility I've been given.   This leads into the laziness of my colleagues. Housekeeping is simple, you have a checklist of what you're supposed to do and people can't even do that. When we get new people, more often than not they regularly call off, they quit within the first week, or just half ass their job and get mad when we ask them to fix their mistakes. They complain they don't and can't get enough hours when all they have to do is ask for a list of extra cleaning. No one wants to put in the effort to learn extra positions like breakfast and laundry for the pay raise and none of it makes since to me. Whenever we have a snowstorm our owner allows us to stay the night at the hotel so we can still get our hours. She also provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner for us on these days. Yet only management usually stays and then everyone calls off because of weather and complains about losing hours when they finally come back to work. On top of this, the owner gives random raises to any employees she sees doing a good job and not causing issues. A friend who started the same time I did has earned a $1 in raises just because she cleans well and doesn't cause issues with management and other workers. You literally get raises for doing the bare minimum and not being an asshole, this is how low the bar has been set due to the fact we can't get any halfway decent workers.   This is really just a rant, because I'm frustrated with my workplace and the people who work at it. The two hotels I work at won the 1st and 2nd place for guest satisfaction for our brand. The guests that stay are typically business travelers and it is typically really clean. No drug or crime issues for all of my time working there. We have not even received an application for any position in over a month. And we have only hired one worker in the last 3 who has stayed more than a week. It's a really sad state to see things in and it's hurting everyone's moral.	1642832375.0	s9vyo8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vyo8/i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people_refusing_to_work_are/	I feel like a lot of people refusing to work are just lazy.

176si8	The title pretty much says it all, I really don't understand why we ever decided that professors shouldn't have to be qualified in teaching.  Yes. Professors are smart. They are masters in their fields and are likely to be published researchers. But being an expert in your field doesn't qualify you to teach it, those are two completely different skills. Every student I have ever talked to has at least had one professor who has had no idea what they're doing when teaching... that shouldn't be an expected hurdle that all students have to jump over during their educational careers.  Getting a teaching degree really isn't that much extra work. Most places offer them concurrently with other bachelor degrees, meaning you don't have to spend extra time on them. In Canada we actually have a surplus of Ph.D holders with few job openings, so I actually think this requirement would help out the job market as well.  Overall, the education you receieve in college is arguably the most important education you will ever receieve, especially since it'll help you get a job and live independtly... and yet, the professors who teach at them have the least amount of educational training out of any other educator, it makes no sense.  DISCLAIMER: I am aware that most professors prioritize research and often considering teaching a side job, but this doesn't diminish the importance actually knowing how to teach. If you're in a classroom setting, you should know what you're doing.	1642833233.0	s9w6xy	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9w6xy/collegeuniversity_professors_should_be_required/	College/University professors should be required to have teaching backgrounds

d3bg9	Not sure how common this opinion is, I've never seen anyone discussing it.  In the past, you could simply right click an image, any image, and a "Search google for image" button would appear. Sometime during one of the past chrome updates, they removed this button and replaced it with "Search image with Google Lens."  Now, I get it: Google has this cool new technology and they need data and for people to use it. But here's the problem: Google lens (technology designed to bring information relevant to objects *inside* an image) and Google Reverse Image Search (technology designed to find similar images as a whole, and their sources) have two completely different purposes!  If there are images of five people and I want to know what shirt one of them i swearing, I would use Google Lens. If I want to see similar images (e.g more photos of those people, or more images of five-peopled groups), I would use Google Reverse Image Search. *The two are not the same*.  It's not that they "removed" the reverse image technology, but it's a lot less usable now. You need to click on 'search with google lens', scroll *all* the way down just to see the prompt "Didn't find what you were looking for? Retry with Google Images.", and depending on what image you searched, you could be bombarded with [a ton of advertisements](https://i.gyazo.com/17f1ee55bcb01e12536726e60a46549c.jpg) before you get to that button - which is finding similar images, rather than *product advertisements*.  Now, here's the clincher: I have absolutely no use for Google Lens, but I frequently reverse image search, usually for things like researching and to find sources. I understand the uses of Google Lens, and why someone else might use it a lot more, or why I myself might one day use it. But by *forcing* me to use it, you've essentially turned it into a version 2.0 of Google+. It stopped being a nifty cool feature I might use because it's relevant to me, and instead became an annoyance and impediment I completely ignore that slows me down when I'm trying to do something.  It's not like it's even remotely hard to have both services side by side; instead of adding the Google Lens button to the right-click menu, they chose to have it *replace* another feature, and what I could previously do en masse with one click now requires a lot more time overall when you're someone like me who uses such a feature a lot, on a consistent basis.  Remember Google+? That thing that was supposed to become Facebook's competitor, except they then shoved it down everyones' throats and required everyone to make an account, and then to use their real names on youtube?  Google hasn't learned a thing since then.  /end entitled/petulant rant	1642833394.0	s9w8d5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9w8d5/google_lens_sucks_and_by_hiding_reverse_image/	Google Lens sucks, and by "hiding" Reverse Image Search, it sucks even more

ac0lzzcz	Soo, since this is the unpopular opinion sub don't come at me lol.  I watched both films. And I also finished the Before trilogy. I enjoy Before Sunrise (and Sunset) because it's filmed in a unique manner (you know, all talking for 2 hrs through the city). Hated Midnight because the fight is way too realistic, reminded me of how my toxic parents fought. Only it never ended in a "well, I do care about you" vibe like Jesse and Celine.  In this post, I'm only taking Before Sunrise to compare with Titanic. Because there's the similarity of "two people fall in love in a short period of time" and "sense of wonder in discovering and knowing each other" plot.  In terms of romance movie recommendations, I often see people recommending the Before trilogy while Titanic is being categorized as "overrated and celebrated" simply because it's a big budget film. Jack and Rose's romance seems to be treated like a meme.  Personally, I re-watched Titanic more times than Before Sunrise. There were also many points in Titanic that moved me deeply, the love story just added the perfect touch to string all the moments together. I'm also a total sucker for "My Heart Will Go On" (the credits version) because it personally means more than just lost, grief and love for a romantic partner for me, as the listener.  With before Sunrise, my heartstrings were only pulled only once or twice, like "aww, that's cute and relatable!" then I'm just feeling cool about the whole movie again.  I'm not preaching that Jack and Rose's romance is realistic and perfect or whatever.

iub3l	The beginning part of the movie is usually just establishing the characters and it's boring AF for a rewatch. The middle is where the good scenes usually are. It's more engaging to skip to somewhere between the 25-50% mark. Especially with the really good ones, since they are usually the ones that spend the most time developing the characters in the beginning. The only exception is probably Tarantino movies since his dialogue is just so snappy.	1642837571.0	s9xb1b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9xb1b/its_way_more_enjoyable_to_rewatch_movies_by/	It's way more enjoyable to rewatch movies by starting from the middle.

The only thing I can focus on is the burning sensation in my mouth and it completely ruins the experience of enjoying my food. A perfect example is pizza. Words cannot describe how unbelievably hot cheese and crust can become, so whenever I eat pizza that's served fresh from the oven, I always have to wait for it to cool so I can actually enjoy it.  Food that's is either lukewarm or slightly cold tastes WAY better because I can actually enjoy the flavors a lot more.	1642837746.0	s9xcfo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9xcfo/foods_that_are_hot_and_fresh_are_terrible/	Foods that are "hot and fresh" are terrible

1xx56e6j	Morality and ethics are largely based in feelings. Sure, it makes sense why those feelings exist. Ancient humans with empathy were able to form larger, more cohesive societies. As a result, they were able to dominate the gene pool. Activity in area 40 of the brain was selected for. But nothing about that is inherently “good” per say  These feelings, which your conscious self has essentially 0 control over, are forces of social cohesion. They compel you to act in society’s best interests, which often diverge with your own. It’s a dog-eat-dog world; that society will not hesitate to tear you to shreds. How many times have you heard of someone being “thrown to the wolves”? Millions on social media eviscerate people for making often forgivable mistakes. Many of them then grandstand about “morality”  Read ethical works by aquinas, aristotle, kant, ross, bochenski, etc. Actually, don’t, if you value your time. There’s so much self-righteous grandstanding. Coupled with attempts to paint doctrines rooted in subjective feelings as objective truths   Sometimes, your best interests align with society’s. Often, they do not. I think in many situations, it’s best to ignore your feelings and make the “unethical” or “immoral” choice	1642840411.0	s9y01l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9y01l/morality_and_ethics_are_often_bad/	Morality and ethics are often bad
5cl0smw8	Not only are they never really encountered.  If you take the example of Pascals triangle:  You don't just compute all the n*(n+1)/2 Pascal triangle numbers in your head and just keep them in working memory.  I mean sure, go ahead. But how good do you think are your arithmetic abilities to catch up with super-exponential growth?   Not only that. As you utilize exclusively your working memory (not short term memory), your hippocampus won't have the occasion to pattern your tendencies and encode them as engrams such that they stick.  You just learn to forget faster.   (Practical example: the students starting exercise sheets 4 hours before deadline, then panicking due to having "forgotten" everything when the exam approaches. Well, duh...)  Sure, maybe some accordingly genetically configured people get to calculate a couple more than others, but never will they be able to calculate up to practically relevant sizes (e.g. when approximating equations or multiplying polynomials) unless they ironically spend good effort into the task of specializing only and only on that task.  Thereby potentially diminishing their performance in other abilities.  You could say well, the ability to quickly cycle through things rapidly without distraction without any training is already an indicator for a certain learning and figuring potential.  But that's not even what mathematicians are doing. If you've ever read about Henri Poincare or Godfrey Harold Hardy, they seldomly worked on problems more than 4 hours at a time (4h deliberate practise seems like a general flat-rate productivity cap).  And surely they weren't at a hurry, since they frequently followed study periods with mundane/basal activities such as going for a walk, letting "their consciousness" figure things out.  Their prolificness and tempo didn't come from them turboing their working pace.  Rather they intricately and diffusely worked out the intrinsic logic to the problem and efficient ways of representation, until figuring out the logic and progressing with problems became as simple as talking about the weather (and there is no point in trying to talk about weather at a 5000 WPM speed. Mental processing speed is expensive and follows a narrow normal distribution).  Next to the fact that quicker specialized processing automatically arises despite normal general perception speed from tightly and very sparsely and efficiently organized neural connections. It becomes "reflexive".  (Food for thought: Everything in some way is logic.  Particle A impacting particle B already encodes an implication. Anything that can be computed/measured, and weighted against a change of its state can be backtracked to a logical representation, with observation self-verifying the statements of the encoding logic.   Therefore, studying a subject focusing on logic should carry over skills to any other perceptional/logical subject.   That's why mathematicans also made good physicists, biologists, chemists, engineers, but someone good at IQ tests barely would make a good freshman math student.)  ...right.   Which opens up the debate wether quickly going through low-level predictable yet overconvoluted patterns can compete with seeing things from a general abstraction and back-tracking their imposed logical patterns as is done in mathematics.  If you look around, and notice a striking difference from a state where mathematics wasn't a thing, you may conclude a clear winner.  Apart from that, you can overconvolute any pattern into sheer absurdity.  I could ask: "If you can solve this sequence of 30 nested arithmetic progressions, you have 200 IQ!"  Or, I could pose the innocent question to finish a number sequence starting with 9 numbers needing a 10th, yet the underlying pattern is a quadribonacci sequence (current number = sum of all 4 preluding numbers).  Good luck.   That not enough: the method of inquiry imposed in IQ tests directly contradicts the way actual mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry e.g. are practised.  In these, patterns are conjured up from fundamental principles based on how linear/nonlinear they behave.  We can perfectly know, in an idealization, what distance s at time t a car with velocity v (negl. air resistance, lol) being constant starting at t = 0 would achieve:  We have a not changing rate over a uniform scale (time, quantized as second), therefore the distance is the velocity cumulated with respect to passed time (as you'd compute an area of a rectangle) i.e. s = v*t.  Simple logic figuring out equally accelerated movement, with higher mathematics taking up all other non-uniform cases.  Now get a high IQer on the task: give them a pattern of 100 measurements of the cars speed (including air resistance, measurement errors, car maneuvring errors, gear shifting) and let them figure out the next number coming at the next time stamp not recorded.  Godspeed. At that point that which makes someone allegedly "smart" degenerates to a gamble, a gamble that would never have been when figuring from abstract and associative/representative reasoning.  In that regard, approaching it from a logical standpoint seems like the most intuitive way rather than succumb to having to be a gambling extrapolation machine.  As a conclusion: if IQ tests claim IQ to be largely stable, what really stays stable is the utter irrelevance and unneccesity and inconsistency of it's design and purpose.  For being a predictor of mathematical ability it sure doesn't have a lot in common with professional mathematics.  It's almost like saying "Knowing numbers and basic arithmetic predicts professional mathematical performance."  Eh... yeah?  That being said, the lifelong stability of IQ is not unfounded: That which has no realistic relevance is seldomly used.  And logic and abstraction perhaps have the greatest relevance for anything perceivable.	1642840659.0	s9y20m	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9y20m/the_only_thing_stable_about_iqs_are_their_testing/	The only thing stable about IQs are their testing methods delivering unneccesarily convoluted and useless, impractical patterns no one explicitly ever encounters, barely even in academia

Door knocker earrings are another big offender, and anyone who has one of those rings that's just their name is completely moronic based on experience.

Star Wars just taught me to never really take them seriously.  So I’m just going by my subjective opinion and stating that yes Dre Parker and Mr Han outclass Daniel and Mr Miyagi. In story, characterisation, depth, themes and yes even fighting prowess.  I will say Cobra Kai has the benefit of having such a likeable protagonist as Johnny Lawrence and I have a soft spot for his and Miguel’s arc. So they get a bump over the original but we all know a 12 year-old Dre can wreck every single one of those Cobra kai kids in any form of martial arts.   So yeah that’s my two cents. Drey Parker is the goat and the Karate kid remake is the superior movie of the franchise.	1642844689.0	s9z0wf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9z0wf/i_think_the_karate_kid_remake_is_a_way_better/	I think The karate kid remake is a way better than the original and Cobrai Kai

ig1bxf1z	We all feel, I feel.  We can feel a certain way, but we most certainly do not care.  What matters is how we feel to ourselves but not to others unless this person is the nearest one to you (husband / wife), this is how it should be, since feelings help us to navigate things; pain / pleasure. Be that what cannot be evidenced or something that directly causes this to happen or what is seen between people but not to those outside of a relationship.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  People however, still do not care.  Ask someone for an opinion on your issues inside a relationship, people will only draw from their own experiences and what they have been told by the same method, thus completely biased.  You could never fully comprehend the feeling or truth, however let us say you have both people together discussing their feelings, here a person on the outside looking in serves as a logical processor between two feeling people, the processor needs a result out of the combining energies.  What they do care about is invalidation / validation.  When you are trying to help someone who is in their feelings, never invalidate them, but always lead with reason and an outcome, a direction. These people need direction, they also need to feel safe / listened to, they also need to empirically be lifted from the ground that they fell down to, faith in what they are doing. Give them examples, show them the path. There are people who do not want to be lifted, these people.. are much harder to help.  &#x200B;  However even this process is not from caring about their feelings, it is just validating the feeling, but denying their furtherance as to keep the person down in the dumps.  This happens also with positive feeling where some people cannot stand if someone is having a bad day, they will invalidate them and live in their own feelings as if they are correct.  Emotional immaturity exists on both sides.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I have experienced life for a long enough time to to know that people do not care about my feelings and I am glad it is this way, because my feelings lead me nowhere and mostly feelings want to comfort themselves, advancement does not come from feelings but from recognizing the feeling, why it has happened and how I can avoid or do better next time.  &#x200B;  Such as deleting my account on Reddit as it sometimes causes me anxiety with so much stupidity, but that's because I am imperfect.	1642847361.0	s9zo3z	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9zo3z/nobody_cares_about_your_feelings_other_than_you/	Nobody cares about your feelings other than you.
yx99q	Genetical looks are so much less important than what people generally believe. Many will often blame their failiure with love and life on their genetic looks. This is complete garbage thinking and often just an evasion from the fact that you need to change yourself.  Speaking to men, they will say they can’t get women because they are ugly. The real reason is because you are a loser with a loser attitude. Women care much more about character. That does not mean that you should be a «nice guy». It means be a man! Grow your confidence, charisma, work out, set goals and fight for your life.  Also, physical looks can be done a lot with. Get fit, shave, comb your hair, dress better, stop looking like a zombie in your face. Grow some passion in your life and confidence.   I think most people know that what really is setting them back is their failed mentalities, but if they admit that, then THEY have to change, and not the world. So it’s easier to blame the world for not accepting them.   Take it from me. I used to have this attitude. I thought I was ugly, and I was right. My mentality made me ugly because I had no confidence, dressed horribly, no charisma and a lousy personality. But as I changed myself, I became way more successfull. Now, I’m doing better with women than any of my attractive friends, even though many of them have better genetics. It’s about your character. Confidence!  This applies too for women. And for women it is probably more difficult because men are more judgemental phyiscally. But you can change that too. Dress better, get some charisma and femininity, get fit. If you dyed your hair blue, wear no makeup and are overweight, don’t blame the world, blame yourself.  Looks matter extremely little in this world. What you CHOOSE to make of yourself does.	1642847694.0	s9zr9n	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9zr9n/no_youre_not_failing_because_youre_ugly_youre/	No, you’re not failing because you’re ugly, you’re failing because you have a bad mentality.
u7y9u3o	Seen a lot of talk about this, but the film industry needs to aim for higher frame rate. Honestly 4k is good enough. I'd rather movies be 4k at 60 frames per second rather than 8k at 24 frames per second. My eyes hurt whenever any movies does a slow pan shot, it's like I'm watching a powerpoint presentation.

9g2eea1n	  I’ve always been bothered when people said this. It’s patronizing - you don’t know what experiences the person you are talking to has had and you are claiming authority over them, saying those experiences were justified by some divine meaning you seem to be uniquely enlightened. You are also implying that people need to experience bad things to learn or grow. While you could learn or grow from bad things happening doesn’t mean you need them. Saying this you claim authority over someone’s pain and give it a meaning that it doesn’t need. Sometimes things are bad and they don’t have silver linings.  It also reinforces toxic positivity and toughness culture. Not everyone processes trauma the same way, some people never heal from trauma. What doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger - it gives you lifelong mental health issues and may end your life. Many terrible things devastate and destroy peoples lives, and there is no reason or positive side to it. We didn’t *need*terrible events that occurred in history to learn or grow. has real consequences. There is no positive side to someone being raped, abused or tortured.  It comes from a place of ignorance and privilege. While everyone’s pain is valid, saying *everything* happens for a reason you imply that there is a reason that justifies terrible things like severe poverty, natural disasters, terrible cruelty, awful diseases…you may think there is a silver lining to you failing your driving test, and your sadness is valid, but sitting on the back of the thatexperience and  saying there is a universal reason that justifies All bad things is incredibly tone deaf.  It also is disempowering, prevents proper healing/grieving and healthy processing of emotions. You have no agency over what happens, and saying this to someone tells them that their ideas of agency are stupid and pointless. And it completely disregards the fact that spirituality is personal.   Basically people who say that are on a gigantic high horse and don’t realize it.	1642850914.0	sa0k9j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa0k9j/the_phrase_everything_happens_for_a_reason_is_rude/	The phrase “everything happens for a reason” is rude

Which is the reason why abortion is legal: because wanting sex and wanting a child are two different things. In Germany, women are even allowed to drop their children anonymously in hospitals if they don't want to be parents.  But why should men then be forced to be fathers or pay for the child, when women are allowed to choose not to be a parent after being pregnant and even after conceiving the child?  The fairest thing in the world is to allow men the same rights as women: to not want a child. ABORTION SHOULD STILL BE THE CHOICE OF THE MOTHER.

jxpqi5p	   I don't know how else to say it. You use the "E" word around gamers on Reddit, you'd better be prepared for mass downvotes and even a brigade, but that's exactly what it is.  In particular I'm talking about the huge scandal that is Blizzard releasing FREE content in ALL of their games to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Diablo. How do you think fans react? Take a look at this pathetic trainwreck: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5ltnh2/diablo\_3\_anniversary\_patch\_243\_celebrating\_20/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5ltnh2/diablo_3_anniversary_patch_243_celebrating_20/) (That's one thread on Reddit's home for "Quality Gaming Discussion", there was another thread concerning this a while back that was equally garbage.)  So many people legitimately angry that totally free shit isn't to their liking and not only defending their shitty, childish reactions, but getting angry at the audacity of anyone pointing out that it's totally free content for a game that has released a shitload of free updates over the years. How many of them would even have been interested in returning to the game at all to experience the new stuff? I really doubt it's all of them. It's merely another excuse to be angry about something and to follow the circlejerk.  There's some people there (comparatively few, unfortunately) who are just disappointed, and that's totally fine. I'm talking about the people who act like they've been betrayed or "slapped in the face".  I really have to wonder how much time the whiners have put into the game before complaining about this. You'd have to be pretty passionate to be so offended by this free content, and being so passionate, I'd have to imagine you'd already gotten your money's worth. You know, that is if you'd actually bought and played the game rather than just jumped onto the latest hate-jerk bandwagon. What does it take to please people, or at the very least, have them acknowledge that they aren't OWED anything?  And let's talk about a few of the words "gamers" like to use excessively, as though they were magical spells or mantras:  * CONTENT * CONSUMER  I include these two together because they are a brilliant insight into the mind of the average Reddit gamer. "I NEED MORE **CONTENT** TO **CONSUME**". "How can I be expected to pay $20 for the new Necromancer character class when I've only gotten 800 hours out of Diablo 3 so far, and a new class will only give me 100 or so hours more?"  This, to so many "gamers" is:  * ANTI-CONSUMER  There it is. The magic word to make all bad things that scare you and make you uncomfortable go away. Developer releases some DLC for completely free that requires some grinding or a microtransaction to purchase? That must be **ANTI-CONSUMER** because these people now (pathetically) identify primarily as "gamers" and secondarily as "**consumers**". There's a certain kind of self-awareness-but-not-quite there that is really sad. So, if developer does something I don't like, they are **anti-consumer**, and don't you dare try to explain what that term actually means to me or I'll accuse you of loving to have developers "shove anything down your throat and begging them for more". No middle ground. No room for "Maybe it costs that developer money to put this free content out and the people who buy it aren't 'ruining the industry' but funding that free content you want so badly but aren't willing to either play the game or pay for it?"  Which comes down to the uncomfortable reality that so many of these people don't see games as a hobby or a pastime. They see them as not only a way of life, but a *right*. They see that optional DLC that they can "grind" for or pay a few bucks for as "anti-consumer" because they can't wait to consume it but don't want to *play* the game. Yes. We have gamers now who are unwilling to play games because the pleasure-centers of their brains are so over-stimulated that they *need* their next hit sooner, but don't believe they should either have to put any effort or money in to experience it. Rather than take a step back and examine their own behavior and motivations, they lash out against the developer, the publisher or even other gamers in order to resolve their cognitive dissonance.  They don't play games anymore, they *consume content*. I truly don't think they even know why they *want* all of the little free knicknacks other than the fact that they want *all* of the **content** because they can't stand the idea of being "incomplete" or "missing out" (or other players having a shiny skin they don't have). Part of this I blame on achievements.  Looking at the pervasive negativity and toxicity within gaming, they don't even enjoy it a lot of the time, or they have a mutual agreement to complain about it excessively. Why get so angry about a game when you can play another one of the quarter million games out there, most of which are cheap or free?  So many gamers appear to be miserable with the games they play. Even when they say nice things, it's begrudgingly. They just seem to be passing time, consuming their content and then feeding back into their negative circlejerks. This is so bizarre to me and I would donate money to a study into this phenomenon. It's fascinating.  I have another screed about how I think the inability of so many gamers to be happy with most games is because they are burned out on games (or a specific game, remember how Skyrim was almost universally praised but now it's shit all over? Could it be because people played hundreds/thousands of hours of it and now it just doesn't do anything for them because they've done it all 10 times and they want to blame the game rather than their obsession? Or because it's fairly old now and people can't or won't contextualise?) because they are addicted and can't experience the same "highs" anymore, so they blame the games rather than their own destructive behavior, then substitute more "content" for quality which might explain the obsession with "content", but this post is probably long enough.  It's definitely a conversation I'd like to have, though.

777w13gk	I genuinely mean it. Physically uncomfortable. I'd rather have my upper-middle class life atm or a lower-middle class life.  My uncle is a pretty rich person (owns an IT company). His furniture and house, while very beautiful, is very uncomfortable. I can't fatom living at his place. Not to mention his and his kids' diets aren't the best either. They literally have McDonalds everyday. I don't have anything against my uncle; I love him and he's nice but his house ain't it  Cars as well. Lambos and Ferraris are top flashy. And impractical with many road surfaces. Mercedes, Audi etc are better coz they're luxury cars plus they're very practical. Toyotas, Mazdas etc are practical plus they're pretty comfortable too  I really do hope to be CEO of a company one day (on my way to do a CPA after uni). But I wouldn't like to live an ultra-luxious life. I'd like a big house but with a upper middle class taste to it if that makes sense.   And let me tell you; there is actually a big difference between being upper-middle class and being rich. Being upper-middle class typically means you're a white-collar worker with a well-earning salary and you've got multiple assets invested somewhere be it shares or a bit of real estate. You might own a rental investment property. That's what my parents have. Being proper rich means having a few luxury cars, having your own company or being an outlier of elite white-collar workers.   Maybe this isn't an unpopular opinion, but a lot of people I see get gobsmacked when I say this. Or it might be that I'm out of touch with the general public; but that being said, when my family first came to Australia, we were living in a one-room student apartment together and we used to have multiple layers of blankets and sheets to not freeze during winter. So ik the experience of that.

2my1wrlb	I’ve been working hard my entire career and personal life to ensure everyone feels equal and treated fairly based on issues seen in EEO programs but what I thought was only a fad by placing people in categories based off when they were born has been causing more division in my life than most others.   I work with individuals older and younger than I and lately it’s brought up that someone is a boomer, a X, a millennial, or a Z. This of course makes individuals feel like they don’t belong to a group and feel that others don’t understand them.   Even at home with my family it’s referenced a lot lately and it’s just made up segregated bs.   I’ve tried to explain to everyone I know, that plenty of people transcend this age separation by being amazing individuals. I know people who are 50 and above who get along with people who are 20 and vice versa. I get along with everyone almost, save the jerks who just can’t quit being genuine grade A butt heads.   I just want people to quit coming up with new ways to label and segregate each other. We have enough strife through other issues. We don’t need this too.

fdphc0v	Sorry not sorry.  I've talked to countless people who have some money management issues that could be fixed if they just go with what they normally use.  Netflix, Hulu, and other video streaming services are around $8-10 a month give or take. That averages around $90-120 a year roughly. If you don't use these services often, then why are you paying so much?  Same goes for XBOX live and PlayStation plus. If you're only using the service a few times a year, then why pay month to month.  There's also people who don't go to the gym but pay a monthly gym membership. I can't even.  When there's free ad-free radio apps like caprice radio, It's crazy how people pay for pandora or spotify.  I don't even want to get into car payments. You could buy a used Toyota and be fine and save $200+ a month and just get by on liability insurance to save even more money    There's people who have multiple subscriptions and payments and they complain that they can't put any money away to save, yet they made those spending choices and complain about living paycheck to paycheck.

I wouldn’t put any distracting stuff on it like Games or Social Media on there  2nd. Only educational stuff  3rd. Only communication functions like E-mail, Instant messaging services, phone calls, chat, voice conference, video conference  4th. It can take pictures  5th. And other useful features like notes, ordering stuff, translate, watching the time just stuff that you ACTUALLY need  Basically just make it a utility tool, not addictive, no unnecessary features just a tool you can use for when you need it  Just a simple device for communication, education  No entertainment and shit like that (that’s what a TV literally is made for)  Nothing that’s distracting  Cause that’s the issue with modern phones they are too distracting and addictive  And the people who said they were gonna change the world for the better with that I believe instantly failed to recognize that these machines have failed simply once they started to have, too many features to really be used for something world changing.	1642861692.0	sa3ng3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa3ng3/phones_have_become_useless_and_failed_their/	Phones have become useless and failed their purpose

erxpd	I’m sure several people have come across this concept where the handyman tiktoker will dismiss an itemized bud or bill request. I thought if I saw just a few of them do it then it would be an outlier but I see if far too often. These videos wouldn’t pop up as often if people didn’t engage with them which means there are people out their who agree with them.  Just because you are good at something or have done it as a trade for many years doesn’t mean you get to stiff the requesting person with this mentality that they don’t deserve to know what goes into their project. Frankly if a handyman or construction person tells me this then I tell them I’m not interested in using them, and I encourage everybody to be that way.  There are a number of problems that contradict their logic of you don’t need to know what goes into it.  1. What happens if you as a contractor or tradey are no longer accessible to them. Are they just shit out of luck not knowing how many board feet their deck took to build or the route you took the plumbing or what circuit you tied into for the electrical. 2. How are they supposed to gauge or know what products you are using without a formal written out proposal detailing products and amounts. 3. How can they trust that you are doing right by them, which I think it’s by far the most important part.  Those may not be strong arguments to some, but if I’m inviting and paying a person to do work to my home I want to trust them, I want to know how to follow-up with them, and I want to know what was used in order to repair it myself in case the contractor is too tied up with other jobs or MIA. Lastly, with what little the average person knows about these types of things and the infrequent use of contractors means they wouldn’t know any better or that the contractor throws in a whole new set of tools to expense the job out without even telling you.  Here’s the other side of this though, as a consumer, be ready to pay for the labor charge on these bills. I commend guys and companies who break it down all the way to labor because then I know what’s going on. Home improvement or construction projects in general are not easy to complete without the right tools, preparation, and skill set. I will happily pay for all of the above as long as it is straightforward with me. I respect the skill sets that go into trades and the investment of the tools and time getting efficient with them. If they are fast and have done it for years with good results then we should be paying for their efficiency.	1642864366.0	sa4ji5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4ji5/handyman_estimates_should_include_an_itemized/	Handyman estimates should include an itemized bill including labor.

You’re supposed to put them on pedestal and be forever thankful for the life they gave you although you’ve never asked for this life, it was only their selfish wish.  If you look up r/raisedbynarcissists, you will see posts of many people deeply hurt by their parents. But they still love them and wish their parents could have treated them differently.

If you aren’t prepared to take the good with the bad, the tough with the not so tough and the inconvenience that may cause you, *DON’T HAVE KIDS!*.   Your baby shouldn’t have to fall asleep scared, alone and covered in tears because you can’t be bothered to actually put the work in. We wouldn’t treat our partner, parents, grandparents etc… like that, so why is it ok to treat a baby that way?   The baby isn’t learning to ‘self-soothe’, that requires the ability to rationalise and self-regulate their emotions (which take years upon years to learn and utilise), they are giving up trying to communicate because they realise nobody is coming.

Here’s the main differences between those who can afford the mortgage v/s those who can’t:  Can afford: student loan debt, a couple of non-store branded credit cards, sub$30k auto loans.  Can’t afford: student loans, several branded and non-branded credit cards spent to the max., auto loans over $50k.  Just spent over an hour with a “woe is me” idiot who was blaming everyone else under the sun for his financial straits. Both husband and wife making less than $15/hr (but WFH). Over $100k in student loan debts (pretty common for their age group) and almost maxed out Credit cards. Again, most of that generation has a pretty similar credit profile but here’s the kicker: they had an outstanding balance of $22k on an IKEA Credit Card and two auto loans (one for $55k and the other for $80k). I asked if the cars were in any way required for the work they do-No. Than what makes you go out and get cars with monthly payments that are preventing you from putting food on the table? Given what you earn just what did you need to fromIKEA for $22k? Every answer he gave me was how society had done him wrong. Did society make you go out and spend $150k on cars? Did society demand you get and max out credit cards from places like Kohl’s and IKEA?   Just when do people start taking personal responsibility for the situation they are in? No one’s making you “keep up with the Jones’” but you.	1642865390.0	sa4w1o	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4w1o/a_lot_of_the_people_complaining_on/	A lot of the people complaining on r/lostgeneration are the cause of their own problems
hpjuozsf	Not only do very few people talk about it, but it seems to be a non-topic entirely. The issue is that like other mental health issues, the more it is normalized to talk about, the better the chance of recovery or seeking help there is.  Having either or both of these will impact every aspect of someone’s life. How much they earn, who they date, the quality of their relationships of any type, and much more.  They can also lead to depression as well. Which in turn is making all situations even worse than before.	1642865505.0	sa4xgu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4xgu/having_low_selfesteem_and_or_low_confidence_is/	Having low self-esteem and or low confidence is one of the worst traits a person can have.
dldrdaxu	"It's the curse of the internet that's becoming more and more apparent these days.   I don't think people were meant to have access to the ability to instantly and bidirectionally communicate with several hundreds or throusands or even millions of people at once. I think our brains aren't adapted or possibly even ready to fully comprehend the consequences of that scale of social interaction.   Also the usual lack of a face or any personable elements online kinda makes it harder to empathise with people during online discourse.   Outrage is also the most viral and powerful emotions  to stir controversy and discussion online, and in an almost 'natural selection' kinda way out competes the other types of emotion expressed online (like joy, sadness).  The result is when stating a controversial opinion online, people are predisposed to take 'offence' and get angry at you, and are the most 'vocal' and hostile interactions. These outrage response end up strongly amplified in a positive feedback loop with other outraged people ad infinitum.   The result is a group of people mobbing one person with the most visceral and venomous responses, that don't see a person, just an opinion that they perceive to attack their identity. The dog-piling creates an echo chamber of outraged users, doing increasingly harmful things like harassment, death threats and doxxing etc.   And boom, from a single opinion, you are now the target of a vicious outraged Mob that wants you to at best be silenced, and at worst wants you to suffer and not exist anymore.  And this isn't even going into how some social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are deliberately designed to incentivise this kinda Mob behaviour because outrage and mobbing 'increases user engagement."	1642865571.0	sa4ya4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4ya4/hijacking_udiamondisnotcrashs_comment/	Hijacking u/Diamond-Is-Not-Crash's comment.
9sco546a	Using Marijuana for recreational purposes is overrated in my opinion. In TV shows, movies, music etc. weed is portrayed as this wonder drug that makes you feel very good and enlightened or something. I have smoked weed off and on for years and sure sometimes it feels good, but it is over hyped. I think weed is best enjoyed with moderate usage and not doing it everyday which is why pot heads drive me insane. I feel like people are psychologically conditioned to believe the high feels great because everyone says it is. What also annoys me is how expensive it is.	1642865773.0	sa50sz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa50sz/using_marijuana_for_recreational_purposes_is/	Using Marijuana for recreational purposes is overrated

If you let this animal, which knows no better, roam around your house doing whatever it wants while youre away at work or sleeping- youre as bad as parents who leave their kids alone in the car unattended.   Youve taken on the responsibility to care for this creature, and that responsibility includes teaching it boundaries, whats okay and not okay to eat, etc.   Dogs will grow out of the destructive phase, and if you do it right, the crate becomes a safe space, one which the dog trusts being put into not just at home, but at places like the kennel and groomer too, making their jobs easier because the dog knows what a crate is.	1642865968.0	sa538o	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa538o/people_who_dont_crate_train_their_puppies_are_bad/	People who dont crate train their puppies are bad dog owners.

apuiuyc4	[1 in 5 Maryland students are chronically absent.](https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-chronic-absenteeism-20180604-story.html) That stat rises to nearly 40% of students in Baltimore. [Another study shows that 83% of Baltimore students are chronically absent.](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/city-school-with-83-students-chronically-absent-graduates-nearly-half#:~:text=Project%20Baltimore%20did%20some%20digging,2019%2C%20spiked%20to%2083%25.&text=If%20a%20student%20has%20more,they%20are%20considered%20chronically%20absent.)  You could pay teachers a million dollars per year, they're not going to drag the students in. This is a problem in parenting. The parent has to get the child to school. It's not the teachers' job to do that. It's solely on the parent.  Now this is an extreme example that illustrates the worst way parents raise their children. However you have to remember parenting is on a spectrum. These parents in Baltimore are doing the shittiest job they can. On a scale from 1 being the worst parents and 10 being the best, this is a 1. So here's the thing. Lets say the parents get them to school. Great. You got step 1 done, now the student has to be polite, respectful, and willing to learn(or reasonably so, they are kids after all.) The child has to be socialized to a certain degree in order to learn. And that's the parents' job. During the formative years they have to instill at least the basic amount of discipline and manners. If you have a classroom and 25% of the students won't stop talking no matter what you do. The teacher is fucked.  What's the teacher supposed to do? Suspend all of them? Then you get tons of bad parents who don't know how to socialize their child(because they were never socialized themselves) coming in angry at the school, not because their child is disruptive, but because they have to take time off from work to watch after their unsocialized child. So nothing changes here. Not only that, that 25% of disruptive kids are disrupting the learning of the other 75%.  While I lay blame on the parents, I'm not naïve enough to believe you can change them. How do you change these parents? These parents were once the children who were not going to school. They were the children who were disruptive in class. They were the children who were brought up unsocialized and chronically absent with no respect for education. As you get older your brain becomes less and less able to change and adapt. Your ability to learn and grow is hampered. So these parents are not going to change and you shouldn't expect them to. It's a vicious cycle.	1642870762.0	sa6rp6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa6rp6/the_biggest_problem_in_education_are_the_parents/	The biggest problem in education are the parents

They are planning for a marriage and I'm happy that the two people I love and care are happy and having a healthy relationship, rather than getting angry for a relationship that didn't last for a reason. First, I was sad and bitter even but I think its important to draw your boundaries and know where to stop. Its called "ex" for a reason, you do not control their romantic life choices anymore, or own them because once you were together. You aren't entitled to have control over your ex as much as your friend's romantic life. Just because they are your friend doesn't mean they should make their life-choices according to *you*, especially over a relationship which ended. You are putting both pressure on yourself and your friend over something which ended and has no value to it anymore. No one is obligated to limit their freedom & choices that are not even irrelevant to you anymore.

apuiuyc4	Many people like to point at teacher pay as a huge problem in education. However what they do not say is what is too low in pay and what is appropriate for pay. It's a meaningless platitude, 'I'm going to say teachers should be paid more in order to show how much I value teachers.'  Thank god teachers are there to teach kids how to read, write, and do arithmetic. It really is a miracle so many people know how to read. Totally on board with that.  The problem is, if you get into specifics the majority of these people can not hold a conversation. They get defensive. When you ask questions on how much is enough and what would the benefit of paying teachers be, they get super defensive. 'Are you saying they shouldn't be paid more, you anti-intellectual monster who hates teachers?' 'You mean, I have to explain my position? That makes me super uncomfortable, because I haven't looked into this at all. I'm just agreeing with what everyone else says.'  When you ask this person how much teachers should be paid, they have no answer. They always just say more or 'It's a regional issue.' OK, how much should your region pay teachers? Then you're likely to get a non-answer that deflects away from the question.  [On average, public school teachers](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_211.60.asp) get paid equal to or above the mean household income. Mean -household- income. They get paid way more than mean individual income. So it's actually a job that provides an above average pay in most cases. Are there outlier situations that can be rectified in certain counties and cities? Maybe, sure. But on average this isn't an issue in most areas.  Now, what are you saying if you think teachers should be paid more? Are you saying they would teach better if they were paid more? So, in other words, teachers care so little about education of children they're holding back based on how much money they make. I don't want teachers like that. Especially when they make average or above average income and get 2 months off per year. I also don't think that's the case.  Are we saying that the teachers we have are bad and we need higher pay to attract better teachers? That's one way to look at it. From the teachers I've talked to it seems like most teachers are pretty good.  From the teachers I know and have talked to about the subject they tell me that, sure, they'd want higher pay, who doesn't? However it wouldn't increase their ability to teach. The problem isn't the curriculum in most cases or how it's presented. The problem is the students.	1642871641.0	sa73so	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa73so/people_who_say_teachers_arent_paid_enough_dont/	People who say teachers aren't paid enough don't know what they're talking about
6xkpgh8p	Unpopular bit: "Animals were here first" is not a good enough argument. In the wild, territories and resources have to be constantly defended from rivals who can take over them at any moment. Humans are just another rival. We may not be as strong as other animals, but we're damn smart, so smart that we can make pets out of the animals we think we can't rival. And that's exactly what made us a species so successful. By the law of the jungle, we deserve to be at the top of the food chain. We deserve all the land and resources we took from othee species.  Popular bit: But, of course, we're still part of the same nature we subjugate. Because we know more about it than the average mammal, it's also our duty to take care of it. We understand (I hope) that it's not wise to destroy the flora and fauna that give us food and make life in this world possible in the first place. We made this world ours and, in doing so, took over the responsibility to care for it.	1642872004.0	sa78la	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa78la/by_the_animals_own_standards_we_have_every_right/	By the animals' own standards, we have every right to the land and resources we take from them.

iiwc35gi	Trailer parks are often the laughing stock in the US, calling people residing therein "trailer trash". Yet, the average trailer park is actually still a lot better than the average middle-class home in a third world country.  1. The standard size of a trailer is bigger than most middle-class houses or apartments in developing cities; 2. The fact that no one lives above or below you, is by itself a luxury. 3. There's plenty of parking and open space. 4. It has running water, electricity and gas.   If people living in trailer parks are "trailer trash", you might as well call half of the people in the world as savages.	1642872045.0	sa7956	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa7956/trailer_parks_are_actually_pretty_nice_by_global/	Trailer parks are actually pretty nice by global standards.
1u2dcemj	I've felt this way for a long time now, & I realize that I both could be wrong or could just be a little anal grammatically, but I can't stand when people put these two together in the same sentence.  To me, to say "please" is to be petitioning someone for something. It's a request. And petitions & requests are fine, but the second "thank you" is put in the same sentence (before I've decided whether to comply or not) it's as though to you the answer has already been decided, as if it really weren't a petition at all, but a command dressed up to look like a petition.  Including "thank you" is to say that you EXPECT me to do it, & has a very entitled feel about it. Imagine this: someone on yhe street walks up to you & says "Hi, I'm taking today to try to find people who might wanna donate $50 to the children's orphan home division.  (With no hesitation): Would you like a receipt for your donation?"   Now, initially, you hear what they're taking donations for, & if you're a person w/ a generous heart &/or a love for kids, maybe you're almost ready to grab your pocketbook. But then, before you've said a word about being interested, they've moved all the way to the end of everything with 'would you like a receipt', as if you had no real say in the matter anyways. They've ignored that the entire transaction hung on your decision to agree or disagree, & they've attempted to steal that from you. Saying "please & thank you" together is the same thing.   I hate when people say that.    Yes, we were taught to say "please" & "thank you". So say "please" when you're petitioning something of someone, and IFFFFFF they choose to comply with your request,  say thank you after they do, not before. Otherwise you're just invalidating the initial "please", & making you look spoiled, not polite.	1642872365.0	sa7dh8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa7dh8/its_actually_rude_to_use_the_expression_please/	It's actually rude to use the expression "Please & thank you"

i10v706d	 I am specifically referring to the ideas surrounding cats. I get it. Cats are bad for wildlife. They are, after all, an invasive, predatory species. There's no reason to believe that they'd have a *positive* effect on native ecosystems. However, its annoying to me that people seem to assume that cats have an *equally* negative effect on every ecosystem they inhabit. In a place like New Zealand, for example, which lacked any native feline predators, cats are devastating. In a place like the UK, wild versions of your domestic cat have been hanging around the woods since before humans set foot there. Do cats *really* have an equally destructive impact in both countries? The idea seems absurd. Yet, I very rarely see people take geography and ecological context into account when condemning outdoor cats. Cats aren't invasive *everywhere,* and in a place like the U.S., while they may be technically invasive, wild birds have been dealing with predatory felines for a long time: cougars, bobcats and lynx are all native here.  I often see statistics like "cats in the U.S. kill xyz amount of birds a year." These headlines confuse me. In nature, animals die. Human beings have killed off wolves, lynx, bobcats, birds of prey in untold numbers. We literally go into the woods and "cull" animals all the time to control their populations to make up for this. Yet I have rarely seen an article continue on to say "this is xyz% of a sustainable take for this species in this location, or xyz% of how many would have died of predation before humans depressed the number of local predators." Usually they *do* go on to say "cats have led to the extinction of countless birds," disregarding the fact that many of those bird species were from an entirely different ecological context than the ones familiar to the article's intended audience.  So color me skeptical about how bad cats are in the U.S. and the U.K. I have a strong feeling that dense human populations, lawns, pesticides, insecticides, deforestation and other forms of human activity cause way more harm to local wildlife populations than cats by a wide margin. This is the Anthropocene, not the feline-o-cene. Yet someone with an ecologically barren lawn covered in pesticides will eat a beef-burger and snack on some cookies made with South East Asian palm-oil before shitting on their neighbor because they let their cat out, *and not feel in any way hypocritical.*  Still, all of this is only half my argument. There are DEFINITELY places where outdoor cats should seriously be illegal. Places like New Zealand or Hawaii or really anywhere where birds haven't been dealing with similar predators. However, **just because an animal should not be allowed outside does not mean that keeping it inside is humane or compassionate. Sometimes the best solution is to just not have the animal.**  I do not believe *any* mammal or bird larger than a hamster should be kept indefinitely indoors. I think the thought of chickens, cows and pigs who never get to experience fresh air or grass under their feet is innately depressing. Very few animal lovers would fault me for that. Cats though? People seem to think that every single apartment building in the human world is a great place for a cat to live the entirety of their lives. Most cats that I have seen indoors do not live in a home or apartment set up with their needs in mind. It's just assumed that if humans are fine with it, the cats are too. I mean, sure, the cats can't talk or consent and many (many is the key word) try to escape every chance they get. Yeah, I get it, *your* cat is different. She or he has lived their whole lives indoors and hates the outdoors, which has nothing to do with the fact that the cat has lived its whole life in an unnatural environment and everything to do with their innate nature. Sure.  You ever just see an indoor cat sitting on the windowsill, staring at an outside world it will never get to experience? I would literally never deprive *any* other animal of some fresh air once in a while. Not a dog, not a chicken, not a pig, not even a rabbit. Animals are meant to be outside. Just because we have brought them to environments where they shouldn't be isn't going to change their nature or their innate needs. What we have done is put ourselves in an impossible ethical dilemma due to our own selfishness. **My unpopular opinion is this: if you live in an area where outdoor cats are a serious threat to wildlife (and that CANNOT be everywhere, as the wild versions of our semi-domestic felines are native to both Africa and Eurasia and similar predators exist all over the world) well, don't get a cat.**	1642877817.0	sa9cqf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9cqf/too_many_people_think_that_just_because_letting/	Too many people think that just because letting an animal outside is ecologically destructive, that keeping it inside is therefore humane.

32uyh29z	Most people experience love quite young, and most the time are not looking for it at all.  I will admit that it's an amazing, fantastic feeling unlike any other, and while it's in your life, life feels really good, and you look forward to the next day, because you may spend it with the person you love, or you may be one day closer to seeing them again.  Before you experience love, single life feels fine, and normal, but after you've experienced it, single life feels lacking and empty, and really lonely.  Simply put, once most people have had a taste of love, their life won't feel complete, or even enjoyable without it.  I guess that's a reason why people stay in relationships that are bad, it's why some people would rather put themselves through hell, than sleep alone at night. And that's why some people are just always dating diffirent people, because they can't stand to be without companionship.  Before I experienced love I was carefree, and content, now I just want to feel that again, and I can live my life and get through each day no problem, but there's an empty feeling, and a constant longing for intimacy that was just never there before I fell in love for the first time.	1642878305.0	sa9j9v	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9j9v/love_changes_you_and_definitely_not_for_the_better/	Love changes you, and definitely not for the better

fobql	There are two kinds of lazy, smart lazy and stupid lazy.  Smart lazy means you put some effort into getting yourself into a situation where you can now get away with working less.  Stupid lazy means you just try to put in less effort with no consideration to the consequences.  Office workers are stupid lazy. Reddit and other message boards are full of office workers who talk about how they only really do a few hours of work a day, how they want to cut down from 5 days a week to 4 because they can easily get their work done in 4 days, and the latest is that they all want to work from home because they can't be bothered to get dressed and come in to work.  Here's what their stupid lazy is going to get them.  They cut down to 4 days a week, they cut out the office and just work from home.  Then companies figure out that they can pay someone in Iowa half the money, because rent in Iowa is $500 and you can buy a house in rural Iowa for $75,000.  Then companies figure out that they can pay someone in India 1/3 the Iowa salary, and the Indians will work 50 hours a week instead of the 30 that Americans were reluctantly doing.  Congratulations, you lazy fucks, you just outsourced yourself.  Now  you can go get a real job where you have to come in to work.  Nobody's going to be able to work from home in truck driving, nursing, warehouse work, restaurants, or plumbing, so you might as well figure out which of those you want to do now.	1642878909.0	sa9qxp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9qxp/officer_workers_are_stupidly_lazy/	Officer workers are stupidly lazy

86hm6ad8	I hear all the time where people say "trust the data," or "believe in the science." If they are extra sharp, they will have memorized a bunch of random statistics.  The problem with this is that most people have no idea where the data they are citing is coming from, and do not realize the general *potential* fallibility of research.    Research is susceptible to a wide variety of pitfalls (i.e. p-hacking, spurious correlations, sample/selection biases, funding bias, etc.).  In fact, the MAJORITY of published research is later found to be wrong or inaccurate in some measure.  So while I would separately argue that the entirety of the scientific process, over the vast expanse of time, eventually comes to truths, what most people are doing is quoting and "believing" in the results of a random research paper...and that is no different than believing in magic.	1642879010.0	sa9s7t	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9s7t/people_who_blindly_say_believe_in_the_science_are/	People who blindly say "believe in the science," are unscientific and might as well believe in magic.
i88d3tsr	 I knew someone who used to be like this, he knew I was depressed and was going through a rough time of no motivation goals in life, just being isolated which with all going on these past years was even worse than usual.  He knew all this yet never stopped boasting about how great is life is, as if he is tea bagging me and trying to piss me off, make me jealous or whatever, constantly just spamming the best moments of his life, portraying something like a perfect fake instagram page where all you see is just happy moments.  I am not saying that if you have a depressed buddy all you should do is mirror the behaviour and act like a crybaby who is just pessimistic all the time, I am just saying that acting like a child and screaming around because you are successful in your life is not the solution either.  To me its just like visiting someone who is dying in a hospital , needs a triple bypass and just flexing your 9% bf muscles while screaming around like hulk, some people might see that and appreciate it see it as some sort of motivation but I think most just think you are a douche.  I like the middle ground where you acknowledge that someone is going through a rough time perhaps even relate to the person and say something like "Look I was also depressed, I did X and Y which helped me in life and now I am here" in a humble, not bragging type of way.	1642879050.0	sa9sqt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9sqt/boasting_about_your_great_life_in_front_of/	Boasting about your great life in front of someone who is depressed is asshole behaviour.

Imagine if you refused to use Chinese slave labor because it was unethical as a big company. You'd be outmatched by the competition most likely.

b6g1ol61	I do want to be clear, Pixar has made some great movies. I love Moana, Coco, Soul, the Incredibles, and Ratatouille, and WALL-E and Inside Out are pretty nice too. But there's always been something about them that's never really clicked with me like it seems to with other people.   I think it's two things. First of all, I just don't like the aesthetic of a lot of their movies. There's just something about the way their characters are designed that I'm not a fan of. That's one big reason I liked, but never really loved Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story franchise. I do like their newer animation much better. Even though I didn't particularly enjoy Luca or Onward, I still like the animation quite a bit more than their older work.   The other thing is the worlds that the characters live in. Now again, sometimes they're really cool! I love Moana's world, and Ratatouille adds just a bit of something special to Paris that makes it interesting. Soul has an engaging world too. But I think that their worlds have just never been for me. I never understood the appeal of the city in A Bug's Life or the world of Onward, for example. They almost feel watered down for me, like something much more interesting is hiding under the surface.   And then there's Dreamworks.   I think a lot of people think of Dreamworks very badly. And I can understand that, they have made some terrible, terrible movies. Boss Baby and Trolls are both pretty recent and also both pretty bad, and they both got sequels that were even worse. But Dreamworks have also made some incredible movies.   And some of their films and film series have had completely undeserved bad reputations in the past. Shrek is not terrible, in fact, it's really, really good! And the second movie is even better! Despite the name, Kung Fu Panda is a shockingly emotional movie. It's got a ridiculous premise that is executed PERFECTLY. and Megamind is nothing like Despicable Me, they're just similar on the very absolute surface and were released at about the same time.   Here's the list of movies of theirs that I massively enjoy, in order of when they released them: The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Shrek, Spirit, Shrek 2, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Over the Hedge, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek 4, Megamind, Kung Fu Panda 2, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, HTTYD 2, Kung Fu Panda 3, and HTTYD 3.   They just have a lot of good movies. And personally, I think every single one of the movies I just listed out is better than any movie in the Toy Story franchise.	1642880952.0	saahar	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saahar/i_have_never_really_understood_the_appeal_of/	I have never really understood the appeal of Pixar as a studio, and frankly, I prefer Dreamworks over both it and Disney.
i88d3tsr	If you are blessed with great genetics and naturally look really good, to a point where you could easily be a model then I believe you have the most overpowered aspects a human can have.  I know there are other things you can have which are also extremely overpowered, something like just being really disciplined and being a charismatic spokesman, you'd definitely be more successful in life however those are all things which you actually have to master and work for.  Life is not all about the looks, I get it, also good looking people have their own problems, just like how billionaires can also have their own problems.  However I strongly believe that just the face that you look good, you will go through life with much more ease.  You avoid bullying in your childhood which most likely makes you have less self esteem issues than people who don't look great.  Looking good for most people also equals being naturally charismatic, many teachers respect a child who just looks "cute" more than a child who says the same thing but doesn't look like he came from model parents.	1642881073.0	saais6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saais6/looking_good_is_one_of_the_most_overpowered/	Looking good is one of the most overpowered aspects you can have as a human being.

74oqmu1r	So a couple nights ago someone on Reddit posted about her boyfriend making it clear to her, that if she was to become pregnant, and she didn't abort, he would break up with her, not supporting her or the child whatsoever.  I replyed as much as I believe in both participants having a voice in this huge decision, it needs to be discussed in adult conversation, with both coming to the conclusion together, supporting each other. That's what a healthy relationship would do to problem solve this. His way, or the highway, with threats is announcing, not only is he volunteering, he'd be a deadbeat dad, its a loveless relationship.  If you love someone, you wouldn't threaten,  threats. I was bombarded with people saying they were offended because they don't want kids and the guys being honest and has a right to not want kids so she shouldn't break up with him. I explained that the guy is 100% aloud to feel this way, but he's admitting he would be a deadbeat dad, if she didn't obey his wishes. One person even made the argument that a deadbeat dad is someone who has a child, and then doesn't support it. Apparently your not a deadbeat dad if you tell the female before she gets pregnant that you won't support her and the child before she's pregnant, you're off the hook if she gets pregnant.  So I'm not sure if this is an unpopular opinion, or if it was just a handful of lost souls , clueless what life's about.  Heres my unpopular opinion........  If you're responsible enough to play hide the weenie, then you're responsible enough to understand,  with playing hide the weenie, there's a chance of creating a child. If you announce to the person involved that if she doesn't obey you and get an abortion, your not supporting her or the child, that doesn't get you off the hook.  With this mindset, then every single adult life decisions that come up that you don't agree with your partner on, your breaking up with them. This is called controlling someone. It's also called mental abuse. It's also called toxic behavior creating an unhealthy relationship.  If these are your view's, than find someone who shares these views to have sex with, or quit having sex until you take responsibility for your own birth control.  With sex comes responsibilities.  Accept these responsibilities have consequences if something goes wrong during sex. Own that responsibility.  You can get your point across without threats. And you don't have to have sex if your partner doesn't agree with your commands.	1642882043.0	saavlc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saavlc/let_me_educate_some_members_of_reddit/	Let me educate some members of Reddit!!
4y2r6jqn	I like to practice, and advocate for, safe driving. There is nothing lower in my opinion than people who run red lights or dangerously speed. If you run them, it kills innocent people. If you’re someone who regularly runs red lights, and an app tells you that there’s a camera ahead so you just don’t run that particular red light, you won’t get caught and perhaps change anything. I think it completely defeats the purpose of the red light camera. The same thing goes for apps that tell you when police are around. For the people that are actually responsible and caring citizens, there won’t be a problem with police in the vicinity. Those who practice dangerous driving should learn their lessons and not be aided in their bad habits by an app.	1642882115.0	saawj1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saawj1/maps_shouldnt_tell_you_theres_red_light/	Maps shouldn’t tell you there’s red light cameras/police up ahead.

But it's world governments (mainly the US and USSR back in it's day) that should be doing more about global warming rather than pushing it off on the consumer.  Hundreds of nuclear bombs have been set off since it's inception. In the sea, and in the air. Hundreds of bombs have been set off IN THE ATMOSPHERE. In the early days, there was even concern that a nuclear explosion and set the atmosphere on fire and burn the planet. You're telling me that had nothing to do with global warming??  All that being said, I *try* to do my part. Avoid single use plastics, replaced sandwich bags with the silicone ones. If nothing else, it saves me some money. But, I don't feel even a little guilty for not being an "activist" or not "doing more".

I think of it as a badge of honor, and if you are running from the reality it feels cowardly to me. Jamie Lee Curtis was rocking a gray pixie cut and she was smokin.

If you fall in love with someone, the last thing on your mind should be how you met them.  You’re no better or worse than anyone if you met online or if your eyes locked across a crowded room. Honestly sometimes meeting online is better, you liked them for their bio/personality/common interests, not just you both found each other attractive so you talked to each other, then you happened to be a match.

Years ago I knew someone who had a dog and let it get so matted, didn’t have a haircut, went to the bathroom all over the house without cleaning it, like don’t own animals if you’re not ready you can get like an actual member of your family.

In fact, if the ending sucks, I don't even want to waste my time watching an otherwise good movie.  I prefer to have at least a vague idea of the plot of the movie I'm watching and how it ends before I watch it and I'll tell you why.  Being surprised by plot twists and unexpected endings add nothing to my experience. I just want to enjoy the movie and not worry about anything.

ehnxxko5	If one household makes $100,000 a year and another household makes $300,000 a year, many people would assume the household that makes more money would be happier. This just isn’t true. Sure the household with more income probably has more expensive vehicles and a fancier home, but those people are most likely just as happy in life as the lower income household. Both households have things they want that they can’t afford and that never really changes. People always want more and that’s just part of the human condition.   More money will not increase your level of happiness once you reach a certain income. Most people need food, shelter, transportation, health insurance, a job, a retirement fun, and a family to be happy. They also need a safety net just in case a catastrophe happens such as illness or job loss. Once those things are met, money no longer will make most people happier in their day to day lives.  Families living in lower income households could increase their level of happiness with more money. I’m not saying a poorer family can’t be happy, but the stressors of living in a lower income household are great enough that money could relieve some of that tension. For example, when someone in a lower income family is diagnosed with an illness, a question they might ask is: how the hell are we going to pay for this? Not having those worries and that stress increases overall happiness.	1642883861.0	sabisp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sabisp/happiness_is_only_increased_by_monetary_gains/	Happiness is only increased by monetary gains when the increases wealth provides life’s essentials.

3ox7wa97	Caffeine is considered a non issue by majority of the population. People let there kids have it without batting an eye. The amount of adults that can't function without a cup of coffee in the morning is ludicrous. The amount of people giving themselves or exacerbating anxiety and sleep problems is off the charts.   Caffeine should be treated like alcohol or cigarettes. Make it at least 18 to buy to keep kids from getting addicted to it at a young age and make the branding of it less attractive to children.   On a personal note, I drank about 3-4 mountain dews a day from the age of 10 to 18. Didn't officially stop caffeine until about 6 months ago. I sleep better, I don't feel like a junky in the morning looking for my fix, and my anxiety has pretty much entirely evaporated.   Obviously some people can handle caffeine and I have no issue with people using it. I think as an adult you should be able to do whatever you want with your own body.

i6wz9yjs	March 2, 2020 Hayden, Alabama (Blount County)   Breana’s body was found shortly after 12:00 pm in her bathroom at her home according to her husband, Steven. She was an RN and had worked the nightshift from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am. After doing her reports, she would normally get home around 8:00 am.                            ·       I received a phone call from her husband, Steven at 12:23. Steven said, “Hey, what are you doing?” I told him I was at work and had just finished eating lunch, what are you doing? He then said, “Well, you better get over here, your sister has done tried to kill herself.” He said it so nonchalantly, I didn’t believe him, and asked if he was being serious.  ·       When I arrived at their house, there were a lot of ambulances and police cars lining the street.  ·       I walked in and saw Steven sitting in the living room with his parents on either side of him. He was staring at the floor. His parents both had tears rolling down their faces and seemed very shook up, while he sat there extremely calm looking at the floor.  ·       I asked him what happened and he told me “I was standing outside, and heard a thump, but didn’t think anything of it. I thought maybe she had dropped her cell phone.” “I then left to go to the bank and the dump, and was gone for about an hour. When I got back, I noticed that there was a light on in the bathroom, but the door was shut.”  ·       He said he picked the lock with his fingernail to get in and she was lying on the floor with her head to the door and that there was a needle lying beside her on the floor. This was an 18g needle. There were other unopened needles found at the scene of various sizes, however, all of the puncture wounds appeared to be from an 18g needle. She had been an RN for 12 years, and would have known not to use an 18g needle.  ·       Her body had multiple bruises and injection sites – about 80. Her feet and hands were covered in bruises and injection sites. Her palms appeared to have defense wounds and her feet had bruises that looked like fingermarks. However, these were on the inside of her feet and did not look like they could have been made from dragging her, but from someone possibly holding her down.  ·       Two of Breana’s co-workers have told us they did not notice any marks or bruises on her that night.   🚩🚩🚩Red Flags🚩🚩🚩 The investigator stated that the paramedics said he was practically tripping over them trying to remove garbage from the bathroom while they were trying to save Breana’s life.   He gave three different timelines of the events that happened that day.  The investigator told us that he and Breana were arguing back and forth over an affair while she was working that night. While Steven had told us that she was in a good mood and they had been cutting up all night by text.   He refused to let the sheriff’s office search his truck, and he refused to let them have his phone.   ·       He joked about his handwriting not being legible, when asked to write his statement, so I had to write it for him.  ·       One of the officers working the scene was a family member, therefore the investigator was reluctant to question Steven as needed.  ·       The home was searched, nothing was found. Also, the next day, my Mother and I went to get clothes for her to wear for her funeral. We searched her entire panty drawer from top to bottom to find a decent pair of underwear and did not see anything out of the ordinary. A few days later he had planted a bloody napkin in that drawer. These photos are attached in comments.  ·       Two days later, after Breana’s death, two empty vials of fentanyl were found in a drawer in the spare bedroom.   ·       Steven found more evidence later on but never reported it. When I asked if they needed that evidence, I was told they already had enough.  ·       Several items were planted throughout the home where Steven led me to find them. (This was about a week after her death).  ·       Before the investigator left to obtain a search warrant for his truck, she instructed the other officers to watch Steven’s truck and not to move it. According to the investigator, the truck had been moved when she returned, along with the garbage.  ·       His uncle, who is a deputy at BCSO and family were allowed to stay inside the home the entire time.  ·       I was told by the investigator that there were family members of Steven’s there before the paramedics arrived. The paramedics station is a block and a half from Steven and Breana’s home. His parents live 5 miles (8-10 minutes) away.  ·       The original investigator, has now been removed from the case and from the Blount County Sherriff’s Department.  Breana worked two jobs, one full time at Princeton and the other was a part time job at Birmingham Surgery Center.	1642885590.0	sac5e9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sac5e9/the_mysterious_death_of_breana_noojin_nix/	The mysterious death of Breana Noojin Nix

3wvb8zx6	There's a lot of stigma, it seems, with someone not knowing how to do basic household chores and cook basic foods. Honestly it's undeserved criticism for a good portion of the population who has this issue.   I'm 29M, and I was quite lucky that my parents (though mostly my mom) had me start cooking, doing laundry, and other basic household chores starting at age 6. By the time I was about 8 or 9 years old, I could make a full, fairly complex meal for my entire family with no instruction from any adult, just the recipe. I could do everyone's laundry correctly, sanitize cleaning surfaces, vacuum, etc.   My sister on the other hand, was the exact opposite. She got upset and called me one day because she didn't know how to cook hot dogs. She wrapped bacon in plastic and microwaved it, almost starting a fire. She forgot half of the ingredients in brownies and they came out as black bricks... twice. Her laundry folding was atrocious. My parents, for reasons unknown to me, didn't spend as much time teaching her these basics as they did to me. I think the fact that I was the first born had something to do with it and they were able to spend much more time teaching me, and I became pretty self-sufficient enough to help with these tasks once both parents started working full time.   The only thing that my wife knows how to cook well is stir fry, and that's it. It's good stir fry, but even with with recipe for anything else, something goes wrong. Her laundry folding is also terrible. Her parents were both working two jobs to keep the family afloat, so she was never really taught how to do these things. They basically lived on takeout meals because it was easier than cooking.   That being did, both my wife and sister can change a tire, put chains on tires, and assemble a piece of furniture (without instructions) with no problems. I can't do any of these things, no matter how many times it's been shown to me. For whatever reason I just can't seem to grasp these other "basic" things. And I personally don't think it's a big deal.  Should all people know the basics in order to be self-sufficient? Yes, in an ideal world, but for some it's harder than others. They can't exactly help that their parents either were too busy to teach them these things, or were super spoiled and mom and dad did EVERYTHING for them, or they just can't get a grasp on how to do certain things. I don't think I know ANYONE who can do *every* "basic thing" that adults should "know" how to do.	1642885964.0	saca1d	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saca1d/theres_nothing_wrong_with_not_knowing_how_to_do/	There's nothing wrong with not knowing how to do laundry, boil an egg, or other "basics" as an adult.
1rdgeiyo	So for seemingly most Americans, weddings are seen as “your most special day” when the bride and groom should get anything they want, indulge themselves, and it should be this expensive fairytale type thing.   The couple gets to be treated like celebrities or royalty, and they end up focusing on themselves rather than their guests.  As a result, it’s becoming more common to exclude children from wedding celebrations because they’re seen as an inconvenience on a day that should be all about “me.”   I grew up in a Mexican-American culture, so I view things a certain way. And to me, “childfree” weddings feel empty…off in some way.   Personally, I LOVED going to weddings as a kid. A whole day of hanging out with my cousins, aunts and uncles and other family, running around, and going wild on the dance floor? Hell yeah!  Honestly, thinking back, some of my favorite memories as a kid were at weddings. They were basically big family reunions.   My wife has a similar fondness. As a kid, seeing the bride was like seeing a real life princess. And during our own wedding, she made sure to dance with every little girl or boy who wanted to!  And I loved having kids at my own wedding. They added so much fun and life to the party, I wouldn’t have it any other way.  Obviously, my opinion is based on my experience. But to me, weddings without kids are just missing something.	1642886032.0	sacava	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sacava/childfree_weddings_are_not_nearly_as_fun_as/	“Childfree” weddings are not nearly as fun as regular weddings

BUT it does seem like there’s a specific type of gamer, one who spends a lot of time on places like Reddit, YouTube, or Twitter, who are simply *never fucking happy*.  Literally every time a video game comes out, without fail, you can find these jokers ranting and crying online. Everything is bad, everything is “not like it once was”, everything “would be better if they just listened to me”.  Heres an idea — any time a new game comes out, go to YouTube and search “*new game* review”, and you’ll be bombarded with 100+ videos that are all a different variation of “*EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS NEW GAME*.  Do people realize that they feel this way because they take video games way too seriously and have allowed to become the biggest part of their life?

I think it can only make you more empathic, prone to understand and admit different views and be more human to a certain extent.  It’s not possible to get an addiction from shrooms, and it’s one of the least dangerous drugs (including alcohol).

I've watched around 25 movies of all genres this month, so I went into this with an open mind, but was really baffled by the extremely positive reception.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it was incredibly cliché in its plot. I found one critical review that hit the nail on the head, which concludes that it's exhausting to be "Sundanced to death". It's a perfectly cliché Sundance Film Festival movie: scrappy family, goofy humor involving sex, wanting to win a competition, boyfriend messes up and has to make up, anxiety about choosing between going off to school or staying with family.  The movie had a lot of bright spots for sure. It had decent acting, plenty of humorous moments, and it made a deaf family relatable, which was nice.

ig6pm94y	There is a misconception I have encountered in my life that social work and healthcare jobs are "easy" and "everyone can do them". This is absolutely not true, and it's completely valid to say that one cannot do this type of job, similarly to how some people cannot be good at other types of jobs.   Social work and healthcare jobs are absolutely not easy. They are some of the hardest jobs out there and yes, they do require a specific type of person to do well at them. Society really undervalues the type of skillset required to do these jobs. Just because in some cases being social worker does not require a degree, doesnt mean anyone can do it. I think pushing people towards jobs they cannot do is going to ultimately be very harmful. It creates inneficient, frustrated and angry workers, which could end up being a disaster for everyone.	1642890087.0	sadri5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sadri5/social_healthcare_work_is_not_for_everyone/	Social / healthcare work is not for everyone

Our ability to make tools and buildings was the first step toward planetary destruction.  We made edged weapons and explosives; we became much more effective at killing.  We developed the plow; we destroyed natural areas and enslaved animals in an effort to grow food for ourselves at the expense of countless other species of plants and animals.  We built ships; we spread diseases around and could enact genocide and species destruction worldwide.  We developed medicine; we live longer and there are more of us, displacing other living things.  We discovered electricity; our greed for energy sources has decimated natural areas on land and sea and exacerbated war.  We built spaceships; now we can leave the planet to destroy other worlds.

Don't get me wrong, if you cook any meat with no seasoning or sauce it will be bland.

Like it was a decent meal but I would have enjoyed another meat with sauce or seasoning better...  I find this the case going to restaurants too.

3f1v9lc6	Ok imagine if there's a crisis in Namibia and you want to do something about it. You try and raise your support but people are going to ask why do you support or care for Namibians? If you say because they need our help and it's the right thing to do, are you being really sincere or are you showing your kindness as a way for wider public to pay attention to you and for you to be revered as a saint?   Unfortunately it's mainly the latter. It's seem that so called allies are only interested in the praise they'll receive from the communities they claim to represent and people in general. Well excuse me but I think that's incredibly disingenuous. If you only care about something or someone because of what others might think than what's the point of bothering with that thing in the first place? Ask yourself why virtually every celebrity panders to every cause under the sun but do little to nothing to better the problem. Only for people to say that you're a good person or you're such a powerful ally but here's the thing: You aren't actually a good person but rather a selfish bastard who lectures others for not sharing the same views as you and protests at every instance as  a way to stick it your parents.  It's the same with most abolitionists of the 19th century. They hated slavery but had quite the same racial views as the slave masters, proving that they were only interested in praise and appearance. I believe that is the same principle on why straight men want to stick up for rights of men with different orientations but are many times repulsed at the idea of those same men living with them. And yet these same people call the rest of society bigoted.   Now is this to say all people who speak up for causes they support are like this? No of course not but it is a difficult pattern of self-righteousness and vanity that really harms the conversation rather than advance us forward. I believe this trend is much more greater than it was in the past thanks to social media. Now millions of young people are advocating for something that doesn't affect them on a personal basis. Why don't you go seriously work down at soup kitchens or go to this foreign country and work with the people there? Because you find it much more satisfying to get confirmation from people who are not of that situation rather than people suffering.   If you truly want to make a difference, start by abandoning the feeling of smugness and just assist someone regardless if you get attention or not. Then you can be considered an ally.   TL;DR: People with absolutely no struggles at all try to speak on behalf of said community need to take a good look in the mirror and realize they're no different from everyone else.   P.S. Bojack Horseman was the show that help me realize this.

But, for the most part, I can imagine living in China to be quite a eye-opening, beneficial experience, providing you follow the rules.   Mainstream media and plain word of mouth are what I believe to be the cause of this hatred towards China.

3sfdxt1i	Depression is at an all time high in human history and for most people, their depression is the result of a poor diet consisting of highly processed foods leading to an unhealthy gut microbiome. What is our gut microbiome you ask? The gut microbiome is an incredibly diverse array of organisms that exist in every person's GI tract. It is believed that there is more bacteria in our intestines than there are cells that make up an entire person (that's a lot of bacteria). This microbiome is responsible for many functions in the body including regulating your immune system (very important right now for obvious reasons), regulating metabolism (you wonder why you can't lose weight no matter how hard you try?), and producing 95% of our bodies serotonin (the hormone responsible for mood regulation, well-being, and happiness). If you only eat highly processed foods and drink sugary drinks, you are not fueling your gut microbiome correctly and damaging it. That means your serotonin output is drastically lower than it could be and that could be the root cause of your depressive symptoms. Fixing your gut microbiome and allowing the bacteria to produce enough serotonin could very well cure your depression along with helping you become a happier and healthier person.  Here is a link to a research article if you would like to read more about this topic.

I've played it you literally only can do two things: Roll and dodge the same easy to dodge attack thrown at you and toss can't-remember-the-name until the over and over(which is the quickest/most effective way to catch Pokemon), OR you can do the same boring turn based combat that has less moves and serves NO PURPOSE besides it HAVING to be there because it's a Pokemon game.  Go check out a really old Fan game called Pokemon Generations, the combat should be that. It should be more like an arcade fighter or Pokken, that would have been so much better than this pointless, tedious crap. There's literally NOTHING outside of that besides SOME trainer fights that again serve no purpose other than it's a Pokemon game.

4v92qojf	Morality is subjective, and the universe is indifferent to our existence.  If morality was objectively true, it wouldn’t vary the way it does from person to person or culture to culture.   If morality was objective, we would be able to make a moral statement, for example “murder is wrong” and then it would be testable and verifiably immoral to murder.   But we know thats not the case.   In the case of murder, some people think its justifiable to murder in self defence and doing so is moral, some even will say you are morally obligated to defend yourself and others, while others would argue that you should not kill another living thing under any circumstances.  Think of the worst thing someone could do, something you would never do, ill bet you can imagine someone doing it and justifying it too.  If morality varies person to person, how can we judge a persons actions as being “Good” or “Evil”? We would only be able to judge it against their own morality, which we may or may not agree with.  Good and Evil don’t exist, the universe doesn’t care what we do, only we care.	1642894234.0	saf9y8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saf9y8/good_and_evil_doesnt_exist/	Good and Evil doesn’t exist

However, I do think the characters are a bit overrated. I don’t why it is but just the way they’re written and it never feels like they take any responsibility for their actions and when they do it’s often because their talked into it by other characters and not by their own volition.Also unpopular opinion, I always hate it when Jade did her Tori impression.

I understand why these services exist, and why someone might NEED to use them. Though I still think they are a detriment to us.  They are taking away from valuable human interaction, face to face interaction, that we need as a social species. Not only that, but I think that these services are making people lazy. It’s become far too easy to get shit at the push of a button. Even ordering on DoorDash you still don’t talk to the driver, they just leave it at your step and take a picture of it. It’s weird, lazy, and can have lasting negative consequences. Take the time out of your day to go to the stores and order in person.

We can’t keep pushing them for therapy, because I guarantee you that is the very last thing on their minds. We can’t speak for anyone else. If anything, it is selfish of us to choose the fate of other people, it’s as if we think we’re entitled to choose for them. Euthanasia should be legal as a simple, peaceful, effective manner of ending someone’s life if they so please.

e05a8vdo	i love my hero academia. after the first episode, i was absolutely hooked. i love the characters, the story, the animation, the humor, and pretty much everything about the series. however, i refuse to say that the series is flawless because it definitely isn\`t. there are a couple of things i don\`t like about the series. and one thing i don\`t like is just how much it tends to drag things out.   this wasn\`t that much of a problem during the couple of arcs but it really started to become a problem during the shie hassaikai arc. don\`t get me wrong. this is by no means a bad story arc. actually, it\`s quite good as a matter of fact. however, my main problem is that it drags things out quite a bit. for example, when two henchmen try to get in the hero\`s way, emagichi volunteers to hold them back while the heroes continue on. we then get a full episode dedicated to just this fight. and keep in mind, each episode of my hero academia is 25 minutes long. that means a full 25 minutes of very little being contributed to the overall story aside from emagichi gaining confidence. what i would have done was cross cut between the heroes and the fight and just have that be a recurring motive for the next few episodes. but instead, the writers decided to just stop the plot to give us a cool fight scene. and then, there\`s the episode where we get kirishima\`s backstory. i do confess that kirishima has one of the best backstories on the show. however, again, a full episode takes place in his past. what i would have done would be to go the godfather part 2 route. half the episode would take place in the present day and the other half would be flashbacks. on my blu ray disc of the first half of season 4, this arc takes up pretty much the whole dvd. and guess what? on part 2 of season 4, it still isn\`t over as the first two episodes on part two are still part of the arc.  again, i love the show but, it really doesn\`t need to spend 15 episodes on arcs that could have been wrapped up in 10.	1642896882.0	sag79i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sag79i/my_hero_academias_biggest_problem_is_that/	my hero academia`s biggest problem is that storylines are dragged out for WAAYY too long
aq84wsjs	Everyone's obsessing over Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, and Tom Hardy, but I truly feel James Corden is a terrific, unconventional, inspired follow-up to Daniel Craig.  1. Idris Elba, the current favorite for many, is 49 years old. Starting a Bond franchise at that age isn't ideal. James Corden is a fresh-faced 43. 2. We've done the suave, sexy, chiselled Bond to death (literally). James Corden can bring in a fresh angle to the story – how does an everyday guy without a supermodel body become the greatest spy in MI6? 3. With Hiddleston or Hardy, it'll be hard to differentiate their interpretation from Craig's because they're all so sexy. James Corden will naturally be completely different from Daniel Craig, 4. For anyone still concerned about his well-upholstered figure, he already lost 25-30 pounds over the last couple of years and has thus proven capable of a body transformation. 5. At 27M, he has among the highest subscribers for a late night show, allowing him to heavily promote the film and ensure financial success. 6. With Ocean's Eight, Cats, Cinderella, among others, he has steadily been building his acting resume and is primed for a big break.	1642896913.0	sag7pj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sag7pj/james_corden_is_a_great_pick_for_the_next_james/	James Corden is a great pick for the next James Bond.
609c1xp0	Being an extrovert is always portrayed as people who are kinda high energy and feed off energy of others.   That in itself is pretty true.   However!!!   People don’t take into account that us extroverts actually DO feed off of the energy of others. We crave human contact.   So when we DON’T have it, it sucks. There’s no motivation, you feel like shit, and overall are just… you’re just deprived.   It is extremely overhyped. I like being an extrovert, I like being able to interact with the people the way I do, but it just hits so hard when we don’t get the contact that we crave.

Just make your thing and post it onto your fan pages and repeat right? So where to people start this off from? Using their talents or hobbies and what they are passionate about.  So as an observer of this trend as a *creative* myself - I find these posts of some dog shit that someone's built for the sake of making *anything* and hoping some algorithm somewhere flies it into traction.

Shortly after, the LotR movies came out and I fell in love with the world again and tried picking up the books again, only to be defeated by confusion and bored once again.  Yet after many reruns of the Hobbit (book) and the LotR movies, I still saw promise in the books because of how amazing the world is, so I have tried consistently to read the book series.   I've finally managed to read most of it, and now I have decided to give up because in my own opinion, they're not that great. Tolkien focuses so much on the world he's created that he leaves the character development to one side, it's very two-dimensional and well, simplistic. The movies pulled that side off so damn well in comparison, because they cut out all the needless rubbish and the sheer amount of names (people, locations, ages, and all sorts) one has to remember.  You can get to certain sections of the books, where it will be pages upon pages of dialogue, where the most you'll get outside of the speech quotations, is "<Insert name of one of the gazillion people in the convo> said... And then straight onto another lengthy monologue by another character. The lack of description, like "he boomed with a disconcerted look" (rather than just "he said"), or in character emotion and development, or the world itself (rather than just place names and their history) is a real sore point for me.  Then you have the sheer amount of songs, that especially if you listen to it as an audiobook, it comes across as more like the LotR Disney sing-along. It takes the seriousness that the movie encapsulated so well, out of it. Especially when you get to Tom Bombadil (I have given up reading the first book so many times because of that chapter you're introduced to Bombadil). Just oh my god, the seriousness of the themes it tries to portray, are totally undermined by the quaint, jolly and rather childish (like a fairly tale sort of childishness) parts of the book, which are numerous and ridden all over the books.  I was really wanting a deep exploration of what is good and evil, not a two-dimensional, black & white, portrayal of them, and how this and the ongoing events affected the characters. In the Movies, Aragorn has an internal battle about his role as the Heir of Insildur, whereas in the books, that's pretty much done and dusted by the council of Elrond, and the sword gets forged immediately and theres no internal conflict within Aragorn. He just accepts his place and gets on with it. He's not human, he doesn't have the depth that humans have, it's just like a Wikipedia entry on some historical figure. I've read history books that have humanised their figures better than this piece of fiction.   Then there is the waffling in, the sheer amount of waffling, some of the most impactful scenes in the movie happens in a few minutes, whereas the book will take dozen upon dozens of pages to make a SHALLOWER point of the same scene. It ruins the delivery and takes away the emotional impact and urgency of their situation - because most of it is filled up with histiography of the world, and maybe some comment about "How quaint and jolly Bilboo is in this situation" (in comparison to the movie, how the ring has affected Bilbo is MUCH LESS discussed and the focus is on how jolly he is - it discusses it, but because there is so much pointless content added to it, the impact is taken away).  If you like the book, that's fine, but after finishing the Two Towers, I am done with it. It's a waste if my time and a huge disappointment because it's a fantastic world, but it's lacking in character, because the characters in the world are stale... Tolkien placed too much on world building and not the actual characters within that world (he chose quantity of characters over quality of characters).	1642902866.0	sai7fw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sai7fw/the_lord_of_the_rings_book_series_arent_just/	The Lord of the Rings book series aren't just overrated, but are boring.

Same with dancing, playing an instrument, drawing, etc. I’m not saying to just straight up insult the person’s act, but people need to realise that they really aren’t good at what they’re going, or at least not as good as they’re making themselves out to be.

4vc94ka0	It’s been well supported that nurses face some of the highest rates of work place violence, however the blame for violence in the hospital setting is often placed on the victim, rather than the perpetrators. Of course some of this violence comes from people who are obviously not in control of themselves, such as dementia patients or patients with serious mental illness. These people should be exempt from this boundary. However if you are mentally sound and choose to assault a HCP you should be thrown out.Anyone who assaulted an employee at any other job would be denied services without hesitation. If you’re well enough to throw a punch you don’t need hospital assistance. I understand being sick and relying on others when you are typically independent is incredibly frustrating.

46n93q1i	Maybe one day I can get over this hang-up, but when I see pregnancy announcements I don't usually feel joy, I just feel jaded and sad. Children are seen as a blessing, but I see another carbon footprint. If children are blessings then the people they grow into must be too--but the average person isn't seen as a blessing or miracle, they're just another person.  This is going to sound so neckbeardy and I wish I knew how to phrase it differently, but whatever.. For me, to see children as a blessing is to see the growth of the human race as a blessing, and I don't. I value people as individuals but as a whole I see the way humanity digs its own grave and the collective problems we bring upon ourselves just by nature of our existence (not the fault of the average person-- we're just meeting our needs and I understand that) and I can't bring myself to let it go. Then, at worst, we obviously have people who intentionally inflict pain and suffering. Those people were once children too, but they're not blessings.  I know kids are a blessing to their families (as they should be) and I do think that all children should be protected and loved, but my anxiety about the world on a larger scale takes away from what otherwise would be a positive view of children.	1642904197.0	sain4c	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sain4c/i_dont_see_children_as_a_blessing/	I don't see children as a blessing.

2voud1qq	Throw in a requirement that you’ve needed to have x number of years work experience if you’d like, but with MBA’s and the like becoming many companies’ minimum education level for any real growth, using someone’s undergraduate performance from 5, 10, or more years ago is unfair and unrealistic. A huge number of people aren’t working in the industry they studied for, especially with the drastic changes in the workforce over the past 10-15 years.   Very few people are the same person they were as an undergrad, and many are much more than their transcripts show. I am in favor of letters of recommendation/statements of purpose and the like and am not advocating for it to be free, but if you have the determination and are willing to pay for the program at your chosen institution, you should be able to sign up and earn your graduate degree.   Being 100% online with recorded lectures, there is no limit to how many students can be involved and if a student learns they can’t handle it, they drop out and the school still has the tuition they paid. Lessen the number of essays students need to complete and the workload of professors will not be a concern since they can simply use online tests that are automatically graded.   Yes I’m just a bit bitter. I’m not even close to the same person I was when I graduated and deeply regret not taking my undergrad as seriously as I should have. That said, I would like to continue my education and help improve my work performance and future possibilities, but GPA or GRE/GMAT requirements make it nearly impossible to meet what is needed.	1642906298.0	sajazt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sajazt/if_you_have_a_bachelors_degree_and_are_at_least_5/	If you have a Bachelors degree and are at least 5 years removed from graduation, 100% online Masters programs should not have admission requirements.

d46i4sug	I've been slowly cooking up this opinion by some posts I've seen about the fact that kids are starting to take part of sexual acts from even a younger age than before so let's cut to the chase.  The only viable solution I see for kids to get actually educated on this matter and to not go towards this is by getting educated on it, no more taboo and no more "Pollen" or "The Stork" talk.  The birds and the bees need to disappear and this are the reasons why.  Numero 1: We live in the easy access to internet age, where everything is about sex because the majority of it's users are teenagers and adults and that's what they like to see. The problem roots from the fact that even young kids are able to use it and because of the fact that they are born with it, they can surf it really quite well, so even though if you think that your child is innocent let me tell you, even if that's true it won't be for long due to modern media portrayal of arousing images for horny spectators that YOUR KIDS can easily be aimed at.  Numero 2: You keep treating them dumb or feeling uncomfortable around the idea of explaining it and instead of going right to the chase you create this whole big story of a really important matter. Sex is as important as... I dunno... some subjects taught school... There's a whole world behind it and being part of sexual acts is just the tip of the iceberg, the more you keep posponing it the less time you have to teach your kid what's important. So throw away the stigma you have for this subject, is sex and it might be uncomfortable for you but in the near future it might mean everything for your offspring to know about. If they are not educated enough they are prone to the bad part of sex life (STDs, accidental pregnancies, infections, etc)  Numero 3: This might be the most unpopular one of them all but you need to grow the fuck up. Sex is real in this world and as long as your kid is part of this world it will be very real for them too. The best way to treat this is face forward and with honesty: Do not scare them away from it, do not lie to them about it, do not pospone the talk longer than necessary, and certainly do not avoid any involvement from it.  &#x200B;  **BIG SUMMARY:**  There's no way your kid will never know about sex, it's only natural for a kid to develop sexual tendencies at a certain age and therefore to try and participate on them. And not only that but they probably ain't that stupid, they know how to use a computer, even if they do not get aroused yet they have some exposure to sex already.

Yeah sure, things are pretty awful nowadays and we all need to vent, laugh at something/someone or, ultimately, finding an anonymous punchbag to publicly shame and hate. But lately even the smallest thing in that forum receives a tsunami of hate even with little to no context that justifies it, and of course if you point that out you're either a Karen too or a Karen lover. People may get doxxed and suffer disproportionate consequences over some stupid screenshot taken out of context in a hate sub, it happened so many times before, yet people is so crazy and won't stop to think about it once the first insult comes.  Well you know what? At least those "Karens" can stand up for themselves and speak up for whatever (they THINK) is right, unlike 80%-90% of the average redditor who self-peeceives as superior for slandering and roasting some random person while at the same time crying about how bad their "sOcIaL aNxIeTy" is and how they can't manage to tell their server that they got their order wrong.	1642909696.0	sakcwu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sakcwu/not_all_karens_are_a_karen/	Not all Karens are "a Karen"

7ggapwup	seriously this kind of talk implies if they made the game less complex then there would be less bugs and patches on day one. And honestly if that’s the case then just do that seriously. you can’t say final fantasy 7 remake is more polished and complex for the ps5 charge an extra 10$ and the pc version is a mess.   you can’t charge us extra money for cyberpunk and wait over a year to make the game playable.   You can’t charge full price for a game like Warcraft reforge and put it in a worse state than it was on the original 2002 release   It’s really interesting how a game like hades which isn’t the most complex is considered one of the best in recent history and surprise surprise it’s not a buggy mess.

I think it would be much more productive to just study topics that you want to excel at by setting time and money aside to buy books and learn things by yourself you are much more likely to remember it because you don’t have to actively listen to a professor. I understand that lifetime friendships are made in college and it is an unforgettable experience, but logically there is no reason to give vast amounts of money except to just say that you graduated from so and so.

himk3c93	These people tend to assume that,  people only go to the gym out of vanity in order to try and get nice bodies to attract the opposite sex. In reality, most people lift weights and exercise for the serotonin release. And Even if a person is going to the gym for vain reasons, like solely for the purpose of trying to be more attractive. There is nothing wrong with trying to gain more confidence in a healthy and productive way. If someone’s abusing steroids or over exercising than there’s a deeper problem that needs to be addressed.

aaqcsqyv	Saw it one time and that was that.  DiCaprio has several films with better replay value:  1. The Wolf of Wall Street 2. Inception 3. The Revenant 4. Blood Diamond 5. Catch me if you can  That’s just to name a few.   Everybody knows how the movie ends based on the true story from 1912 and original movie from 1953.  Yes there were a lot of superb actors and James Cameron did a good job directing the film.  Celine Dion’s song was a sensation as well.  But here’s where the proverbial ‘ship hits the iceberg’ - take a closer look at the other classic films that debuted in the same year as Titanic:  1. As Good as it Gets (1997) 2. Good Will Hunting (1997) 3. LA Confidential (1997) 4. Men in Black (1997) 5. Donnie Brasco (1997)  That’s just to name a few.  How many movies on that list are you watching before Titanic in 2022?  Fun Fact: All 5 movies combined had a film budget of $220 million  Titanic’s budget was $200 million ($330 million in 2022 via inflation).  Yes they made it back 10X at the box office | Put that much money behind any film and it’s going to receive the proper marketing and promotion.   Keep in mind this is in the 90’s (no at home movie options and early dvd releases came until the 21st century).  Overall the movie is a good first watch; especially if you don’t know about the true story.  It’s not even a Top 5 Remake:  1. Ocean’s Eleven (2001) 2. The Thing (1981) 3. Casino Royale (2006) 4. The Departed (2006) 5. Scarface (1983)  That’s just to name a few.

7wpjxbja	So often will I hear stories about someone getting raped or sexually harassed, or it happening to a fictional character, and most often they all have alcohol involved. Whenever I see or hear them, my belief that alcohol as an inherently dangerous thing is affirmed and is a firm contributer to sexual assault.  I also think the same things in regards to parties, specifically college parties, because due to the fact that alcohol and drugs are prevalent during parties. I once saw a statistic that said that 1 in 5 rapes that happen in college happen at college fraternities. Which is an insane statistic.  I also have known people who have done sexual crimes while under the influence. My sister, while drunk, tried to get one of my cousins friends to sleep with her, which was sexual harassment.

izte72o	Notes: English is not my first language; my autocorrector may do some dumb "corrections"; posting using my phone.    Have you ever watched a movie where you see a lonely person that's actually awsome, but no one knows because he/she is simply too insecure to talk to others? And them some cool dude comes to save the day and dig out the qualities of this uncomprehended person? Me too.   And, just to be clear, I do think that, most of times, people become lonely because they have problems to aproach strangers and talk to them. Making new friends is just too hard for some people. Hell, I am one of those people.   BUT, and there comes my unpopular opinion, sometimes, these lonely people simply deserve to be and stay that way.   Sometimes, they may have a nasty personality. Or may be too rude. Or narcisistic. Or manipulative. Or violent...  You get the point. Some of them are people that no one want around because of the simple fact that they are not worth the time and effort necessaries to build a relationship.  We don't live in a movie. Not everyone is a diamond in the rough.

7ylnyir6	When a person or group says they practice tolerance, what are they really saying?  At first glance, it sounds great! It seems to convey inclusivity as an action. In reality, however, it isn’t an action at all. Consider the following definition, courtesy of Oxford Languages dictionary.  Tolerance:  the capacity to endure continued subjection to {something}.  By definition, tolerance is the act of doing nothing.  You can even hate what you tolerate. How likely is that to effect long term change?  I think tolerance is a buzzword and a shortcut to critical thinking.   So what is my answer, since I am criticizing a whole movement?  Kindness:  the quality of being generous, helpful, and caring about other people, or an act showing this quality. -Oxford Languages Dictionary  Kindness requires both action and empathy. In, short, the effort needed to affect change.   The best part--you don't have to change your beliefs to be kind to someone.

7trz8yid	I've always heard this argument that the dress code is stupid and that teachers are sexualizing students for pointing out that they're wearing something scandalous.    While I understand some instances in a lot of dress codes are a bit extreme. (No visible straps. No showing shoulders. Etc) I think that a teacher that doesn't want you to be wearing something that violates the dress code is most of the time acting in good faith.   They're most likely just trying to protect you from other students being disgusting. I know people like to act like High schoolers don't sexualize each other but I know that's definitely not the case a lot of the time.   Am I saying the dress code is perfect? No absolutely not but the focus should be on removing silly and unnecessary rules like straps rather then acting like every teacher that cares enough to tell you to wear something less revealing/longer is a pedophile.

7bwcbmco	In today’s world, it seems that no one really gives a shit if you say you’re sorry for something. It doesn’t erase the wrong, just reinforces your guilt. People don’t want to hear “I’m sorry”, they want you to have not done the thing you’re sorry for in the first place, myself included. I had a former friend apologize for all the shitty things he did and I could care less about his “apology”. I just wished those things never happened in the first place. I think a better phrase would be, “It’ll never happen again.”   If you demonstrate you’re sorry, like truly sorry, that’s one thing…like buying your roommate more ice cream after eating his without permission.

tm1lu	I have noticed this thing on reddit the past 2 years, the concept of feeling like you are "the main character" usually in reference to some kind of negative behavior. I understand why it's grounded in that because of how selfish some people can really be, a lot of people too to be honest. But guess what, indeed you are the main character, you are the protagonist in your story, your life, your destiny, your purpose. Yes your life should be centered around you(around yourselves if you  are couple) and nothing is wrong with that. Because absolutely no one other than maybe the closest family members will ever care about you, your needs or your desires as much as you will. So yes behave like you are the main character be in control of your life absolutely nothing is wrong with that.	1642916421.0	samctm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/samctm/you_are_the_main_character_and_nothing_is_wrong/	You are the main character and nothing is wrong with thinking that.

I have never seen such a big beer brand as such, and I hear people praising it.  But gosh, it tastes like water! Like if it has a yellow food coloring in it, ewwww... how can someone say that like beer and, at the same time, say that Heineken is good?

Seeing all these reactions from American cinemas has me in disbelief, people screaming and shouting when anything significant happens, having full on conversations throughout the rest of the film...

mro27fk	I’ll preface this with I have my own personal beliefs about college but I absolutely understand the difficulty that goes into getting accepted and attending one regardless of how flawed the institution of higher learning is particularly in America.   Posting that you got into a college, especially a competitive one, is something I have no problem with. It is an accomplishment a lot of high schoolers (as well as general adults) work hard for and sharing your accomplishments on social media is pretty common but when you make that your entire profile (including the college you’re attending in your bio, multiple posts about said college, discussing your frat/sorority politics,etc.) I truly don’t understand what’s to gain.   My biggest problem is that I feel like this, along with the media, creates a fantasizing image of the “college experience” and contributes even more to the culture that is cultivated around college in America. I’m currently in college and it’d be hypocritical for me to tell people not to go or not to post anything that would remotely attract others to college. It only irks me when it feels like a cult and it’s almost like you’re giving your college free advertising to convince other people why they should go into enormous debt because of your sororities matching uniforms.	1642918723.0	samznb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/samznb/making_the_college_you_attend_a_personality_is/	Making The College You Attend A Personality Is Weird

Nothing should be declared/ruled out completely and should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering that the overwhelming sample size on the majority of surveys tends to be nowhere near the full amount of people being requested to do it.  If we look at something like looking at the trends of what people are buying, you can make it more reliable data because it is something recorded without even having to ask people what they bought and I think we need to start realizing the differences to how different surveys are recorded because it is not always the case on the wider scale than what is always considered 'correct' on a mainstream scale.	1642919346.0	san5oc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/san5oc/surveys_should_not_be_considered_legitimate/	Surveys should not be considered legitimate unless everyone takes part in them.
2glgahr3	There's several reasons for this. I just find it more convenient that during the winter all I have to do is put on another layer or two, and I'm warm again. During summer, when it gets really hot, you can only take off so many clothes before it turns illegal. Even being stripped, you still have the potential of being way too uncomfortably hot. I hate the heat.  I just find the cold more comfortable. I love the air in the winter; I like the increased darkness, the lack of insects, and the peacefulness of nature. Although snow looks really disgusting after days of sitting along a road, I love the way it looks when it's fresh.   I don't care much for winter sports, but I do occasionally like skiing. Its not a highlight of my liking for Winter. It's just an add on.   A part of me likes the cold because I find my peace and enjoyment being in very forested, mountainous and temperate areas of the world. Of course, these areas are colder, and thus, are more isolated. Because people don't like the cold. They prefer the heat. And being an introvert, I'm fine with that. I do like human interaction, but don't want to be bombarded in the hustle and bustle of modern society. I'd rather live a more simple life, in a small temperate town surrounded by mountains and big trees. And so, I like the cold because it makes me happy to think about me in this sort of peaceful setting.    That being said, I know humans are warm blooded. Naturally, we enjoy warmer weather. It feels really good to me on a really cold day to walk into a heated building, or step foot in a warm car. Or take a hot shower. BUT, at the end of the day, my opinion always falls on the cold side. I know this is very much an unpopular opinion, which is why I shared it to this community.	1642919418.0	san6fr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/san6fr/i_prefer_colder_weather_over_hot_weather/	I prefer colder weather over hot weather
45u5fpzn	I’m sorry, but I’m done listening to people taking a jab at the pharma industry and how they rip you off of money to get basic healthcare.   First of all, what is “basic” healthcare? A disease, irrespective of how basic or complicated it may be, takes about billions of dollars worth research to make drugs for. Discovering a new drug is a tedious process because it involves understanding a particular pathological process at a molecular level, then picking out one biomolecule from one of the steps in this process, synthesizing hundreds of compounds that would bind specifically to this target biomolecule, selecting the one with the best effectiveness and the safest side effects profile, formulating that compound in the most optimized drug delivery system and then sending it out for clinical trials. All these steps takes money, buddy. And by the way, this is probably an oversimplified version of the actual drug discovery and development process. The actual process is a lot more challenging and intricate than what I just described.  And reaching the clinical trails may sound like a big feat, but it only gets brutal from there. Only 1% of all these drug discoveries ever make it through all three stages of clinical trials. And on an average, a clinical trial for a drug costs about a billion dollars. Imagine the loss of capital in those 99% drugs that don’t make it through clinical trials.  If we don’t pay the price for these medicines, the pharma industry wouldn’t have the resources to sustain it’s Research and Development process which only aims at improving the quality of our lives.  Yes, this industry at times has not had a clean slate of records when it comes to ethical practices. And I also agree that healthcare needs to be more accessible.  But it’s the only industry that ensures you and I stay alive and don’t lose to Darwin’s Survival of the Fittest theory.

a5w6nwth	When I got into my first programming class they just made way more sense to me. Especially with inequalities. As a dyslexic, signs like ≤  used to be confusing. I used to flip them around all time whenever I wasnt supposed to. But signs like <= are easier. Instead of relying on direction, its more orientation if you know what I mean. If you think of them as one sign instead of two, less than points out and vice versa for greater than no matter how you flip them around. Programming doesnt really have special thing for < or >, but it still better to me. And you can read them like it's own little language.  ! "Does not"  = "equals"  When you combine them !=, "does not equal too" Also I dont understand why they taught us to multiply with x either. I get why they dont start with teaching paranthese, but they could've have just told us to use • or * to lighten the transition from basic math to algebra. Or the "U" for union.

I’ve never been to any of the Disney parks myself, but it does seem odd that so many people thoroughly DESPISE these adults and constantly make them the butt of their jokes.   Maybe I’m missing something, but I think it’s quite sad that adults are teased for being in touch with their sense of wonder. As a shy, nerdy young kid, I remember feeling warm and fuzzy any time I watched Mr. Rogers. Being in my 30s now, I still watch him from time to time and I still feel like I did all those years ago. I would hope that you all remember that despite the what the world might think, it’s okay to be childish sometimes. It’s okay to play and find wonder in the things around you.

awbv6gqx	Whenever Deus ex is mentioned folks usually talk about how the original was so mighty and great, best game ever and that the other games were terrible, unplayable. And I disagree.   Outside of just being a Deus Ex game, all games include one very important recipe which I believe more games seriously need to do and that's Semi open worlds with hella tons of exploration. The fact you can just go in most buildings or people's apartments and loot is an underrated design.   The Deus Ex maps might be small but they have so much content inside them, it's why I believe they will always ultimately be better than open world games. Sure having a massive map sounds great but if the map is devoid of content it's essentially worthless. No Man's Sky has an entire universe to explore and that gets real old, real fast.  As somebody once said it's better to have a puddle as deep as an ocean than it is to have an ocean as deep as a puddle.   I'm not sure of this so do confirm but I believe Deus Ex popularised this formula before the likes of Dishonoured and Prey, both of which are also amazing games because of this Semi-open world design.   Anyways back to the games themselves, there's something great about not having any limits on morality in your game, you have the intense vibe of shadow illuminati doing evil shit with the fate of humanity on the line, bringing up questions about what it means to be human and whether we are truly free or can be trusted with said freedom.   Then the next moment you're breaking into a random dude's apartment, smashing his head in with a baton and ransacking his shit with absolutely no consequence on the story.   Human revolution and Mankind divided brought a more realistic look into this cyberpunk kind of world and again brought up this huge moral issues about our humanity and whether we should continue down this road and breaking free from the unseen chains of those who rule above us.   Only for the next minute to stab the living hell out of your old work colleague with your arm swords all the while crushing random civilians by dropping printers and what not on them. The games truly didn't give a damn what shit you got up to and it was fun.   That's all a game really needs to be, fun. Not every game has to be deep and interesting as little nightmares or graphically and hands on with Red dead's horse ball technology.   If you haven't tried this games then I encourage folks to try them, if you wanna continue sucking the long rod of nostalgia then play the original. Games are about having fun, if you want some fun I recommend these games.	1642921848.0	sants0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sants0/deus_ex_invisible_wars_deus_ex_human_revolution/	Deus Ex: Invisible wars Deus Ex: Human revolution and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided were all great games and arguably didn't deserve the hate.
4ojvm0o6	To preface this, I actually like the styling of both, however I am speaking from experience of living with both cars.   The only advantage to a hatch is manoeuvrability, and it’s ability to hold large cargo such as boxes (which for most people is a very rare situation to be in).   Sedans are better in all other aspects:  Gas mileage, cabin room, better safety in a crash, overall comfort, highway stability.   On cargo: Sedans offer nice deep trucks, which are better for storing a higher number of smaller items, which in my opinion is a more common situation than that one time you need to transport something big from Home Depot. (It is also underrated how small hatch trucks are when’s the seats are up) On top of that, if you have something long like a pipe, hockey stick, etc, sedans will actually perform better since they are physically longer.   Don’t get me wrong, I do think they are useful, but not as useful as they are made out to be. Yes they are extremely convenient when it comes to trips to ikea, Home Depot, etc, but at the cost of other aspects as mentioned above	1642922467.0	sanzek	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sanzek/hatchbacks_are_overrated_sedans_and_station/	Hatchbacks are overrated, sedans and station wagons are better

2g4rcmcb	Working aucks. Working in an office is okay. But I noticed that approaching work like a game makes it more enjoyable. I have no loyalty except to myself and my salary. I focus on my output because it makes the day go by faster for me personally. My primary objective is "leaning" every aspect of my job resulting in lower effort but higher output. I was hired into a department/role that was demanding the resources of 3 employees (including myself). Once I was familiar with the job role, I opted out of all the unnecessary habits (IE over detailing email attachments for archive, over detailing internal notes, sending an email reply only saying "thank you"  both internally/externally, using hard copy reference instead of digital and much more) that were trained to me. I did not let customers or colleagues that I didn't report to manage me. Within 6 months, colleague # 1 got promoted out of the department. Colleague # 2 (my supervisor) clashed with upper management, was revealed to be inefficient, and emotionally driven when making high impact decisions. Colleague # 2 eventually quit and I became the department for a year until we hired another employee). Title/Salary bump + autonomy over department parameters/company written processes.  I play all sides when it comes to internal politics and communicate neutrality when there is conflict between colleagues/departments. I try to maintain frame when there is an emotional situation (frustrated colleague, high maintenance customer, mistakes across multiple departments resulting in x dollars) and avoid matching tonality so I appear to be the more rational person in the room. Most colleagues are intimidated by upper management. 3 years later and I now report directly to the CEO after starting as an entry level employee. Although I'm much younger than upper management, I'm treated as a peer.	1642927709.0	sapar3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sapar3/i_enjoy_climbing_the_corporate_ladder/	I Enjoy Climbing The Corporate Ladder

He robbed a dude at gunpoint and held him for 30 mins threatening to kill him.  It got me thinking that I totally agree with giving violent criminals like him lengthy prison sentences. If he only got 10-15 years maybe he could have a chance at being rehabilitated. Maybe we could spend millions and millions of taxpayer dollars trying to help this guy. Maybe it takes and he does better.  Then again, maybe he gets out and kills someone next time. Why should we risk it?  Statistically we know that the vast majority of violent crimes are committed by young people and that as you age you become less likely to do those kinds of things. So it makes perfect sense to keep violent criminals locked up until they are old.  Nothing will do a better job at changing someone's threat level than 50+ years of aging.	1642930921.0	saq2xm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saq2xm/lengthy_prison_sentences_are_better_than_trying/	Lengthy prison sentences are better than trying to rehabilitate violent criminals.

c31sp2do	i'm sick of "a certain millionaire"  complaining about birth rates.  In vitro is expensive. I'm sure a lot of couples forgo the idea of having a second child when faced with fertility issues becasue they prefer to use the money on their existing kid as opposed to pay for the chance of having another.  Many couples forgo having a second child becasue their experience with their first child was too demanding (the couldn't get childcare, they lost out on promotions/oppotrunities). So now that the 1 kid is older and they feel "over the hump"  they don't want to go through it again.  Those are tangible blockers to higher birth rates which can be magically 'dissapeared' with money.

3tss0k76	First and foremost: Of course sexual harassment is never okay. Of course you should never feel unsafe. I am a woman in the nightlife and I have had some encounters that I got angry about.  However.  Right now I am experiencing a lot of woman getting angry over stuff that is not aggressive at all from the male's side. The "dont sexualize me" does not really make sense to me when you are on a bar. Many persons went there to flirt and maybe have sex. Also the women. Thats sexual. It is not bad to be sexual.   I do get that a guy wanting to have sex with me but I dont find him attractive is creating aversion inside me. But he did nothing wrong. I can just politely be like "I am not interested I am sorry, thank you for the compliment." If he doesnt stop after that then you can start to get annoyed. The thing is the same of my friends who will talk shit about a man for flirting with them unsuccesfully or call him a swine will be happy if a charming handsome man does it. But how should the men know if they are your type? Trying to get in bed with someone is not objectifying them. It is simply trying to get in bed with them.  Again, maybe this is because I live in a country where I am not in danger. I walk pretty safely on the roads, I can trust most men. Unless there is agresion, someone trying to have sex with me is not something I fear will turn into something bad. A catcall is not harassment to me. Its a compliment unless there is agression in the voice or they follow me.  In case this is very unpopular remember that that is the point.	1642933726.0	saqrcv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saqrcv/the_aversion_against_males_trying_to_get_in_bed/	The aversion against males trying to get in bed with us has gone too far.

1lvxy914	For the life of me I can not figure out how these brainless thugs deem it important that neighbors listen to their shitty music at 4:30 and have a positive reaction out of it.   In fact, multiple renters had knocked on their door at intervals throughout the night in vain to try to get them to turn down or shut off the music. Always some ignorant excuses for the said renters to return to their own room. Right after that, blasting till kingdom come again.  When I was in college, this was the norm every weekend, but at least they either still had the two brain cells left to afford the decency to turn everything off at 2:00 at the latest, or I could find some peace if I did a walk around campus just for fresh evening air. These people in this area clearly can’t be as decent as college frat kids.  As I am writing, they’ve switched to EDM and are still going at it. How the fuck do you sleep with this?  And Houston Police Department is still showing appreciation for taxpayer money as always. Routine “spell your street name, closest cross street, apartment name and number; yes sir, dispatch will be sent to xyz.” And guess what? Someone might get killed in that cesspool of a room because of some drunken brawl, and they still would not show up.  My family all work during the weekend. My mother has to be at work by 10:00. My brother’s schedule is always hectic. At my old job, I have to be at the office by 9:00. No exception. Well yes, I can rig my phone to ring right into my ears 20 times to be up for work. But it doesn’t take rocket science to see it’s not a sustainable and healthy way to live or work.  There is no excusing this behavior. It’s simply trashy. And if you have to deal with this kind of stupid and childish behavior every week and somehow still come out in defense of these thuggish subhumans, you either have the patience of a saint or a brain more useless than theirs.   Education does matter a great deal, because these folks have not a modicum of it, and it’s showing so blatantly and audibly.	1642934681.0	sar043	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sar043/neighbors_who_blast_their_music_at_430_am_are/	Neighbors Who Blast Their Music At 4:30 AM Are Trashy.

ekspac4j	When I was little Cinderella was always my favourite princess.   My mum told me before she died to work hard and always give much more than I get and the world would look after me. So I definitely had a soft spot for her and I can’t stand how she’s viewed as a bad role model.   My mum was the kindest person in the world, and would get taken advantage of often, I always thought how she should be more distrusting. But somehow she ended up so rich in so many ways. everything she gave out into the world came back double. By actually caring , she inherited property, businesses, opportunities, support, respect. In a roundabout way, even the times when she was absolutely, unmistakably used by people (I’m talking months of unpaid labour type used) she always ended up benefiting (twice fold).   I look back and think of where she would have been if she was not so kind, she would have been working a 9-5 for the rest of her life, with no property or anything.   And I have had the same experience. So I honestly believe there’s a lot of truth to the story of Cinderella. Trade the fairy god mother for society. And Prince Charming for success. I think giving time and love without ever expecting anything is such a good way to live. And it does lead to success relevant the to the current time.

15bv8f	Millions of animals die every day and eating their meat is fine. There's very little difference between the suffering a sea creature endures during typical preparation, and what it endures when a mukbanger is cooking it up. Besides, if you tried to boil up a whole live octopus with no former experience you'd look pretty cruel while doing so as well. "But they shouldn't film it for the world to see!" Some say. Why not? A crab doesn't have any moral objections about being recorded while it dies, and the outcome of its existence is the same regardless of what happens to it prior. The only reason why people get up in arms about the video aspect of it is because it makes them face the fact that meat comes from animals.

Being told you're gonna be a dad is a really private matter and to be honest, if the guys get angry or upset they have the right to be upset, its not like you're being told that you won the lottery, that you just got a new car or whatever, its a moment you cannot be prepared for, then not being able to talk about it the moment the message is smacked in your face would make anyone uncomfortable.

ibbsk5kw	??? I'm kinda asking.  I'm seeing some hostile post criticizing introverts and people saying that introverts think they're superior/smarter. So many people are claiming to be introverts nowadays. Is it like a trend or something now?  I know extroversion is usually chalked up to someone who gains energy through social interaction while introverts have to unplug from socializing to reenergize. So when you put it that way, it does sound kinda negative. It makes extroverts look like draining energy vampires and it makes introverts look like the prize. I figured that is why so many people identify as introverted bc energy vampirism kinda makes you look like a miserable, annoying and empty parasite that no one should be friends with.  I also notice that people become very offended when introverts drift away from them.	1642944113.0	satj46	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/satj46/its_now_shameful_to_be_an_extrovert/	It's now shameful to be an extrovert
8lsscjyh	Whenever you look at films or series that involve scientists or geniuses, it's always the same. They are constantly portrayed as aloof, quiet introverts unable to relate to others and usually have some kind of underlying mental issue. The imitation game and a beautiful mind are the prime examples of this. It's damaging, since most of the time this type of lifestyle is also vastly romanticised and people get this stereotype of "genius = introvert". Because of this, people who turn these portrayals into role models tend to forget the value of social interaction and become emotionally immature as a result, unable to fully enjoy their lives. It also leads to "smart" people having a higher chance of being ostracized from society as a whole, naturally so when those people weren't able to learn how to properly interact.   My dream is to pursue a career in the STEM field and most people I know who also have the same dream have been affected by this stereotype, me included. Of course, in reality it's very important for one to have adequate social skills to be successful in STEM since one has to know how to give proper presentations/find sponsors etc etc, but how are we supposed to know that if the role models that we have admired all throughout our childhood have been "romantic tragic geniuses"?  Anyway, was just thinking about this since I wasn't able to find any film or series that involved a cheery/extroverted scientist as a main character lol	1642944213.0	satk8n	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/satk8n/portraying_scientists_as_troubled_introvert/	Portraying scientists as "troubled introvert geniuses" is damaging to society.

bzgorpu	Since reddit is mostly North America based, alot of people don't know how school is outside of America and spoiler alert, school system is basically the same everywhere in the world. The 3 tier school system of elementary school, middle school, and high school is widely practiced around the world. They may have different names for them or be distributed differently (less elementary school, more high school etc...) but the general idea is th same and what you learn in each education level.. My point is, this isn't a US onlyissue imo.  As to the problem, we learn alot of jargon in school specifically from elementary school to high school and to an extend in college because of mandatory requirements. For example, you have to take X number of science credits or fiveristy credits or writing credits etc... Even if you don't need them for your job. I get schools want you to have a basic understanding of the world but I feel like sometimes these requirements go beyond basic understanding and get too technical for people who don't need them.   Be honest, how much stuff did you learn in school that you don't remember at all? I think not only we are forced to learn too much jargon, but also the way school is structured, we also don't learn anything and we are often memorizing things for the short term just to get through a class/exam and we forget the material quickly afterward because we have another exam coming up that we need to memorize a bunch of other stuff for.  I don't know what the solution is, but I definitely think the current system promotes not actually learning anything that will stick with you after you finish your class and move on. But I do think a big part of the problem are closed book quizzes and exams as they are today because all they do is force students to cramp weeks of material for a 2h test and after that they will never come up so you don't need to waste mental space on them and as such you will forget them very quickly which serves absolutely no benefit except ticking a box for graduation requirements.    I honestly would have loved to remember more concepts and materials from my  chemistry classes or biology classes because at the time I found the topics interesting but since I don't actually ever need them in my line of work and daily life I completely forgot about them!	1642944632.0	satopj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/satopj/i_think_the_current_school_system_around_the/	I think the current school system around the world is bad because it promotes short term memorization of the material being taught.

None of the characters are likeable, the songs aren’t memorable and I don’t think there are any jokes, just “isn’t that quirky?” Moments. I get it, it’s supposed to be childish and goofy because that’s the whole point of the story but it’s gotten to a point where I’m starting to find the characters annoying.

I LOVED the soundtrack, the cars, the characters, bosses and even the minor, but still interesting story. I know a lot of people were unhappy with the game and called it the failed copy of NSF Most Wanted, but I genuinely enjoyed the game. Gosh, just the boss battles in canyon were awesome, and it's honestly a shame it got overshadowed by NSF Most Wanted. Same goes for NSF: The Run. I loved the entire story line, and the whole concept of driving through the entire USA. It was awesome. The soundtracks for both of those games were amazing as well.

The green Mission Winnow logo? Awesome, it's a nice shade, and adds contrast to a car that's 90% red. And always has been.   The gradient from Rosso Corsa to burgundy red? That also looks very nice, and it's a nice shade of burgundy. I won't dispute the people who said it looks like the car got burnt, or soiled itself. But the gradient is subtle way of including just a smidgen of contrast.   And with a bit of yellow on the car from other sponsors, it's not that unreasonable to keep the car mostly red with subtle amount of other colours.	1642947232.0	saujht	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saujht/the_2021_ferrari_f1_livery_looked_nice/	The 2021 Ferrari F1 livery looked nice

I used to love wow back in the day then i got addicted to swtor and now i dont like any mmo but also i dont feel like good singleplayer games come out anymore. 2019 and 20 were probably the worst gaming years in a long time.

I personally will never date anyone beyond the 2 year gap that I have in place. And the closer to my age that they are the more inclined I am to a relationship with them.

3m69bhnz	People seem to be getting the impression that unless you’re a millionaire in some highly developed country that your life is utter shit. No, it’s not. Yes, 9.2% of the human population is in *extreme* poverty. And yes, the world is nowhere perfect for everyone but it’s definitely manageable for the average human. Healthcare in all countries is at it’s peak since the dawn of humanity. There’s hasn’t been a war between major superpowers in nearly over a century. I live in a 3rd world country and 99.9% of the people I see aren’t miserable, they’re a happy people, they eat 3 meals a day and have access to clean water. In most countries, including a lot of developing ones, being poor still means you are able to sustain yourself. Yes, people struggle to make a living but that’s all part of human life. A life without struggle and hard work isn’t an achievable one. Every time I see any post or comment mentionig someone working or being employed for a long period of time everyone seems to portray them as poor and heavly exploited laborers regardless of what said post is about and everyone assumes that everyone hates their jobs. In reality, most people in these developed countries are likely paid well enough to survive and live healthy. I honestly cannot understand how people say that any country that isn’t Scandinavia is such a shitty place where living is a daily nightmare. This is just insulting to actual people who are starving and barely eat. Being a human has never been easier. Now, I’m not saying people from developed countries can’t complain. Of course a lot can be fixed. I’m just thinking that people are can be very ungrateful for the decent life their ancestors worked so hard to give them and that the world isn’t an utter hellhole.

While he had every right to accept a contract with a different team, the very premise that he had no choice because he was somehow a victim is just not the truth.   Tom Brady was paid comparatively less than many other quarterbacks of his tenure and skill, but he accepted those terms himself. Each team has a salary cap, meaning that they have a collective budget of salary for the entire team. Brady was given the choice to accept higher pay, but was told it would lead to other members of the team being cut, and he actively chose to accept the lower salary each and every time. That is a choice he made himself, he didn't have to do this.  Secondly, the claim of being underappreciated... how? Having a million fans screaming your name around the world is underappreciated? A cult of personality around you is underappreciated? How does this make sense?  Finally, he refused to be a team player and work with other members of the team to help them improve and advance. The last several years on the Patriots he is said to have been a difficult person to work with, believing that it was not his responsibility to help his team and that they were not good enough to work with him. That is his fault, not theirs, for choosing to have that attitude.  I am sick of the Tom Brady as a victim narrative. Spare the nonsense, please.	1642950880.0	savrve	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savrve/tom_brady_was_not_mistreated_by_the_new_england/	Tom Brady was not mistreated by the New England Patriots, and his leave was not inevitable or inherently moral.

Sure, I can see an argument for that but there people just automatically throw it on the list as if it's a given when there are probably at least 2 movies released every year that are overall more entertaining, better acted, better scripted, better edited and just better in general.    &#x200B;  Even Wizard of Oz stands up better than Citizen Kane does in every category I mentioned above.	1642951110.0	savuo6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savuo6/citizen_kane_is_not_the_greatest_movie_of_all/	"Citizen Kane" is not the greatest movie of all time, not even close.
fq9vinfj	Toilet paper is gross. The practice of using it is gross, and the end result is gross. Either you end up with a dirty ass, or you need to use so goddamn much of it that you waste a huge amount of paper to accomplish a task that can be easily accomplished by a small quantity of water. Or maybe you're one of those people who takes ultra clean crispy shits and this doesn't apply to you, but these people are few and fucking far between.  The whole reason the western world is addicted to toilet paper is because capitalism permits a system where corporations that benefit from your monthly spend of $20 on TP can afford marketing that stigmatizes other alternatives such as bidets, so that they can keep selling you a product that you hardly need and keep you hooked on the cycle.  A bidet attachment costs like $50, and can be used for years. The 16oz or so of water it uses costs basically nothing, and the end result is vastly cleaner and more sanitary. Furthermore, I have been to some countries where toilet paper can not be flushed because the plumbing doesn't support it, so you end up putting soiled toilet paper in the fucking trash, when all this could be avoided by simple, fresh water that every toilet in the world is already hooked up to.  I'm not here to put anyone's preferences on blast, but from a purely functional and economic perspective, toilet paper is a highly inefficient system (also requires municipal sanitation departments to do more work to separate solid waste from liquid waste) and the only reason it exists is because capitalism, through the magic of the dollar, has stigmatized a substantially more sanitary, economical, and environmentally friendly option.	1642951128.0	savuv8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savuv8/wiping_with_toilet_paper_is_filthy_and_a_monument/	Wiping with toilet paper is filthy and a monument to capitalism at its worst
bxpnp1ae	Mandatory disclaimer, I *do* understand that many relationships are abusive in ways that are not blatant. I *do* understand that abuse can take on many different forms. I *am not* saying that abuse is only someone beating you or calling you the worst possible things in the history of language. With that out of the way, I do think that if you were to consider everything that people call abusive, well, abusive, there probably wouldn’t be one single healthy relationship in the world, of any kind - parent-child, spouses, friends, siblings, etc. Some of the things that the internet throws around as abusive are character flaws, different styles of communication / attachment / love language, cultural or generational differences. Things that can be annoying, sure, even downright upset I g, but hardly abusive.   The worst part of this is that, like with other things, it takes away a little of the strength of the word abusive and of really abusive relationships.	1642952120.0	saw7fo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saw7fo/the_notion_of_an_abusive_relationship_is_way_too/	The notion of an abusive relationship is way too broad nowadays

Drake did this because like most guys he thought you could not flush condoms without blocking a toilet. All I can say is that I have done this in every home I have lived in for 20+ years and never had a problem, BUT you have to use plenty of toilet paper to completely wrap ALL of the condom.

The argument is mostly used by people with little to no formal education. Often, it is used in such a way that people say their opinion is more valid than others', as they apparently have less knowledge/experience.   The problem is that often, people with lesser education uses the point against people with higher educations/people with larger wealth etc. Doing so, they not only undermine the knowledge of others, but also assume that other people haven't had tough experiences/gone through hard times (...).

5b7qkst2	Not sure this qualifies as unpopular opinion, but in social media, and recently just noticed/realized that in r/FreeCompliments r/FirstImpression and r/DemEyesDoe that a lot, at least, of the women who post feel the need to show off their bodies, versus their beautiful smiles, eyes, etc.  Girls, you don't need to show cleavage, wear tight clothes, etc. to be beautiful, to show off your amazing eyes, and to even ask people what their first impression is of you. I honestly believe that the most confident girl is one who knows her beauty ultimately is her personality, her smile, her sparkling eyes, etc. She doesn't feel the need to dress seductively, for lack of a better word, for others to like her and for her to be attractive. You want people to notice your smile first, or your eyes, or your laugh, personality, etc. Not your body because that wont always stay the same amd if people (guys especially) like you first or most or only fir your body, it's superficial and no girl deserves that. Our looks should be the cherry on top,not the primary focus, if that makes sense. Social media is so much about looks, and a lot of it, like Instagram is fake.  I'm healthy, in shape as best as I can be atm, have an hour glass figure, oval face shape, and almond shaped eyes, but I sure as heck don't feel the need to show off my body, I want others to like me for my personality, my smile, eyes, etc. not only for my body or really not my body at all.   Hopefully that all makes sense. Girls, you're beautiful and your bodies are beautiful, but you should be loved and liked more so for who you are, personality, etc. not purely your body. You are priceless and so much more than your body, and if anyone treats you otherwise, please cut them out of your life.	1642953439.0	sawo63	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sawo63/girls_feeling_like_they_need_to_show_off_their/	Girls Feeling Like They Need to Show Off Their Bodies to Be Attractive

If you go in any thread at all about anything marginally related to someone in the age bracket of 18-20 years old, you will see a bunch of comments acting like if they do not have a job, or still live at home, or act in any way differently then what a “mature adult” should, they’re lazy, losers, they have been raised wrong, stuff like that.   18 year olds are not adults. You don’t turn an adult magically at midnight when your 18th birthday comes. *This* is a very childish idea.    Besides, even science nowadays agrees that your brain and body are not fully developed until you are about 25, anyway. The acne you have at 22 is still considered teenage acne by dermatologists. The general shape of your body at 23 is still not seen as fully “set” by P.E. professionals. Your hormones are still a mess at 21. Why do we act like suddenly at 18 you should have figured it out, act like a mature adult, etc?   This is coming from someone who was very precocious, by the way. It’s not about my personal experience, more about how annoying it is to see people here on Reddit and on the internet in general bashing 18 year olds for not being fully-grown adults when… they aren’t.	1642954636.0	sax4im	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sax4im/18_year_olds_are_not_adults/	18 year olds are not adults

mf38v	My belief is that professional athletes don’t effectively represent their teams unless they have an established connection to the area they are in before they are serving. It is different from high school and college sports because those players do usually come from the regional area (except for some larger colleges) and have opportunities to participate on their campus outside of being a member of a sports team. Professional sports teams do trades for strictly business reasons instead of preserving the regional identity of the team, leading to a bunch of rich athletes claiming they are authentic to the area when they are not.  Each professional sports team should have a recruitment territory that gives them an equal opportunity to recruit promising and talented players. This means teams with smaller populations would get larger recruitment territories. There could be some overlap in larger metro areas where there are multiple teams serving the same sport (e.g. New York City for football). All recruited players must live in the boundaries of that area for three years within the last ten, with the option to count your home and college addresses. The general idea is that it would make each team more representative of the area its serving and thus inspire further loyalty from fans.	1642958160.0	sayh8j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sayh8j/professional_athletes_should_be_recruited_by/	Professional Athletes Should Be Recruited By Region Instead of Freely Drafted

4fl7bj5q	I remember when I was a teenager, around 15 I think, I went to this birthday party and a few kids were doing drugs, alcohol, marijuana, and inhaling glue to be exact. At the time, I used to train Taekwondo, was in a pretty good shape, and I strayed away from drugs because my parents frame them as this demonic substance that once you fool yourself and "try", it just snowballs and goes downhill from there.   As I grew older, my moral convictions changed, and I did try a few drugs just for the sake of it, and then I found myself a junkie struggling between financials, my mental wellbeing and physical wellbeing, I remembered my parents' words and how true they are. They turned out to be, indeed, as demonic and bad as my parents describe them. Over at r/addiction, you see many posts of people saying that it's not worth it, it's not enjoyable, it's deadly, it is this and that, and after recovering from a few addictive substances I had in the past, I completely agree. I keep interacting with people who are under the influence of drugs, a classmate who smokes a joint everyday, a flatmate who drinks to death in the weekend, and these interactions are by far the most dysfunctional, irritating and annoying interactions I've ever had with a person. The agitation, the broken communication, the decoherent narrative all remind me of how bad drugs are.  I still go to some parties right now as a 25 years old guy, and I still see people using drugs and frame them as this majestic and beautiful thing that you have to try. You also see movies and such glorifying them but the reality is, they're just not worth it at all. As a person who broke free from all addictive substances (even caffeine), I have never in my life felt better. Call me vanilla or boring, I just think the new norm should be that drugs, in any way shape or form, should be demonized socially.	1642959036.0	saytgn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saytgn/demonizing_drugs_among_young_adults_and_adults/	Demonizing drugs among young adults and adults (even teens) should be the norm, not imposed by an authority, but imposed amongst each other

A jeep doesn’t. A jeep doesn’t drive comfortable. Doesn’t get good gas mileage. Doesn’t have the interior space of a SUV or van, doesn’t haul like a truck, and not exactly known for their reliability. only thing it is good for is off-road driving if you put knobby tires on, which will further reduce ride quality on streets. 99.999% of people that have a jeep just get one that’s overpriced and because they think it looks cool	1642959346.0	sayxts	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sayxts/jeeps_are_the_stupidest_vehicle/	Jeeps are the stupidest vehicle

abcbavcn	This is probably super unpopular considering the average age and emotional intelligence level of reddit BUT here we go. I think i’m in the right sub.   I was very insecure and jealous when i was younger (in my twenties). I wasnt controlling but i was often making a big deal out of small things because of jealousy. The worst i could imagine was if my boyfriend had physical desires for another woman. I felt undesirable and worthless if my boyfriend was attracted to someone else. I saw infidelity as the absolutely worst thing you could do to someone.   Now i am 32, i have a kid, i have lived in 4 different countries, i speak 6 languages and i have worked all over the world. I have had several relationships in my life and i am currently with the father of my kid.   Now I understand that if my husband get physical with another woman, it has nothing to do with me. I understand that i am not to blame. Like, i deeply understand this now. I believe it into my bones. I would be heartbroken if he did it, but I wouldn’t let it mess with my feeling of self worth. So it wouldn’t impact me as much as before.   Also i see other things as much worse. If he emotionally abandons me. That shit is 10 times worse.   Lets set up 2 scenarios:   1. He is there for me/us. He wakes up in the night when the kid needs us. He is there for me emotionally, checking in on me. Makes me my favourite dinner and picks up my dry cleaning so i can take a long bath and have a break from the mom-stress. And then he makes a mistake: he gets drunk and ends up making out with his co-worker at the office christmas party. Major idiot, i agree, but scenario 2. Is worse!   2. He stops being there for me and our kid. He starts working late hours and when he comes home he is grumpy and annoyed and goes directly into his office and has a phone-call with a client. He forgets to take our kid to the dentist and makes my life so much more complicated because i then need to reschedule and fix everything. He doesn’t look at me anymore and he just wants to have sex and then fall asleep and couldn’t be bothered with how i am feeling. But he is being “faithful”.   Scenario 2 is far worse for me.   For me, “cheating” shouldn’t be solely the act of having physical relations with others. It should include not respecting the unwritten agreements you have with your spouse. If you support each other and help each other and actively love each other and you somehow neglect your spouse in these matters, youre also cheating!   The world is too focused on 1 problem being the oh so horrible thing. I simply dont agree.	1642960196.0	saz9q6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saz9q6/the_older_i_get_the_more_i_realise_that_cheating/	The older i get the more i realise that “cheating” isnt the worst you can do in a relationship

On the internet, unless you're from not from a rich place (in which case someone who attacks you will rightfully be seen as a bigot), if you mention your nationality, apparently it's an open invitation for everyone to lay out stereotypes and joke at your expense.  Maybe some people find them hilarious. But assuming they do and should accept it is just ridiculous. And just because you would be okay with it doesn't mean everyone is.   I'm french, I can't count the number of times where people on Reddit told me to shut up when I told them I was uncomfortable with their unfunny anti-french jokes.

So your validation seeking rant about your partner honestly makes you look worse than them.  Oh, and no, there's no surprises. None of their behaviors should be a surprise, and if they are maybe you should have invested some time getting to know them.  The only valid reason to share a life with someone is you make each other's lives better. These kinda of posts don't make me think "ugh, all (insert any/no gender) are the same, your person sucks, I feel for you!"  Instead I think you're someone who married out of wanting the social validation just like you're seeking it with your post and on top of that you exhibit poor judgment.	1642960449.0	sazdh6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sazdh6/spouse_complaint_posts_are_so_cringe/	Spouse complaint posts are so cringe

There’s also lots of porn where it’s meant to simulate rape, break in, etc. So I totally get it and agree that porn isn’t free of faults or implications. There needs to be in improvement in the porn industry.   It just seems like every person I run into a person who says these things use shame to drive the message rather than just say the message. Instead of saying something like “the porn industry can effect blah blah and people should be aware, especially people with addictions.” They say “if you watch porn then you’re then this, if you’re boyfriend watches it then he doesn’t value you and he hates women”  I feel like if they really cared they wouldn’t be using shame based assumptions to get a message across, especially people with literal ADDICTIONS.	1642960938.0	sazku7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sazku7/most_people_who_shame_people_about_porn_usage_do/	Most people who shame people about porn usage do not care about changing or making the porn industry safer/better.

35tsmheu	We have this perception in America - perhaps driven by some sort of cowboy nostalgia - that “Real America” is a *man* on a horse with a hat tending to his herd on a wide-open ranch with mountains in the background. “Real Americans,” so it goes, are the people who best match our largely incomplete history of the American frontier.  What a load of bull - pun intended.   First of all the implication that there is an “unreal” America or American is preposterous, period. What does real even mean? Does it mean “most representative?” Does it mean “best epitomizing our frontier past?” We can ask this question any one of dozens of ways, but I am focused on representativeness - what does America look like for the average American demographically speaking. As an aside, race and income play into this question MASSIVELY, but I cannot write a book today. In terms of demographics, the critical fact is that most the population in this country is urban, nearly 80%. Our top 100 cities have approximately 60 million people within their respective city propers. Approximately 15% live in the narrow Northeast metropolitan zone alone.   Meanwhile, somewhere in Iowa, there is a town with a population of 150. It is predominantly (if not 100 percent) white with people who have rarely if ever left their state. If there is a such thing as “real America,” that ain’t it.  Instead, if we’re going to push this notion that there is a “Real America” somewhere out there, people are going to have to get over the frontier version and start acknowledging it is a city. A busy city corner is the heartland of America.	1642962442.0	sb06le	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb06le/real_america_is_the_corner_of_a_busy_city_street/	“Real America” is the Corner of a Busy City Street - Not a Farm in the Great Plains

9579b5pr	Spiritual formats have gotten so closed minded and are more focused on "the rules" of something. Whether it's tarot, meditation, bone throwing, praying, yoga, crystals, etc.  Spirituality is a practice, not a religion. It's not "cultural appropriation" that someone is doing Vipissanā while listening to Buddhist quotes or Christian music. Just because you practice a combination of spiritual beliefs doesn't make you a colonizer or appropriator.  Respect having cultures having closed practices, but stop hating on people who are actually informed and want to reach enlightenment is their own respected way. If the person is polytheist, they're allowed to worship a pantheon that isn't connected to their ancestors as long as they are well informed and know the best way to practice.	1642958913.0	sayrop	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sayrop/new_age_spirituality_is_a_cult_thanks_to_cultural/	New Age Spirituality is a cult thanks to "cultural appropriation"

The view of wind turbines and solar panels gives me a feeling of cleanliness, clean of coal and other dirty energy sources, even the air around them feels cleaner and fresher.

ctgpzmtf	This is an unpopular decision within my generation gap (Gen Z and/or Millennials) but nobody is entitled to a text/call back the same way you don’t have to text/call someone in return. People nowadays become so sensitive and overdramatise the time it took for someone to respond as if it matters. Some people don’t like to be on their phones and prefer to have hobbies and things that don't revolve around social media or technology. Others might not be in the mood to be social and like a lot of people, they simply forget. Does that make them a bad person? Fuck no.   The entitlement that reeks from people is beyond me, it is almost toxic even that people believe that if you don't text them back within (insert time bracket) then they’re a fake friend/partner or whatever even. As if they’re any better and all high and mighty that they never forget a text/call and have never left someone on seen. Grow up and realise that they don’t even have to respond to you at all so be thankful you’re even communicating with them.   Of course, certain circumstances need urgency! This isn’t about that. Urgent matters NEED quick responses. But, getting mad because your friend didn't text you back on time to know about the new hot gossip around campus doesn't mean anything bad or dramatic. They just simply didn’t text back that's all.	1642967259.0	sb22jj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb22jj/youre_not_entitled_to_a_text_back_or_a_call_back/	You’re not entitled to a text back or a call back

a2q0xca8	This is a GENERAL statement based on MY experiences  There's no denying that drunk people, statistically, are more of a danger to themselves and others. There's also no denying that getting high (on weed, that's what this post is talking about) is less bad for you than getting drunk, when done the same amount of times. But high people are waaay more annoying than drunk people are.   Despite the stereotype, most high people are extremely erratic. I've seen my high friends blow their carts into smoke alarms and set them off, cover my floor in minced garlic, almost start fist fights, and through ice at people. Drunk people can be crazy, even erratic, but their behavior is more predictable. When my friends are drunk, they mostly just dance around, take stupid pictures and videos, and attempt physical stunts that result in pain. The normal dumb shit drunk people do is usually less spontaneous than the dumb shit high people do.    High people create a huge mess. This is especially a problem when your trying not to get caught smoking the weed. It's because there's so much paraphernalia you need to smoke bud. Rolling a joint, the least lucrative but also least efficient way to smoke involves small papers and filters, a grinder, and a lighter. Compared to other drugs, this is already quite a bit. With alcohol, you need nothing but the container it comes in, with cocaine, you need dollar bill, and credit card. Same for ketamine. For LSD you need nothing. If you plan on smoking with a bong, you need a paper clip, lighter, water, somewhere to clean the bong, and possibly running alcohol. It's really hard not to loose any of that when your high. The pungent smell that attaches itself to everything is also very annoying and hard to hide. The eating is also nuts. I've had high friends ruin countless kitchens and create so much to clean up because their stomachs are just bottomless pits.    High people are dumb as rocks. That's why leave their paraphernalia everywhere. That's why they get irrationally paranoid all the time, which is annoying to listen to. Drunk people can be idiots too but they're never paranoid and aren't as forgetful unless they've blacked out.    High people are just generally more of a hastle, and I often find myself babysitting when my friends get high. O and also, people who are inexperienced fucking vomit, cleaning vomit off a carpet is awful. I think this unpopular, don't know about you, would love to hear in the comments.

5bzxry0i	I will agree with the fact that if someone dates someone else *only* because of their looks then sure, they're a shallow person at least in the relationships department, but having physical preferences is okay and being attracted to your partner is key in a relationship. I think rejecting someone because of their looks is justified as long as you're not an asshole to them about it, and I think what's actually shallow is dating someone you're not attracted to, because more often than not you're either confusing platonic and romantic feelings or you're in a relationship out of loneliness and desperation. Obviously this is a generalization since everyone lives relationships differently, what I disagree with is giving shit to people who care about what their partner looks like as if it's mutually exclusive to caring about their personality.	1642968950.0	sb2pw0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb2pw0/people_who_accuse_those_that_care_about_looks_in/	People who accuse those that care about looks in dating of being shallow are actually the shallow ones

7emwwdfp	I don’t understand why some people complain about tv shows or other forms of entertainment being dramatic, ‘that’s so over the top’, ‘that’s way too unrealistic,that doesn’t happen irl’. Well yeah, that’s the point, most people consume this kind of media to disconnect from real life or I should rather say as a form of escapism. Its not always supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be entertaining and engaging. Not saying that both cannot coexist, they definitely can because crazy things happen irl also, but in fiction something dramatic has to happen to keep the story moving and hold the audience’s attention which may sometimes seem unrealistic. Majority of the people don’t want to read or watch about normal people doing mundane tasks.

4rly19hu	It isn’t a lack of creativity, talent, or money, it’s the lack of courage on the part of the big studios to fund original scripts that aren’t within a predetermined money making formula and greed by not funding projects that don’t multi picture franchise potential.   It’s hard to find a good movie that isn’t a glorified television episode or a multimillion dollar hi tech comic book/real life Saturday morning cartoon.   The studios are rarely making original movies that don’t set themselves up for a sequel. Even good trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” was followed by a corrupted version of “The Hobbit”. The original book was basically a long short story yet the management to squeeze 3 feature length movies out of that.

3wvd69al	I don't care if the people in it are just out for a profit, whatever. The fact is, there are better medications available around the world that so many people can benefit from and now have access to. The US is so ruled by Big Pharma that blocks access to millions of people by delaying FDA approvals or jacking up prices to the point where hardly anyone can afford them.   The process to get FDA approval is incredibly expensive and takes over a decade, so many safe and effective medicines that are approved and used in other countries won't even try for FDA approval in the states anymore.   Living in the states means you have to pay an outrageous amount of money for a medicine that is no longer the best option available.   Nowadays, you can go online and order the medications you need for hardly any money. I know this is not always safe and you need to take precautions, but there are legit ways to access medications online now and it's a wonderful thing.

Older girls are also everywhere and super aggressive selling these stupid cookies.  Ran some errands this morning.   Grabbed a coffee at Dunkin…they are in the drive through line pushing cookies.   Went to 7-11 to get gas…more cookie sellers.   Went to tractor supply to grab some rock salt and again cookie sellers.   The troop probably makes peanuts on every box sold.

9kh259qj	I am not a big anti-makeup kinda person, I think makeup in general is a lot of fun and a cool vehicle for expression, and I really don't care if someone wants to wear a full cakey face every day or never touches the stuff or anything in between. That being said, personally I can never take nose contour seriously. It's in such a prominent position on the face that it always looks like someone got chocolate ice cream smeared on them instead of a natural shadow, especially when you see it in person. Cheek and jaw contour don't really have that problem because they're actually following natural hollows/shaded areas of the face to at least some degree, but when you try to give yourself that little button nose by contouring around the tip, I'm sorry, but it just looks like you got a weirdly specific suntan. Ultimately I don't care if people like how nose contour looks and still do it, I would never say this to anyone's face because it's just a useless little personal opinion, but I don't think I'll ever see a nose contour that doesn't make me giggle a little bit to myself at how obvious and wrong it looks.	1642973793.0	sb4lgu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb4lgu/nose_contour_never_looks_good/	Nose contour NEVER looks good

ccovtxtm	To me drinking alcohol on a consistent basis leads to nothing beneficial. The euphoria fades very quickly after the first drink and it just becomes sloggish and tiring the following day and the rest of the night. To me it's honestly comparable to doing Benadryl or DXM in effects and hangover, it's just not worth it and also fucking highly addictive for what little it gives you. Coke and Molly are hella dangerous in their own right, yeah. However, coke gives you more of a nightlife/party drug advantage and it introduces you to a lot of new people or girls if you try not to abuse it too hard. The same thing can be said about molly. DMT and psychedelics introduce you to a fascinating world in its own right and can be mystical or magical experiences. Drugs like methamphetamines and heroin are considered the worst drugs because of how addictive they are, but the highs are allegedly so goddamn powerful that more than often, the addiction is "worth it" in a sense for that individual. Alcohol objectively has all the negatives of drugs combined. It has bad comedowns, the high isn't worth the addiction, it doesn't really open you up to new social horizons like molly and coke do, it doesn't give you any mystical experiences, and you can blackout and vomit everywhere and mysteriously have your roommate vanish for the next few days...

bt1tajmy	All the videos and streams that are on YouTube and Twitch's servers take up a MASSIVE amount of data, and servers to host and store such a large amount of data cost a MASSIVE amount of money.  What this essentially means is that only a massive corporation can afford to start a video/livestream service and keep it alive without going bankrupt. THIS is the reason why almost all potential competitors to YouTube (like Vimeo, Dailymotion, Mixer, BitChute, ZippCast, etc) end up either forgotten about or shut down entirely. The only reason Twitch managed to rise up is because they're backed by Amazon.  Huge corporations do not give a crap about their customers, except for squeezing as much money out of them as possible. That is a fact we all can't deny; after all, it's only human nature. I'd probably be a scumbag too if I was a rich corporate suit, and YOU'D probably be a scumbag too (don't deny it).  This is why YouTube and Twitch treat their content creators like shit (demonetization and strikes for no reason, etc) and do stupid things like removing the dislike button and trying to force Google+ on all their users: they're sitting pretty with their precious monopoly that they know they will NEVER LOSE.  And if YouTube and Twitch do end up going away one day, they're just going to be replaced by another big corporation like Apple who will end up doing the same shit that they do now.	1642975119.0	sb547i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb547i/youtube_and_twitch_are_going_to_suck_forever/	YouTube and Twitch are going to suck forever

8vpk9ika	I was looking up if some obscure finnish music I'm into is in the public domain and I was flabbergasted when I saw that finnish copyright law says that the copyright of a work lasts the author's lifetime+70 years, which is ludicrous. It means that a dude can make a copyrightable work in his twenties, live to his eighties *and only then* will the 70 year waiting period start ticking down, which means that from the work's conception/publishing it can take *130 years* for it to enter public domain. At least american copyright can expire if it's been 95 years from publication but is otherwise the same.  How can anyone who isn't rich enough to afford the royalties or one of their loyal sycophants, be for this?

Most therapists go to school to study in order to become good therapists but I feel like that’s only half the training. I feel like therapists need more experiences in life to understand their clients more in order to give proper advice. And I’m sure therapy can be great in the beginning, because who doesn’t like a new perspective. But going forward and to build and maintain that connection in order for the patient to truly open up and trust the therapists advice is harder to come by.

7t6g09i	Not only do companies completely ruin the experience of players by making their games gigantic chore simulators so they can increase these metrics, but the concept doesn't even translate correctly to videogames like it does in other products.   It's naive to think that higher engagement metrics correlate to higher revenue in a videogame since in a lot of cases the bulk of the revenue comes from whales, who actually engage less with the content.  And as an investor you'd have to be a complete idiot to think that engagement metrics are a useful indicator of the health of a game since it's very evident that companies that care about that will do whatever it takes to artificially increase those numbers, painting a false picture of how they're actually doing in that regard. You're trusting the numbers from a business partner that disregards your intelligence to sell you smoke.  So if it ruins things for the players and damages the product experience, and if the numbers are manipulated so they look bigger to investors, why do we accept companies maneuvering around them if it only benefits the company and fucks the other two parties which are the ones actually interested in the product?   It might be the reddit bubble, but I see so many people defending this absolute garbage of a practice under the pretense that companies NEED to present this "vital" information to the investors, as if it was something actually useful to them, and so they're justified in ruining perfectly good games by adding horrendous time-wasting mechanics.	1642977014.0	sb5vdt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb5vdt/engagement_metrics_in_videogames_are_the_dumbest/	Engagement metrics in videogames are the dumbest shit ever and are unjustifiable.

3nghtcqp	So I live in NYC and a couple of times a year myself and my SO like to go out to some pretty fancy restaurants in Manhattan and sometimes to see show or the opera. Stuff like that. The reason I’m addressing this is that I frequently see a lot of tourists who show up dressed incorrectly and are turned away  at the door and absolutely lose it or if they’re seated they just look at everyone there completely infuriated. Also I’ll add that I can count on one hand all the restaurants in Manhattan this still require a jacket so it’s not like these people didn’t have other options.  Why I feel this way is simple. When we decide to go out to dinner, we aren’t just paying for the food. If we were, we would have gotten take out. We’re there because restaurants are fun. We enjoy the environment and at a nicer place you’re paying for a beautiful and elegant space to spend dinner in and everyone around you contributes to that or in this case detracts from it.   You aren’t dressing up for yourself. You’re doing it for the people around you and to convey to staff and possibly the owner or chef that this experience is of significance to you. That you feel a sense of privilege to be able to experience such a nice meal.   When you’re wearing jeans you’re suggesting that this meal is meaningless to you. That this isn’t the best meal you’re going to have this month so it’s not worthy of the best stuff in your closet.   It seems to me that people have somehow decided that anytime they’re spending money inside of a restaurant, they’re suddenly entitled to be as inconsiderate and selfish as they want and it’s something I absolutely can not understand. What’s wrong with being someone who others enjoy being around? When did people start equating trying to be pleasant to be around with caring too much what others think? And why?

gbkrgdx8	I’ll say for some cases but not all.   Usually there’s two type of friendzoning:  Realizing someone you thought of as a close friend only wanted to get with you feels really uncomfortable. Like when you think someone is just genuinely nice and cares about you, only to realize they were nice because they wanted more… and then they treat you different after because you won’t give them what they want. It sucks and it hurts when someone completely cuts you off because you don’t want to sleep with them so you’re not worth their time anymore  Or when you care about someone who cares about you and you have to turn them down because you don’t feel the same, there’s such immense guilt because as some point you wish you COULD feel that way so you don’t hurt them but you just can’t. It changes an entire relationship. I still feel guilty about times I’ve had to respectfully say I’m not interested in a relationship with a person.   People always get mad/hurt about being friendzoned and act like the person was purposely trying to make them feel bad but that’s not true. Just because someone wants to be your friend and not more doesn’t make them a shitty person. Having to see the disappointment when someone puts themselves out there is hard, especially when they’re a close friend. I’ve been on both sides and honestly, both hurt just as bad.   And before anyone says “if you feel bad just date them”, lying about your feelings to someone to make them feel better for a short period just to break their heart later is worse than being honest	1642980132.0	sb71bw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb71bw/friendzoning_someone_is_just_as_hard_as_being/	Friendzoning someone is just as hard as being friendzoned
rk1og	I would really like to see some other people in big roles for a variety of reasons.   For one, I’m really tired of seeing the same people cast over and over again. Most recently I saw Leonardo de caprio as a scientist in “don’t look up”. Ok, cool, so versatile! How about, literally any good actor for that role? Or Brad Pitt as an astronaut in whatever that movie is called. Give me a break, besides the break in immersion I get every time I try to watch one of these movies.  Another reason this bugs me is that I see billions of dollars flowing to a relatively small group of actors. Sure it’s good for them, I’m sure they love mopping up all the money in the industry. But this is just the same kind of insane inequality we see everywhere in our society, magnified dramatically.   I know some will argue that it’s just good business, people want to see the same people over, and over, and over again. And that therefore you want to hire from this tiny pool of people so your movie makes more money. Maybe that’s true, maybe it’s not, but it’s certainly the justification given.   Either way, I’d like to see any number of literally thousands of men and women who are skilled actors filling these roles. Both to get more great actors in the mix, to give more the ability to make a good living in the field, and because I’m quite tired of seeing the same old people in these roles.  Just to clear it up ahead of time, no I’m not a jaded actor, or doing anything related to the industry whatsoever. I actually work in one of the few remaining meritocracies so no complaints here.	1642980521.0	sb766q	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb766q/im_really_tired_of_the_same_cadre_of_actors_being/	I’m really tired of the same cadre of actors being cast across movies

daybdv51	There was an extract from a newspaper I read a few years ago where a comedian quipped: 'young people think that just because they can dress, walk, and drive by themselves, they've got the whole world figured out', and despite it being a joke, to be honest I've always felt that way. I simply couldn't relate to or care enough about the banal things people in my age group talked about, and the certainty in which some of them expressed themselves was something I didn't understand. Generally speaking, most of the time my friends, and their friends, just sat around listening to terrible music, texting their next hook up, and engaging in recreational drug use.   Which is why for me it was always refreshing talking to somebody with a bit more life experience, gaining an insight from certain past transgressions, and how they learned or moved on from their mistakes. I've got a bit of a soft spot for old people (70+), I love just spending a bit of time with them, and sometimes ask how things were like when they were younger, their recollections are a brief glimpses from another time. I find that elderly people are far more interesting than young people, bless em'.	1642982072.0	sb7q7y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb7q7y/older_people_are_far_more_interesting_than_young/	Older people are far more interesting than young people.

cuzpuwik	I've watched a close relative go through all kinds of treatments for breast cancer over the past 8 years. She has a huge community of people who love her, and with the best intentions they'd always say something along the lines of: "You can beat it! You're so strong!" and "Kick cancer's ass! I know you can!" And every time they'd find a new tumor on her body, after supposedly "wiping out" all of her cancer, she felt absolutely devastated that she wasn't able to clear the cancer from her body, and would beat herself up over the fact that she wasn't strong enough to beat the cancer herself.   Obviously, that wasn't her fault. And obviously, everyone who had told her to keep fighting, all of the narratives that hospitals push to stay strong, they all mean well. But the truth is, whether you beat cancer or not, whether you learn how to walk again or not, and whether you are able to recover from any other medical condition or not, none of it is representative of how strong you are, or how hard you fought.  I am not at all trying to downplay just how terribly great the emotional turmoil is to face something like this, and of course everyone who goes through these things has to be emotionally strong if they want to get through it. But the matter of whether or not they were physically fighting hard enough to "beat" whatever they're facing just isn't accurate. Either their body takes to the medication and the therapy and the other treatments, or it doesn't.

Listening to the same fragment of butchered remixes of songs over and over and over with brain dead teenagers dancing or doing some other dumb shit. The other day my friend was by my side scrolling through IG Reels and I genuinely had to ask him to stop or put headphones cause I was about to go crazy.

4pp8ns2p	Back in the old, wild west, days of the internet it felt like certain jokes/images/gifs gained popularity more organically than today.

People didn't seem to set out to create memes, people just wanted to have fun and some things took off. It was fun to watch something grow out of obscurity or to watch people going "what the fuck is this?" knowing that you got it because it came from *your* community.     These days, if they're not outright manufactured by an advertising company they're being churned out by meme-mills like r dankmemes where people just throw shit at a wall and see what sticks; or they're something totally random that's been catapulted into orbit by some social-media-influenza with more followers brain cells.

8t5z3c6v	Yes, it was a dick move and he said some pretty reprehensible things but his kid had a life threatening reaction to something they sold him. 9/10 parents are going to go apeshit over this because their brain is going haywire from their kid almost dying.  Also, that they refused to tell him who made the smoothie and whether or not it might have peanuts in it. The guy is trying to figure out why his kid is turning blue and they won’t tell him. Imagine your kid is having a deadly reaction and you think it’s peanuts but you don’t know and the only people that can tell you for sure simply won’t because they’re afraid of getting in trouble.   People on Reddit seem more upset about the fact that he said the magic no-no words than the fact that a restaurant served a common dangerous allergen to someone who specifically asked for it to be excluded.  I really don’t see how it’s any different from someone saying “please don’t come near me if you have the flu” and you doing it anyway because you don’t know or care about their reasons.  Part of being a restaurant and selling people food is basic good safety.  Someone shouted at some high schoolers because they almost killed his kid by being negligent about what they put in food. Big deal, they’ll get over it and they needed to be shouted at anyway based on their total disregard for other people.  It’s one thing to accidentally serve someone something they are allergic to, it’s another thing to withhold that information during a life threatening medical emergency.  The real pieces of shit are the kids that filmed the guy trying to figure out why his kid is dying and then blasted him on the internet for it. Not to mention all the people online who joined up to doc this guy and end his career over it and are racing to defend the kids who refused to provide incredibly relevant info that only they had during a life threatening medical emergency.

Don’t play bad music for your kid. You’re the adult. My son loves Queen and we play Beatles and Say Anything and all kinds of fun music.   I told my friends that and they looked at me like I spat on their mom. As if every rock or pop song I play for my son actively makes him dumber.

dhydzj9j	no one wakes up with the want to be angry, just like no one wakes up with the want to be depressed.   they both stem from deep emotional and chemical imbalances. trauma, abuse, neglect feed into creating an angry person just the same as they do a depressed or anxious one.   until we start to treat them with compassion, the cycle of pain and hurt will continue.   don't tell someone "anger gets you nowhere", they know, they can't help it and need understanding as opposed to judgement.	1642987832.0	sb9qun	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb9qun/telling_someone_not_to_be_angry_is_like_telling/	telling someone not to be angry is like telling someone not to be depressed.

csx47car	Every bit of stored nuclear waste has more energy value in it than it started with. That’s why we use ‘breeder reactors’. The design purpose the nuclear reactors was to create plutonium for bombs, which has an even higher energy value than the uranium used to make it. When a fuel pellet is pulled out of a reactor it has a layer of "ash" on it that contains the plutonium as well as other byproducts of uranium fusion that slows the process efficiency, and the pellets get removed for reprocessing which removes the ‘ash’ and the good fuel underneath can be put back to work in a breeder reactor, and the plutonium can go into another of a variety of power supplies designed to maximize its potential.  The reason we have un-reprocessed nuclear fuel in storage is because of nuclear arms treaties limiting the amount of processed plutonium anyone can have at any time, and we basically don’t use any except in radio isotope generators for space craft. We could easily dispose of it safely and permanently by casting the pellets in leaded glass and dropping them down 30,000’ deep bore holes; no worries. We could even drill the holes in a reactor pattern and dump the reprocessed plutonium down hole to flux away where nothing gets harmed, and use it to power a geothermal type plant for hundreds of years.  We do not have nuclear waste, we have bomb materials storage. That’s why mankind doesn’t see any benefit out of nuclear energy, compared to what is available. And that’s why we learn about nuclear wast and all the problems, to keep us from demanding it done right. If we had full value from nuclear energy,  [Our 4500 year old scarcity based economy](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/evolution-explained/) that profits from exploiting human suffering ends, and [the Hydrogen Economy](http://H2space.org)begins and we switch to excess based Nash Equilibrium economics that allow us as a species to finally industrialize space and start really moving on.  It’s up to us though, ‘We the People’ to choose to change how we think of ourselves and Humanity as a whole.

It also has many interesting connections to hinduism, which is quite rare to find in series that has great popularity worldwide.

8fnbnlcb	Once in a while, I hear people talking about you don't need a degree to be a programmer, or you can just join an online self-directed course to get a certificate in things you are interested. But I believe none of this works in developing countries where education from an institution is very important to secure a job. this no college education and still getting a job theory comes from a very privileged, ignorant belief and can't work for everyone. besides the fact if you don't have a college degree that doesn't equate to doing small courses and having commendable knowledge. you still need to study to get a complete understanding of the subject or get trained even if you aren't in any university.  And trust me I work in one of the big MNC e.g, Google, Microsoft, Intel, AMD, Facebook. And when we say no degree required, we meant highly talented young people 😀, and the job inside is not as easy as to just watch YouTube tutorial or StackOverflow, majority of the knowledge required are concrete fundamental and a lot of creative thinking.   So you either are very passionate about the subject you are studying from online course that you are able to research and understand the latest trend then produce a spectacular project to present on your interview, or you just get a university degree. And also getting a perfect CGPA in a university don't equate to securing a job with us. The odds are just too high for a non degree people.   It's okay to have dream, but please present us some project that is not from YouTube tutorial.

8df848ud	First of all I want to say that everyone is different and if you don't agree with this that's perfectly fine I'm not expecting everybody to believe the same things that I do.  1. Everything is basically legal besides sex in high school. Like you can't smoke you can't drink and you barely can drive so why would something so mature be giving two immature people just learning life. It's bound to basically be a mistake.  2. Most people in high school will use it as a way to get away from life as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Not everyone does it for that but when it happens it's too late and then they are bound to do it again until eventually they finally come to their senses and when they realize it kind of leaves a little bit of an indent.  3. Most sexual assault victims in high school never come out because they feel as though they are too young and never will be believed. Why give something so powerful to people who aren't ready for it's yet. Not many victims come out in high school because they are too young and inexperienced. The orange ready to have to go through so much trauma so early in life  4. America has one of the highest teen mom pregnancies in the world and in a lot of generations. Even though some schools are actually teaching it safely many people are still getting pregnant I feel as though even though you can teach something so early not many people are going to listen making it a double edged sword. Even if you try to normalize it so young not many people will listen and trust your advice so you normalize something that many people probably aren't going to listen to you and by allowing this you are allowing more people to enact something they are not going to safely do.  5. Believe me when I say a lot of people have regretted the first time and it usually ends up happening in high school when I've talked to a lot of people most people who regret it are in high school as opposed to people who waited until after high school to lose it even though some have regretted it After High School I feel as though it's much lower.  6. We used to have to have kids so young in life over fear of a lot of things when we were Neanderthals. So many things could essentially kill you and that's why in theory we had to reproduce so young because we didn't have much time. But as our average age expectancies Rose it allows us to basically have a longer span of time to do things such as schooling. At the time we weren't able to have much schooling besides basic learning as we grow older because we did not expect to live on. But with Society we don't need to rush into things so carelessly. Now we can wait to do a lot of things that we couldn't before because we didn't have the time to still having kids so young is essentially a flaw. Society expects more from us considering we don't have to have kids so young and we can wait on them while we practice something we desire a degree on or even study up on a few things before calling to college.  7. Many Teen Moms acts out as they are older such as going to parties or things of that matter when their kids are able to do things for themselves or when they have more time. I've met people who act too childish at times because they spent their entire youth guarding a child and trying to be a parent and they never were able to potentially grow up. Just because you have to grow up doesn't mean you actually do grow up permanently.  8. The amount of people who accidentally get somebody pregnant high school and then just stopped caring about the child is insanely High or they just stopped caring as much. The mental strain that it has on the single mom of a high school student is never talk much about. Most moms don't get the spotlight of being able to have a success story on Tik-Tok. We all think so many moms have such good lives because Tik-Tok make it seem that way especially when all the success stories are from people who got out of that bad situation. But what about all the Teen parents who had their kids taken away or who was never able to see their kids again.  9. Giving such a mature role to somebody who is Childish doesn't often mean they are going to become a mature nor does it mean they're going to make the right decision. Most likely normalizing it will give our generation much more problems than we realize. I don't know why we have so many fourteen-year-old mom's but it scares me because I feel like people around them made them mature when they didn't have to and their youth was taken away the moment they had a child. You can still live your life but many of your friends will leave and you don't have as much support as you want to believe  BTW if you are a Teen Mom don't take this negatively I don't think any child is a bad choice they are all blessings I just don't really think sex is something we need in high school. And I hope all of the moms out there who had kids too young are well and safe but I think we have to somehow change this before the Next Generation. I think that people need to accomplish their goals before having to stop them. I've seen people who had to stop trying to be in the NFL or NBA because they had kids too young and couldn't go to college because they had to support a child. I think most of us have known somebody who got somebody pregnant and couldn't go and focus on their dreams anymore and I really do wish the best for everyone but this is something I completely feel on.	1642996813.0	sbcqxn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbcqxn/sex_in_high_school/	Sex in high school

f53dz	I say this as we just began “modernizing” the color scheme within our home at the behest of my significant other. We’ve been slowly updating things and now it’s time for my most detested activity, painting. I’m too obsessive, it’s never perfect enough and I dwell on mistakes. Ugh. It needs to be done though and I recognize that; so no complaints from me, despite all the bitching I’m doing here.  So “we” picked a nice looking grey for the first room and probably others. There’s going to be an accent wall with some color soon so my opinions may change. I think it looks good so far, I do! I’m just not super stoked about it. SO says it’s more of a *warm* grey and is really happy with it. I think it’s certainly not as warm as the old beige was. The name of the grey paint color is actually “whiskers”. Appears more light than I make it sound. It’s probably important to note that I’m colorblind, specifically deuteranopia – issues with red and green.  SO is concerned that I don’t like it but I just think it hits different for me. Claims the beige is something old ladies like. I say maybe I am an old lady! Jokes ensued, I inspect all the imperfections I need to fix and then we have dinner. Maybe I just like beige.  Now here I sit, relaxing in my currently completely beige living room. Lights dimmed.

One hypothesis for the origin of life on earth is panspermia. I personally do not subscribe to this hypothesis, I believe that life began due to the abiogenesis of organic matter. How? I have no idea, but it to me is the most likely hypothesis, but I don't see why we should not cultivate bacteria and other simple organisms that would likely thrive in Martian etc environments and see where evolution would take them.

6gtynmc	Listen, he was an asshole and his behavior was entirely unacceptable. We all agree on that. However, I really think people should consider the entire situation. He went in that shop and ordered a drink for his son, specifically requesting it not have any peanut products in it because of his son’s peanut allergy. His son drank the smoothie and then had to be rushed to the hospital to be treated for his severe allergic reaction. I don’t think it’s completely insane for a father in his position to lose his shit a little bit. I get that he went way over the line and said racist shit and everything, but I mean come on, he was surely afraid for his son’s life (or at least general well being) and then he lost his job and is being shit on by pretty much the entire internet. Yeah he fucked up, but he was in a shitty spot and I think he’s suffered enough.	1643000253.0	sbdsz0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbdsz0/we_should_cut_the_racist_smoothie_shop_guy_some/	We should cut the racist smoothie shop guy some slack.
emfc59rp	Metformin, fasting, low calorie diets, avoiding excessive inflammation, regular exercise, a diet that hits all your macros, avoiding drugs/alcohol/stds/meat have all been shown to by the latest research to slow down aging.   Personally I’ve been low calorie dieting and fasting on and off for around 18 years with regular exercise and my last InsideTracker results showed my biological age compared to people 10 years younger than me so this does work (it also reflects in how old people assume I am which is usually at least 8 years younger).  Aging can be delayed, we don’t have to accept it and live our lives thinking that it’s normal to unhealthily age. Newest research shows that it may be possible to actually arrest aging completely on a cellular level so the longer you delay your death, the higher chance you have of living longer.	1643000469.0	sbdvpp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbdvpp/you_shouldnt_just_accept_aging_it_can_be_delayed/	You shouldn’t just accept aging, it can be delayed

3tweixm4	I would like to preface this by saying that I do not and never will condone injuring, killing or causing physical harm to anyone. My opinion is based on the premise that these actions are necessary to preserve human life and therefore the sacrifice of human life is counter to the motivations and goals of my proposal.  I believe that in modern times, we have lost the capacity to conceptualize the notion that moral actions do not always fall under the rule of law. We have put the world into the hands of people who are actively destroying it for their profit. The oil pumps, the pipelines, the landfills and the garbage islands are a direct result of the actions of a conglomerate of elites who have put their needs above the needs of the many. Their primary motivation being profit and greed, the inability to produce wealth would therefore pressure them into complacency under the threat of gradually diminishing profit.  Destroying the means to produce pollutants, distribute or access them would lead to a positive result after a sufficient period of time. Sabotaging or destroying equipment destined for those ends seems to me to be a reasonable option, as long as loss of life and injury are not a consequence of that sabotage.	1643001481.0	sbe6sg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbe6sg/some_forms_of_property_destruction_and_industrial/	Some forms of property destruction and industrial sabotage are morally correct as a form of activism.

80t722rn	I might get flamed for this, but so be it.    Valorant isn’t a good game. It’s objectively designed horribly. Being an amalgam of features from both CS:GO and Overwatch all in one, the game gets overwhelming at many points in time.   The whole “precise gunplay” deal is a truckload of bullshit. There’s nothing precise about it. The spray patterns are never predictable enough to land a headshot every single time, and some guns are straight up busted under a run and gun situation.   Don’t even get me started on the in-game store. Blows my mind how Riot makes money. The most recent package of weapon skins totals up to almost 100 dollars. 100 dollars for some shitty little nerf blaster lookin ass gun skin that makes your bullets look like used tampons. It’s hilarious how they get away with that, and even more hilarious that people dump money into it constantly.   TL:DR; valorant sucks.

did5v9wc	Now before you start your judgment, I do NOT advocate training students how to shoot a gun. Teaching young people how to shoot in a classroom setting would be incredibly dangerous and irresponsible in itself. However, being that it’s is a “god given right” to own a firearm in the US, the people should know the repercussions of doing dumb shit with a gun.   With that being said, there are many people (including children) that die from gun related accidents every year that are completely avoidable with proper safety knowledge. I’ve personally introduced many people to firearms and it is unbelievable the things they find acceptable that could actually kill another person. I’ve seen people look down the barrel of a loaded gun, people shoot when another person is down range, and even people point a loaded firearm at me with a finger on the trigger. The worst part is, they see nothing wrong with their actions and some find it quite comedic. I also know many people that have died from accidental gun deaths, one of which a boy shot his girlfriend in the head with a rifle while playing with it. (His family tried to sue the manufacturer despite him literally putting the barrel to her forehead)  So if any 18 year old in the US can purchase a gun, why don’t we teach them the wrongs and rights of owning one? Learning to be safe could save lives…  (And yes, I’m quite aware that if no one owned a gun, less people would die to accidents, but that is quite a far step for American culture.)	1643005942.0	sbfim7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbfim7/firearm_safety_should_be_taught_in_american/	Firearm safety should be taught in American schools
foqlbbp1	I watched the recent Spider-Man and objectively it’s a good movie. Great CGI, good character development, good writing...but oh my god it’s soo boring.

I appreciate well put together action that feels consequential (Dune as one recent example where violence and action feel devastating all the way through). But for Marvel movies, while not solely being restricted to Marvel, this is the main problem: action in these movies are predictable and stale. It doesn’t feel new.

xbszgs4	The NFL overtime rules are just fine.   I see people complaining that both quarterbacks should be able to get the ball in overtime. If you want your quarterback to have the football, play some god damn defense. This is professional football at the highest level, and just as much emphasis should be put on defense as there is on offense, especially in an overtime situation. Overtime shouldn’t be an offensive shootout- it should be a continuation of the team game of football.   For those that would say that NFL overtime games are essentially decided by the coin toss, don’t let the game get to overtime! So many other plays influence the outcome of a game and reducing the perceived outcome to a coin toss is overly simplistic.   Side note: I think the college overtime rules are fine for college, because the overall game has much less emphasis on defense (especially compared to the NFL).	1643008408.0	sbg73s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbg73s/the_nfl_overtime_rules_are_just_fine/	The NFL Overtime rules are just fine.

What if I rather wanna sleep etc. 19-04 rather than 11-07. Like it doesn't prevent me from working a normal 9-17 job. Sure it probably limits your social life more but if that's not a need you have then just why, so many people would just question everything you do and talk bad about you cus "ew why do you sleep during the day". Well shut up I still get my work done so if that works for me leave me alone.	1643009775.0	sbgjtu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgjtu/why_does_sleeping_at_night_have_to_be_the_normal/	Why does sleeping at night have to be the "normal"

fs4t7	I’m nowhere near a gym rat, actually I’d love to go to the gym more often, but often times you have to wait sooooo, long for a squat rack or a bench press to become free at busy gyms, it adds a lot of time to your workout.  Making the workout unpleasant and often discouraging.   I am constantly seeing people hog up barbells in a squat racks and bench presses with ten pound plates or twenty pounds in plates on each side for a total of 65-85 pounds.   While that maybe heavy to some, that exercise could easily be done with dumbbells, freeing up the squat rack or barbell.   So if you are doing exercises at a weight that can be done with dumbbells, than you should do so.  Leave the squat racks and bench presses to those who actually need them, those who lift at a weight that cannot be done with dumbbells alone.	1643010489.0	sbgqgw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgqgw/at_the_gym_if_you_can_do_the_exercise_with_a/	At the gym, if you can do the exercise with a dumbbells, you shouldn’t hog up a squat rack or bench press.
16rg2a	Yes, the WNBA sucks compared to the NBA.  Yes, some of their players are delusional wanting the same salary as NBA players, even though they don't bring in even nearly the same amount of money.  Yes, if it wasn't for the NBA and its financial support, the WNBA would probably cease to exist.  Having said that, I feel like there's waaay too much hate towards the WNBA. If there's a single post about the WNBA on any social media, most of the comments are just pure hate + mocking the players how much they suck.   Like I said, I agree the WNBA isn't that great, but the amount of hatred it gets is undeserved, especially from some males who I doubt have achieved more in life than any of the WNBA players out there.	1643010652.0	sbgs4m	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgs4m/the_wnba_doesnt_deserve_the_amount_of_hate_it_gets/	The WNBA doesn't deserve the amount of hate it gets.
7vphrskw	Lately, a lot of people post opinions on how not having a partner and being alone is nice and good.    While i do think that you should not be ashamed of not having a partner, i think that it's quite dangerous to normalize.    Humans are highly social beings and not having anyone to share intese intimacy with that goes beyond sex or being a close friend, will leave a lot of people very alone and sad at the end of the day.   On the other hand, i think a lot of people aren't able to provide this kind of intimacy to each other which makes being with them worse than being alone!	1643010659.0	sbgs7s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgs7s/normalising_being_alone_is_a_quite_dangerous_road/	Normalising "being alone" is a quite dangerous road we are heading down.
s84u9zi	For long, long time we are being thought that ever life matter and everyone should have equal chances in life.      The terrifying truth that all of these are lies. Not every life matters and we will never have equal chances in life. It is not only about material issues, it is also about ability to learn, intelligence etc.    Second truth of the day is that the fact you were born as human is not the same with becoming Human. By Human I mean being able to live within society, with reasoning based on knowledge, logic and common sense, who is not being radicalized into delusional fanaticism.  To be able to step out of self-centrist point of view and look items from other perspective. To grow as entity in the world.      Sadly there are people who does not meet minimum criteria of the above. Their existence is being reduce to just be, consume, and not die another day. Not because they stuck in low paid job, just because they don't care. Some of them are filled with some delusional thinking about race superiority, or that their way of be is best and everyone should follow.  People who stand against living in society in aggressive way. And there like like no logical explanation to keep these people alive. There is no input from them into society. Well it is good if they at least are not damaging common good.   &#x200B;  The only two reason for not purging community is :  \- Moral hesitation of killing other living being   \- lack of metric you can use to make it.... reasonably right.	1643010709.0	sbgstn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgstn/big_part_of_society_should_be_dead/	Big part of society should be dead.

i2ziw245	I really don't understand when people say they want a big Sudan or a coupe. I personally thing that, unless you want a car with a lot of space, a small hatchback is far better at doing everything. It's small (good for the city) but not too small so you don't have space for anything (they are actually surprisingly spaceous), they have some power in them, it's way easier to maintain, most of them come With a lot of good features, really affordable, suuuuuuuuper fun to drive around (especially with friends) and they are very cozy and have something like a personality to them. Kinda like a small house. So many people that either can or will buy their first car (especially car enthusiasts) always want to buy a huge sportscar or their parents tell them to buy a long sedan, they get overwhelmed and can't maintain it, they find it hard to learn and eventually sell it. I always recommend to new drivers to get a small affordable car and if they don't like it, its not as much of a economic problem to upgrade from a small car to a bigger ont than the other way around. In conclusion, if you are not a car guy with experience in what you like or someone that does crazy big car trips frequently (which even then I think a small car can handle it) don't go immediately on a big car	1643010902.0	sbgul1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgul1/smaller_cars_are_far_superior_than_bigger_cars_in/	Smaller cars are far superior than bigger cars in almost everything
z3ldk	I saw a post recently regarding a video online about a some market traders beating an orangutan to death for taking fruit to feed her babies and of course the comments that followed were "humans are the worst".   I usually see similar themes and posts about how evil humans are and how animals are sooooo much better. It's so frustrating to hear because what do you think that orangutan would have done if it caught a human stealing it's food from her babies? Do people really think it would have politely shared it's food with us and we would have had a nice Thanksgiving meal? That shit would have tore our faces off so fast.   Another comment in the same thread mentioned a horse casually eating a baby chick right in front of the mother hen like nothing while the hen is going crazy. No one called horses evil. God forbid a human did that.  I read a story from India about a dog killing a baby monkey. The monkeys went down to the village and killed all of the puppies by dropping them off a cliff and when they ran out of puppies they started attacking children. Are monkeys evil too?  It only seems like in these situations everyone likes hate on humans but ignore when animals commit heinous and horrific acts as well If anything I think humans are by far more compassionate than animals.	1643011107.0	sbgwc1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgwc1/humans_are_not_evil_and_tend_to_be_more/	Humans are not evil and tend to be more compassionate than animals.

63zdpkls	I think every instalment after Syndicate just lost the unique story and passion we know old Ubisoft for.  Don't get me wrong, Syndicate was nowhere near AC2 in terms of quality, but it was clearly the end of their thematic tone after 2015.   Everything after 2015 felt like a generic RPG. Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, they felt NOTHING like the Assassins Creeds we grew up and loved. I am not a gatekeeping elitist, and I am not against games changing the formula IF it's done properly and with a clear goal in mind. But these new Assassins Creed games feel soulless. Sure they might look a bit better, and the mechanics feel smoother (other than the stealth, there is no stealth in these new games Lmao), but they haven't got any heart.  These new instalments are shit, and the reason I think that this is an unpopular opinion is because most people actually seem OKAY with the diversion in story quality from these games. They're okay with it because the mechanics and graphics are cleaner, at the expense of decent writing and an engaging story/interesting characters.  If you think these games are overall good, that's fine, but you don't like them for being Assassins Creed games.	1643012689.0	sbhbcj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbhbcj/the_latest_assassins_creed_games_suck/	The Latest Assassins Creed Games Suck

Honesty is when you break something and instead of hiding it, you tell your parents/friend right away.  Honesty is when you own up to your mistakes.  You can be kind and honest without sugarcoating it, you can be honest without letting everybody else know your business or what you're talking about, you can be honest without hurting somebody else's feelings.

In my experience, at-fault drivers are apologetic and honest. Attacking someone without giving them the opportunity to accept responsibility is unfair and immature. Accidents happen, and they sometimes have severe consequences. But at the end of the day, they’re accidents. If you wouldn’t scream at a stranger for bumping into you, you shouldn’t scream at a stranger for accidentally wrecking into you— especially without understanding what exactly caused the accident (it’s acceptable to be angry at someone for driving drunk, texting and driving, etc) and  allowing them to admit guilt is irrational.	1643017594.0	sbij39	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbij39/confronting_someone_with_anger_after_a_car/	Confronting someone with anger after a car accident is irrational and immature, even if that person is at fault.

Jim supports her through all her art school, which she fails, and she can’t return the favor when he starts Athlead. Not to mention the wack plot in the final season with the camera man. All in all, I guess a relationship that’s built off making a move on an engaged woman doesn’t have the greatest starting point to jump from. That’s why the episode with Roy’s wedding shows how much better off he is without Pam because Pam truly enjoyed being in a relationship with him just so she could feel like she was the better person in the relationship and focus on his flaws instead of her own.

The number of pointless remakes I think we can all agree on is endless, but I don’t think you should even be allowed to make a newer version til the overseas version has done a complete run on a leading network. “What’s the point in remaking it then?” Exactly - if you don’t have a solid reason to remake it, then don’t. Truly convince me as an audience member why I should attempt an American remake when I either loved or hated the original international version.  The British version of Ghosts was wildly better but a lot will only watch the poorly done US remake. Call Me Kat is absolute garbage whereas it’s original UK concept Miranda is side splittingly funny.   Sure we have a rare successes like The Office and Shameless but I still think the original versions should’ve been aired fully on mainstream/leading TV.

xbv17	First of all, sports fandom is kind of a weird thing in it of itself. I love sports and am a fan of my teams, but I think it's kinda lame when grown ass adults get super emotionally invested in whether their team wins or loses, and i definitely used to be that type of person as a teen and young adult. I do feel some nerves during crunch time of the games, but i dont let the outcome really affect me that much. if they win, dope. if they lose, oh well.  Also, the people that try to gatekeep fandom are super lame to me. Sports are really just an entertainment product, so there isn't really a right or wrong way to consume them. there is nothing wrong with being a fan of certain players and rooting for them individually, rather than having a specific team that you root for. And people always talk about being a diehard fan of a shitty team, like that earns them sympathy points, and act like its a taboo to switch to being a fan of another team. If I'm a fan of a team that's inept and their ownership is shitty, then that team does not deserve my support.

I get that this guy is only 15 and shouldn't be having sex but getting angry and causing an argument over such a thing isn't going to solve a single problem. In Season 2 she's just in a mood, no idea why yet but the fact that she's disregarding everyone around her just because she's in a mood is stupid because if somebody else happens to be in a mood and gets angry at her she would play victim.   Basically, she's just that kind of person who is happy go lucky until something goes wrong in which case they turn into the devil incarnate. She treats her family like crap, she treats her husband like crap, she treats most people around her like crap. The only reason she's important is because she married superman, if that wasn't the case you would just view her as somebody with a big temper.	1643019581.0	sbj0w4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbj0w4/lois_from_superman_lois_is_a_horrible_person/	Lois from Superman & Lois is a horrible person
jf9nk	Nurses brag about their job too much  RNs everywhere are practically chomping at the bit to let you know that they’re a nurse. Whether it’s in their bio, on their car, etc. Nurses do important work they literally save lives but so do doctors, surgeons, EMTs, firefighters, etc.  Not only do they brag about how hard their jobs are but they also brag about the pay which is well above average but not as high as impressive as they seem to make it sound.

4vs18fzg	As a person who has love for style and over the years tried many styles (leather jacket cool, bussiness casual, streetstyle) but I just found my love for functional clothing (often identified as techwear although techwear also has other implications). It is so nice on the skin, is warmer, elastic, breathable, wears out slower, can be pretty affordable (when compared with brand clothing). It just has so much advantages against cotton, standard poly, wool etc. And it CAN be made into nice fashionable clothing (doesn't have to be bright colors and sportish style). Thankfully a lot of businesses started making functional button downs, stylish sweaters, or even jackets. I'd just love functional fabrics to be made into classic style clothing more often so I can feel like in the comfiest sporty clothes when wearing my button down to work.

There are over ***7 BILLION*** people in the world.  1. If you care about the value of life, the hundreds of thousands we spend on a relatively few individuals could be much more efficiently spent either improving thousands of times more lives that are just in poverty, or giving bare necessities to those starving or lacking other bare necessities, or  2.

1zrx17vd	TL;DR version: 5G towers are not a threat to aviation, and airlines are lying to you because corporations want control.  Cell communications do not interfere with avionics. The recent uproar over the 5G towers near airports is not based on any actual concern for safety, but as a method of exerting unnecessary control over people. Tough understand how this sounds, this isn't some tinfoil hat conspiracy. Allow me to explain.  They continually make the same comments about general cellphone usage. This simply isn't true. First, we need some numbers. Cell towers have an effective range of about 500yds and a power consumption of about 1-1.5kw. the FAA also generally requires roads to be at least 1000 feet away from the end of a runway.  Signal strength drops off with the inverse-square law. That means that the signal degrades very rapidly. Beyond the effective range of a transmitter, you may not even be same to detect it. With a 5G Tower, you hit about 3% of the transmitted power at the distance between the end of the runway and the transmitter.  So you have a cell tower that can pump RF out to 500 yds. But at that range, you have a few (as in single digit wattage) of RF getting to a plane.  But it gets better. General aviation, something like a little Cessna 172 or Piper Cub, generally operate between 500-1000ft. This means that small aircraft regularly fly in the "danger zone" of 5G. This happens with systems less hardened to RF radiation than larger aircraft. However, they experience no ill effects. Yet you are supposed to be worried about what'll happen to an objectively better-engineered aircraft that was designed to survive direct lightning strikes.  Now, RF emissions can screw with aircraft. On an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the AN/SPY-1D has a power consumption of about 6MW. So 3-4,000 times the amount of energy in a 5G tower. And when the Navy conducts flight operations on such a ship, they need to create a cutout in the radar for a helicopter to approach. But this is usually done at a distance of a few thousand years. So again, 5G could be a problem, but only if it was at several hundred or thousand times the power of the current antennas.  So why create all this commotion? Why tell us to put phones in airplane mode to begin with? Well, a fast moving cell phone can cause a lot of network congestion. You can move between multiple cell towers quicker than the cell towers can refresh and drop off your moving cell phone. With several airplanes with several hundred people each, this can basically create a cell phone blackout around an airport. Each person is simply tying up space on multiple towers simultaneously, and the system just bogs down. The FCC, not the FAA, is the interested party in this case. They are the ones who pushed for airplane mode functionality on phones.  As for the airlines themselves, there must be some financial motive or underlying psychopathy from the CEOs that's driving this. 5G functionality near airports substantially undercuts the ability to sell Wi-Fi inside the airport, which many airports and airlines use for income. It wouldn't surprise me that the lost money from airport Wi-Fi subscriptions is financial cause enough to try to make cell phones unusable near an airport. Or maybe it's simply the fact that one in five CEOs are complete psychopaths, with no redeeming human characteristics. Maybe they just like the fact that they can take away your ability to call for help.  Regardless of the reason given, the concerns over cell phone use and air travel are fake. The planes avionics are more than capable of handling whatever RF transmission or EM spectrum radiation that a cell tower, cell phone, laptop, or even a lightning bolt puts out. But here we are, having corporations deciding what we can and can't have, and nobody bats an eye. Nobody wants to be well informed enough to tell a corporation to fuck off for the benefit of the people. I guess that's what they call late stage capitalism.	1643023158.0	sbjybu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbjybu/the_5g_risk_to_aviation_is_made_up_to_control_you/	The 5G risk to aviation is made up to control you

Life is difficult enough without being bullied because a bunch of social media warriors chose to turn your name into a fucking insult.

4w0y5xwu	I had an altercation with my parents and relatives. Some personal stuff was involved, I was shocked to see how much immature my relatives are. They kept bringing up past mistakes that I made as arguments, anf when I told them that I fixed my problems or I'm working on it. They say that they don't care and it is my business not theirs. So much Hypocrisy. And when I called them out on it,they get mad. And I don't I always talk in a calm voice. And whenever I'm called out I keep my cool, And acknowledge when I'm wrong. They don't...      I Realized that a bunch of adults act like that...  Always hypocritical when they are given the chance. Never acknowledge your mistakes as an adult And always get mad when someone calls you out or hearing sommething that you don't like...  This is how children act when they are like 10.  Children have an excuse of an underdeveloped brain, and they haven't learned how to argument on different topics... but adults have a fully developed brain. This unfortunately affects the whole world imo. Many people think that being immature is being childish, but being immature is not thinking twice on what you say or do, and having a short temper. There should be lessons in school, that tought you on how to acknowledge your mistakes, on how to be always calm in arguments. This is not something that past generations do. This is something that is being passed out by parents to their children. I would guess that 70% of parents in the entire world are immature, and that gets passed when the child becomes an adult. And it is a circle that will never stop until a child realizes how to be mature in life.	1643024972.0	sbkfit	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbkfit/it_is_incredible_that_there_are_so_many_immature/	It is incredible that there are so many immature people on this planet

We put ourselves out there, love, have the things we love taken away from us, and try and love again.  And every time, we get it right just a *little* bit more. That's a beauty worth protecting.

2onb7jl5	This recently came up again in one of my internet circles: Oh, it's such a good thing that Disney cast a black actress to play Ariel in the live action *The Little Mermaid*.  No. It's not. It's lazy is what it is.   Listen: as much as people hate to admit it, the majority of Disney fairy tale movies come from Britain and Germany. Most of them are bastardized (yes, I am using that word correctly, thank you) versions of the *Grimm Fairytales*. (And if you don't believe me that the fairy tales have been mangled, let me remind you that the word "grim" in the English language does not mean "happy" and there's a reason for that.) Others (such as *The Little Mermaid* specifically) come from Hans Christian Anderson, who was Danish. Which, again, is from that tiny little bit of Europe.  Branch out. Africa has mermaid lore. South America has mermaid lore. (Hell, South America has *freshwater* mermaids!) These mermaids are all different! You can even branch out! Chinese mermaids are different from Korean mermaids which are different still from Japanese mermaids.  I think it says a lot that the most popular Disney movies are Moana and Encanto, and neither one of them are based in freaking *Europe*. That mine has been tapped out, close it and open a new one somewhere else. Anywhere else! For crying out loud, Disney hasn't even tapped Irish, Scottish (*Brave* was just the tip of the iceberg of stuff they could do there), French, *Russian* fairy tales and folklore.  In short: if you're going to give me a black mermaid, Disney, then I damn well expect a black story to go with her (or him).	1643026975.0	sbl10f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbl10f/i_think_disney_is_just_being_lazy_at_this_point/	I think Disney is just being lazy at this point.

btcquchf	Parents are horrible culprits of using the phrase "I know what it was like to be a kid" or "I remember when I was your age."   No, you fucking do not. Not only do you not fucking remember, you have to take into consideration that today's standards of being a kid are not the same standards in place when you were a kid.   I'm approaching 28, with no kids, or wife lol. But that doesn't matter because I'm not foolish enough to think I 100% remember what it was like to be in my teen years or younger, experiencing those overwhelming feelings of hormones and emotions to be hanging out with friends on summer break, to be pursuing the first perceived love that I have, to be yearning for that first kiss that's just taking way too long to get.  You parents and adults that think you remember childhood, very, very likely don't actually remember it.  You remember that you went through those feelings, sure.  But you don't actually remember what it truly felt like. And using that phrase you're ignorantly dismissing how those feelings can be vastly different for your child today through the use of social media, discord chats, and now online schooling.	1643029646.0	sbltrr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbltrr/parents_and_adults_in_their_thirties_definitely/	Parents and adults in their thirties DEFINITELY DO NOT remember what it was like to be a kid the way they think they do.

6he7pohp	Well,there are two different point of view.First,singleplayer,what make a good singleplayer game?A great game can provide unique experience for every playthrough via RNG and AI etc.This make the player actually "create" something unique for the player itself everytime they play and this is why a game is great and fun!Of course,playing a normal playthrough isn't enough to be proud of,but inventing a new way to play the game for fun or speedrunning and breaking a record in a game are something to actually be proud on since you created something unique.In short,uniqueness is essential to make playing a singleplayer game fun,great and something that can be proud of.And rhythm game simply never be able to do that,it is always the same,same level,same music,same script and you can't even express the damn script in your own way like acting!No matter how hard you make it,it is still the same as before,muscle memory,muscle memory and muscle memory.Yeah,I know you will say it is fullfilling to achieve something hard,but you know what make this kind of thing fullfilling?The unique process!You are not climbing Mount Elvis for the sake of doing it,is to enjoy the process of conquring it which make conquring has it meaning,and this is also unique!And the process of finishing a really hard rhythm game?practice your muscle memory,that is it and all of it which is the same for everyone!What about mastering it then?still the same,no matter how skillful you are,the record is still the same,it has a hard ceiling on it!There is no mastering on something that has a hard ceiling that a human can achieve.I just can't imagine having fun and proud of something that is the same for everyone!Well to the second point of view,mutilplayer,atleast you can win someone over it right?Nope.Running,swimming and most olympic sports are also not unique when doing them but you can win someone to make it fun,fullfilling and proud of,is'nt it?That is because they don't have a hard ceiling for a human!You can always do better,excel to win someone at those sports,that is what 'winning' meant!But rhythm game?you can only do it perfectly by not making mistake and wait for your opponent to fuck up by themselves!Do you really consider it is a win for waiting your opponent fuck it up?In short,if you can't really win in it,how do you have fun and fullfilling in it?Base on this two point of view,I find myself unable to understand the rather big fanbase of rhythm game which think rhythm game is fun,fullfilling and something to be proud of.     p.s.

43k6q6vk	I see people arguing all the time and for example there was a post about a woman who made a TikTok texting her man and asking if he liked a dress from a photo she sent him and he said it was too revealing, then she sent a photo of a instagram model in it and in the screenshot it shows that he liked the photo. Women and men in the comments kept debating whether she was wrong or he was wrong, and throughout the comments I've noticed that mainly people call out others so called "hypocrisy" and then contradict themselves by being hypocritical and say things that makes their points null and void. The funniest part is that when I see these debates they never truly debate over the actual point of the post but instead focus on only people being consistent with their points (or 'brownie points' for some reason) and while yes it's good so they themselves aren't hypocritical, they always act like their side is correct and no matter what others say they will start to dig a deeper hole for themselves defending their point and still try to correct others for being hypocritical and inconsistent when they are more so than others.

391r0bys	I hear a lot of people in real life, but especially on reddit, wistfully long for the days of pensions where a company would cut you a check from its pension plan after you retired til the day you died.  That is just fucking absurd. Do you not realize all the downsides of pensions?  1: If the company mismanages the pension, you're potentially fucked. And this has happened.  2: You have to stay with the same company, in some cases most or all of your career. Bear in mind that the very same redditors who MOAN about not having pensions anymore will turn around and advise you to switch companies every two years to get more pay. Hate to break it to you, but these positions conflict.  3: The contributions are roughly the same. You had to pay into pension plans JUST like you pay into your 401k/Roth IRA.  4: This way I carry my retirement and savings on my back with me wherever I go. I change companies? I'm fine. I move across the country? I'm fine.  5: I have more control over my financial planning and retirement. You wanna do FIRE? Good fucking luck doing that with a pension plan. Many pension plans historically didn't have an OPTION to retire early unless the pension fund was losing solvency (in which case you're getting pennies on the dollar) because the entire fucking point of the pension plan was to basically shackle you to that company.  Long story short, pension plans were golden shackles used to lock employees to their employer. I think their death has ultimately empowered employees and are a good thing. There is one notable group that has been hurt:  Irresponsible people who are bad at planning for the future. Sorry, sucks for them.	1643031109.0	sbmagq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbmagq/the_current_system_of_investment_retirement/	The Current System of Investment Retirement Accounts is VASTLY Superior to Pensions and I'm GLAD that Pensions are Dying

52eeclje	As the title goes, I never get the point of camping, it’s basically people looking to put unnecessary efforts on themselves.  It’s not like picnic, where you bring pre-made or ordered food and stuff to hang out with your friends with a short period of time. I don’t understand why do people have to suffer and prepare extra chairs, camping necessities and cooking food in nature, it could be cold or hot, with uninvited bugs, it’s not hygiene and most places are not equipped with proper amenities, not to mention doing the dishes.  Lastly, the idea of sleeping in car or in a camp outside on purpose it’s just mind-blowing, why would you suffer when you have a real shelter built for people (home) to prevent you from extreme temperatures, rain, snow or wind, etc. The idea of sleeping out can never be more beneficial than sleeping in your own bed, I really don’t understand why people suffer from this.  I can see the point of chilling in nature or parks for a certain period of time, like picnic, but sleeping out and cooking on scene is going way to far, you’d need proper sinks, pan, stove, oven, and dishes to make dishes, building everything on scratch and using those camping stuff are always leaving trashes behind and make it extremely troublesome. You’re not meant to have modern dining outside, we’re not primitive anymore, except for like a small barbecue bonfire session, I really don’t applaud for the idea of bring silverware and pans there.

149on6	Traditional sports and games have detailed rules publically available. People can check whether a certain situation in a match happened according to the rules. Also, they can verify whether the rules aren't rigged for one side.  Most e-sports are programs where the players send inputs, and the programs somehow decide who wins. Understanding roughly how an e-sport works isn't difficult, but that its source code isn't available means that there may be undiscovered bugs that may create unexpected behavior, and the program can be rigged to favor one side, which may be slight enough that it wouldn't be detectable.  The source code of an e-sport is the rules, and if a sport should be taken seriously, it should have publically available rules. The creators of the e-sport may worry that the source code could be taken and used in a different e-sport or game; that could be a problem, but it would be a much smaller problem if e-sports commonly had public source code because it would be easily discovered by looking at the code. The creator of the e-sport could release detailed documentation instead of the code itself, but then bugs could invalidate some matches because they would be against the public rules.	1643033461.0	sbn2ve	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbn2ve/all_big_esport_games_should_have_public_source/	All big e-sport games should have public source code.

hj2uwizo	For gore videos or obscene videos depicting real acts of violence to be made people have to be hurt, and people who view or possess these types of videos create demand for it. Demand for these videos incentivizes people who have these videos to distribute them on the internet.   Victims who are featured in these types of videos are likely going through the worst moment of their lives and every time someone views these videos it’s like they’re being re-victimized. For example, there was a video of a kidnapping victim (racially motivated crime) being beaten and taunted on video that was circulated on social media. That was likely the worst moment of his life especially considering the fact he has the mental age of a child. Every time that video is viewed or shared online he’s being victimized all over again.   If they don’t survive the production of the video then for their family and friends every time the video is viewed or shared it’s like their loved one is being killed all over again. For example, there was a video of two tourists being decapitated in Morocco. The video was very graphic and was widely viewed and distributed on gore based websites. For the family of the victims every time the video was shared or viewed online it was like their family members were being killed all over again.   Viewing or sharing gore based videos or videos that are obscenely violent causes harm to victims and their families. People who view or share these videos should be held responsible for the damage they caused to the victims and their families.	1643036288.0	sbo1yx	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbo1yx/anyone_who_views_possesses_or_distributes_gore_or/	Anyone who views, possesses, or distributes gore or obscenely violent videos should be arrested and imprisoned

pgoqq	I see kids/teenagers with crooked teeth and I know their parents have the financial means to fix them.  I know they managed to go through life with crooked teeth, so "if it was good enough for me it's good enough for them." That needs to stop.  Also, if you're an adult with crooked teeth then get a consult from an orthodontist. There are more reasons to fix your teeth besides aesthetics.  However,  aesthetics are the main reason because of the social consequences that percolate to every aspect of life. We as people judge the crap out of people with bad teeth whether we know it or not.  Fix your teeth for yourself and your kids.  For those who can't afford it... that sucks. It should be standard medical care.	1643036814.0	sbo91v	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbo91v/fix_your_teeth_and_your_kids/	Fix your teeth and your kids!

Reddit seems to get a kick out of those videos and fully supports them. Buying magnets and repeatedly putting them on someone's car after being asked to stop is over the top.

There are entirely too many functioning alcoholics among us who are in grave denial. People around us enable us because it makes them forget about their own alcohol problem and feel less guilty.   People should have to go through mandatory counseling about I'll effects of alcohol and long term excess consumption before they're allowed to drink legally.  Suburban bars encourage drunk driving.

9xmvh	Every time I see a fight video coming out of a highschool nowadays they are increasingly brutal. I see more and more tactics that are borderline attempted murder. Head stomping, suplexes into concrete, eye gouging, biting, etc. I personally feel that this is for a few reasons.   1. The stakes are too high.  -  With schools implementing "zero tolerance" policies for fighting, emotionally charged young people know that once they're in a fight, or they reach they're breaking point, no matter what happens the consequences are the same. In other words, if you're getting expelled or suspended you might as well get your money's worth.   2. The taboo of fighting makes them unfamiliar with the consequences.  - if you've never been in a fight in your entire life because you've been trying to abide by the rules, you have no reference for consequences of certain things. If you've never been punched in the head then you cannot understand how much worse getting kicked in the head could be.   3. Your reputation hinges on 1 fight.  - if you're a young person who's found themselves in a fight, you have to win. You're only going to do this once and if you lose, you're forever a lover.    I think if we could reduce or remove some of these, we would see an increase in fights but the level of violence within would be greatly reduced. The sane level of this is to lower the consequences of fighting in schools. The less than sane version would be to teach boxing and/or wrestling to familiarize the youth with violence and its consequences. The craziest level would be for the schools to organize safe fights between consenting students. Headgear, mouthguards, gloves, a soft surface, and a referee would allow these kids to fight (which I feel they're going to do anyways) in a much safer, lower stakes, environment.	1643038079.0	sbootc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbootc/kids_should_be_allowed_to_fight/	Kids should be allowed to fight

3yrrmzii	I am a guy in my mid 20s. Due to this I get a lot of posts about people my age not knowing what they are doing in life. Working dead end jobs, failing out of school and just feeling overall lost in life.   Due to this there a lot of social media influencers who have gained popularity by telling in my age group that it is "ok" to be lost and not have a clue what you are doing. That eventually you will figure things out and to not stress about it.   I understand that not everyone's life works out they plan and that major life events can derail anyone's progress. But telling young people to not stress about having no plans or goals in life is horrible for their future.   I also understand that people can get a "late start" in their lives and still be very successful. But spending years of your life failing to start shouldn't be normal.   Not knowing what you are doing in life should be stressful. It should keep you up at night. It should be the main thing on your mind most days. As much as it sucks having a good career and being financially stable is something you have to spend years working on.   A vast majority of people my age are wasting years of their lives avoiding their problems and big decisions. Wondering what they want to do or feeling "lost" but never trying to solve the issue. Living in their mom's basement trying not to think about the fact that they are losers.     It is ok to take some time to figure yourself out and what you want to do. But actually spend the time thinking and exploring options not smoking weed in your childhood bedroom. Go back to college, learn a trade, get a certificate.

For example: the recent video where the Florida father flips out at a smoothie bar for peanuts being added to a drink of someone allergic to them. I’m not saying what he did was acceptable (it wasn’t). However as a parent I can see why he was upset and angry. As an online community it’s wrong to pass judgment on someone on a 30-90 second video. The online rage has cost this man his career and his reputation. Do we as a community have that right? Should he be accountable for his actions? Absolutely, but that is not for you or I to pass judgment on. That’s for law enforcement and the courts to decide.   What if it was your child that had the allergic reaction?

I think the latter may be the worst aspect.  It gets people riled up over events that don't directly affect them and it causes fights in comment sections or with peers. It divides us as people.  I can't stand seeing it.  I was reading a book recently (I forget the name) and it posed the question along the lines of, "how much time in a day do you spend in your own thoughts thinking about your own life, not including the shower or in bed."

But to me, he just happened to be champion at the time where the weight class was outclassed in PRIDE FC.   People also state that his fighting style was boring, but never seen to take into account that when he wasn't doing much in the cage, his opponent wasn't either.  He defended of multiple occasions, has some pretty nice knockouts under his belt, and got there in the first place.   If anything, you have to give some credit to him for even bothering to hold the division up when he could have just relinquished the title and gave up.

508pd6o7	A push in allot of major universities is to remove Greek life especially fraternities in regards to sexual assault and alcohol. Removing these organizations will cause more harm than good.   Fraternities are governed by both Governing bodies and the schools them selves. Members often have the highest GPA on campus There houses have to be zoned and special built in order to handle large amounts of people. Sexual assault in fraternities (when governed well) is dealt with quickly and severely. International chapters want to keep there image. In a fraternity party you know who is there.   If these governed organizations were removed the increase of apartment parties and underground fraternities would blow up. These are dangerous because there is no oversight.

Why would people who get so much money spend it all in such a short time? After contemplating it, I think I understand.   After winning the lottery most people begin spending like crazy. Other people start treating them differently and they get used to the lifestyle that comes with wealth. The problem is, lottery winners don't actually know how to earn money. (at least not that much money). They only know how to spend it. They upgrade their lifestyle and go into a deficit, slowly (or quickly) draining their bank account.

For those of you who are going to scream about income inequality, I agree this is  going to be purely used by those who have the means but as I said go ahead and give it to folks who do show up. Assuming you have a pool of 30 jurors (no idea) and you have three that can pay you just bumped the pay that day to $135 per person.

ds3kaez5	I always see these videos of "Shopping Cart Police", or "Shopping Cart Narcs".  If you haven't seen them, it's basically either random people, or workers at a grocery/supermarket.  The go around berating people, attempting to force them to put the shopping carts back into the designated holding areas.  First of all, these people generally take an asshole tone.  They "demand" it, often in a way that comes off as almost threatening.  Big strong men telling 50+ year old ladies "believe me, you're going to put it back" comes off as threatening to me.  And it just comes off as entitled as hell.  A dude whose job is to go around and collect the cart starts being rude, and getting on his moral high horse because you're making his job harder... as if it's everyone's full time job to make his HEROIC job easier.  They act like they're EMS or firefighters, or soldiers, and you're disrespecting their difficult jobs that are so vital to society.  I get the idea.  And a few years ago, these videos were actually funny, because the people doing them weren't assholes.  They'd simply ask you to put your cart back, or JOKINGLY/IRONICALLY make it into some serious thing.  But now, these people are actually being serious.  They think it's some heinous moral offense, and that you're a bad person if you're not putting your cart in the holder.  For whatever reason these videos are all over reddit now, and it's cringe.  I feel it's emblematic of a problem in society as a whole of people feeling so entitled that even cart people are now feeling like their human rights are violated when they actually have to gather carts.    To me, it'd be like a maid from a Hotel berating you for not making your own bed, or not keeping your room perfectly tidy, which makes her do more work.  THAT IS YOUR JOB.  I am a janitor for my job.  I don't go around berating customers when they drop little bits of popcorn, and pretend they are evil people for making my job harder.  Because that is my job... it's not their job to worry about the floor being clean.  To be clear, there is a difference between leaving a cart in a dangerous place on a windy day where it's obviously going to cause problems(just to clear that up before people bring it up).	1643040812.0	sbpphi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbpphi/shopping_cart_police_videos_arent_funny/	Shopping Cart Police Videos Aren't Funny

Trap music is just a small part in the whole history of Hip-Hop. There are so many genres of rap, it is insane – Jazz Rap, Glitch Hop, Trap, Melodic Rap, Gangsta Rap, Emo Rap, Horrorcore, Industrial Hip-Hop, Alternative Hip-Hop, Abstract Hip-Hop, East Coast Hip-Hop, West Coast Hip-Hop just to name a few.  "Oh, but only mumble (c)rap is mainstream, other stuff isn't popular! Rap died when 2Pac died.". Kendrick Lamar has nearly 31 million monthly listeners on Spotify and has released several of the greatest albums that I have heard in any genre, mainly "To Pimp A Butterfly" and "good kid, m.A.A.d city". Little Simz has over 3 million monthly listeners and has released one of the best records of last year. Tyler The Creator has 22 million and is one of the kost creative musicians in recent years. Good Hip-Hop isn't just not mainstream. You are just dismissing it.  Finally, if you want to get into Hip-Hop, here are some of my favourites rap records out there:  Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp A Butterfly   Avantdale Bowling Club – Avantdale Bowling Club  Injury Reserve – By the Time I Get to Pheonix   Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill  Tyler, The Creator – IGOR (it is more Neo-Soul, but Tyler usually makes rap music, so...)

I’ve generally noticed a complete lack of care for holding up entire groups of people so they can have the damn cigarette and they always wait until the most inconvenient time to decide that they need one _right now._  God forbid they don’t get the cigarette? Or have to wait five minutes? Better bet they’re in a shitty mood and will talk and talk and talk about how bad they want a cig until they get one.

I’ve never really got the joke and it doesn’t help that it’s literally everywhere, which is just annoying. If you find this joke funny in the slightest, please tell me why. I’d genuinely like to know. I don’t see what’s funny about calling someone a different name from the name they were assigned at birth with, or the name they want to be called.

5g40fktj	I'm not posting this to anger people; I am posting this because I know some of the things I say in this post will be incorrect, and I want to get other people's perspectives on my opinions so I can revise them.   I recognize there are people in truly unfortunate situations, and this post does not apply to those people.   If you haven’t done the things necessary to make yourself a marketable employee, that’s on you. What is a company supposed to do? Hire an incompetent person because they feel bad for you. Minimum wage jobs are designed for people with minimal work experience and skills. I suspect many people complaining about not having a high-paying job didn’t do jack shit in high school. Yeah, the system is corrupt and shitty, and I’m sorry if you come from poverty. However, being born in poverty in America still puts you ahead of most people in the world. If you are from a low-income family, bust your ass off and get into a prestigious private school because they will cover full tuition. As a poor individual, you can go to a school that costs 75k a year for free, an opportunity the middle class doesn’t have. If you can’t get into a private school, that’s ok. Not everyone can, and low-income students often don't have the resources provided to them to get into these schools. However, if this is the case, don’t say fuck it and give up on educating yourself or go to your local state school and party for four years and saddle yourself with enormous debt. Go where you can afford, smaller schools or community colleges. Or if you want to go to your big state school, bust your ass off. You can still gain the experience necessary to make the debt you take on worth it. Or, learn a trade! Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, boat builders, etc., make really good money, and the cost of a two-year degree from a trade school is not high. If school isn’t your thing, go out and become an entrepreneur. If you truly are too poor to afford any education, you have to educate yourself; the internet is a powerful tool. It isn't fair that this is the only option some have, but it is reality. However, for most people, there are so many options out there, and if you are mad because the only jobs you qualify for are shitty minimum wage jobs, then you failed somewhere along the way. This isn’t to say I don’t have sympathy for you; it is so hard to make all the right decisions from a young age, especially without supportive parents/going to a shitty high school. However, stop acting like the establishment is out to get you; if you didn’t do what needed to be done to set yourself up, you have to work harder in the future. Online classes, go back to school, learn a trade, do something other than sitting on Reddit and complain. I know the path to success is a lot harder for some than others; it is so frustrating to see kids with wealthy parents do nothing in high school and end up with an Ivy degree, but life isn’t fair, and that is reality. Everyone is born with distinctive gifts and passions, and while some have way more privilege than others and can cultivate these gifts more easily, that doesn’t mean you should give up and take handouts. Fuck that shit. There are people in third-world opportunities that would kill to have the opportunity Americans have, and instead, you are going to sit there and complain your whole life about how corrupt the system is. Do you want to see real corruption? Leave the United States. Instead of playing the victim, be grateful you live in a country with more opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Educate yourself (go somewhere you can afford, and if that is a community college, so be it), learn a trade, or take a risk and open a business. The beauty of the free market is it will reward you heavily if you create something that brings value to the world. Don’t complain about someone else being wealthy when they have worked their ass off and contributed to the world. Some have to work harder than others, but that’s life, and if you're a realist, you have two options, complain or work harder. Unfortunately, too few choose the latter.	1643041491.0	sbpysr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbpysr/im_tired_of_people_complaining_about_a_lack_of/	I’m Tired of People Complaining About a Lack of Oppotunity in America
5xc2v	Like 99% of people who have watch movies, I've been exposed to Martin Scorcese's filmography. By now, I've seen almost everything he's done. While I do like his movies and I am not saying they are themselves bad, I think the man is a so-so director at best and absolutely horrible at the worst times. I love his screenwriting though, and consider it as important a part of Americana as the Superbowl, Hemingway or jazz.  But I've just watched The Departed for the 3rd time in my life and finally realized what makes his movies fall short of greatness for me. Lack of in-scene continuity, edits too quick to make any kind of impact in story-telling, split diopters for no discernable reason, scenes that linger so long they test the ability of the amazing talent he has been blessed to work with over his career.   I'm sure my cricisims aren't anything he hasn't had throw his way before, but the idea that they can be ignored so that he can be considered one of the greatest directors of all time is ridiculous to me. I don't know what kind of director he is behind the scenes but I assume he's great to work with. But his final product doesn't reflect that assumption. He seems to get away with poorly executed concepts simply because of how good they are on paper. I find myself having to force my perspective in order to enjoy his movies and overlook the nearly-amateurish way he constructs a scene.  He would better serve the film industry he loves so much as a screen-writer, rather than a director and I wish I could see someone else take the helm behind the camera in his projects. Maybe use him as an assistant director? But certainly don't let him in the editing room.	1643042395.0	sbqapm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbqapm/scorcese_is_a_terrible_director_and_should_be_a/	Scorcese is a terrible director and should be a full-time screenwriter.

ibbw2ve1	A lot of times celebrities will get plastic surgery and if it looks good everyone just talks about how they never age or age so gracefully but if it’s botched then people say “why do they hate themselves?” “Why would anyone get plastic surgery?” or say it’s bc of low self esteem or something.   For ex Jennifer Anniston has multiple nose jobs and plastic surgery but you never hear those kinds of judgements on her, only how great she looks. Courtney Cox, on the other hand, gets a lot of hate for her plastic surgery. Also people judge Lil Kim a lot for her surgeries, but it’s like not her fault the surgeon did such a bad job (also her nose jobs started when her nose got broken due to domestic abuse so I really don’t think people should judge her for getting surgery). There are exceptions, like people who want the most giant boobs in the world or something crazy but even then I think a responsible surgeon would turn them away… People act like a celebrities botched look is always intentional, but I really don’t think the goal for many of these people is to look deformed? I think the surgeon probably just did a bad job in most cases.   I also follow a plastic surgeon and he said that sometimes plastic surgeons can get nervous when they are doing a celebrity and they want it to look “perfect” and then they over-do it do it’s passed the point of looking natural. He said this is what happened to Kenny Rogers. Idk if it’s true but it makes sense.   I guess I don’t understand the judgment against a lot of surgeries too. Why is it if your teeth are crooked it’s perfectly fine to get surgery and fix it but there’s so much stigma if your nose is crooked and you get a rhinoplasty? I’ve never had plastic surgery (did have teeth done though) but I also am a random person and no one cares what I look like. All in all I think it’s very understandable of why a celebrity would get plastic surgery and it’s usually not their fault if it turns out weird looking.	1643042767.0	sbqfql	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbqfql/people_are_unfair_to_celebrities_with_bad_plastic/	People are unfair to celebrities with bad plastic surgery and should put the blame on the doctors instead
lj1p6lw	Bear with me on this, But if you tweak just a few minor details in the overall writing it becomes a completely different narrative.   Firstly: there should be a group of underground batshit hedge wizards and witches that use Lunas family magazine to spread info and gather safely out of government eye that would eventually play a major role in an upcoming Civil War that nobody else is remotely aware of. Secondly: The drama in the woods is entirely too dragged out and mostly feels forced overall, leave the two friends at school to develop stories separately. Like what if Ron and Hermione establish renegade networks that trickle into government positions, or even potentially get brainwashed along the way I don't know just literally anything that gives more character development than sitting in a tent. Thirdly: this is where I'm gonna stop even though I have a lot more, But Harry should have lost the last battle due to intervention of grindewald saving voldemort and running away together after escaping prison instead of being killed in an insane state, somehow grindewald becomes a new form of horcrux starting a new arc in the series where a magic Civil War breaks out between those in power and the various factions of wild/civilian witches&wizards.

The point was, yes, it's a nice time and all but YOU ARE THE ONE PICKING THE FRUIT. therefore it should cost LESS than grocery store items of the same kind. Right? Makes perfect sense to me  Now the gentrification has come to town and all of the assholes from NY and Mass come up and it will cost you 40 dollars for a bag for apples and a quart container.

aem5e5	I am in no way defending Carrie’s overall treatment of Aidan! This is from a recent rewatch. Spoilers for those who haven’t seen seasons 3 & 4 of Sex and the City.  Spoilers:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  In season 3, we know that Carrie cheats on Aidan and he (rightfully) dumps her. When Carrie bumps into him in season 4, she wants him back.   The time frame here is this:   4x6: Carrie and Aidan try the friendship thing, the episode ends with them getting back together  4x12: Aidan proposes to Carrie and buys the apartment next door  4x13: Aidan moves in  4x15: Aidan and Carrie break up for good   &#x200B;  In 4x15, Carrie says “Aidan, you’re pushing me”, after she had asked him for more time to process things and potentially set a later date earlier in that same episode. Bear in mind, we’ve never seen Carrie live with a guy and since SATC seems to be set in eternal summer, Aidan has only been living with her for a few weeks/maybe a month. Carrie asking for more time doesn't seem that ridiculous of a request. When Aidan wants to get married right then and there in 4X15, it's totally understandable why she doesn't. Even if Carrie wanted marriage, we all know she would want Samantha/Miranda/Charlotte/Stanny there. Aidan is only thinking about himself here.   I don’t like Carrie, but I do agree that he was being too pushy. I mean, they had just moved in after he proposed and they hadn’t lived together long enough to see if they were even compatible at cohabitation. When Carrie says “why can’t we just live together?” and Aidan whines in response that he doesn’t want to, it comes off to me as pushy and disregarding of her feelings since they’ve barely lived together a month and she’s having other issues.   I like Aidan, but he wasn’t always the angel everyone makes him out to be (unless you’re comparing him to Big).  And for everyone who says "she disregarded his feelings when she cheated on him", of course she did. They never should have gotten back together and they're not right for each other.	1643044777.0	sbr87l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbr87l/in_sex_and_the_city_aidan_was_pushy_about_getting/	In Sex and the City, Aidan was pushy about getting married and disregarded Carrie's very valid feelings

I guarantee all these self-righteous asshats who condemn people for not putting away their cart have never done that job.  If you had, you would realize it's one of the better tasks.

How hard is it to write "if i remember correctly" especially in a time when auto correct has reached a point where it can (in my experience) predict your next word 60 percent of the time?  When you compress a sentence to the point when people aren't sure what it originally meant, i think it's just time to stop using it. I don't know about you, but "shaking my head" and "smacking my head" have different connotations to me so i can't tell if someone's smh is condescending or more like a "im not mad I'm just disappointed".   And still, that's assuming you already vaguely know what it means. Because if you don't, smh can be "smashed my headphones", "some metalheads" , "sarcastic moving hand" , "scared my heart off" , or a typo of "smash". I'm exaggerating of course, but you get my point	1643047704.0	sbsdek	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbsdek/internet_abbreviations_are_just_the_worst/	Internet abbreviations are just the worst

Social media site designers know that most of their users will never scroll through every available post in a given day, and know that no one likes all the pages they follow equally. With that in mind, the dreaded algorithm is designed to show the most interesting posts first to give the users that dopamine rush that will keep them coming back for more. Everyone has their own list of things they want to see at the top of their feed, and for most, your latest MLM pancreas cleanse blast isn't at the top of that list.

3nu8y0dr	Most of my professors and teachers throughout elementary, high school, and college have barely put effort into their classes. Of course, this is not an all-encompassing rule. Some professors are awesome and very capable; some professors, however, are inept.   My brother enrolled in college this year and, one night, I saw him struggling for hours over a Calculus problem. Recognizing the math, I taught him how to solve it in 2 minutes. The rest of the assignment took him 10 minutes. How can a professor be so unable to just teach students something before giving them homework on it? This is also at the college level.   High school and elementary teachers that I’ve had have also historically just not cared enough about their class. They spend more time goofing off with students or talking to other teachers than they do preparing an in-depth explanation of interesting topics. Sorry, but a powerpoint that you read in front of the class just isn’t enough if you start making upwards of 60-100k a year.   A higher salary will breed more competition. People who are willing to put more time and skills into teaching classes would replace a lot of the current staff. This scenario would ultimately do wonders for the education system in America, in my opinion.   The argument can be made that because teachers are paid so little they have little incentive to care. If that’s the case, they should just work in the trades or pursue another line of academic work.   Pay teachers more and give kids a better education. Get rid of bad profs.

3whd2g9g	This seems to trigger pretty much everyone when it gets brought up but I've always argued against people who say, "The victim is never to blame".    This seems to be a commonly held belief and one that creates quite a stir but I've always held the opinion that, while morally, no the victim \*shouldn't\* be blamed, you can't say they are totally innocent and removed from blame/fault/responsibility just because they are a victim.  The topic always comes down to a rape and a "was she asking for it?" hypothetical which just leaves everyone uspet so lets not go there.  Instead - what got me back onto this topic recently was the tik tok video of the angry dad throwing a smoothie at a worker after his daughter/son had an allergic reaction to a smoothie with peanut butter in it, even though he asked for a smoothie with no peanut butter.  In this case - both parties "fucked up".  Workers made a mistake and there were lots of people who were essentially blaming the victim - the angry dad - by saying, "well if your kid is so allergic, maybe you shouldnt go to a store where the incident might happen".  Fair point, right?   Well, why is THAT amount of blame okay to be directed at him, the victim, but in other, logically analogous situations, it's suddenly NOT okay to blame the victim?     In the case of the video, it seems like people are okay blaming the victim, because he was an asshole that went WAY over the top and threatened people for a mistake.  That's fair too.  He was wrong.  But he was initially a "victim" so to speak.     It seems very illogical to me.  It's never okay to blame the victim if it's a hot or controversial topic... but if the victim then becomes an asshole - its okay to blame them?  &#x200B;  My opinion - is concrete - which apparently makes it super unpopular, but I hold true that in almost every case, the victim has to accept SOME, even miniscule amount of blame.  Even if it's something as ridiculous as a person walking outside and getting hit by a falling piece of space debris.   If it was the size of a golf ball, you would have been protected if you remained inside, but you ventured outside and knowingly walked into an increased risk of death or injury from space debris.  Its so ridiculous that  no one should reasonably consider it in their daily interactions - but its a choice they made, with a potential outcome they were aware is possible, and they took the chance regardless. They, logically, chose to increase their chance of getting hit by a small piece of space debris by going outside.  I think, even though its ridiculous, theres SOME minuscule amount of blame/responsibility that goes with that.   &#x200B;  Please, help me see how this "wrong".   And not just because it's morally, or ridiculously unlikely "wrong".  Im talking factually and logically.	1643052641.0	sbu9s4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbu9s4/its_okay_to_blame_the_victim_sometimes/	It's okay to blame the "victim" sometimes.

I hear a lot of people grade actor peformances in TV shows and movies when they are really referring to the script which is why I think this is unpopular.  Further evidence: shakespeare plays are immortalized because of the scripts (granted they couldn't record video in that time). Old movies are recognized for their memorable quotes. TV shows and movies can be very successful with animation (of course voice acting is a skill its own right, but you see less of the actor). If you watch a table read of a solid TV show, that alone can be very entertaining. Some of the best movies are based on books.  I'd be interested in more screenplay awards being featured, e.g. best dialogue, best plot	1643053766.0	sbuq2n	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbuq2n/actors_get_too_much_credit_and_blame_for_good_and/	Actors get too much credit and blame for good and bad scripts respectively.

fs4t7	A school uniform polo shirt for a little kid goes for $30 or more dollars.   And you have to buy the schools shirt with the schools logo from the schools preferred vender.

These school uniform venders are often small operations and getting any mistake fixed is a huge timely matter. For something that I can get fixed at Target in a single trip takes 4 weeks to get fixed through school uniform venders who only deal in snail mail.   And they say school uniforms discourage fighting. Really??  Go to r/fightporn and you’ll find video after video of kids fighting in their school uniforms.

You might not make it, the market might not make it or hell the world might not make it. But even if it does, what the hell are you going to spend it on? Travel? Yeah sounds fun, but wouldn't it be more fun to travel now. And have you seen old people on vacation? I'd say a third of the time they look miserable because their back is acting up or they just can't do anything because they are old. They can't go windsurfing (or at least not as good as now), so just go now.  If you can save money, why not buy a house or condo now? It's a bubble? Ok just wait it out or just say fuck it, or do my plan, live at my place until the next bubble.  Heck spend the money on anything that makes you happy now instead of for a rainy day that might never come. Anything is better than what you are doing now, which is gifting an insane amount of money to the richest people and companies of all time for an IOU you can't cash for 40 years.

hk2c90n3	This is for the US. No idea food prices in different countries.   Also yes, there are outliers. I don’t need to list out every possible situation of why someone may not have the means to cook, or the 10% of the US in a food desert.   If I cook with chicken it’s usually between $2-4 for a full plate. Meals are  only expensive if you’re doing some lavish gourmet meal. Pretty much only steak or a nicer type of fish will cause a meal to break $5. Only cook with chicken thighs because much tastier and cheaper than breasts.   Spicy Thai chicken thighs and rice noodles   Creamy onion gravy over fried then baked chicken.   Mahi mahi and cauliflower   French chicken   Pork belly  Baked pork loin  Hash browns, biscuits, eggs and some type of meat/cheese  Creamy chicken Alfredo   Steak, potatoes, onions and stuffed mushrooms (this will be about $8-12 depending upon cut and size of steak)  Etc etc. most veggies for me are onions, mushrooms, potatoes, corn, cauliflower, garlic.   The Amount of oil/butter/spices per meal is marginal cost increase. Mere cents.   Most fruits costs the same as a candy bar. Eat a snickers or eat an apple or an orange.   Unless you’re buying organic or going to Whole Foods or a high end grocery store, cooking is not expensive and usually only takes about 30 minutes of effort, but that can be enough for one meal or three days.   Before you disagree, before you get Reddit upset and argue this as if I just insulted your mother, just google prices from Walmart, aldi, target or a similar type of store near to you.

ic30jxcy	It's just silly. Your appearance is possibly one of the most important factors about you and probably will continue to be like that for decades and centuries to come which I find absolutely ridiculous. Firstly, there's the judgements. Unless you're a 10 you will be judged based on what you wear. If you're a bit overweight you can't wear tight fitting clothes without being ridiculed or having your gut pointed out, I've encountered that a few times, I'm not incredibly overweight, a few kg over but I have a bit of a gut and anytime I wear something that makes it obvious it gets commented on which is just annoying moreso than anything, it's led to insecurity where I've my stomach sucked in by reflex whenever I'm around anyone else. Somebody wearing a low quality tracksuit will be seen as an addict, especially skinnier people with a hood up, at least around my area people tend to get judgey over that kind of clothing.   Secondly, it can fuck up a job interview. Now I get hygiene, taking care of your body is incredibly important but having to wear certain clothes to work or having to look the part of a job interview? Nah. I feel like people are more pressured to wear nice clothes for an interview than what they would normally wear and personally I think wearing what you wear any other day of the week is important because it's what's comfortable to you. How you appear plays no part in a job unless that job involves your appearance such as modelling or physical training. Jobs with specific dress codes like construction are also an exception because there's reasoning behind those, there's a necessity to look a certain way or have a certain uniform but some random person working in a cubicle where nobody is ever going to see them? Hell, they should be able to go in, in their pyjamas, it really doesn't matter, nobody sees you, your appearance isn't important, so why should it matter so much.  Thirdly, dating. I should be incredibly clear here because this is probably what I'd get flamed the most for. Having preferences is fine, everybody has standards, you're entitled to your own preferences. I have seen and met people who will not touch another person (dating wise) if they don't meet a certain requirement. Things like not dating somebody under 6"1, not dating somebody who's too muscular, not dating somebody who doesn't have the right curves, bad knees, wonky elbows, weird nose, monkey ears, cross-eyes. Like I said, I get having preferences but rejection based on the fact that they don't meet a physical trait, something which isn't entirely important in a relationship to begin with, is just a bit strange to me. Like imagine you meet your prince charming or your sleeping beauty. They are perfect and tick every box but they don't have good teeth or they are too skinny so they are a no-go. I don't know, I just don't think that it's right but again everyone is entitled to preferences, I can understand that somebody not matching a feature that you would like in another person would be a bit off-putting.  Just to sum it up, appearance is just too important nowadays and I personally just dislike it. I don't like the fact that people get rejected from things based on their appearance (UNLESS their appearance is necessary for x thing like carnival rides or nightclub, it's important to distinguish those from what I'm talking about), things like jobs, dates, ridicule on social media, in public, from friends and from family.	1643056121.0	sbvn81	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbvn81/appearance_should_not_matter/	Appearance should not matter.

16xkeq	To be born into abject poverty, at least in a developed country, really teaches someone the importance of having to make something of yourself and the value of working for things on your own. Of course, you don't have to be born into poverty to realize this, but it's the quickest and most memorable way to get the message and to fully comprehend how bad things can get if you don't try. It also discourages wasteful behavior later on in life.   I've noticed that people from middle and upper-class upbringings tend to get really caught up on first-world problems or sometimes have a lot to fall back on and this hinders their ability to solve problems when the going gets tough, whereas someone who was born into poverty might have a little more know-how on how to rectify such situations as they are used to going without.  I'm not suggesting that being born into poverty is a good thing or a thing that all people born into poverty generally have a better conception of the importance of hard work, but I am suggesting that being born poor gives you a leg up in terms of one's worldview and perspective on the importance of moving forward later on in life.	1643057395.0	sbw4cn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbw4cn/being_born_into_poverty_is_actually_a_blessing_in/	Being born into poverty is actually a blessing in disguise.

sdomd	My wife and I welcomed our first child recently. We held a baby shower months before the delivery date and did the cordial formality of sending hand written thank you cards to everyone in the months between the shower and arrival. However, cue a few months later, a very rough delivery, and two sleep deprived parents, we continued receiving gifts but from people further outside our social circle (almost entirely neighbors/friends of our parents). We are grateful for the thoughts and gifts; however, we are also receiving increasing pressure to send hand written thank you cards to these people as well. It may seem petty, but this feels very archaic and is not a high priority for either of us. Everyone recognized that, as new parents, we would have little time for anything other than care for our newborn, which partially is why a baby shower was planned months beforehand and why we wrote thank you cards immediately afterwards when we had the availability to do so. I would hope people understand that, when sending a gift after a major life event, the individual or couple may not have the same freedom to prioritize formalities like thank you cards like they did before. Instead, respect any thank you you receive at a much later time or verbally.	1643058066.0	sbwdgo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbwdgo/dont_expect_a_written_thank_you_when_giving_a/	Don’t expect a written thank you when giving a gift for a major life event that has already passed.

16xkeq	Let me just start by saying that I am not 'anti-Elon' or just generally pessimistic and looking to insult the aspirations of a successful entrepreneur. He's a really interesting guy with more brainpower than he knows what to do with and deserves to see all of his ventures succeed given the probable value that they will yield for humanity.  That said, I cannot help but look at the broken promises of Tesla's automated driver tech over the last few years (and its rising price), the pitfalls and shortcomings of The Boring Company and their tunneling projects, the whole 'going to Mars in the next ten years' projection from SpaceX, etc., and just think that it seems like Musk's professional activities are always long on ambition and short on specifics. This is the case especially for that Neuralink business that he touts as well, which states that it will be using artificial intelligence to augment human cognition with a neural interface.  It just seems that the speculative nature of a lot of his ventures, the massive amounts of investor money being funneled into them, and the commensurate media and public attention that they gain is a little concerning as the results that these ventures produce are somewhat falling short of expectations. I get that Theranos was based on technology that literally did not exist, and than Musk does have some long-term potential for a lot of his businesses which do *have* documented successes, but I can't help but draw the comparison that maybe he is trying to deceive the public into thinking he can do *all* of these things and that the capital these ventures employ is inconsequential and he can just ride on potential.	1643056947.0	sbvy81	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbvy81/elon_musk_is_just_as_unscrupulous_as_elizabeth/	Elon Musk is Just as Unscrupulous as Elizabeth Holmes
549689h8	Seeing this a lot lately. You basically do your job for 1 year and then repeat. Most subjects don't change with time(like Maths, history etc.). So people just have to deal with kids, which a lot of jobs have to. Can't speak for the US so sorry for being uninformed, but in my country (Germany) the degree you need for becoming a teacher is a budget version of the "real" one. In addition to that they have more time off than any other field of work due to schools being closed on holidays.   Another hot take: in my opinion I do believe that actually a lot of people can teach all basic subjects until like 10th grade without much preparation if any at all.  You get payed for what you know not what you do and if a lot of people know what you know due to learning all of the stuff that is taught, I really don't see the issue here.

I’ve also lived with people who smoked weed like 4 times a day. They claim “I can still function”. Yeah maybe as a high person you think that you are the same at your job and nobody notices. Well, they do and you are less productive despite what you’ve may think.   Im not comparing alcoholics to stoners, but stoners need to except that they have a drug dependency.

57dld2mg	Often when a TV show, album, movie or video game is delayed - an influx of angry fans quickly flock online to complain about how this is outrageous and that they should of put back the release date in the first place. Some “fans” go too far and send death threats, or (debatably) even worse.  When a project is released to a new deadline, occasionally, it ends up like complete dogshit. I’m going to use Cyberpunk 2077 as an example, in which on release many loyal fans defended the game - claiming the idiots threatening the developers are the reason the game was rushed.  This is completely *WRONG* and to even suggest this, absolves the developers of criticism they rightfully need to receive. Even if this were the case, as horrible as it is to receive threats of violence, if you release a product early because of troll comments - you should not be in the entertainment industry.	1643059737.0	sbx0d6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbx0d6/fans_are_too_often_blamed_for_when_a_product_is/	Fans are too often blamed for when a product is rushed.

1l24jkgv	A lot of parents brag about teaching their kids the word vagina because they're accurate or scientific terms but most of the time they're not even talking about the vagina and the word they'll looking for is vulva. Teaching a girl that her parts are called a vagina is like teaching her that her butt is called a colon or her mouth is called a throat.  And there are a lot of little girls who grow up thinking that everything between the labia is the vagina and don't wash it because the vagina is self cleaning. Yes it is, but you wash the area around it. And putting all the focus on the birth canal, which is all the word vagina applies to, really makes a girl feel like that's the only thing worth mentioning down there and that is a bad mindset to grow up with.  If you want your kids to know the proper terms for them, teach them all of them. Penis, scrotum, testicles, vulva, labia, clitoris, vagina.	1643060278.0	sbx9d9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbx9d9/children_shouldnt_be_taught_the_word_vagina/	Children shouldn't be taught the word vagina.
2xlqgsr7	Sociopathy and psychopathy are not good things, but people who suffer from them are not these evil demonic monsters. These are severe mental illnesses just like schizophrenia or BPD and I’m tired of them being demonized. We need to offer help and resources for people who struggle and not treat them like they are filth. This isn’t to say I think sociopaths and psychopaths who do bad things should be forgiven just because of their illness. They 100% should face the consequences of any bad actions they commit, but they need help from medical professionals. And these illnesses are on a spectrum just like any other mental illness. Not all sociopaths or psychopaths are these chronic criminals out to hurt everyone around them. Some of them are very normal people who cause more suffering to themselves than to others. By stigmatizing these things, we create a world where people can’t express their severe mental struggles without thinking they are a bad person even if they haven’t actually done anything harmful.	1643060575.0	sbxdow	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxdow/im_so_tired_of_sociopaths_and_psychopaths_being/	I’m so tired of sociopaths and psychopaths being portrayed as evil people in media

And not to mention I have used a condom maybe a couple dozen times and at least half the time they have broken on me.

Basically just writing this post to get an idea of what it's like for other guys, and how it differs based on circumcision-circumstances.   Also for the ladies, I've had more partners request that I not wear a condom than request I wear one, and I can confidently say not a single one of those that asked I go bare back had intentions of children.

i1mvqe6v	I consider this an unpopular opinion due to me not having heard any similar opinions, nor do I have any statistics to suggest this is factual.  However I believe we need to stop telling kids "never talk to a stranger", because it invalidates many people (like me) who have been sexually assaulted or raped by a family member instead.

48keklt9	Sometimes things can be overpriced, but in some cases the materials are more expensive because of the higher quality.  Personally I don’t have a set amount that I want my ring to be, but I know that some cheaper rings are cheaper because the metal and stone will be more prone to scratching or look bad after a period of time.  Also, real diamonds sparkle when the ring is polished.  I wanted a ring from Swarovski or Pandora for a long time before I realized they tarnish and the glass will scratch even though I like the look of their rings.  I also wanted a cubic zirconia ring and I still like them but I realized the quality isn’t the same.   But also, when I get married I would prefer to pick the ring with my fiancé before he proposes (or he may not surprise me, I’m fine with him asking me casually).  I don’t think expensive engagement rings are bad, but I admit that I think it’s wasteful to spend money on a ring beforehand just in case she says no or doesn’t like the ring just for the “surprise.”   But overall I do think the negative attitude towards expensive engagement rings comes from people who can’t afford them or are jealous.  It also comes from men who don’t wear them so they don’t care as much about how it looks over time.  If you can’t afford it, maybe ask your fiancé to pay half?	1643061419.0	sbxphq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxphq/people_who_make_fun_of_expensive_engagement_rings/	People who make fun of expensive engagement rings or the people who have/want them do so because they generally can’t afford them.

Lizzo is not just “unconventional looking”, she is disgusting to look at and everyone knows it.  You can, “YAASS QUEEN” all you want but that doesn’t make easier to look at and you’re only encouraging her narcissistic behavior. Like when she twerks at a basketball game and exposes her ass, gets criticized, and blames it on bigotry not her pompousness. Or  when she *gag* *puke* did the body paint thing on her instagram and then calls all of her backlash body shaming. I mean, *technically* it is, most of her back lash is honest feedback about how gross she looks, but she’s the one that cursed our gaze with such a post in the first place.  It wouldn’t bother me if she was nice, but she’s also a shitty person. I remember when she doxxed her Uber Eats driver because she thought they ate her food and the poor girls life with turned upside down over night. As if Lizzo needs the extra food anyways. She is constantly going about how beautiful she is and anyone that disagrees is just body shaming her when I think most reasonable people find her unattractive and the rest are probably lying. She never bears any responsibility for her obscenity and cries on livestreams for sympathy.  She’s not even attractive by plus sized standards. Her butt is flat like she’s wearing a diaper at all times and her boobs are like flap jacks. She obviously has never seriously hit the gym and built muscle a day in her life.  She sets a terrible standard for women by demanding people find her beautiful while flaunting her unflattering physique any time she can.

2qc897go	Shakespeare was a playwright! Plays are meant to be watched and enjoyed on a fun night out, not read and analyzed in a classroom. I think it's awesome to read shakespeare and analyze it if that's what you want, but it's dumb that we're forced to do it in school. If schools want to teach shakespeare, the students should actually watch the plays (or be in a production themselves) instead of just reading through the scripts. English classes always made it seem like Shakespeare was this highbrow, overly complicated, no-fun-allowed peak of literature, when they were originally written to entertain the public, the poor in particular. Shakespeare is crass and funny and the language isn't even that confusing once you get used to it, and I'm sad that so many people think it's boring.

Would you support a business that supports Australia day being on the 26th?  I'll go first.  As a small business owner, being that we are still in our first year of trade (7 months now), we decided to not draw any negative attention to our socials or brand and promote anything Australia day whatsoever. In our marketing plan we had organised for a limited 1 Day only sale of 26% off already on sale items to celebrate Australia day.  Personally I feel that Australia day, to me, identifies collaboration of many people to form one unique strong young country that is resilient in problematic times and comes together to support one another.  I am also aware that Australia day marks the landing of the first fleet in 1788 and that aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians lost sovereign rights to their land, lost their family and lost the right to practice their culture.	1643062131.0	sbxzi4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxzi4/thoughts_on_australia_day_being_2601_from_a_small/	Thoughts on Australia Day being 26/01 from a small business owner.
i5uxx73v	I did it.  I finally did it... I bought a couple of new TVs for the house.  The problem was, they were 4k TVs with that idiotic looking motion clarity technology (or whatever it is), the technology that makes foreground objects move in super-crisp resolution, all the way freeze-framing the background.  It's ridiculously unnatural looking and I hate it.  The human eye doesn't see like that.  We don't see "people" in the foreground as ultra-4k clarity down to your pores while everything else stays abssolutely static in resolution.  Our eyes are constantly shifting and readjusting for optimal clarity and situational awareness.  I was going to come to reddit to find a "help" sub and ask "How can I make my TVs not look stupid".  Fortunately Samsung built that feature right in - they call it "filmmaker mode", and it takes all of that ridiculous image correction out of the equation and makes your television look exactly like what it's supposed  to look like - a television.	1643062175.0	sby043	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sby043/4k_tvs_with_all_of_that_picture_correction/	4k TVs with all of that picture correction nonsense look stupid.

fl7s0	A lot of posts on Reddit revolve around "I'm not what my parents expected and that makes them sad, they are horrible people."  It's normal for parents to create narrative and build a world view of how they want their childs life to go. From the first day they hold their child they can't help but dream of what the future will hold. For the majority of parents this will fall within what is seen to be socially normal. Go to school, get a good job, get married, have babies etc etc. With their children being the most important thing in their life these hopes and dreams become deeply entrenched.  If their child doesn't follow the path they have imagined then it is normal for their world view to be challenged, and it is ok for parents to struggle with that.  What isn't ok is to try and force the path they dreamt of on their children when it becomes apparent that isn't the path the child wants to follow.

Initially, he respectfully demanded an explanation from Gary Busey, who didn't show due respect by looking Meat Loaf in the eye when questioned. He merely went about his business and walked straight passed without stopping to address the issue, as if to say "...your problem, not mine".  That rude response is what triggered Meat Loaf into his apparent "meltdown", but Gary Busey continued to add fuel to the fire by standing his ground when confronted & remaining adamant, which is fair enough...but he also knew Meat Loaf was on edge & chose a defensive stance, rather than a compassionate  one. This further enraged Meat Loaf who had every right to continue to remain angry even once the bag had been found, since the details of its disappearance remained unknown.   After the matter, Gary Busey went on record to insult Meat Loaf by claiming that "he had stolen his own integrity".

ieeug	It didn't affect me as much before. I probably made a few remarks like that before about being depressed or breaking down. But it's just become so annoying and played out. I feel less empathy each time I see it. I question if the person is actually going through a rough time or if they are exaggerating or just saying it as a joke when something slightly inconvenient happens. I feel if people were actually going through something like a breakdown they wouldn't have such a blase attitude about it.  I don't want to cut people out of my life for something like this, but it is bothering me to the point where I want to. It's something that so many people due as well so taking the time to tell each person if they would stop doesn't seem like an appealing option. Honestly, feel free to rag on my and tell me I'm making something out of nothing, that might help me get over it if I'm truly just being a little sociopath. I usually feel a lot of empathy for people.

dra9ct01	This gatekeeping is extremely common on Reddit.  "OCD is not about being neat and tidy. OCD is believing your whole family will die if you don't flick the light switch 50 times."  "Depression is staying in bed for weeks at a time."  ~~Too~~ So many people default to listing off the most extreme symptoms of mental illnesses when asked to describe what mental illness is "really like," as if they believe that only those extreme cases are real mental illness and everything else is fake. It's like they forget that mental illness has levels of severity. You do not need to display these extreme behaviors and tendencies to have a mental illness. Sometimes, OCD does include keeping things clean and neat. It's not always "believing your family will die," sometimes it's just feeling a compulsive "itch" to do something for no reason. And some people with depression may hardly show any outward symptoms.  Yes, there are plenty of healthy people who treat mental illness like it's some sort of trend or personality trait, or who believe their normal emotions are mental illness. But only discussing extreme cases of mental illness could invalidate people with less-severe cases, causing them to believe their symptoms are not "real" enough to be real mental illness. Mental illness does not need to be crippling in order to be real or valid.	1643065149.0	sbz4ut	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbz4ut/gatekeeping_mental_illness_is_just_as_harmful_as/	Gatekeeping mental illness is just as harmful as fake-claiming mental illness

g5e73hoj	Please, don't play the victim and keep thinking people don't answer you because you're ugly, fat, old, toothless... because of your "race", religion, nationality or whatever... or because people are arrogant, impolite... That's just how these apps work, nothing personal. So stop feeling bad and thinking people are bad... and even condemning whole groups like "the girls/gays in this town are disgusting, they don't answer me".  If you are resentful and hurt like that, I have some news for you: **people don't answer you simply because not answering is the most normal thing in this world and it happens to everyone, you're not exclusive.**  A famous Brazilian youtuber did a 7-day experience on Tinder, he showed that the vast majority of girls didn't answer him... and he is VERY handsome (he was actually a model).  [https://youtu.be/mnHOte\_Z1OA](https://youtu.be/mnHOte_Z1OA)  Some people think it's more polite to say "sorry, you're not my type" - I think that's way more arrogant, nobody likes to be rejected point-blank. If you have no intentions to go out with people, either you dump them (more chances to worsen their self-esteem) or fool around with them with empty chats (that will create empty expectations). Just do your maths: silence is better - you finish then and there, no dumping and no expectations.  In fact, answering has its risks: some people cannot deal with rejection. They may find you arrogant, insist, stalk, even harass you and try to revenge. I've come across some crazy people on these apps who created fake profiles to stalk me... So I can say: instead of dumping someone or going on with some lame talk for the sake of "friendship", I think it's better to just stay quiet and end there - that's just easier and may prevent all the hassle.	1643066329.0	sbzkdu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbzkdu/not_answering_people_on_dating_apps_is_not_rude/	Not answering people on dating apps is not rude and no one should feel annoyed about it

From massive corporations to small business owners or landlords, they're all driven by a desire to maximize the chasm of extra money between revenue and operating expenses with zero regard for fairness or equity.	1643093887.0	sc7mbs	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sc7mbs/profit_as_an_economic_concept_is_immoral_and/	Profit as an economic concept is immoral and should be abolished.
6igyc	Disclaimer: I do not live in the US, but in Finland, so the drinks might taste different in the US and might have different names.   Back in the day ”Pepsi okay?” was the worst question you could get in a restaurant. I was a major Coca-Cola fanboy for a good 30 years or so. Never even doubted myself.   Started dating my gf (now wife) 7 years ago and one day at a bar she ordered us drinks. I was like daymn, that is pretty good, what is it?  It was Pepsi Max  I couldn’t believe it. It was tasty af. To double-triple check my finding, the very same day we went to the supermarket and bought 1.5L bottles of regular Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, Pepsi and Pepsi Max. We put them all in the fridge and the next day we did a blind taste testing.   We pretty much came to the same conclusion. Pepsi Max was the superior drink out of the four, followed by regular Coke and Coke Zero, with regular Pepsi was at the bottom.   It changed my life and views about cola drinks. You should do a blind taste test too and not just go by your views, but by taste buds.  TL;DR: >!Pepsi Max > regular Coca-Cola > Coke Zero > regular Pepsi!<	1643095716.0	sc82ol	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sc82ol/i_think_pepsi_max_tastes_better_than_cocacola/	I think Pepsi Max tastes better than Coca-Cola

ay5nv89z	I too have in the past considered most animals to be dumb and 2 dimensional. However, after living in the bush with no electricity, running water or any other modern luxury, except a small hand held radio, for some years, I realised that the animals around me were infact quite intelligent and brilliant in their own way. Except turtles, my god, are they dumb. Cute though. Let me explain: I spent most of my time outside, either with my chickens or with the random kangaroos that originally emboldened themselves by breaking into my hut and stealing my wheatbix, Despite my 3 dogs. After a while of watching my chickens, i realised that they weren't empty minded idiots and infact were quite aware of their surroundings, not only of inanimate objects or things that moved or made noise, like cars, but of each other and other animals. The rooster, Mouldyhead as we affectionately called him, knew exactly how much his hens had eaten in any given amount of time and would spend a majority of his time finding food and taking it to the hen who had consumed the least. He knew well before us that our oldest hen, Milly, had reached her final days and he was far more keen a guard chicken than my even German-shepard. We also noticed after some time that they methodically comb areas in a specific search pattern, but depending on which chicken and what "rank" they held, for lack of a better term.  And that's just one chicken. Even the wasps that made my roof their home would do a similar thing, while searching for nesting materials, would search an area in a beautiful, almost programmed fashion, zig zagging from left to right and either lowering or increasing their height with each pass to the point that you could tell that they hadn't missed a single square centimeter of their target area. The kangaroos, which i now respect in a much more intense way, were a brilliant judge of character, and one we named radar, was after only a couple weeks, able to request different types of food with the gestures he made, bringing his little paws up to his mouth (actually might have been a girl, pretty faced wallaby). He loved sweet potato and would often tap on the metal bin which held our root vegetables. It became clear to me that the more time I spent watching any particular animal, the more I would understand their subtle genius. Whether these things be instinct or deliberate calculations didn't seem clear at first, but now i believe that a great deal of it was deliberate. They aren't just rooting around in the dark, grasping blindly. They are thinking a great deal. I believe that we do not attribute their actions with intent because it is extremely difficult for us to judge anothers intentions without facial expressions, words or gestures designed to communicate. Take for instance, the story of the king (from somewhere in either Africa or the middle east) who buried his treasure out in the desert and to find it, he took with him a camel and it's baby. He slaughtered the baby at the location of the treasure he had buried, making sure the mother watched, and from that day, the camel never forgot the location of its dead baby, taking the king back to his treasure many many years later (I think it was 30). We do not understand the function that allows some animals to remember the location of things like this, it may be instinct, it may be intellect, but either way, it is brilliant. This kind of information is extremely easy to find, if you don't believe me, do a small amount of exploring, or research for yourself. It is very easy for us to dismiss things like this, as it makes our lives a little less guilty.	1643096475.0	sc89ja	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sc89ja/people_who_greatly_underestimate_an_animals/	People who greatly underestimate an animal's intelligence, are themselves, an idiot.

Yes, there are people who can't afford to move out but I'm sure plenty of people have enough money to live in a smaller town.

3q0emdkm	This might be a bit of a niche post but here we go. The common consensus is that the series lost its horror factor and and went full action around Re4, but IMO classifying even the first game as “horror” is a bit of a stretch. Are there startling moments? Yeah (Dog hallway), are there unsettling aspects? Sure (Lisa), but I wouldn’t say any of it was even slightly scary. Maybe that stuff made you turn off the tv when you were like 10, but as an adult it’s just kinda eh. I’d classify RE1 as an action thriller at most, for gods sake the endgame is you blasting bug monsters with a grenade launcher then you use a rocket launcher to blow up a 8ft tall tube guy.   RE2 and 3 aren’t any better, in fact they’re worse since they give you a bigger more badass arsenal to blast zombies with. And yeah the bosses mutate and become grotesque abominations, but then they keep mutating and IMO it gets to a point where it’s so ridiculous I’m nowhere near scared, just mostly confused at what I’m looking at. Not to mention all the cheesy dialogue in the American dubs. Now of course RE7 came out and THAT game can be called horror (at least in the beginning) along with RE8 and the Big fetus section. I just hear people say the later RE games lost the horror but I think it was never there in the first place.  P.S: I mostly love all of the RE games I just don’t think any of them are scary excluding 7	1643106546.0	scannd	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scannd/resident_evil_was_never_scary/	Resident Evil was never scary

4cj4a0e2	I hear it all the time. "This room looks so aesthetic" "Wow, the colors you chose really makes this look aesthetic."  Something can't be "aesthetic". Something can only be of a certain aesthetic. It's a noun and not an adjective and it doesn't describe things in a set way. There are infinitely many aesthetics and they are used to categorize all kinds of visual, audible or even imaginary information based on what emotions it conveys/it is supposed to convey. A room can't be aesthetic, however it can resemble the aesthetic of an 80's interior design.  I believe that the wrong usage of the world is rooted in the vaporwave style with many pieces of art featuring the word "aesthetic" often with spaces between each letter. If you don't know the word, it being there without any context might make it seem like it was an adjective resulting in people using it as such. It's not something that makes me wanna smash my screen when I see people use it like that but it is certainly a minor annoyance.

hl963eku	One the arguments is about respect. You do not need to call someone by Mister or Misses in order to show respect. My wife is a teacher and they even call each other that. She addresses her principal and her school psychologist as Mister (insert name). It is so incredibly cringe. Are we to say that she can't "respect" her peers if she called them by their first name? That's nonsense.  As someone who has worked in corporate for 8 years now, I have worked for managers, directors, VP's, and even a member of the executive team for a publicly traded company, I have never ONCE called them by anything other than their first names. Yet we all have mutual respect for each other. Only time I have used anything else is when the person is a doctor or has a PhD. I'd call them by Dr. (insert name) but this has to do with their pedigree, which they've spent years and years perfecting. Most of these teachers only have up to Masters, which plenty in the corporate world has as well.  In the same manner, a high schoolers, who is only within a few years to being adults don't need to do the same with teachers. I've seen videos of teachers been offended by it. That's stroking their egos. A student not calling you Mr. or Ms. is NOT disrespecting you. They can easily disrespect you even if they DO call you that. For most high schoolers, they may even be at an age where they are working a part time job. I'm almost certain that they would not call their managers by anything other than their first names.	1643118681.0	sce7l7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sce7l7/making_high_schoolers_call_teachers_by_mister_or/	Making high schoolers call teachers by Mister or Miss/Misses is outdated and just strokes the teacher's ego

Everyone is so caught up in their job or other responsibilities they forget how short life truly is and that it should at least tried to be enjoyable.

ijsdn	I work as a gig and rideshare driver and have avidly avoided going into the grocery delivery gigs for this one reason. Apparently your average American would rather YOU (Driver) carry their purchase of 2-3 water cases that weigh almost 15-20 something pounds each for the low cost of a barely 3 dollar tip for your hard work.  Whenever I get grocery orders on my actual food delivery gigs I always decline them now because somehow every other order is gonna be one of those customers.  I mentioned this now because I saw on my Amazon drivers group someone hauling about 5 packs of water bottles not from Nestle or Arrowhead but those expensive @ss FIJI water bottles cases which are apparently $30 each somehow... Which also reminded me of the time those SMART Water bottles came out and everyone started buying them from Best Buy at almost $3-5 dollars a bottle...  It doesn't even make financial sense either. Your average American Joe spends about $100-200+ a year on water bottle cases alone, $16 Billion on the national level and that's not to mention the tons of possible ecological impacts with plastic water bottles being one of the number one pollutants found in litter everywhere.  I've asked some people I know that ONLY drink bottled water and they apparently don't trust your local water sources and especially water filtration systems... That's fine I guess but they don't even have water gallons either... That's even weirder to me. Like an American will eat God knows what and then lecture you on the dangers of filter water or anything else that can help against the climate crisis...  Got to admit though, these water companies have done an amazing job of selling their "clean" water propaganda and labeling. Every bottle you find tells you all about their process and how much healthier their water is for you despite being higher in acidic in their pH values due to the cleansing after-process needed to keep water safe during it's shelf life. Sure it won't kill you but the idea that's it's totally "clean" water isn't true no matter what.  I guess for a lot of people it's more about convenience which pisses me off even more. I carry my reusable water bottle everywhere with me, holds 40oz+ and I have a larger canister in my car for those hot summer days to refill on my work days. I love the bottle not just because I'm a hippie earth loving tree hugger but it legit doesn't make sense to me anymore to have to buy water bottles by the case. I absolutely abhor it in my household because my Mom has her reusable bottles and I do as well but my Dad legit with the access and the many times I've implored him to just use a bottle so he doesn't have to spend more money out of the convenience he spites us by buying bottles everyday. Not only that he leaves them everywhere which pisses me off even more because while I do recycle I try not to even use if I can reuse so I don't have that much to recycle to begin with (which should be the goal...)   I have 2 filtration systems. I have a PUR water filter on my kitchen sink and while it does pour out slowly in order to filter everything properly, I love it because I don't have to get from the gallon as my big ass water bottles used to finish a full water gallon and didn't leave much for everyone else as I exercise a lot and work a lot so the first thing I do when I leave and return home is fill up and hydrate. I also have another more portable 2 gallon tank with its own faucet in my room so I don't wake up anyone sleeping in the room near the kitchen. Much more cost effective after the initial investment and I don't feel guilty about wasting water or plastic anymore. PLUS you can get similar water filters that are compatible with your system as a cheaper cost that the originals and they last almost as long as them too. Each filter should run you about 3-4 months at most before needing replacement, your standard 3 pack should last you about 10 and a half months at about $25-35 dollars a pack which would save you maybe hundreds to thousands of dollars every year depending on your water use. Better yet you don't need to recycle because you're already reusing and reducing at the same time. So no need to clean and prep for a visit to the recycling yard (which not everyone does either btw)  It just makes sense to me. It's even better when you get into the alkaline craze which I admit a bunch of it boasts some miraculous properties but it's still a good alternative or at least it can't hurt, don't quote me on that though as I still have trouble understanding the craze with alkaline water popularity.  Just don't fall for one of those door-to-door salesmen trying to trap people into a super expensive water filtration systems directly installed into their house because I've had one of those guys almost get my family a long time ago once.    I don't mean to be the Waterboy in this instance but it does annoy me seeing people walk out of Costco with their carts full of water bottle cases looking dumb hauling 50-70 lbs of water into their cars while I have to wait for their parking space to get my $5 rotisserie chicken or my dollar hotdog or pizza.  Sure some people could argue that while you saved here you spent there but every little bit makes a difference.   For the record I'm not trying to start a huge protest over water bottle companies or anything I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to me and it might be an unpopular opinion of mine. Nestle is still evil though.	1643121264.0	scf4cg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scf4cg/buying_water_bottle_cases_when_water_filters_are/	Buying water bottle cases when water filters are easily accessible and cheaper makes no sense.

3xalz	&#x200B;  His life consisted of peak experience after peak experience. After quitting heroin, his peak experiences derived from alcohol and food, and  constantly traveling the world. He was always indulgent as hell. He never tried enjoying life from an unpretentious, calm way. It was always "I have to be the coolest person ever experience the biggest, most awesome peak experiences ever." I know part of this is an assumption on my part, it's unpopular opinion, not dissertation station.   But I don't just think it's a problem with him, most Americans think life can only be enjoyed if you're eating the most exotic food, having the most extreme experiences, etc. It's engrained in our culture and media. Though he traveled the world over and over again, it's ironic he never picked up different ways to approach life from eastern cultures especially.   Sure his gf of the time was bad to him, but consider that most people might be hurt by something like that, very badly, but would find a way to move on, but not him. Ultimately I don't know why that was the final straw, but there was more underneath and I would say it's that he was ultimately a shallow person who did not know how to enjoy life in moderation. Perhaps he had an oversized ego that shatters easily because without substance to his personality there's not much left to keep his self esteem standing. I expect a lot of negative votes and trolls because that's how this sort of thing usually goes.	1643123099.0	scfr8b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scfr8b/anthony_bourdain_killed_himself_ultimately/	Anthony Bourdain killed himself ultimately because his approach to life was wrong.

bx5qtqda	There is a very prominent narrative in america that you should look for a job you love and are passionate about, and accepting work in a field that doesnt light up your soul on a daily basis is resigning yourself to a miserable existence. I have found that this isnt really true. The most important thing is loving the people that you work with, being fairly compensated, and feeling well supported and valued by the leadership system. I've worked in a few fields that I loved (coffee when I was younger, and public health when I was older), and both attempts were generally ruined by things like malicious managers, poor work life balance, mean coworkers, poor communication, etc.   Now, I work in software. This was never what I imagined myself doing, and the work itself is only just fine. But I love my coworkers, I feel invested in by the company, my manager is kind and a strong leader, and I have plenty of room for growth and reason to believe that I will continue to grow in the company. I am well compensated and my employer regularly incentivises me to stay, and the work culture is fun. Suddenly, it stopped mattering that I'm wasn't passionate about software. The most important thing about your job isnt the actual work that you do, it's everything else.   &#x200B;  \--> This is probably not true if your work is something like being a nurse that is really time consuming and exhausting.

7d5ao7fr	Although everyone's life story is different and our highs and lows come at different times in our lives, it seems like lots of adults genuinely just forget what being a teenager was like. For the majority of people I know, myself included, it was anything but the totally happy, carefree time portrayed in the movies, where all you have to worry about is getting a milkshake with your girlfriend or sneaking out to have a drink with your friends. A lot of us were working almost full-time from the time we were 15 or 16 years old in addition to school. Let's be honest: high school fucking sucked for a lot of us, too. Adolescence is for a lot of people a time of extreme angst, depression, and uncertainty, as well, even if a lot of it blows over in the end. Not to mention that teenagers are usually entirely at the mercy of their parents, and it's an uncomfortable truth that a lot of families are abusive and dysfunctional, more than we like to admit. It's definitely not easy to be an adult and pave your own way, but there are pros and cons to all situations. So many people I know act like being a teenager was wholeheartedly better than being an adult, but there are ways being an adult is obviously better than being a teenager; for example, lots of adults live with their SOs and get to see them every day. It's also a freedom we take for granted that we can spend our days off as we choose, or what we do after we get off work, for example. Of course, we have lots of other obligations, but nobody short of the law can actually force us to do anything we don't want to do. If you want to stay up all night browsing Reddit or laze around all day the next day, you have nobody to answer to. Being a teenager wasn't all good and being an adult isn't all bad.

eekaf0du	I think this way, because for example every post about my country Finland is just caricatures of what we are depicted to be, but they don’t accurately represent the majority of the residents here.  I feel like this kind of content is entertaining to some, because it’s kind of patriotic and makes you feel proud of being a citizen of that country.  For example Finns love to circlejerk the bullet points that it’s really cold here, we go to the sauna often, are quiet or “unsocial” or we have Sisu or that Finland is the happiest country in the world.  Non of those things are in anyway special to our specific country, Sisu (*a Finnish concept described as stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness*) will die along with our veterans and the last stat about happiness doesn’t exactly mean that much when you think about it, it’s just an emotion that can easily change day by day.

flhty	NO, I'm not trying to imply religious texts are works of fiction. Let's get that clear.   I think everyone needs something to have faith in, something to believe in and something to live by. Something that provides them a moral code even.   Conventionally, that would be religion. Some people vibe with that, and some people don't. And both are fine.   Some people find meaning in the media they consume, and if they're exposed to it at a young age (or even then), they might derive their morality and ethics from said media.   And that's completely fine, in my opinion. The only trouble is if they take away a harmful message from it. But that's also an issue with religion, so no stones can be thrown that way.   Someone who has faith in Marvel/DC/insert superheros here might strive to be as good as the heroes they watch/read. Learning responsibility from Spider-Man, Iron Man might help them through alcohol addiction issues, etc.    Someone who watches My Little Pony might become kinder and more open to others because of it. I think that's what the show's about, I haven't actually watched it.   Someone who likes Doctor Who might hold faith in the Doctor. They might do their best to follow their values of being kind, standing up for those that need it and share that sense of wanderlust and love for the world they live in.   And again, people can easily internalise harmful messages too.   Someone who reads Divergent might think that people can and should be separated by arbitrary personality traits.   The older Disney films might teach that women are to be passive and exist only as prizes for men.   And the less said about Rick and Morty the better.	1643127165.0	sch9ez	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sch9ez/everyone_has_something_they_hold_faith_in_and_its/	Everyone has something they hold faith in, and it's alright if the thing they have faith in is a piece of fictional media.

If I knew my son or daughter had an allergic reaction to nuts and they wanted icecream, I Would either make it myself or buy one from a store that specifically says nut-free.   It's really hard to have a place that serves products like icecream with crushed peanuts and simply expect them to get it right every single time when you say "No peanuts please". It's one thing to go and perhaps say "No peanuts please or else my son will die.".

7dmynz0j	A more honest description of most products that market themselves as “eco-friendly” would be “marginally less eco-harmful than similar products”. The result of the vast majority of consumer products is a net environmental negative, where the environment is worse off than it was if the product was never produced. Buying “eco-friendly” toilet paper made from bamboo? Great, but don’t describe it as “eco-friendly” when a natural forest was cut to grow the bamboo, the bamboo was processed in a factory powered by fossil fuels, and then packed on a container ship and sent halfway around the world before you wipe. You can’t describe a cobalt based battery in an electric car as environmentally friendly when the net impact of that battery on the planet is negative. Sure, it might be less destructive to the environment than a diesel truck, but it’s still destructive. Destructive in that it is the result of metal mining, fossil fuels were used in its production, and undoubtedly have a hand in generating the electricity used to power it. This is obviously an incredibly complicated issue and I’m moving beyond just a discussion of the “eco-friendly” terms, but point being, let’s just be a bit more honest with ourselves about exactly how “friendly” we can ever be to this planet.	1643130205.0	sciep3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sciep3/calling_consumer_products_environmentally/	Calling consumer products “environmentally friendly” and “good for the environment” is a lie.

c47h3w81	Nothing marked me more frustrated than hearing people curse like a 6th grader who just learned curse words. Everything is "fuck", "shit", "ass", "bitch" etc. Wheen someone curses, it should be for emphasis or atleast trying to curse creatively. If someone drops the word fuck in a sentence more than once it just sounds like they can't think of anything else. The creativity is lacking and when you finish with "like, fuck man, like...yeah" you sound like an idiot. Why can't you try to say something that doesn't sound like you're actively being aggressive or interesting? Besides, if you curse less, then when you actually DO curse it grabs more attention and is far more affective. Cussing shouldn't be the go to.	1643130828.0	scimv8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scimv8/cussing_is_so_incredibly_uncreative/	Cussing is so incredibly uncreative

guzod59o	Throughout the course of history, access to information and knowledge was a privilege of the upper class and elite. It was only 120 years ago when having the ability to read became more common than not in the USA. For the next century, access to the frontiers of information remained centralized in the universities. The internet was originally invented for use between universities, so that they could send each other information electronically. Little did they know at the time that this information highway would be onboarded by the average man and woman. Access to ideas is no longer the rarity it once was. While it made sense for most of history to defer to the Ph D, this is increasingly becoming less sensible. Aside from the narrow pocket of focus in which the Ph D has specialized, they are hardly more likely than a random passerby to be well read. When I see Ph D put in a Twitter name, it doesn't mean anything to me unless you specify exactly what your research is for. If you would have people defer to your judgment on general topics due to your Ph D, then you would be unfairly claiming intellectual maturity. To be fair, this applies to almost all professional designations. However, Ph Ds are the most likely to put Ph D in their name and are most likely to expect general deference. A deference which, while it should exist to an extent, does not come close to a garuntee of intellectual superiority.	1643132226.0	scj65f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scj65f/the_level_of_deference_owed_to_ph_ds_is/	The level of deference owed to Ph.

You're setting them up for failure and humiliation.   They look at people who have a reason to be confident and think it's all in the demeanor when it's not. Those people are confident bc they have what people **WANT**.

In every movie in which he has acted, that's his entire schtick. It's supposed to convey intensity but really he just looks like a guy trying too hard.  Add that to the fact that he frequently covers the rest of his face (Bane in Batman, Max in the Furiosa movie inexplicably called a Mad Max movie, Dunkirk, Venom) ... and the fact that he mumbles all his lines and is incapable of emoting, and you just have a void on screen.	1643133982.0	scjuyn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scjuyn/tom_hardy_is_a_terrible_actor/	Tom Hardy is a Terrible Actor

My advice is: get to know people, gain their trust, get friends. When you are getting bullied, you have a backup. Another one would be to ruin your bully's reputation, so that they lose their social status in front of everyone. If nothing else helps, and you've asked them to stop. Punch those suckers.

3fi0jgh	The reason people are so divided on whether it’s okay to “ghost” is because people are using that word in radically different ways.   People often say that ghosting is fine if you’ve only had a few dates, or have just been talking on a dating app ... but those aren’t established relationships where you can have any expectation of continued contact anyway. If you stop responding during those early/casual stages, that’s perfectly normal. Someone who barely knows you doesn’t need a paragraph about how the timing isn’t right.   It’s only “ghosting”- called as such because you suddenly disappear out of someone’s world- if you were already part of their life. This term makes sense if you had reason to expect consistent contact from them, like you were texting every day or seeing each other consistently. It makes no sense otherwise.   This obviously isn’t restricted only to serious, long, or monogamous relationships. Even a FWB could ghost you, if you’ve been in a routine or have seen each other frequently for a while. Friends can ghost you too. Anyone who would need a proper reason to suddenly disappear from your life and refuse to answer any message or call. Someone who, if they stop responding suddenly, you would feel the need to check on.   But if you didn’t have an established, consistent, and active relationship of some sort, then you weren’t ghosted. They just stopped responding.	1643134237.0	scjyk8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scjyk8/the_word_ghosting_should_be_reserved_for_when_you/	The word “ghosting” should be reserved for when you were actually in a relationship.

22dosi5t	 People always try to tell me I’m weird because I’m not proud of my country. I find some things to be great about it, somethings I don’t like. But “proud” isn’t a word I’d use. I often find pride to be a negative trait. It’s a deadly sin for a reason. And I’m not necessarily void of it. I often feel proud of the things I’ve accomplished, whether that’s good or bad. But I had nothing to do with the status of my country or how it is today. I didn’t choose to be born in my country. And also it’s just lines man made on a map. I think showing some type of favoritism towards your people, culture, race, ethnicity, etc is such a weird concept and it’s just a catalyst to divide. I may have more in common with someone half way across the world then I would someone with the same passport. When I watch sporting events like the Olympics and people are so wrapped up in their country winning, I can’t help but feel like it’s strange. If someone’s from my country won, it was a win for them. Not a win for me or the country. For me to take some ownership of the win because we happened to be born in the same country just makes zero sense to me. My identity is far beyond what country I’m from. It’s such a tiny aspect of who I am I don’t even care to think about it.	1643134369.0	sck0iu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sck0iu/i_dont_need_to_be_proud_of_my_country/	I don’t need to be “proud” of my country

d7ybwxwq	As someone who has been a drugdealer and had done time in prison I have met many people in prison who had committed violent crimes. I shared a cell with a murderer who was one of the friendliest nicest persons ever. The thing is that these people their crimes are 9/10 related to their mental health. People who were so desperate in life that they pulled to last resort and committed a robbery, did jobs for the mob, sold drugs. The problem needs to be fixed at the source, which is mental health.  So I'm using these two countries as examples because these are the most known, Norway and USA. US prisons: a shithole full of violence, inmates get treated like shit, guards get treated like shit, if you lock people up like animals and treat them like animals they are going to act like animals. As a result of this, people come out more violent and commit crimes again. I used the US as an example because it is very well known, don't even get me started on South American prisons.  Now Norway or almost any other EU country, focuses on rehabilitation instead of punishment. Killings inside the prison are almost non existent, criminals get therapy so they can become a contributing member of society again.

62f46t77	This will upset true believers and those who claim to have had wild success, but none of the established diet programs are designed for you to truly succeed. You will cherry-pick elements of the diet that you like and ignore others, causing you to go through the following stages:  Stage 1: You feel great about your initial success, and get cheered on by a welcoming community of fellow believers who swear that their lives have changed forever, and who shout down anyone who questions the orthodoxy. Your posted successes help to recruit more believers to buy into the program.  Stage 2: You hit a plateau or gain a little weight. You feel guilty and frustrated. Hare-brained advice that you solicit from your fellow believers encourages you to restrict even more. You ignore the sabotaging  impact this advice has on your physiology, because you really want to have the same success as your fellow believers claim. You want to post that beautiful downward weight-loss graph so badly! You may or may not bounce back into Stage 1, but you'll be back!  Stage 3: You eventually move on, because that program "doesn't work for you anymore." You are now absolutely certain that any failure is the fault of the program or to some undiagnosed hormonal issue. You don't want to hear that the severe restrictions you imposed on yourself might have sabotaged you. After regaining much of the weight (and about 80% of dieters do that within a year), you find the next magic solution that will get the job done quickly. And the recruitment cycle continues.  I'm not saying that long-term weight loss is impossible. But just imagine a diet company having the courage to promote a long, slow, difficult, and sometimes lonely process that will lead to long-term change. I doubt they would get many recruits.	1643135457.0	sckflt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sckflt/you_will_likely_fail_at_every_commercial_diet/	You will likely fail at every commercial diet plan that you try

Being Introverted should be the same way and should be under the category of "harm to self or others".  Being happy with being asocial OR introverted doesn't make it healthy.

We are social animals after all, and being alone for a massive amount of time leads to depression, self harm, unproductive and many mental Ilnesses. It's self harm.  If not, then it's should be heavily discouraged. It should effect one's performance at BOTH school and work.

df6s5tqr	There are multiple reasons for this, but mainly is that people are apparently not responsible enough to own them. If you own a dog and frequently take it on a walk like i do you have for sure met at least once an idiot walking with a big dog off the leash.  Let me tell you this, when dogs (of the same sex especially males) meet each other on the streets, they are often gonna try to start a fight.  I meet these idiots basically everyday, my grandma was attacked before when walking my dog and severely injoured by a big off leash dog, that threw her on the ground, because of which she (very fragile at the time) was hospitalised, and my dog was also severely injured and needed surgery.   Just today i was walking my dog and i passed by a house where a VERY big dog lives, this one dog is very aggressive to both his peers and humans (and had in the past bit my sister on her shoulder  as she was walking by the fence!) As i face the house i see the garden gate OPEN WIDE amd the dog in front of it, staring at me and my puppy.  Luckily i was far enough for him not to charge at me and slowly walking back as the gate was closing me and my small dog where safe. (When i pass near his house he always tries to exit and jump out the fence) When i confronted the owner about it he acted with nonchalance saying thay his dog is "good" and "never bit anyone" (not true).  So as far as my personal experience goes big dogs are dangerous and people are not responsible enough to own them. Just think if instead of my sisters shoulder passing near the fence was a mother with a baby in her arms.  Now you may say  >"But mine is a good boy!"  there is no such thing as a good dog or a bad dog, dogs are animals, and act by *instinct* they are thus unpredictable and often act differently than you expect. They may be all cuddly and kind with their owner but they act differently with strangers  >"not every big breed owner is reckless like that"  Enough are tho. I see everyday people walking dogs as big as calfs off leash. Also banning something for the unresponsible action of some is reasonable. If people were allowed to own light machineguns most would not act unresponsibly with it but the actions of a few are enough for that to be prohibited.  Big dogs are dangerous and there is no reason you should own one instead of a reasonably sized one.

asubitpz	For US streaming services you know exactly what you're getting into with TV-G through TV-14, but it's the wild west when the rating hits MA and without the aide of third party sources. With TV-MA it's impossible to know if you're getting two f-bombs, a bloody shooting, and a mild sex scene with no nudity, or a gore-fest orgy with lingering nudity and f-bombs as conjunction; Think of it this way, Marvel's "Luke Cage" is the same rating as "The Boys" and "The Witcher". I personally can't handle the latter two, but Luke was fine.   The FCC released a statement [here](http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/Release_091621.pdf) in September that all services *should* display (which if I understand lawyer lingo means "ought to not have to") the rating and content guides for shows *at the time of playback* but I feel this isn't enough. In my opinion, the content guide would be more useful on display at the video description.   In addition, a new rating system needs to be modernized for today's streaming. TV-MA just doesn't cut it anymore for the reasons listed above, but having age-based ratings doesn't either - the ratings need to be more clear up front about content or MA should be broken into tiers.	1643138589.0	sclm40	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sclm40/tvma_is_too_broad_and_tv14_too_rigid/	TV-MA is too broad and TV-14 too rigid
fdnr9xla	It sucks but if your life is at risk for eating anything that can easily be cross contaminated in a food rush, you shouldnt be going there. Fast food workers and restraunt workers, especially now, are under staffed and under paid. For the most part theyre not going to have the time to pick apart the menu items for you when they can have to attend to many other customers. Its too easy to forget small requests when youre overwhelmed with customers.   After hearing about that man who assulted a teenage girl for a smoothie he ordered at a place he knew used peanut butter in many other smoothies for his son, with a severe food allergy, my blood boiled. I've worked in fast food before and I've had customers threaten violence for far less so its hard to sympathise with him.   Abosuletly the employees should of taken the procautions, but, from what im hearing, the man never told them it was for a food alleregy, he really expected them to just read his mind. The man should of never put his hands on that girl, he should of been with his son at the hospital and taken the steps to sue the chain.   That man is an awful father and cannot do the bare minimum to protect his son. He could of safely made a smoothie for his kid at home where he knew there would be no peanuts. But he goes to a smoothie place being left in charge by minimum wage highschool kids and expects perfection?

551c2cmt	Earlier this week i started looking back at tv shows, music, commercials, and generally everything from my childhood. I got really nostalgic, and it kind of depressed me in a way. Its like something ill never experience again.  Being born in 1999 I got to experience alot more "cool stuff" than kids today experience in front of their iphones and ipads. For example the feeling of finishing pokemon games on the old school gameboy, or watching old school cartoon network shows, the old Scary Movie comedies, listenting to Britney Spears, Shakira, Madonna, and more.  The nostaliga just hit me extremely hard this week, and i thought about how lucky i was (in my opinion) to be born at such a time.

7ioezbd2	If you are like me chances are you have been inundated with a barrage of Mobile Phone Spam Calls and Text Messages, the problem is at least in the United States is that Mobile Phone Spam is treated as a misdemeanor and carries a $10,000 Fine. I believe that is merely a slap on the wrist, I believe that most spam farms are monetarily operated by cryptocurrency and not physical cash. If anything they should not be allowed to use cryptocurrency to pay off any fines. The fines should be increased ten-fold depending on the severity of the spam context, for instance if it is related to financial, warranty or advertising wire fraud (which a good percentage of them are) the fines should easily top $500,000 in legal tender on top of serving a sentence of up to 15 years in prison, failure to pay the fine will be seen as an act of contempt and will result in additional fines and or time in prison. This is on top of having forced surrender of all physical and financial assets used to commit acts of spam to the proper authorities.	1643139008.0	sclruw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sclruw/mobile_phone_spam_should_be_treated_as_a_felony/	Mobile Phone Spam should be treated as a Felony and not as a Misdemeanor

i1qp8	90%+ of working adults don't need advanced mathematics to excel in their daily lives. Those that do are usually using it in a job that requires an advanced degree. Every average adult that doesn't have life handed to them already absolutely needs financial literacy to succeed in life.  This should be taught and tested over at least two full years in high-school. You should not be graduating into adulthood without understanding credit, loans, savings, healthcare plans, etc. We absolutely cannot expect parents to teach their kids this stuff as a vast amount of adults do not understand it themselves. This subject is taught in most education systems, but its glossed over too quickly, and I really don't think it's absorbed by most high-school students. There's an argument for "nothing is", but I think the longer you teach it, the more it's focused on, the more likely students are to keep that knowledge into adulthood.   I also think we should be teaching ethics as a core class from day 1 but that's a separate conversation.	1643139356.0	sclwll	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sclwll/we_should_teach_financial_literacy_over_the/	We should teach financial literacy over the course of high-school in replacement of advanced mathematics.

v336gor	Okay. I’m going out on a limb here. But first. A disclaimer: I’m in no way excusing or justifying what he did. I’m simply presenting another point of view.   So, smoothie guy got more than angry and upset following his child being hospitalised due to a nut allergy.   Now, while he was VERY upset by the situation, I think most/all parents can relate to how upset he was due to his child suffering such a severe reaction, especially since the product he purchased was meant to be allergen-free.  Not that all parents would react in the same way following their child being poisoned, but they would feel equally alarmed and upset and feel deeply betrayed by the shop and its staff.   Now what surprises me is that there were no senior staff members or a manager on site, but the other side of the penny imho is that the retailer and even the serving staff member may have a serious lawsuit on their hands when the dust settles over the hype.   I’m not an expert on FDA regs but I’m pretty sure you can’t serve a product with a known allergen without clearly stating it to consumers.

9yyb32uj	There seems to be a trend in recent years where Hollywood and the media try their best to make most of the villains in TV and film seem as human as possible. Making the viewer feel more sympathy for them.  Usually these characters get the short end of the stick their entire lives, which causes them to eventually snap. Or they become part of some radical ideology that KINDA makes sense when you think about it. But 9 times out of 10, the villains are often portrayed to be the victim and society the REAL monster.  What happened to psychos being psychos? Take the Joker movie. I don't want to feel sorry for the joker, I want to be shocked by his cruelty. I don't want to see a good man driven to his wits end, I want to see a naturally homicidal maniac who kills people for fun.

Theres someone in front of her clearly filming and turns around and sees what she thinks is someone air humping her all up in her private space and clearly close enough to catch a hook. For the people saying "i wouldve decked her" i bet you wouldve turned in to one of those "its just a prank bro" types if it was  a dude though but hype yourselves up keyboard warriors. Lets reverse  the role and say it was a guy standing while a female was "flossing"  behind them; most of us simply wouldnt be that bothered and def not  enough to swing but a female rightfully so may feel vulnerable such as in this video. On another note if a guy was standing in place of the girl in this situation it probably wouldve been the same exact response  does not matter if the subject wouldve been straight, gay or bi. Respect peoples personal space.   "But he didnt touch her"-- if this happened in a work environment she wouldnt of had to swing on him because he wouldve been fired for sexual harassment. Furthermore even if this scenario took place in a night club, this girl is dancing and some stranger comes up behind her dancing; so many girls would push, slap or even punch the "creep".	1643142249.0	scmzpw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scmzpw/the_guy_that_got_punched_in_the_he_attempted_the/	The guy that got punched in the "He attempted the meme.." video deserved it.

hrig2r1c	Most people find it annoying when you pick out your outfit for the day, decide which shoes to wear, but happen to pick the wrong socks. You don’t realize they are the “wrong socks” until you leave…then all of a sudden you start to feel your socks slowly slide off your heels with every step until both socks are bunched up at the arches of your feet leaving your heels completely exposed inside your shoes. As soon as an opportunity presents itself you fix your socks and breathe a sigh of relief, but as soon as you start walking again, without fail your socks fall right back down to the middle of your feet with your shoes on. At this point you just accept fate and reside to wearing your socks halfway off your feet inside your shoes for the rest of the day!   While most would find this occurrence devastating, I would consider the feeling “awkwardly comfortable”. When my socks fall down in my shoes, I don’t think how annoying it is, I wonder how far will my socks slide down before they stop and how long will I leave them there before I decide to fix them. I’ve become so accustomed to the feeling of my socks being halfway down in my shoes so long that when I fix them I just wait for them to fall back down again because I miss the feeling of my socks being down in my shoes.  I have been on a search for the perfect socks that no matter how many time i fix them they slide back halfway off inside my shoes when I walk. I love the feeling of my socks being halfway off inside my shoes but not as much as feeling my socks slide down…I love the moment I feel my sock slipping past my heel and making it’s way to my arches….I only pull my socks up to repeat this process.  The majority of people HATE this feeling…because socks are meant to stay up, not fall halfway off your feet when you walk. I really don’t care about that, I actually enjoy feeling my socks slide off my feet inside my shoes, I will wear my shoes looser and my socks smaller just to achieve this. I wonder if I am alone in this 🤔😂	1643142586.0	scn494	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scn494/i_enjoy_the_feeling_of_my_socks_falling_down/	I enjoy the feeling of my socks falling down inside my shoes

5pm2d651	Time is money and people who waste it acting befuddled in processing their payment should financially compensate the people behind them.   How many times have you waited in a line to make a purchase, things are moving along until that one idiot's turn comes up and they act perplexed when it comes to payment. They take forever to whip out a credit card or fumble for change or act confused in how to use the point of sale system like they've never done it before. People should have their cash or card at the ready as if they were about to pay the fucking soup nazi with the same fear of repercussions if they mess up in the process.   How would this work? I don't know maybe something like a timer starts once all items are scanned and after 30 secs (which is being generous) if no payment has been initiated then a financial penalty starts accruing that would then be equally distributed to the number of people waiting in line behind the goober as a discount applied to their tab.  Obviously there would be exceptions like for senior citizens, foreign tourists, children or in self-checkouts where it's not practical to have your payment in hand while your trying to scan your own items. But it's not fair to everyone to have their time wasted because the person in front of them was busy diddling their phone or is too stupid to efficiently execute a basic activity and so they should be disincentivized financially for their ineptitude.	1643142969.0	scn9e4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scn9e4/people_who_take_too_long_to_pay_for_things_should/	People who take too long to pay for things should be financially penalized if there is a line behind them.

Height is not as important as is portraited in social media, and I have never even heard a joke about my height (maybe like once or two, but it wasn't hurtful so whatever). I never had problems with girls, and just one girl rejected me for being too short. If you get rejected for your height, don't cry for it, just talk to somebody else.

ke24s	So I'm back at college after a break for a few years. I got a job in my field just prior to graduation and am now comfortable enough in my career and finances to finish off my degree. I'm lucky enough to have a Community College nearby for me to be able to take two of my final three required classes. I attended this same Community College about eight years ago and have noticed a major increase in younger students who have really high opinions of themselves and anger toward the professors.  Because it's a Community College many of the people around me are first or second year undergraduate students who are mostly doing general education classes and lower level major classes.  I swear, the way these students talk it's as if they believe they are already graduate students. They already believe because they enrolled as a certain major that they are essentially an expert in that field. I'm currently in Physics 1 and more than a few of the students have already decided that everything from the professor's expectations, to his heavy accent is a problem.   Some quotes I've heard already:  >"The professor is bullshit, I'm about to drop and find a Engineering Program that's worth my time."  >"This stuff isn't even important and he wants us to write it out on the lab? WTF"  >"I didn't know we were supposed to do that. If my grade isn't fixed by tomorrow I'm filing a complaint."  >"Why would I need a graphing calculator? I'll just use Desmos."  >"How is this dude a professor? You can barely understand him."  >"He just looks for points to take off. Fuck that. He wants to grade for completeness and not accuracy."  >"I'm going to grill him tomorrow. Because we're adults and we're allowed to have opinions on how he's teaching."  There's more I've just managed to black it out. This is two weeks in and these people haven't even touched the surface of what upper division classes will be. Like bruh, the dude is a PhD in Physics and you're out here in Physics 1.

18spdsd	Players simply are the most toxic, and sometimes vile, people to exist in a social setting. They literally tear others apart over anything and everything. Call people horrendous names, abuse game mechanics either because they can or just to mess with other people. Along with simply being a poison to games the majority of the time in how they interact with the game.   Take OW for instance, right now its in long term maintenance mode which is a factor as to why the game is dying out. Yet the players are horrendously toxic, and simply abuse toolkits to easy mode the game, and in turn say what they think an edgelord would say constantly. That in reality would make the edgiest of edgelords blush given its simply being hateful and racist.   Then New World, while it had it's initial flaws, was set up to go well, until the players in the game abused duping bugs so bad. That they permanently destroyed the economy in the game to the point where they simply would have to relaunch the game with fixes in place to salvage it. I think honestly the game is just going to crash and burn thanks to this.  Then finally we can look at WoW, which has an outstanding structure, and has a lot of lore and the like. Yet due to recent events, and the evolution of modern social media behavior, has simply caused a decline in active players. As from my experiences of playing, the number one reason why people quit is due to social interactions in game. Like its horrible how badly players troll others, ruin aspects of the game cause there is no consequence. Then just rinse and repeat till the cows come home or they get IP banned, which still doesn't stop them entirely.   All in all how the game is designed does play a huge factor in how the game will turn out. As in the case of wildstar it was simply tuned towards the top 1% of players, and meant the more casual crowd was turned away and cause the game to crash due to that. Yet players also dictate a lot how a game will go given the above examples I provided. In that it scares me how badly people behave right now, how quick to anger they are. How much they seem to enjoy inflicting misery unto others, along with just generally being unfun to be around or play with. Which right now sadly makes up a lot of the players bases in a lot of MMO's, save for the ones like FF that bans players for bad behavior and toxic behavior. I guess with the new requirement for TPM's for windows 11 may bring players in line more. As now they can have their machine banned which means they can't just make a new account. Yet in the end of it all players seriously can destroy an MMO, which is just common place right now sadly.	1643147166.0	scotbu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scotbu/players_are_the_reason_why_mmos_are_dying/	Players are the reason why MMO's are dying

4n94f0ns	I'd like to preface this post by saying that I love his works and can fully appreciate how influential he was to future generations of horror writers. He does however have a very noticeable trait of over explaining things with adjectives to an almost ridiculous degree. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his very influential story "At the Mountains of Madness".   I recently read this story for a second time and it was honest to God making me laugh at certain points because of how extremely over the top his layering of adjectives is. Almost every single sentence would have several adjectives fully fleshing out nearly every aspect of the thing being described. Almost every single benign object or thing in the story. Every stone must have an eon-dead hideousness. Every breeze must have a terrible alien insideousness only fathomed by eons past. Shit like that. Then in a following sentence he breakds down the entire history of said rock, giving an entire picture of its shape (again having a sinister alien shape to it) and age. This goes on for dozens of pages.   A lot of his works could be shortened considerably and still be just as endearing if they were stripped of a LOT of their adjectives.   Let me make up a paragraph describing what I mean. Here is how H.P. Lovecraft would have written a paragraph about himself walking to the store:  "Upon exiting the opaque and vaguely sinister frame of the oaken ashy door of my decrepit, eon-darkened apartment building, the sinisterly ambiguous breeze of the eon-dead winds of an arctic storm struck me as if sent by an eon-dead unknowable horror from icy depths forever dead and hidden from mortal men. These depths, horrible and diseased in their implication, once held court to a most terrible ancient race of blowing beings to evil and mind-destroying to describe. Beings whos mere mention bring up only the most dark, terrible thoughts in me as I began walking down the crumbling walkway towards the dimly lit corner store. The ancient primordial cold slapped me in my teary eyed face, a face which had not yet adjusted to the unfathomable emptiness of that awful cold breeze...."   And so on. I could keep going but you get the point.   This is a style of writing that only H.P. Lovecraft was really made famous for, and I don't think he's a very good writer because of this. He peppers adjectives into his stories so liberally because he isn't confident in explaining to the reader exactly what he was envisioning with the stories. When in reality, the insane amount of adjectives seems to confuse the reader more than helping them see what he was talking about. I found myself re-reading a lot of portions of his stories to try and cut out the fluff. He should have done that himself, but in my belief could not do so because he didn't think people would understand what he was talking about.   Could any of you understand what the hell i was talking about in my theoretical "walking to the store" post?  In the end, people still loved his work. I do do. There was supposedly a movie being made about this story but I can see why the project was scrapped. It's such a fantastic premise for a story. A hidden ancient ruin of a civilization high up in the mountains, and only recently discovered and explored by man. Two unfortunate men who discovered a far more sinister and horrifying secret buried in the ice of an ancient ruin. But once you cut out the adjectives you begin to see that the majority of the book is just explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining. Not good for movies.   So it is my opinion that H.P. Lovecraft was not a very good writer but a passionate one.	1643147622.0	scoylr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scoylr/hp_lovecraft_was_not_a_very_good_writer_due_to/	H.P.

3syj0r3f	Love the characters, love the ideas, always been a big fan and been watching since the day it aired, BUT... it's just not laugh out loud funny with its jokes and is perhaps stronger with its visual and reference gags.  I think at a push I could argue that across an entire season there are less verbal jokes that land than there is in one entire episode of certain classic Simpsons. I'm well aware of the writing staff history of both shows and why they work so well, but I just don't think that it comes close to being one of the 'funniest' shows and I actually feel like the writers failed in that department with regards to the standards *they* were hoping to set.   Also, I dare say, there is a hint that some of the voice acting, maybe even just the casting, didn't channel that correct energy for the characters (but that's a hard one to judge or imagine, so I'm going to stick to judging the writers!) But it's worth pointing out that with cartoons, sometimes the voice alone can make me laugh. But for some reason, except for perhaps Zapp and the Prof occasionally, these don't.   Certain characters, despite enjoying them on screen and as part of the gang, have absolutely zero going on for me in the humour department. The first that come to mind are Hermes and Amy, who really leave me hanging with so many quips and one liners that it does kind of leave scenes falling flat.  I'm not saying it doesn't have some great lines, Fry, the Prof, Bender and Leela, and of course Zapp all have many laugh out moments, along with many others. I just wouldn't rank it as an all out 'funny show' and I feel its emotional moments are far more memorable and impactful than it's overall sense of humour. A juxtaposition I feel they never really manged to full balance... but that's a topic for another day!	1643149083.0	scphhs	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scphhs/futurama_is_not_very_funny/	Futurama is not very 'funny'

6fbp3u0v	TLDR: the title.   I was on food stamps for about a year and I’ve missed them every day since. Food is a basic human right and this would be an easy way to help make sure all folks have a way to feed themselves and dependents.  The idea of them being abused is absurd and the stigma and bureaucracy (and strict requirements) keep a lot of people away that probably should be on them.   There are already a lot of requirements limiting what you can use them on in the US. I would be happy to see those relaxed, but as it stands there are only so many things you can buy (no hot food, no home goods, no alcohol, etc) . You want to use them to buy a fancy cut of steak or fish? good on you. Rather spread them out for meals across the month? Makes sense to me.   We all have to eat and the government should support that as easily as possible by just making them universal.	1643150477.0	scq095	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scq095/food_stamps_should_be_universally_available/	Food Stamps should be Universally Available
e05a8vdo	back in 2018 when i was still in high school, we had a bit of downtown in the class on friday so i got to making conversation with my teacher about a lord of the rings event that i would be attending with my mother, aunt, and cousin. i am a huge lord of the rings fan and so was that teacher so we had a great conversation. i eventually told her that i really didn\`t know which i like more, the books or the movies. the teacher was quick to say "herequeerandgreat, the books are always better".   although i really didn\`t know my answer at the time, i have recently come to the conclusion that i like the peter jackson trilogy more then the books. to preface, i have indeed read the books. i listened to them on tap and they are good. however, they are not flawless. there is alot of really unnecessary plots and fluff thrown into the books. not to mention, so many characters that it\`s hard to keep track of. the audiobook for return of the king that i listened to was a full eight hours in length.  the movies on the other hand are not only essential viewing for any fantasy fan but for any movie buff in general. peter jackson did an amazing job with these movies, keeping the good parts and doing away with the not so good parts. the trilogy excludes parts that could be considered filler and keeps the story mostly straight. sure, the films are quite lengthy but, with a story as epic as lord of the rings, that can\`t be helped. but, the movies were only as long as they needed to be. and then, there\`s everything else that makes the movies good. the acting is top notch, the music is beautiful, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the quality is just really good. it\`s my favorite trilogy of all time and is one of the few examples i can think of wherein the adaptation is better then the original source material. Tolkien did pave the way but jackson sprinted at ludicrous speed down it.	1643150668.0	scq2w8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scq2w8/peter_jacksons_lord_of_the_rings_trilogy_is/	peter jackson`s lord of the rings trilogy is better then the books
80t3t8zj	I think sites that allow you to gift significant sums of money for individuals such as streamers should require the spender to confirm this via 2FA. There are many reasons I feel this needs to be in place:  &#x200B;  1. You could accidently input the incorrect amount. 2. Your child or someone not yourself could use your account without your consent making this purchase. 3. You may feel overwhelmed emotionally by an individual to donate large amounts of moneys.  The last point is something I feel strongly about especially in reference to streamers. Donating to a streamer you enjoy is perfectly fine, however. I feel that there are some that might skew this momentary means of satisfaction and being noticed at the detriment of their own personal welfare. Having some method of confirmation will give the spender a moment to think about their purchase and weigh the options they have.  When I watch large streamers and see viewers sometimes spend hundreds of dollars to the streamer for a brief moment of recognition I worry that although some may have this purchase well within their financial means, others might be viewing this spending as more important than their own personal wellbeing.	1643150976.0	scq71f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scq71f/sites_where_you_can_gift_or_donate_significantly/	Sites where you can gift or donate significantly large sums of money should require 2FA to confirm the transfer of such a large amount.

He even admits his son would have to 'get tough or die', so he basically left him for dead never caring about the outcome.  The name was unnecessarily cruel too.

aaqcsqyv	They’re both amazing movies easily in the top 5 all time conversations.  But this theory that Godfather 2 is better than Godfather 1 is asinine.  Think about all the quotable lines from part 1. The romance that part 2 did not display. The rise of a Don that did not want to be a Don initially.  Godfather 1 had a Sonny hot headed and ready for whatever, whenever.   Let’s just forget about Fredo for argument sake; He was an idiot in both films.  On the flip side Tom was equally good in both films so we can call that one neutral as well.  Marlon vs Robert? Now this is where the real separation is in both films. Think about it? Who’s been quoted and imitated more for the last 50 years!  Love Dinero the Raging Bull Casino hero! But Brando was iconic is his role of Vito Corleone. Sleeping with the fishes, Horse head in bed, don’t ever take sides against the family,we could go on and on…  Now that “This is the business we’ve chosen” line is a great one! But Godfather 1 has at least 5 of those.  Last but not least; the ending - Just an avalanche of great cinema from Part 1. Even in Part 2 they had to bring back a flashback from the greatness of Godfather 1 (Michael joining the army).

10wx1y	Everyone's situation is unique.  I am 38, moved back to my family home five years ago. Why? Several reasons, one being that my sibling is severely disabled and as my parents age, they needed my support.  I have a roof over my head, food on my plate, security and safety. I work full-time during the week, manage the household chores, care for my sister on the weekends.  But if all you knew about me was my age and that I lived at home, assumptions would be made.  Maybe life hasn't worked with you, maybe you're struggling with addiction recovery or unemployment. Maybe you've gotten out of an abusive relationship.  And sure, there are people who aren't necessarily living at home for any of the above reasons. But even so, judging a person for their journey is unnecessary and unkind.  The next time you hear of someone in their 30s, living with their parents, maybe consider there's a reason why, whether you deem it 'worthy' or not and the last thing that anyone in such a situation needs is your negativity and judgement.  And if you're like me, just living life in a way that works, don't beat yourself up.

I understand people who haven’t been around pro athletics may not realize this, but many of these leagues are built on them. When your favorite player recovers 8x faster than a normal human, it’s not just diet and PT. Yes, Barry Bonds used anabolic steroids in his career. He is just one example of thousands of athletes who have done the same. IMO, PED use should do very little to tarnish an athletes accomplishments. The best athletes almost always rise to the top, and Barry was a generational talent.	1643154862.0	scrmfj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scrmfj/if_barry_bonds_isnt_allowed_in_the_hof_for_peds/	If Barry Bonds isn’t allowed in the HOF for PEDs, neither should Tom Brady or Peyton Manning

But there are still some upsides to having police. for instance, if you are being robbed and your life is in danger then you should call 911 and try to get help. I understand that this isn't necessarily a very unpopular opinion but I have seen so many police hate campaigns or anti-police movements. I would also like to state that violent hate crimes that the police have committed are horrible atrocities and a specific person should not be targeted by their race, I just think that while the police can do horrible things they have also done lifesaving acts of heroism.	1643155033.0	scronb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scronb/although_the_police_can_be_bad_that_doesnt_mean/	Although the police can be bad, that doesn't mean every police officer is a horrible person.

38o5ez5w	R6 Extraction has been getting a lot of heated reviews on YouTube mainly from R6 Siege players. Such as calling it a game that fails before it even takes off. In my opinion, this is because Siege players just wanted it as content for R6 Siege instead of a separate game. Additionally, R6 Siege has one of the most toxic communities in video games. So toxic, they had to remove the "vote to kick" button entirely because experienced players would kick new players instantly. Even more toxic, they had to rework the entire team kill penalty because the community always found away around it to get new players banned.   As someone that enjoys Co-Op games, R6 Extraction is really fun to play with others. It may not be the best game, groundbreaking, or a heavily competitive live service game. But it's a fun, simple multiplayer game that feels like a breath of fresh air in never ending competitive attempts with games coming out these days like xDefiant.	1643155116.0	scrppa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scrppa/r6_extraction_isnt_a_bad_game_and_the_reviews_are/	R6 Extraction isn't a bad game, and the reviews are biased by an already hostile community

bqiae	The obnoxiously loud Harley Davidson motorcycle interrupting your quiet cup of coffee on the patio. The lowered Honda Civic blasting so much bass out their windows it makes your body shake.  In motorcycle school, you are taught to make yourself known as visibly and audibly as possible for safety reasons. Wearing colourful or reflective gear helps your presence be more known especially in lane change situations where a car might not see your comparatively smaller profile and then merge into you. Same with having a bike that can be heard loud and clear.  Now I see it from a safety perspective.  I've heard enough stories from people involved in motorcycle accidents where the other car driver says "I couldn't see them, I didn't know they were there". I've also seen enough times where a bike revving at a stoplight gets other driver's eyes to look at a mirror, check their surroundings, or turn off a turn signal that may have potentially resulted in a collision with the biker.  Rev those engines. Blast that music. Make your presence known, and make those around you be more aware of their surroundings.

A guy who played during a time where players took PEDs and people turned a blind eye is now getting retroactively judged on his character. Just seems like he's one of the scapegoats for the MLB's oversight.   This is like the sticky substance that they're now cracking down on. Baseball has these dirty little secrets that everybody knows about, and when they get one whistleblower they act all high and mighty like they are just absolutely appalled at how anyone could ever cheat the integrity of the game. When said secret comes out, they point fingers at the players who took advantage of a broken system that they created.   Baseball fans, is it normal for the MLB to piss on your backs and tell you it's raining? I'm a football fan, and at this point, the NFL makes no bones about who they are. They're peices of shit. When Colin Kaepernick had that workout with those teams present, everyone knew it was just for show, and the league did very little to act like they were seriously considering giving him another chance.

It really doesn’t matter if the child wasn’t conceived by you or doesn’t have the same blood as you, in the end that doesn’t even make a difference.   I think it’s selfish to feel upset about not being able to conceive but at the same time disregard the idea of adoption. Wouldn’t you still be raising your child even if you adopted him/her?   Some couples just want kids for social validation, and others, just to experience parenthood which are selfish reasons imo.

Trigger warning for this next paragraph about abuse as a child..   However, I know that some people may have not experienced toxic family but I have. I was raised by narcissistic people. I have had my fair share of family “break ups”. As a child I was emotionally, physically, and sexually abused so I know what it feels like to go through severe pain. It was to the point where I was severely depressed and considered suicide in my early teens. I have gone through the broken trust from those who were supposed to love me the most.

And since I am already in a college close to my parents, I decided to change my dreams. I recognize that I have made a mistake of dreaming way above my possibilities, and now I have changed.

ijhbrbb	People that hate on ice age baby are on the right track about the fact that the design is quite ugly but I think it's odd that no one talks about how hideous everything else in that movie is. Ice Age has one of the ugliest cast of characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Every character is so stylized they look deformed, textures remind me of muddy rags, and the animators never learned how to make hair look like hair so hair is gross and wire-y. You could say it was just old animation in a time period when tech was limited but I strongly disagree. Everything is clearly intentional, the basic proportions of the humans are all wrong for stylistic purposes. And the style is ugly and grungy. That is actually what the creators WANTED to do with Ice age, to make it ugly in a comedic way so you'd laugh at the goofy misshapen characters and their idiotic behaviors. And that's all fine and good but let's not pretend like Sid isn't heinous, that Diego's freakishly human face isn't disturbing, that Manny's fur doesn't look like plastic sheets, or that the trees don't look like dirty polygonal toothpicks.

bxpnp1ae	This is one of my biggest pet peeves on Reddit and the internet in general: apparently, if somebody had it worse then you, you’re privileged.   Anything healthy can be called privilege nowadays. If you did not suffer severe trauma, you were privileged, apparently. It’s come to the point where I once said something that, in short, meant “Kids shouldn’t be exposed to their parents fighting” and someone answered me with something along the lines of “If you think fighting is a problem, you lived a very privileged life! I once met a kid whose mother stabbed their father in front of them”. I am not exaggerating at all, this interaction actually happened. *No*, the fact parents fighting is what I consider bad for a child does not mean I had a privileged life, it just means that the life of the kid who saw their mother stab their father was really f*cked up.   We should *not* be levelling things by the bare, bare minimum. Healthy should be seen as normal, and anything bellow healthy as something to be addressed / fixed.

7utqa0kr	Everyone knocks low rise jeans and says "You have to pry my high waisted jeans from me." - Baby ain't nobody even trying to begin with, ok? Nobody wants your hand-me-downs and you can wear whatever you want. Low rise jeans actually look incredible on some people and it's ok that they're coming back. We've been on the high waisted trend train like crazy for a while now. It's ok to accept other jeans in the group. It's ok to go medium, it's ok to go low. But the thing is, not everyone fits low rise jeans, we know this. But also, not everyone fits high waisted jeans either.  If we're thinking back to the 2010s, I remember back then, I remember spotting so many people with high waisted jeans in the 2010s decade era, and oh my god. Some people looked AMAZING with them on. But to be honest, some of ya'll mf looked wonky as hell with high waisted jeans on. If you genuinely think EVERYBODY looks good with high waisted jeans then I'm not sure what to tell you except that I heavily disagree. I think for some, it really doesn't fit right.  &#x200B;  Can we please normalize that some clothing items look better/worse on different people?

icz6wo3r	Hell relies on the ability to torture someone. In order to torture someone, you would need to have a properly intact body or the torture has to stop, as you do not have a body/soul to continue torturing. If the body isn't being tortured. Now, seeing as hell lasts an eternity, and in order for torture, you need a stable enough body or you cannot feel pain, you would have to have a constantly repairing-itself body. If this is what has to happen, then you essentially are immortal. And from the standpoint that immortality is a gift from God, taken away for man's sin, then Hell is still objectively good place; as Hell has to constantly replenish you're form, and it lasts an eternity.  &#x200B;  I didn't think this out much, so it's not an airtight theory, ik ik.	1643160636.0	sctox3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sctox3/hell_is_a_good_thing/	"Hell" is a "Good" Thing

Even if influencers and movie/TV/music stars had a perfectly attainable healthy in shape phys1que that required a simple healthy diet and mild exercise routine, it would barely make any different to people's mental health and perception, because they are not even willing to put the effort in to reach that or anywhere close.  People have mental health issues today about their out of shape bodies because they aren't being taught discipline and knowledge needed to be healthy. Not because they are trying desperately to reach impossible perfection. If they were the average person would certainly look a lot bloody better than they do now. And half of most modern countries wouldn't be dangerously overwe1ght.  Sorry, kids aren't trying their desperate hardest to reach unattainable looks and getting depressed because they can't reach it. They're just ugly and fat and undisciplined and unknowledgeable and feel depressed and shit because they know they look awful and not even realistically good.

9864mb6y	I bought a 2022 Kia Rio 5-Door; it’s a new car but has enough old school specs that make sense for overall safety. All of my basic car controls have manual knobs I can use with muscle memory without going through multiple touch screens on my center console. I have to engage most features manually. The automatic features include my phone connecting when I get in the car and the seats detecting a passenger next to me.   I have to manually engage my headlights every time I get in the car. This helps me double check that I’m lighting my line of sight correctly. On my way home at 7:30pm, a teenager in a Mercedes was driving without any lights on. At the next red, both me and another mom on the other side of her car had to spend a whole minute getting her attention because she was scrolling through her phone. We got her to turn her headlights on before the green light. Though it initially seemed like a nice feature to see my gauges right away, I realized not being able to see my gauges in the dark was always a prompt for me to turn my lights on if I ever forgot in my 2010 Honda.  And I could’ve added a technology package to my car and gotten the auto braking, lane assist features, and other shazam for under two grand. I chose not to because I’ve watched friends with those features act carefree while their cars drifted because the cars were “programmed to correct it anyway”. I chose old school headlights to protect other drivers from becoming blind at night.   Not everything has to be automatic and made easy to disengage the driver from understanding what’s on and what’s off in their car. And please for the love of all that is creamy: 1) Please remind your kids not to use their phones at intersections. 2) Take a second to check that your brake lights work properly. 3) Leave enough room in front of the other car when you’re changing lanes. 4) Use your turn signals. 5) Don’t weave through a school zone because you want to go at 50mph while everyone is doing <20mph.  Not everything should be in the most modern state possible. I just can’t stand “convenience” features that are sold at a premium on all cars just to enhance lack of awareness… and can’t stand some of the horrible drivers that have grown even more in number these days.	1643163391.0	scumxy	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scumxy/all_cars_should_keep_some_things_forever_old/	All cars should keep some things forever “old school”.

4wt5yzyk	Child pornography is illegal but it is somehow okay to hire actors to play as High School 16-17 year olds and put them in compromising, sexual positions.  It’s wrong and gross and an example of the fantasies of men in power who want to go back to their own high school experience and recreate their most perverted dreams.  If you are playing a character who is underage, you should treat them as underage and not have them do nude, sex scenes.  This stuff is damaging to young girls who compare themselves to these characters and quite clearly (because the actors are older and cherry-picked) don’t match up.  Also, the show is just terrible and awkward to watch because of all the child sex scenes.  Lastly, and I know people who disagree are going to come at me and say I am prude: fuck that.

I smoke and I love nicotine. I’m well aware that I’m addicted but I have no problem with it. It helps me to think and calms me. The same goes for a good cup of tea, coffee, sports or a big glass of water. I just have a problem with the way we produce cigarettes. I like cigarettes but I hate that on this day and age, they still are as poisonous as they can be and I blame the uneducated public, doctors, companies and the governments for this. It’s a complex problem but to say it more precisely: Cigarettes are toxic, every nicotine substitution on this planet is shitty, there are still no nicotine pills, or some kind of tasteful, less harmful cigarettes on the market since people just naively assume that every smoker on this planet who smokes does it willingly with the thought „I smoke and idc if I get cancer“. Every doctor on this planet is focused on just telling people to stop but no one is asking why people smoke. As if nicotine has no positive effects at all! That’s a falsifiable claim at best. Instead of society just telling people to „lol just stop smoking“, one needs to acknowledge, that it’s not the nicotine that’s the main toxin but the rest of the stuff inside cigarettes, heck most people don’t even know the nicotine’s mostly just the addictive part and tar etc. is the real bad guy. This clenched view on cigarettes leads to NO real R&D into cigarettes (or nicotine in general), leaves every smoker on their own and is a complete dishonest representation of the main problem. This alone leads to more smoker deaths than is necessary and it just makes me really angry.	1643164266.0	scuxm4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scuxm4/the_witch_hunt_on_big_tabacco_is_hurting_more/	The witch hunt on big tabacco is hurting more people than helping on this day and age

4apugpa6	This concept of "oh you think you had/have it bad" is a sign of an extremely toxic and manipulative mentality.  Someone else might not be suffering as much as you but that doesn't mean that they're suffering is fabricated or that they don't deserve to feel for something they might have gone through or that they need to realize it's not a big deal because someone else experienced worse.  No matter how bad your day or experience was, someone else has gone through worse and would tell you the same thing.

7yy5px2	In total their is roughly 440 million Reddit accounts that alone is less than 1/15 of the worlds population however it wouldn’t be a stretch to say that over half of the accounts are bots/ second accounts for users. So if we are optimistic it may represent 220 million actual people. Which would mean that 1/30 people you meet in real life may use the site in any extent. Which leaves a significant portion of the worlds population most likely not represented. Their is also the fact that most people who would use Reddit would tend to be of a young demographic which leaves even more of the population out of representation. Along with this Reddit’s base primarily attracts people who don’t hugely participate in social lives so that cuts representation even more. In conclusion I don’t believe a lot of the opinions that are popular on the site represent the reality of most of society or that we represent the reality of the world at all.

c0nb1145	I see so many jokes in popular media about someone living with their parents. I come from India and it is very normal to live with parents and I believe it makes absolute sense to do so from:  1. Mental health perspective: Some families can be toxic but generally, it is very healthy to be around family. There is someone looking out for you, someone you can rely on and that love is unconditional  2. Financial perspective: I don't think this needs any explanation  3. Planet perspective: I don't know if anyone has realised that living in separate quarters creates additional waste and adds to the burden of the planet.   4. Caring for the child and the elderly: your parents need you in their old age and you can greatly benefit from their help with rearing your children.

gbkrgdx8	I always see the argument that shows like riverdale and euphoria are unrealistic because of the murder/drugs/sex/body type and like… of COURSE they’re unrealistic. Its all for entertainment purposes. Anyone who goes to a high school knows you don’t get to dress like a stripper, that 14 year olds aren’t ripped/stacked, and that no one gets murdered every day lol. But no one would want to watch a show that’s just 8 hours of silently sitting in classes and seeing your friends for only 15 minutes at lunch. That would be a boring ass show.   Also, teenagers know what sex and drugs are. Sure it’s a bit excessive sometimes but it’s nothing new. A little creepy that adults are playing 16 year old who always have sex but it’s not necessarily a bad influence to teens. Maybe to little kids but that’s not the target audience. Sure, some of these shows should be set in college just because of the age of the actors playing them, but (majority of) teens know teen dramas are total nonsense when compared to the real world and aren’t basing their lives on those of the fictional characters.	1643169184.0	scwlor	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scwlor/teenage_dramas_arent_a_bad_influence_the_targeted/	Teenage dramas aren’t a bad influence.

56f75	I happened across a video on instagram of a woman eating a 15 lb lobster on IG. To put that in perspective, the lobster she ate was likely almost if not already a century old. And was eaten in a fucking mukbang video.      In general, I find mukbang videos, on top of being physically repulsive, to be ethically questionable. Streaming your cooch, videogames, giving people money on the street to increase your follower count, that stuff doesn't bother me. But flaunting yourself feasting to the point of overeating is just pure gluttony. Its a needless flex that I can't for the life of me understand has any sort of following and yet.... literally millions upon millions of people subscribe to channels watching people gorge themselves for hours, sloppily sucking, crunching, and smashing food into their faces. I couldn't imagine trying to explain to a starving person why videos like that are so popular.

bt55d5uo	I am a ‘scalper’ and I sell mainly shoes which are limited.   Often times I laugh at the pure hatred people feel towards those that are like me. There are in my opinion a few things they don’t understand/think about.   - when shoes are limited, the manufacturer intentionally does this, KNOWING that the shoes will be resold at a much higher price. This keeps the brand ‘cool’, and stimulates sales of less limited, cheaper shoes. Why is there no anger towards Nike when they decide to only make 10k pairs of a shoe, when they know for a fact demand can be in the millions.   - people seem to think all I do is download a bot on my computer, and buy hundreds of pairs. I assure you it is not this easy.   - honestly I think people look quite dumb when they get mad at people like me, while ignoring the profiteering that goes on at the corporate level. But since these corporations are faceless, they don’t even think about that.   - people act like they *need* the coolest, newest shoes. Jesus Christ get a grip. Even the shoes I wear are $100 because I don’t need to spend $1000 on shoes.   A few other things, but I’d like to hear your guys’ thoughts as to why there’s so much animosity felt towards us.

5fwp8y1i	Very sensitive topics coming in.  A lot of people are born into very bad situations all around the world. Sometimes the quality of life ratio to worthiness of living it isn’t in par. I honestly do believe that the more self aware you are of the life you, and others live, the more you understand the death wishes a lot of people have. You guys might have seen that meme of “Life is unpredictable, and the only constant is suffering” or something like that. It speaks some truth. Hell, the whole survival of the fittest theory is based upon death and suffering of others. Without the mass suffering of others,you wouldn’t be here today. Our views on suicide are totally obstruct. Nobody knows the main intent for why humans do it (beyond the triggering incidents) , even less animals. In a 2013 book,”How Animals Grieve”, we’re told about the practices of bile milking. A inhumane practice where bears are concealed in the smallest cages and are purposefully abused for their bile. One day “The mother bear supposedly broke free of her restraints, smothered her cub, and then smashed herself into a wall, ending her own life.” Hugo, a smart species of a whale,spent 12 years of his life in captivity. Unhappy and being seen only as entertainment, He “killed himself by smashing his head into wall after 12 years in captivity.” Now, nobody knows the true intent of “suicide” in animals, and there’s a lot of controversy weather it’s intentionally planned. There’s debates to if they even understand the consequence, or cause self harm to no avail of what happens next. You take a look at the leading species in life, humans, and you can make some connections. So many people suffer for years, decades, or their lifetime. We’re told all humans matter, but are not shown it. In the US alone you can find someone with an unlawful amount of money, and in the same city you’ll find someone who has been extremely suffering. with mental health so bad they stop being seen, or behaving as human. I think life is definitely an experience. The odds definitely need to be in your favor. We need a humane way for those with unimaginable pain to leave safely, because why suffer unimaginable pain for longer ,when you’ll end up in the same soil anyway. I think it does more harm than good to not have. “A way out”. It should be frowned upon by society, but there should be a more humane way.	1643173648.0	scxzof	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scxzof/you_shouldnt_be_forced_to_live_and_there_should/	You shouldn’t be forced to live, and there should be a humane way out.

iufzsuf1	It's true that the labour market is competitive and you need a degree to get your foot at the door for an interview. Beyond that there's little use to the degree as most people have to re-learn the skills they require for the job in the first few months/years of in the job training. Hence, going deeply into debt to attain a university degree is beyond ridiculous!  I find apprenticeship to be a more attractive path right after high school as you get the same level of qualification as a degree at the end of it, along with years of experience. Not to mention getting paid all along the way and not incurring any debt.  That being said, you need to know what exactly you want to do for work to be able to choose an apprenticeship scheme. Whereas you can wobble you way through university and decide to do a completely different thing for work. Obviously, there are exceptions to jobs that require very specific qualification such as medicine and law.  All in all, in my opinion university degree is a waste of money given the alternatives available (i.e. apprenticeships) unless you are looking to go for a career which requires a very specific qualification to get the license to practice (such as medicine and law).	1643174178.0	scy5ew	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scy5ew/getting_in_debt_for_a_university_degree_is/	Getting in debt for a university degree is ridiculous

bmipi7pe	I understand the sentiment behind wanting a space where you can feel connected to the person you've lost, to grieve. But the fact is that a gravestone is purely metaphorical anyway, and once a body is buried, it is never seen again leads me to wonder why we do not just either cremate or use (donate to science, use to plant trees, use for police training, etc like we already do) the bodies of the dead? Burying them only serves to provide one symbolic gesture, an incredibly expensive and surprisingly resource intensive one at that, before being buried underground forever.   Again, I want to rehash that the concept of CEMETERIES makes sense to me. People need a space to be connected with something physical related to their loved ones. Caring for a gravesite can be theraputic. But none of this requires the actual body of the person to be buried underneath it in a 5 thousand dollar box in a deep hole. A hole that risks damaging groundwater, and the ecosystems that said groundwater feeds. I just struggle to grasp why people feel it is worth embalming and burying the dead rather than just doing something less resource/money intensive, or something that works towards the greater good when it genuinely would not affect our mourning habits at all, other than the actual act of burial itself.    I always imagine some human ambassador trying to show our society to an alien culture and having to find some way to explain that our practice of throwing dead people in lavish boxes that we then hide forever is a billion dollar industry, and is a service which people are willing to go into financial debt for.  I realize this could seem offensive, or insensitive to someone who has lost someone recently. I have no Ill will towards people who bury their loved ones, I've just been thinking about this for a long time. I'm sorry if this causes any hurt feelings, but I would love to hear what people think about this, as it's been on my mind for ages.	1643174723.0	scyb1i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scyb1i/our_practice_of_body_burying_is_confusing/	Our practice of body burying is confusing.

3la3lxqr	I already do not like nuts to begin with (no, I’m not allergic, I just don’t like them) so this sort of helps my stance on this but there is nothing worse than biting into a nice, chocolatey, yummy looking brownie and then boom - random chunks of graininess ruining the smooth, buttery, luscious texture of the brownie. I know some of y’all are going to say that it adds crunch, and I do like a nice layer of crunch. However, nuts do not satisfy the crunch factor. They just make it grainy. You can’t even taste nuts in brownies so they don’t add anything other than a weird texture.  If you want to add a nutty flavor to your brownies, I would personally prefer peanut butter. The texture isn’t ruined and it actually adds flavor. I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate so I wouldn’t mind a brownie with peanut butter. I just think straight up nuts in brownies should be abolished.	1643175940.0	scynql	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scynql/nuts_do_not_belong_in_brownies/	Nuts do not belong in brownies.

3la3lxqr	I know a lot of people hate flying, but I love it. The sound of the engine is super relaxing as well as the occasional dings. Also listening to music, watching a movie, combined with the relaxing engine sound just gets me super in the zone lol. Not to mention the excitement of going on vacation. Everything about flying is enjoyable to me and if I have to get up early to catch a flight, it’s one of the only things I have absolutely no trouble getting up for.  But night flights hit different. They are weirdly even more relaxing, I guess because the lights inside the airplane are more comforting at that time (plus they’re usually purple, my favorite color) and it gives off sleep-inducing vibes.	1643176783.0	scyvyh	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scyvyh/flying_on_airplanes_is_relaxing/	Flying on airplanes is relaxing.

3kcudivo	For most of the existence of modern humans we did not live long past peak fertility. I was looking at a study of adult mortality in patagonia that suggested most people who made it out of childhood were dead by thirty-eight.  I think this implicit suggestion that we should seek to lead more complicated longer lives, peak later, and cling to life is madness.  We spend decades in school and chasing promotions in a life cycle that makes no sense. By the time a surgeon is ready to begin their career most hunter gatherers would be grandparents and living the last few years of their life.  I don’t want it.

hrxojhws	It seems good when they're a kid because the parent can get off without doing any parenting and the kid is happy. But then the kid grows up, and it all becomes worse for them. They should be able to go and become a good person and in the future I'm not excusing their behaviour but it is harder. And for the parent, it disgusts me how fully grown adults will have a child if they cant be a parent. If you can't even discipline your own child you are lazy and shouldn't be a parent. I'm so pissed at all these adults who act like they're victims because a little kid threw a tantrum. You're not a victim, you're just a shitty parent who's causing problems their child will have to suffer through later in life because theyre lazy. And then most of the kids will change but even as an adult after they would have become a better person having once been a bad person will often make it so others will judge them and they will likely have low self esteem knowing they once did bad and will still feel like they are bad. And then some of them get disorders like ASPD and NPD which they would have for the rest of their life.	1643178342.0	sczc5u	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczc5u/i_have_sympathy_for_kids_who_grew_up_with_parents/	I have sympathy for kids who grew up with parents who never punish them, not for the parents.

hbwpbc4g	I’m watching narcos Mexico season 3 and I’m being distracted by all the hot ass women. The reporter. The DEA agents girlfriend.    I don’t want to see hot women unless I can get off to them. Whether in real life or in porn. Everything else is just a tease and I don’t like being teased.    It also makes society worse, because viewing attractive people without being able to fuck them causes the halo effect.

cvlqyvot	A lot of times on social media I see people deride “tryhard” or “sweaty” gamers, people who have put a lot of effort into the games they play and are consequently good at them. Generally the critique goes something along the lines of “I work all day and just want to come home and relax and instead I just get stomped on by some sweaty basement dweller.” Usually the implication being that the opponent has avoided having a life in order to gain the ability to endlessly dunk on noobs and that because there’s nothing constructive to gain from gaming this is purely a bad thing. Personally I disagree with this sentiment. For one, it is definitely possible to be very good at a game and have a life. I'm pretty involved with the gen 3 competitive pokemon community and used to be top 30 in the world (it's a small community so not super impressive but still took a fair amount of effort). I also work full time as an engineer and while I am fairly introverted I do have a friend group outside of the game that I love and spend plenty of time with, and most of the people I know from that community despite having stupid amounts of useless knowledge about the game also manage to have active social lives and are either making their way through college or have full time jobs.  I also disagree with the idea that it is fully nonconstructive. Yes the idea of getting even a livable wage from competitive gaming is a pipe dream for the vast majority of people and unlike sports you’re not exactly going to get fit from gaming either but not everything you do needs to be in pursuit of something. Sometimes just having fun is good enough and competitive gaming can be extremely fun. Seeing the hard work you put in pay off is rewarding even if it’s not adding to your bank account, and the mental aspect of outsmarting an equally competitive opponent or theorizing new strategies is an amazing feeling. Furthermore, I’ve met a ton of my closest friends through gaming communities which is a whole reward in its own. To make a comparison to a more socially acceptable hobby, if you want to be an excellent piano player you have to put a significant amount of hours into that as well. You are not likely to earn money from it and it’s not going to help you get fit either. Yet no one will question the effort you put into that even if you’re styling on your friend who just learned chopsticks. What makes games different?  Another misconception I see a lot is people conflating tryhards with toxic players. I think anyone who goes out of their way to trash on someone just because they’re bad at the game is a dick. I’ve always been of the opinion that new players are the most important players in any gaming community because they are your chance to keep the game alive and as they improve they are often sources of innovation in your game’s metagame. Scaring them away with your shit talk is not just being an asshole but actively harming your community. That being said these people typically aren’t as common as they are made out to be among the most competitive players. Generally when I’m laddering anonymously the most toxic people I come across tend to also not be very good at the game. A lot of toxicity in gaming comes from people who can’t accept fault from their losses and instead try and blame their opponent's "lame" playstyle or luck or what have you. My personal favorite is the people trying to blame their loss on you playing bad (??). This isn’t exactly an attitude that’s conducive to improvement. From the noob side of things I've also been trying to learn a platform fighter called rivals of aether and when going in to the discords, the people who are most passionate about the game tend to be the most helpful and supportive while the most toxic people tend to be the ones who find my main "lame". Even though they're currently better than me I suspect these people fall in to that same scrub category I find laddering in pokemon.   It’s ok to not want to be involved in competitive games. They can be stressful and they’re not everyone’s cup of tea but they can also be fun, rewarding, positive places and it’s ok to put effort into them if it’s something you’re interested in. Moreover the only way to stop getting stomped is to put forth your own effort, and if you're expecting people to go easy on you and let you win when they're better at the game then I hate to say it but maybe competitive games just aren't your thing.   TLDR, you can be good at games and have a life, having fun is a fine reason to put effort into something, and toxicity doesn’t necessarily go hand in hand with being good at games.	1643179133.0	sczjja	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczjja/its_ok_to_be_a_tryhard_gamer/	It's OK to be a Tryhard Gamer
3a1sujv4	I cant believe how many favorite series have been ruined by this, i.e. Doom or Code Geass. You watch a show and after it, lets say a new season comes out, but as an alternate timeline. That first story you've watched is thrown out of the window never to be seen again, the story that got you into this show, the characters that you love, gone , forever... But hey new timeline , same or reworked characters of the show , new story, thats cool right? No. I would prefer a show ending rather than having an alternate timeline. Of course there are good shows that have alternate timelines , but they're only good when it is heavily implied and/or it makes part of the original timeline and the stories connect. It honestly breaks my heart when instead of ending a show the producers prefer killing it by a new story with the same/reworked characters.	1643179472.0	sczms0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczms0/alternate_universestimelines_in_movies_shows/	Alternate universes/timelines in movies, shows, animes, games,etc. ruin the entire story

5evkm	Yes this is reference to Pokemon Arceus.   I've seen a lot of people in the past few days saying, "this is the developers problem and not the Publisher."  I think the publisher is liable for the problem with the games they publish, to a certain degree. They allow games to make it to the market in bad, unfinished, or dismal states due to not caring.  This isn't to say GameFreak or DICE aren't to blame for their mistakes, they totally are. I just also want to say that a publisher is also responsible.  If we blame EA for lootboxes in BF2, we have to blame Nintendo for shipping a game in the state they did.	1643179819.0	sczq25	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczq25/if_we_blame_ea_for_the_things_they_force_upon/	If we blame EA for the things they force upon their devs to shove in to games, we should also blame Nintendo for allowing their developers to phone in so many cherished franchises.

gll43pjr	My 2 favorite shows at the moment are Succession and Ozark. But I cannot stand how much they rely on f-bombs in their dialogue. Literally every second line has one. And it's not as though they use them to convey extreme emotion like fury or fear. Even in the most innocent and wholesome lines, someone has to swear and it's just annoying. Also, it's kind of a lazy way of telling the audience that the show is serious(kind of like how Euphoria relies on excessive nudity to convince you its a mature show).  As an example of a show that uses its f bombs very strategically and impactfully, watch Bojack Horseman.	1643180100.0	sczsua	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczsua/too_much_swearing_cheapens_the_dialogue_of_a_show/	Too much swearing cheapens the dialogue of a show

3f2xxq64	Recently, I have been accused of approaching some discussions on hot button issues with a bad faith argument when I am genuinely trying to understand someones reasoning. When I point out any inconsistencies I see in the reasoning presented or even simply probe further, I get reply's that I am acting in bad faith and I have even had people say they regret "platforming" me.  I see people using this takedown (e.g. accusing my argument of being bad faith) as a shield for their own inconsistencies/cognitive dissonance. Its much easier to attack someone else or point to made up flaws in their rehtoric than it is to have a coherent position on an issue that isn't predicated on emotions and group validation.	1643181339.0	sd04ek	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd04ek/people_saying_an_argument_is_bad_faith_are_almost/	People saying an argument is "bad faith" are almost always actually communicating "I can't handle disagreement on a topic I feel strongly about".
e93ej	Obviously if you are like injured and die alone because you can’t get help or something, that sounds like an awful way to go but if you’ve lived a full life and want your final moments to be alone and with your own thoughts I think theres nothing sad about that. This came up recently because a member of my family passed away after a very long life and when they were in the hospital and we knew it was nearing the end one of my cousins said someone should be with them when they die. I simply asked do we know if they want that? And basically everyone in my family acted like that was a crazy and insensitive question. I found that unfair because I’m not sure I would want a bunch of people around me when I go. Birth, childhood, school, marriage, careers, parenthood, sports, etc all involve other people so for your final act if you want to go at it alone I think there’s something cool about that.	1643181772.0	sd08e1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd08e1/the_idea_of_dying_alone_isnt_as_depressing_as/	The idea of dying alone isn’t as depressing as people make it out to be because it’s one of, if not the the only major life events you get to do alone.

pwlam	Disclaimer: I don't agree with the mindset of "salaries should not be discussed", I think it's absurd when employers "forbid" it and employees should be able to discuss it if they wish to.  &#x200B;  However, I don't think that two people working in the same position, even given that they have the same amount of experience, getting different salaries is a bad thing. From the employer's perspective it of course makes sense to try to pay people as little as possible - they're here to make a profit after all, and if one of those two people who have identical backgrounds was better able to "sell" their skills or to ask for a raise more convincingly - that is part of their skillset and good on them.  &#x200B;  To reiterate though I believe salaries should be discussed, as employees new in the profession won't know what the "normal" wages are so they won't ask for raises to not seem cocky.	1643182104.0	sd0b7n	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0b7n/i_dont_think_inequal_pay_for_people_in_the_same/	I don't think inequal pay for people in the same position is a tragedy

9s5omqu5	There's a thing or too voxel games can learn from **Roblox's** old **High Scalability Terrain**. You could place up to **3 dimensions** of voxels at once by simply dragging your mouse around (and q key), and use different variations of **every available block**! The textures would also tile across multiple voxels at a time, which was new during the early 2010s. They also had a nice eye drop tool, which worked with the terrain. There weren't any slabs, unfortunately; and the number of materials to choose from was lacking.  In case any of you are asking, this was before Minecraft World Edit was released.'

Because everyone knows the US loves a good old war and the profit it brings to their arms industry Putin could not bet against retaliation if he does invade Ukraine.   As much as I dislike the warmongering US this type of thing shows that they are the least worst of the worlds superpowers.

I feel like that is very half-baked thinking.   I tried this out already, and I detest it with every fiber of my being. I neither want to get drunk, kill my brain cells or my liver.

1iv7qtdh	I think this has been the case since forever. Most marriages lasted long in the past because most people did not have a choice or a chance to leave. Nowadays, it is easier to leave and that is good because you don't need to be stuck in a toxic relationship. I think most marriages in the past also wouldn't have lasted long if there was an option to leave. What I am trying to say is that most relationships don't work whether it was in the past or in the present. Most people will fall out of love after a certain time, any gender, and want novelty. Most people would want excitement and the rollercoaster of feelings. Most people do not recognize that daily life is always going to be boring because you keep doing similar things everyday.   There are very few cases where people were happily married till death did them apart, but most relationships would end after a while. Some people say things like it is an experience or you learn something, but I am a human man, not a chapter or a ride. Feelings get hurt and sometimes they never heal.   Personally, I believe that it is a waste of time to invest in long-term relationships because it is more than likely that it won't be long-lasting. The point of long-term relationships is for them to last, so there is no point in putting effort when it is more likely to not last.	1643182674.0	sd0g9a	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0g9a/most_longterm_relationships_are_unstable_and_wont/	Most long-term relationships are unstable and won't work
er9duki2	The Mario franchise has gone to shit, we haven't had a good game since Galaxy 1  Galaxy 2 is just a cashgrab that took 3 seconds of development, reusing assets and the levels are poorly designed.  All of the "New Super Mario games" are basically the Fifa or Iphone of the mario series.  The only effort that went into Odyssey was the graphics, the rest of the game has terribly designed worlds, with shitty power moons that show Nintendo cares more about quantity then quality.  I'm surprised people are actually critical of the side games in the franchise like the paper mario series or the Mario party games, considering how everyone pretends everything the main series pulls out of its ass is a 10/10 masterpiece.  3d Land is so painfully slow at parts and they completely butchered the Raccoon suit.  3d World is just another rehash, im surprised they actually made new assets instead of reusing shit from 3d Land.  Bowser's Fury is just an excuse not to put out any actual Mario games for the next 6 years.  Luigi's Mansion 3 is somehow worse then Dark moon, another case of the only effort going into the visuals, which sucls because the original Luigi's mansion is one of ny favorite games out their.  Now back to the Mario movie.  Shigeru Miyamoto was clearly high on cocane when casting the actor's and he most likely has no actual involvement after the casting and marketing so that they can score praise for being Mario.  Illumination is a studio infamous for its garbage movies, the only good one being despicable me 1, and writers from Teen Titans Go are writing this movie.  This film will be garbage and even if Miyamoto is involved in the direction and story, executives are going to make him change shit to make more room for fart jokes.  I sure can't wait for this to be praised as one of the greatest movies of all time, simply for having Mario slapped on it.	1643182988.0	sd0j1q	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0j1q/even_though_the_mario_movie_is_gonna_be_shit/	Even though the Mario movie is gonna be shit, Critics will blindly praise the movie soley for being Mario.

4r8h5uy2	I'm going to use "no way home" as an example, but this rant goes for any film that is a part of a multi film series.   No way home is currently at 93% on rotten tomatoes. But it doesn't function as a film, unless you're already a fan of Spider-man and the MCU, it just is a 2 and a half hour reference that you don't get.  I'm speaking as somebody that has seen all of the MCU and all previous Spider-man films, so I was in on the reference and really enjoyed it. But to give it 93% and say its "film of the year" is ridiculous when you have to of watched 30 films prior to it in order to even know what's happening.  I feel like the film should be taken as part of a series. You wouldn't reccomend series 4 episode 8 of a series you like to somebody that has never seen it?

It’s another thing to have a whole “woe is me attitude” and have people wasting their time on you all for you to go against their advice or ignore it  You’re being selfish and inconsiderate of the fact that people are using their real time and energy on you and being a therapist or the person to vent to is heavily draining on someone’s mental health . And then it gets to a point where people are constantly repeating themselves cause you keep repeating the same thing over and over again.   “I’m so sad and everything is so bad for me and I don’t know what to do”, their response: “ok well you could just do-“ “no i can’t everything is so terrible and I can’t do anything right and I’ll never amount to anything” then proceeds to have that same conversation over and over again. Like what do you want people to tell you at this point, honestly you just wanna hear your own voice because I keep saying the same thing   And that also goes for you not wanting to help yourself and then crying about how fucked up it is so people can kiss your ass and say how bad they feel for you.

5z7ralbt	This is prolly all introverts opinion as I’m usually quiet but am talkative. Although I have enough extrovert qualities to have convos with anyone it’s usually me listening. Ik as animals we love to seek information but most convos to me are just complete nonsense to the point I find it usually exhausting to respond to or even approach someone about something that I could possibly address myself, hence introversion. If there’s nothing good to say then why say it? Why say? This applies to any space that is not exclusively about discussions as the person to me comes off as entitled to be spoken to, even if it’ll obv make the situation worse. Added to most humans’ historically bad use of terms and labels, plus their need to be validated/verified, and it’s no wonder why misinformation and some negative emotions spreads the way it do in the social media era.  Also when there’s silence some have a extreme problem with it. You can see how uncomfortable some get just within seconds in the aftermath of a conversation but without any departure. Some may try to start up another convo or speak to someone else (even other animals) which is fine but I remember seeing comments saying they can’t imagine anyone not talking for a day. A day?

This is somehow normal on this platform while at the same time daring to question the thread narrative gets you downvoted into oblivion.  I don't care if you're pro this or that, or whatever the "other side" does. Sabotaging and wishing upon death and or violence will never be a long term solution.

dydi06hj	Articulacy is a soon-to-be thing of the past, as the general population seems to have an exaggerated usage of slang, and it makes you sound incredibly stupid, illiterate, and uneducated. I will absolutely think less of you if you refer to another person as "bro", "brah" and any variation of it, also if you're using "lit/fire" to describe your opinion on a subject matter, you will come across as immature, and your point ends up being discredited as you fail to communicate across the social norm in a formal way.      There are of course exceptions where slang is perfectly fine, but I am referring to sloppy usage of the language, not dialect.   Every generation has its own variation of verbal tics and "like" is clearly one of those.  Slang – a way of speaking that articulates an alternative linguistic culture, I would still want to argue that it's fine on the basketball court but serves to keep its speakers in a linguistic ghetto if used, in – for example – a school classroom, or a job interview.

emxjbde	This is a very specific take, so before all the haters chime in, note that I’m NOT saying that family, in and of itself, is a bad thing. For background, I have a very warm, welcoming, and loving Mexican family, a great relationship with my relatives, and nothing bad to say about being Mexican in and of itself. THAT BEING SAID, my beef is with this entrenched cultural concept that “la familia” is, or should be, everything. It’s not and it shouldn’t be, either.  You see it everywhere in Latin culture. The idea that “family is first”, or “everything for the family”. You ever seen the Pixar movie Coco? It has a pretty good depiction of what “familia” means in Mexican culture. Help your family, help your elders, and who cares if you’re good at the guitar. It’s this idea that you, the individual, have no separate identity unless it is connected to someone else in your family. E.g. What are you doing to help your cousin Junior stay out of trouble? When are you gonna come and do that chore for abuelita? When are you gonna help your aunt in Mexico, whom you’ve never met, apply for citizenship so she can come over to the States?   For the most part, your entire cultural identity lives and dies by the family. You could be independently successful, or stuck in a rut, and none of it matters because you’re supposed to be there for family, and family is supposed to be there for you. And this kind of thinking is wrong.   If I’m being brutally honest, I think the reason why Mexicans are given this unfair stereotype of being “lazy” or not the “best and brightest” is because their entire cosmos, aspirations, and ambitions are entirely rooted in family. And what does that actually look like? It means going over to abuelita’s house, your tio’s house, your cousin’s house, etc. and bullshitting over some carne asada, some beers, and really doing nothing with your life for a couple hours while you play loteria or talk gossip. See, for all the praise that “familia” gets, it really never amounts to anything. In fact, to an extent it’s actually pretty harmful at times.   When a family crisis presents itself, there is this expectation that all hands are on deck. Let’s say cousin Joey just got arrested for his second DUI. Joey doesn’t have any money for a lawyer, so there is this expectation that the familia will cough up the cash to help him pay for his legal costs. But you were saving your hard earned money for that future home renovation you were planning. So why should you have to suffer for cousin Joey’s stupidity? Well, because…familia. And when you’re in a similar crisis, like a DUI, the familia promises that cousin Joey will be there for you, too, no questions asked.   Except, as most promises of this nature go, you already know that cousin Joey has no money to his name and is never going to bail you out of whatever rut you might find yourself in. So you’re effectively guilt tripped into making a charitable donation to his legal defense knowing full well you’re never going to see that money back. And that’s basically what this concept endorses. La familia almost rewards laziness to a degree. It encourages you to set aside your plans, aspirations and goals if it means attending another family get together where you all eat food, get fat and do nothing except chill. So for all the alleged “cultural richness” that being Mexican is supposed to entail, it’s actually pretty hollow. Many Mexicans would benefit from realizing that they’re spinning their wheels investing so much time and resources into it when they could be doing something else more individually beneficial.	1643192988.0	sd2y3l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd2y3l/as_a_mexican_the_concept_of_la_familia_in_latin/	As a Mexican, the concept of “la familia” in Latin culture is overrated and, frankly, more harmful than helpful.

The monster eat a cat which in movie tropes makes it a bad guy, the female lead had a sex scene with a fish monster that was bordering on fetish and her artist friend was a sex fiend that was hitting on a kid half his age. If the kid from the diner was a girl, the old man would have been perceived as a discussing pervert. But because he’s gay, were expected to emphasize with him, even though the scene was bordering on paedophilia. And the rest of the characters were all just caricatures of people.  By the end of the movie I was hoping that Michael Shannon’s character would just kill the girl and the monster.	1643193411.0	sd321e	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd321e/the_shape_of_water_was_a_horrible_movie/	The shape of water was a horrible movie.

Also the US advising families to leave Kiev because of an imminent threat even though the Ukrainian government stating that the situation is nothing from the ordinary and that everybody should keep it cool.

Sure, JRE could get canceled after the contract is up, but I think even then they wouldn't do anything.  If 87  medical doctors ( 193 others to make 270) couldn't deplatform JRE, what makes you think Neil Young could?

I'm clearly abusing these animals because I don't worship the ground they walk on and because I call them assholes.  It's the same idea with kids.

hxb2lm9c	I hope no one attacks me after this! But I've come to a belief they just don't. I know that there is a difference between a p'do and a child molester, but essentially speaking a p'do will act. It sounds really illogical to say that there are p'dos who don't want to act, who haven't seen any illegal content and don't want to, and who are distressed. I may have understood it wrong - maybe they WANT to act but resist themselves, if that's what makes one then ignore everything I wrote and will write.  If you're attracted to someone, you feel happy thinking about whatever you're thinking about. You may feel guilt and shame but you don't feel anxious or bad about it. You just cannot be attracted to someone and be panicked, upset, and want nothing to do with that person. It leads me to thinking that ''non offenders'' are just people with POCD (a subtype of OCD - hence they are NOT p'dos but fear they are and are distressed by the idea).   I know this may sound controversial but think about it this way - a man/woman loves being around children because they've always been kind and caring, but they start thinking what if they are attracted. Whenever this idea comes up they are terrified, distressed and avoid anything to do with children. They never want to do anything, it doesn't seem pleasant to think about, don't want to search for illegal material, and feel sick at the idea. If they had a choice of being with an adult or a child, they would always pick the adult because the idea of being with a child is terrifying and makes them feel sick and anxious.  You just can't be a p''do and not feel the desire for it. If you don't want to do anything and the idea makes you fearful and distressed, then you just can't be one. If you are resisting some sort of impulses and genuinely are controlling yourself then yes that is different, but if you find the idea repulsive and then feel fear then you just cannot be one.	1643197824.0	sd474b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd474b/nonoffenders_dont_exist/	Non-offenders don't exist

I first discovered this as a teenager in an abusive household who got accused of, and physically punished for, “stealing” if I ever ate food without permission. So as a hungry teenager with growing pains in the middle of the night that could only be satisfied with food, I would sneak a couple slices of white bread from the deep freeze in the basement (my room was also in the basement, so it was safer than trying to sneak up to the kitchen) and it was amazing.

We get deluded into thinking life is sweet and responsibility doesn’t exist   We get abruptly thrown into adulthood which consists of working, a lot.   The dread we feel stems from the fact we spent 18 years doing nothing and thought life was a dream.   Those of us who had to work early to support parents flow seamlessly into this role without complaint.

I don’t care. If you just like laying in the warmth, if you just want to be tan, whatever. You don’t need to justify it. I used to use one myself. I even worked at a tanning salon.  But don’t be ridiculous with why it’s okay health-wise “for you”. You know it’s awful for you and there aren’t benefits that make it more healthy than risky.

bldmnte	Let me begin with this: I am a fourth child born into a narcissist household just above the poverty line. I am about to turn 30, and spent the last 10 years rewiring my brain from the psychological effects of being born into a family that did not validate my feelings, being guilted tripped for being unappreciative of being "gifted" the bare minimum, sexually assaulted due to neglect, etc, etc. It took me years to even recognize how bad it was, and it's not even being close to the worst cases out there.   Everyone hates government intervention. Citizens need to be autonomous within their government.  However, when children are born to families that don't have sufficient support (financial, social, and emotion support), these children have a higher chance of being involved in illegal activity, perpetuating the cycle of degeneracy. This causes more social services resources to be allocated and spread thin.   Couples that wish to have more than 3 children absolutely should, but not at the cost of the collective. Couples should demonstrate social and emotional intelligence, and financial stability. They can demonstrate to foster secure attachment style in their children. Couples that can't demonstrate this, sorry but there's only so much social services to go around.   Permitting wouldn't be difficult, just a basic interview with a social worker coming out and interviewing the children as well, seeing how children interact with parents, a financial review.   In closing, I have no idea how this would be enforced.	1643203167.0	sd5t38	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5t38/having_more_than_3_children_should_require_a/	Having more than 3 children should require a permit.

Most western countries criticize companies for child workers and often destroy companies reputations and income which leads to them shutting down. The child workers lose their jobs and go back to having no food or shelter and no means to support themselves or their family. People say that they can get an education but the sad reality is that in some countries educations is useless. If anything it’s better for them to start working at young age so that they save up enough so that the next generation may be able to do something with an education.	1643203270.0	sd5udj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5udj/child_workers_are_good/	Child workers are good

Selfishness is too much of a thing in MMORPGs nowadays as well though not sure how that can be solved unless you have players put into a predicament to group and do things together.

Would this be the same if it were a male who’d beaten his significant other and then committed suicide?

Trying to disperse anything (sauce, pieces of meat and vegetables) through them evenly while cooking is a nightmare, and eating them is a hassle too. Maybe they are ideal when using chopsticks (I don't know, I can barely pick up sushi), which would excuse the Asian varieties, but for a fork-knife-spoon, smaller, rounder shapes (penne, farfalle, dumplings, gnocchi...) are much better.

Stating that is not an opinion, it’s not an attack, it’s a scientifically proven fact.   I see a lot of people getting wound up because a healthcare professional has told them that breastmilk is healthier for babies than formula, be it a doctor, a midwife, a nurse, a dietician etc… and I don’t think they deserve to be slandered for saying it. It’s like them saying that getting your 5-a-day is best for your health, or 10,000+ steps a day is best for your health. They don’t mean that 3 a day is bad, or that they’re judging you for not getting those extra 2, or that 5000 steps is bad, they’re just presenting you with scientific facts.

b9upo8zj	So before anyone asks, no I’m not a furry and let me explain. So actually this occurs on Roblox of all places. My current avatar is a Doge with muscles and those ink things that go on your skin. (My post got deleted for mentioning the word smh) simply because I thought it was funny and it got a fair bit of attention in games. Occasionally however I would have people I have never interacted with walk up to me and say things like:  - Ew  - Gross a furry - You’re ####### sick  It never got to me because I knew that  these were quite possibly just little kids who haven’t learned everything yet, but I was actually interested in if this is how people react to a doge how would they react to an actual furry?  So i made a new account and went to the avatar shop. I bought a protogen mask, a mafia suit, a tail, and some rainbow antlers with Noob heads.   *Holy. shit.*  The amount of hate instantly went up to 11. My favorite example of this was how in a Murder Mystery 2 lobby a guy dressed up as an angel (not joking) comes running up to me. Keep in mind I haven’t said a single word in this lobby. This guy just starts shrieking at me. These are some of his direct quotes:  - ALL FURRIES ARE GAY WITH EACH OTHER! - THEY ARE ALL PEDOPHILES! - ALL FURRIES LIKE TO #### ANIMALS!  And my personal favorite:  - ALL FURRIES WHO HAVE PETS #### THEM!  😐  Needless to say I obviously tried to defend myself, but you can imagine he was having none of it. So I continued the experiment with that outfit for only a week and had a lot of hate thrown at me in multiple of Roblox’s most popular games.   Now obviously there’s a difference between things like jokes or memes, but in my experience it was just straight up toxicity.  I obviously do not support zoophiles, or online dating/nsfw roleplaying on Roblox, but if you see a furry just minding their own business either in game or irl please just leave them be.  And if you still think of them as disgusting, just walk away. Don’t try to “convince” them to stop by screaming at them please.   In my opinion they get enough hate as it is.	1643204968.0	sd6e7y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd6e7y/i_did_an_experiment_and_think_furries_get_way_to/	I did an experiment, and think Furries get WAY to much hate.

At the end of the day that’s a lot of food that people might want to eat, even if it doesn’t look exactly like the rest of the roll pieces, they are just as tasty. Just a waste of great food in my opinion.   At least give me the option to eat them. Sushi is expensive and usually unless you order a lot of rolls you are still a little hungry at the end, but not enough for a full roll.

ac3agw2y	I'm going to Mortuary School. My goal someday is to open an exclusively green funeral home and open my state's first and only natural burial cemetery.   Here's my issue with embalming. I understand that it has it's place in the world; corpses who have to travel long distances, corpses that are severely decomposed, ect. But to take a corpse and embalm it for **no reason** is so wrong to me. This adds hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to your bill. And it's completely unnecessary if you don't need it. Ice can preserve a body until it's needed for a service in the same way, and it doesn't make your loved one's corpse look like a horror show wax figurine.   Every unnecessarily embalmed body I've seen has instilled a kind of sadness in me. Why is it that we're doing this as a regular thing? Why is every funeral home doing this instead of only a select few offering this service? Why are we so obsessed with trying to make our loved ones appear to be asleep instead of accepting the reality of death?  When we die, we don't look like we're *asleep.* We look dead. And there's something that happens when we realize this; the grieving process changes when we accept this. It gets easier. We see that our loved one is gone. The person that was there is there no longer. When we accept that, it's easier to accept that they're gone.   I think if all funeral homes had green, no embalming options, this would save grieving families thousands of dollars, ultimately will save our planet, and help the grieving process exponentially.   Embalming has it's place: but it should be a rarity, not a common reality.  Whatever you decide to do with your future corpse is okay. I'm not here to judge you. As long as you're actively thinking about what you want done, I'm a happy camper.	1643208063.0	sd7h9c	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd7h9c/embalming_should_be_saved_for_rare_cases_not_the/	Embalming should be saved for rare cases, not the go to for all cases.

I get the idea that being self suficient is awesome, but 95% of people just can't do it, or don't have the will to, including me. I would hate growing my own food and doing that every day. Also no electricity if that happens. Which automatically implies no heat in the winter and no Air Conditioner in the summer.  No running water, no TV or Internet. Yeah, maybe you can live without those two, but you definitely can't live without the others. Oh, did I mention that criminality will literally skyrocket? Yeah, maybe in you city/country/neighbourhood the criminality rate is high already, but in the event of a societal collapse or something similar, it would be 1000 times higher. People will do anything to survive. Literally. We've had a very small glimpse of this in 2008-2009 financial crisis. Millions lost their jobs, couldn't pay rent or mortgage, could barely make ends meet and the criminality increased like crazy. I still remember that time in Europe, especially Eastern Europe car thefts and house break ins became very common. Almost daily you would see something like that on the news.   And don't even get me started on zombie apocalypse. People who wish it believe they will be like Tallahassee from Zombieland. Or like Daryl or Shane from The Walking Dead. No dude, you won't. Oh and did I mention no showers, no brushing your teeth, no healthcare of any kind, no meat (eventually animals would stop existing, and it would be sooner rather than later). Oh and good luck fighting zombies if you live in Europe, Australia or pretty much anywhere else besides America where almost nobody has any guns and you can't find any.  Yes the world has a lot of problems, but wishing for societal collapse or apocalypse is just what an idiot would say.

87uwqj6e	(This is my first time posting to reddit so sorry if I don’t know what I’m doing.)   Don’t get me wrong, they’re right about the history of these studies and many horrible acts did happen (just like in every study, look at psychology or anthropology.) However, many things have changed to make things modern and more sensitive to exploited groups.  To explain, mordern archeology is not grave robbing anymore and there are a number of laws and ethics they have to follow if they find anything. Many of them even work with the groups the artifacts belong to. .   I understand that many groups want they’re artifacts back and I’m by now means saying that museums shouldn’t face their past. So what I think is the best response to this is for museums to work with the groups of these artifacts and come with plans to properly store and preserve them. Who knows, maybe the group feel the artifact is safest in the museum or they want it placed in their own national museums.  Or, many museums have rotating/traveling exhibits so maybe they can create something like that and then more people from all around the world can learn about these cultures.	1643211965.0	sd8xk4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd8xk4/the_museums_are_full_of_stolen_artifacts_crowd/	The “museums are full of stolen artifacts” crowd doesn’t understand how modern museums/archeology works.
azuj214o	I’ve been seeing a lot of news lately about how the US is considering stationing troops in NATO countries within Eastern Europe & the Baltics, as well as the fact that they just gave NATO a full super carrier and accompanying strike group, for “training purposes”. This is the complete opposite of what the US should be doing. This will only make Europe think the US will come to their defense whenever shit hits the fan. We all know the US wants the EU improving their defense capabilities, so that they won’t need to rely on us as much, for literally everything. Not coming to their defense will force them to reevaluate their choices, and if they get whooped by a weak Russia, they will, more than likely, invest heavily into their defense. This isn’t the US’s war, we shouldn’t be getting involved, we shouldn’t be sending a single soldier, a single carrier, or plane, to defend Ukraine and the rest of Europe. Sending basic equipment and forcing sanctions is the most we should be doing. As every foreign country says “the US isn’t the world police”, so, let’s stop acting like we are, and fix the problems within our own borders.   TLDR: This isn’t the US’s war, Europe should be able to handle a weak Russia on its own, and if they can’t, they’ll learn something and invest into their defense. Unless Russia makes a direct threat to the US, we shouldn’t get involved.	1643212366.0	sd92s7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd92s7/the_us_should_use_this_ukraine_vs_russia_squabble/	The US should use this Ukraine vs Russia squabble as an opportunity to force the EU to finally increase their defense spending to a respectable level.

xwam0	There's this mentality that if you get a pet in any way other than adopting from a shelter or taking in a stray you are a bad person. I don't agree at all. A pet is an animal, a living thing that needs to be cared for whether it grew up being neglected or was bred for the purpose of becoming a pet.  I don't care if people want to make a living breeding pets of a certain breed so a person can have their perfect companion for a significant amount of time. It's a very substantial commitment, and the idea that taking on a pet has to be some selfless act of heroism where you save a pet from a shelter or take in a stray is rediculous.	1643212534.0	sd94zu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd94zu/theres_nothing_wrong_with_buying_a_purebred/	There's nothing wrong with buying a purebred animal instead of adopting.
dmmks76g	I have taken many psych classes in college and found them to be very interesting. I have also been to multiple therapists and the whole process is just mind-boggling. In the classes you learn that there is this desire to learn about behaviors and mental processes, so that we can better understand people and why they do things. We are basically taught that normal doesn't exactly exist. Anytime I have done therapy, or learned about specific therapies, it is always about altering yourself to fit in with others. It's like people who do screwed up and hurtful things will get told they are doing the best they can and get huge amounts of understanding. If you have a thought process or anything that doesn't fit the status quo, you aren't really given that sane understanding, you are just "forced" to do better for everybody else's sake.	1643212620.0	sd965y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd965y/psychology_merely_attempts_to_alter_a_person_to/	Psychology merely attempts to alter a person to fit in with others

I played through most of ocarina of time, twilight princess, and skyward sword, as well as dabbled in other games in the series. But besides a few outlying moments, I just couldn’t play for more than an hour at a time. I found it a chore to go through the dungeons and solve puzzles. I found the gameplay to be monotonous and too linear. The combat felt stale and uninspired. The only thing holding the game for me was the story, but the gameplay just wasn’t for me. I love breath of the wild, but I think anyone can agree it’s not a traditional zelda game. I like the exploration aspect of it, and the fact they scaled down the puzzles and dungeons a lot to make them more compact and less complex.

bblb6981	Everyone seems to want strips of bacon with their breakfast, but I think bacon as a side by itself  is underwhelming. Its great added to a burger, sure, but on its own bacon fails. It feels so one noteish. As a side meat, usually at breakfast, sausage in the form of links or patties is the superior option because its a delicate mix of meat and spices that work together and provide a complex flavor profile. Bacon is just bacon. Also its an overload to the taste buds when eating a stick of bacon on its own -- like taking a sledgehammer to the tongue. It should be subtle mixed with other flavors. I do love bacon, but only to improve the flavor of other foods. When you add the bacon to other foods it extends itself through those foods and leaves the taste buds satisfied and the brain becomes satiated. But when eating just a strip of bacon on its own it feels like its over so soon because its working on its own. This is why people always want more bacon. The fat is meant to carry flavor, but its arriving empty-handed, so we reach for more in compensation.	1643212830.0	sd999y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd999y/bacon_is_not_good_by_itself/	Bacon is not good by itself

People finger point at Mao for killing 10 million people during the Great Leap Forward when he ordered birds hunted down so they stop eating rice. Resulting in lotus infestations and famines. Stalin is similar with the Ukraine famine in the 30s. Although Stalin eventually did some more... direct things.  However, there are countless examples throughout history where capitalism “regimes” also implement some shit policy which results in the death in millions. Such as the bengal famine, as Churchill stopped sending food to the India. Or the Belgians murdering 10 million Congolese under Leopold, as those not farming enough were killed.  Don’t get me wrong, Churchill is a war hero, but western logic suggest Churchill is much of a genocider as Mao.

Third, we dissuade them from taking good paying trade jobs in construction, welding, electrician work, etc.  Not only that, it's almost like we convince them that those are dirty/lower-class jobs which are beneath them.

Some can’t - and exponentially more simply won’t - do those things, and that’s perfectly cool.
