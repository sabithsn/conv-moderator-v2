dumc9vay	Feel free to add if I missed any (I‚Äôm sure I did).  Canceling the Keystone pipeline, costing the U.S. thousands of jobs.  You still have kids in cages.  The gas prices keep getting higher.  A worker shortage created by yours truly.  No student loan forgiveness.  Continuation of the War in Syria.  The wall is still being built.  You have an even more massive crisis at the border.   China and Russia are laughing at our leadership.  No 2K stimulus checks ‚Äúimmediately.‚Äù  Even higher military spending than Trump.  A proposed 6 Trillion Dollar Infrastructure plan that would destroy our economy more than it would destroy poverty by plunging us even more into debt.  Not taking any Cuban refugees, and lying about what the Cubans are fighting for.   Lying about the Taliban ‚ÄúNot going to take over‚Äù.   Getting 13 servicemen and over a hundred Afghani civilians killed in a terrorist attack that could have been prevented if the withdraw was not pushed back.  A drone strike that killed children in Afghanistan.   American civilians are still trapped in Afghanistan and likely will be taken hostage.  Letting an entire arsenal of weapons be captured by the Taliban (Including planes and helicopters).   Biden lied about saving Americans from evictions with a 1.9 trillion dollar rescue plan. Biden sat back and let the evictions happen.  Running on a campaign promise to ‚Äúcure cancer‚Äù but not a single word during his presidency was spoken about it.  An inflation crisis caused by this idiotic fool, and his dumbass economic choices.  Build Back Better being so radical, it gets blocked by senator Joe Manchin, who was initially for the plan.  More people died from COVID in a year under Biden, than a year under Trump.   Running on the campaign promise to fight and defeat COVID-19 with the government, but in the end, gives up and says the government can‚Äôt do anything about it.  An election bill so radical it gets struck down.  Attempting to remove the filibuster, again getting struck down because of how ridiculous it was.	1643148112.0	scp50w	/r/Conservative/comments/scp50w/list_of_current_biden_failures/	List of current Biden failures.

bj8w2wtu	This is in response to a post on the front page about Ruby Rose, and insinuated the average American doesn‚Äôt know her.  I was educated about her mistreatment well over a decade before ‚ÄúCritical Race Theory‚Äù was trending. No, this wasn‚Äôt in some prestigious private school. It was a in a public school in the state that was the second worst in education.   I also learned about Jim Crowe laws, the Little Rock 9 and other injustices this country has caused.   I learned about internment camps during WWII, treatment of the Chinese people during the gold rush, and the trail of tears.  Almost every major point of shameful mistreatment in American history was put on full display for me in my shitty little public school.   So my question is what new concept can CRT possibly teach, other than warping what is presented and how we feel about ourselves and others? And I have to say, it already made everyone feel shitty, there wasn‚Äôt some nice clean spin on it that made everything seem okay.	1643208009.0	sd7gl2	/r/Conservative/comments/sd7gl2/15_years_ago_i_was_going_to_a_public_school_in/	15 years ago I was going to a public school in Nevada (2nd worst in education at the time) and I learned about everything from slavery to the Little Rock 9. CRT can‚Äôt possibly teach anything new about history, other than severely warping our perception of it.
