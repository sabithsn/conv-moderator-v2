2nmd6kpc	There seems to be a trope in older American literature targeted at boys about finding arrow heads. It seems like the Hardy Boys, Encyclopedia Brown, Tom Sawyer and their ilk were forever stumbling upon Native American arrow heads.  This seems to have lead to actual children running around in the 20th century (at least that's when I was doing it) finding arrowheads. We regularly also found all kinds of fossils.  In retrospect I think a lot of the "arrowheads" were actually just vaguely triangular rocks and a lot of the "fossils" were just things that looked like some animal part if you squinted at them hard enough.  Do we have any sense of how many of these "finds" are real? Do we have some estimate of how many of these things are out there to find in a given place and a given time? I would expect that over time there are fewer of them and that some areas get picked clean faster than others (like summer camps).	1642704790.0	s8q3ko	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8q3ko/were_20th_century_children_actually_able_to_find/	Were 20th century children actually able to find arrowheads and fossils?

Is this just the value of hindsight or is there anything I'm missing that makes this decision make sense at the time?	1642707298.0	s8r0wm	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r0wm/was_pearl_harbor_in_any_way_a_good_decision_for/	Was Pearl Harbor in any way a good decision for the Japanese?

5xg8z09e	I am unsure whether my understanding of sexual violence during warfare (particularly medieval) is correct or blurred by the entertainment I have consumed. I would like some clarity. Many depictions of war in entertainment formats (whether books, video games or tv shows) often make sexual violence a commonality in wartime (particularly in more historic settings).   Sexual violence is often depicted as commonplace and something which inevitably occurs as a consequence of war. Particularly graphic representations I have seen are the mass of references in the fantasy game of thrones books but also more historically based entertainment such as the vikings tv show.  My question is ‘just how common was sexual violence’ and how accurate are the depictions we see in media, is the presumption of permanent sexual violence in wartime a tv trope or does it have historic truth? If it is truth, why?  I am not asking for examples or occurrences. I understand these things happen. My question is more why it was so commonplace in older times (if it indeed was). Modern examples I can think of seem to have at least some reason or logic behind them (even if the reasoning is incredibly sick and twisted). Horrors such as Nanking have a (again, sick) reasoning behind the violence (the Japanese brainwashing troops with a sense of racial superiority). Same as the soviet attack on Berlin (based largely on revenge) and in Rwanda (as a weapon against a scapegoated community - Apologies if i'm wrong my knowledge is poor on this topic). These are all horrible but notably stand out and are known as horrific exceptions (I think). We know about the perpetrators, the victims and the reasons people could bring themselves to do such things.   In medieval entertainment however sexual violence seems to happen every time possible. Surely every single medieval soldier was not eagerly anticipating their first chance to perpetrate sexual violence and then able to comfortably live with themselves and their families afterwards? Also if it was the case, why was this violence accepted so? Pillaging a settlement and then exterminating the entire populous wasn’t a guaranteed norm (I know it happens, but not every time). The saying is not pillage and paedophilia, so why was sexual violence to women seemingly so standardly accepted?  The story of Boudica comes to mind. According to Simon Schama, revenge for sexual violence to her daughters was a motivating factor in her rebellion against the Romans (a history of britain, ep1: Beginnings). Wouldn’t a sexually violated conquered populous be all the harder to control and less likely to accept their new rulers (therefore making it a politically bad decision too)?	1642707662.0	s8r5r2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5r2/sexual_violence_in_wartime_depictions_in/	Sexual violence in wartime; depictions in entertainment vs reality.

p1eac	I've heard the argument (though I can't remember where) that Nazi Lebensraum ideology grew out of the fear of fertilizer shortage at the beginning of the century.  Goes something like this: The world is running out of nitrogen deposits for fertilizer and without it crop yields will drop significantly, so it can't support the current population. This is an us or them situation, so we have to conquer the land of our neighbors and exterminate them. Otherwise we will either starve or be conquered/exterminated ourselves.  To make this horrible rationale more palatable, we add a bunch of racism, so we can tell ourselves that we deserve to survive more than others.  Nitrogen shortage wasn't an issue anymore with the invention of the Haber Bosch process even before WWI began, but the far right had already internalized that thinking without really knowing/caring where it came from.

nxnq6	As far as I've been able to discern, all the major "last stop" towns—that is Calgary, Helena, Cheyenne, Denver & Pueblo in the east, and Spokane, Boise, Ogden/SLC & Albuquerque in the west—were roughly following parallel economic trajectories into the beginning of the 20th century. I can see why Denver gobbled up Cheyenne & Pueblo, (more direct route from Kansas City, plus federal favouritism, as in the Denver Mint) and why Great Falls & Kalispell stayed small, (Great Northern got a late start) but I haven't been able to figure out why Helena stayed so tiny. The best I've been able to find is that there was some pretty vicious racism in Montana at the turn of the century, which drove out all the black residents, but I have difficulty believing that that was unique to Montana.

em3he	In the 1997 poem [*Five Ways to Kill a Man*](https://poetryarchive.org/poem/five-ways-kill-man/), Brock proposes four cumbersome ways to kill a man in chronological order:  1. "make him carry a plank of wood/...and nail him to it." 2. "take a length of steel/.../and attempt to pierce the metal cage he wears" 3. "blow gas at him" 4. "fly/miles above your victim and dispose of him by/pressing one small switch"  And at the end he suggests a "simpler", "direct", and "neat[er]" way: "to see that he is living somewhere in the middle/of the twentieth century, and leave him there". Was the postwar mid-twentieth century truly the deadliest time in history for the average person? Even compared to being an early Christian in the Roman Empire/a knight in the Wars of the Roses/an infantry in the Somme/a civilian in Coventry/Dresden/Chungking/Hiroshima?

bsq2c	Seneca the Younger's De Ira offers extensive advice on preventing and dealing with anger. It is written as a letter addressed to his (brother?) but I assume this is just the typical ancient literary conceit that formulates publications as sort of open letter disguised as a private one.  Did Romans in Seneca's time perceive their era as being more angry than in the past? Were the reigns of Tiberius through Nero characterized as particularly angry and burdened by the kind of poor decision making that comes with anger (for two of emperors in that time period I think I can guess the answer)?

(Or otherwise tried to interfere in the other countries affairs?)   Did they have one court with nobles from both countries, or did they keep separate courts? Did they have separate or joint advisors? Was there tension there?   How did they choose which country to live in?  Did they split their time between countries? Did they live together or apart?  How was their union perceived? Men were seen as the headships during that time period, but Isabella was queen in her own right- how did that affect their relationship?

9f8xwa3p	[The colonial census of 1792](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain#Demographics), according to wikipedia, showed that Indians were 51-61% of the population of New Spain, while Mestizos were 21-25% and Europeans (whether peninsulares or criollos) 18-22%. I believe this excludes Central America. Interestingly there are several states with strong Indian majorities, including Puebla, Veracruz, Tlaxcala, Mexico (which included Guerrero, Morelos, Queretaro and Hidalgo at the time), in addition to Oaxaca and Yucatan which are still majority-Indian today. Even then, every state except Nuevo Leon has a large Indian population even if not the majority.  Contrast this to modern day Mexico where Indians are 21.5% of the population according to the census, and I believe has been majority mestizo since at least the early 1900s. I do know the basics about how independent Mexico adopted mestizo nationalism as a way to homogenize the country and create a national identity, as well as about colonial-era race relations, how Indians typically dominated in the countryside of the core areas of the Spanish Main.  **My question is, how exactly did this massive demographic shift take place between 1812 and 1900?** To what extent is it attributable to immigration, variable birth rates/life expectancy for different groups, and/or simple assimilation of Indians? Does it reflect an actual shift where Mexico got that much more European in descent, or mainly a phenomenon of people swapping out traditional cultural identity for ? What were the causes behind these reasons? When exactly did major shifts occur, and did it always correspond to language shift? When did Spanish become the main spoken language or the spoken lingua franca for the masses?  If you have research for further reading, that would be great.  I'd also be interested to learn about pretty much the same question in other Latin American countries - specifically Peru, Ecuador, (eastern) Bolivia, Central America, and Colombia. [Handbook of South American Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook_of_South_American_Indians) includes some Peruvian census data for the independence era that listed a strong majority for Indians for at least most of the 1800s. I also recall reading somewhere that Colombia was about 50% Indian up until independence.

52o21	To follow up on a question that was asked about the attack on Pearl Harbor being a "bad decision," I'm curious why the desire to drag the United States into the war was a goal.  If I understand the timeline correctly, Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940, and the next major move against the "Western" powers with to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, declaring war on the United States and Great Britain, followed by declarations of war against Japan by the US, UK, Canada, Netherlands, China and Australia... THEN Japan attacked Malaya, Singapore, Burma, etc.  So my question is: Why was tipping the USA's hand and pushing them into the war so important, when Japan could have arguably gained a substantial foothold on mainland Asia by focusing on taking full possession of French and Dutch colonial possessions while they were occupied by Germany? Was there a "hawkish" voice in Japanese military policy that advocated expansion, but only against relatively weak players in the region?	1642729690.0	s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/	Why didn't Japan simply continue "colonizing" Southeast Asia instead of attacking Pearl Harbor?

2nmd6kpc	There seems to be a trope in older American literature targeted at boys about finding arrow heads. It seems like the Hardy Boys, Encyclopedia Brown, Tom Sawyer and their ilk were forever stumbling upon Native American arrow heads.  This seems to have lead to actual children running around in the 20th century (at least that's when I was doing it) finding arrowheads. We regularly also found all kinds of fossils.  In retrospect I think a lot of the "arrowheads" were actually just vaguely triangular rocks and a lot of the "fossils" were just things that looked like some animal part if you squinted at them hard enough.  Do we have any sense of how many of these "finds" are real? Do we have some estimate of how many of these things are out there to find in a given place and a given time? I would expect that over time there are fewer of them and that some areas get picked clean faster than others (like summer camps).	1642704790.0	s8q3ko	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8q3ko/were_20th_century_children_actually_able_to_find/	Were 20th century children actually able to find arrowheads and fossils?

5xg8z09e	I am unsure whether my understanding of sexual violence during warfare (particularly medieval) is correct or blurred by the entertainment I have consumed. I would like some clarity. Many depictions of war in entertainment formats (whether books, video games or tv shows) often make sexual violence a commonality in wartime (particularly in more historic settings).   Sexual violence is often depicted as commonplace and something which inevitably occurs as a consequence of war. Particularly graphic representations I have seen are the mass of references in the fantasy game of thrones books but also more historically based entertainment such as the vikings tv show.  My question is ‘just how common was sexual violence’ and how accurate are the depictions we see in media, is the presumption of permanent sexual violence in wartime a tv trope or does it have historic truth? If it is truth, why?  I am not asking for examples or occurrences. I understand these things happen. My question is more why it was so commonplace in older times (if it indeed was). Modern examples I can think of seem to have at least some reason or logic behind them (even if the reasoning is incredibly sick and twisted). Horrors such as Nanking have a (again, sick) reasoning behind the violence (the Japanese brainwashing troops with a sense of racial superiority). Same as the soviet attack on Berlin (based largely on revenge) and in Rwanda (as a weapon against a scapegoated community - Apologies if i'm wrong my knowledge is poor on this topic). These are all horrible but notably stand out and are known as horrific exceptions (I think). We know about the perpetrators, the victims and the reasons people could bring themselves to do such things.   In medieval entertainment however sexual violence seems to happen every time possible. Surely every single medieval soldier was not eagerly anticipating their first chance to perpetrate sexual violence and then able to comfortably live with themselves and their families afterwards? Also if it was the case, why was this violence accepted so? Pillaging a settlement and then exterminating the entire populous wasn’t a guaranteed norm (I know it happens, but not every time). The saying is not pillage and paedophilia, so why was sexual violence to women seemingly so standardly accepted?  The story of Boudica comes to mind. According to Simon Schama, revenge for sexual violence to her daughters was a motivating factor in her rebellion against the Romans (a history of britain, ep1: Beginnings). Wouldn’t a sexually violated conquered populous be all the harder to control and less likely to accept their new rulers (therefore making it a politically bad decision too)?	1642707662.0	s8r5r2	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8r5r2/sexual_violence_in_wartime_depictions_in/	Sexual violence in wartime; depictions in entertainment vs reality.

p1eac	I've heard the argument (though I can't remember where) that Nazi Lebensraum ideology grew out of the fear of fertilizer shortage at the beginning of the century.  Goes something like this: The world is running out of nitrogen deposits for fertilizer and without it crop yields will drop significantly, so it can't support the current population. This is an us or them situation, so we have to conquer the land of our neighbors and exterminate them. Otherwise we will either starve or be conquered/exterminated ourselves.  To make this horrible rationale more palatable, we add a bunch of racism, so we can tell ourselves that we deserve to survive more than others.  Nitrogen shortage wasn't an issue anymore with the invention of the Haber Bosch process even before WWI began, but the far right had already internalized that thinking without really knowing/caring where it came from.

nxnq6	As far as I've been able to discern, all the major "last stop" towns—that is Calgary, Helena, Cheyenne, Denver & Pueblo in the east, and Spokane, Boise, Ogden/SLC & Albuquerque in the west—were roughly following parallel economic trajectories into the beginning of the 20th century. I can see why Denver gobbled up Cheyenne & Pueblo, (more direct route from Kansas City, plus federal favouritism, as in the Denver Mint) and why Great Falls & Kalispell stayed small, (Great Northern got a late start) but I haven't been able to figure out why Helena stayed so tiny.

em3he	In the 1997 poem [*Five Ways to Kill a Man*](https://poetryarchive.org/poem/five-ways-kill-man/), Brock proposes four cumbersome ways to kill a man in chronological order:  1.

"fly/miles above your victim and dispose of him by/pressing one small switch"  And at the end he suggests a "simpler", "direct", and "neat[er]" way: "to see that he is living somewhere in the middle/of the twentieth century, and leave him there". Was the postwar mid-twentieth century truly the deadliest time in history for the average person?

9f8xwa3p	[The colonial census of 1792](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Spain#Demographics), according to wikipedia, showed that Indians were 51-61% of the population of New Spain, while Mestizos were 21-25% and Europeans (whether peninsulares or criollos) 18-22%. I believe this excludes Central America. Interestingly there are several states with strong Indian majorities, including Puebla, Veracruz, Tlaxcala, Mexico (which included Guerrero, Morelos, Queretaro and Hidalgo at the time), in addition to Oaxaca and Yucatan which are still majority-Indian today. Even then, every state except Nuevo Leon has a large Indian population even if not the majority.  Contrast this to modern day Mexico where Indians are 21.5% of the population according to the census, and I believe has been majority mestizo since at least the early 1900s. I do know the basics about how independent Mexico adopted mestizo nationalism as a way to homogenize the country and create a national identity, as well as about colonial-era race relations, how Indians typically dominated in the countryside of the core areas of the Spanish Main.  **My question is, how exactly did this massive demographic shift take place between 1812 and 1900?** To what extent is it attributable to immigration, variable birth rates/life expectancy for different groups, and/or simple assimilation of Indians? Does it reflect an actual shift where Mexico got that much more European in descent, or mainly a phenomenon of people swapping out traditional cultural identity for ? What were the causes behind these reasons? When exactly did major shifts occur, and did it always correspond to language shift? When did Spanish become the main spoken language or the spoken lingua franca for the masses?  If you have research for further reading, that would be great.  I'd also be interested to learn about pretty much the same question in other Latin American countries - specifically Peru, Ecuador, (eastern) Bolivia, Central America, and Colombia. [Handbook of South American Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handbook_of_South_American_Indians) includes some Peruvian census data for the independence era that listed a strong majority for Indians for at least most of the 1800s.

52o21	To follow up on a question that was asked about the attack on Pearl Harbor being a "bad decision," I'm curious why the desire to drag the United States into the war was a goal.  If I understand the timeline correctly, Japan invaded French Indochina in September 1940, and the next major move against the "Western" powers with to attack Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941, declaring war on the United States and Great Britain, followed by declarations of war against Japan by the US, UK, Canada, Netherlands, China and Australia... THEN Japan attacked Malaya, Singapore, Burma, etc.  So my question is: Why was tipping the USA's hand and pushing them into the war so important, when Japan could have arguably gained a substantial foothold on mainland Asia by focusing on taking full possession of French and Dutch colonial possessions while they were occupied by Germany? Was there a "hawkish" voice in Japanese military policy that advocated expansion, but only against relatively weak players in the region?	1642729690.0	s8yukr	/r/AskHistorians/comments/s8yukr/why_didnt_japan_simply_continue_colonizing/	Why didn't Japan simply continue "colonizing" Southeast Asia instead of attacking Pearl Harbor?

In an old collection of Robin Hood tales I read, the King of England once prayed to St. Thomas for Robin to miss in the royal archery competition and offered 4 loads (bundles? Bushels?) of “fat candles” for the priory of such and such if he did.  Other times, I see or read a castle being fully lit with candles on every surface, and that seems unlikely if they’re a luxury.  Moreover, in a world before electric lighting, any work being done after dark would need candles, so they must have been fairly common.

What led pearls to be so popular for wedding jewelry? Is there specific symbolism of pearls for brides, or was it a "It's what everyone is doing" influence? Pearls used to be one of the most valuable and socially restricted gemstones, so was there simply a greater supply of pearls through manufacturing or international trade, especially after World War II?

The 116th regiment finally arrived at Pointe du Hoc in the early morning of June 8th.  &nbsp;  Apart from the USS BARTON attempt, I have the impression that no other reinforcement attempt has been made from the sea.

So I'm also quite open to learning about how things were done in East Asia more broadly, especially in a sporting context.

So a more specific question is, did the political leaders that started the American revolution feel that it was winnable, hence a reason for revolution, as opposed to taxes and self-governance being the reason?

737p5	There was a comment in an AskReddit thread suggesting that the invention of zero led to significant cultural advancement, but I'm curious what the actual tangible consequences were beyond just mathematics (business, economics, etc).  A couple supplementary questions...  To what extent did ancient civilizations understand the concept of zero? Was it simply that the number had not been Incorporated into mathematics, or was it not even a linguistic concept?  What were the mathematical consequences of using zero? What advancements were allowed to be made after its incorporation, and how did earlier mathematicians get around the lack of zero beforehand?  Did the use of zero lead to any tangential impacts within society (finance, agriculture, etc)? Was its use really responsible for a period of rapid advancement afterwards?

They decided against the plan for multiple reasons. For example, some feared an assassination could lead to a new lost cause myth and keep the Nazi ideology going.

inwqd	Here's a good example from "Traces on the Rhodian Shore":  >The idea that there is a continuous interaction between man and his environment—man changing it and being influenced by it—also has its mythological antecedents, but its full development belongs basically, I think, to rational thought, because such a conception requires a sense of history. The Sumerian thought the civilization of which he was a part—its institutions, cities, towns, farms, and so on—had been more or less the same from the beginning  And from Kramer's "Sumerian Historiography":  >That Sumer had once been desolate marshland with but few scattered settlements, (...) —such thoughts probably never occurred even to the most learned of the Sumerian sages.  I must admit I am very skeptical of this statement. Obviously, the ancient world did not have the rapid-fire change we're experiencing now, but surely cities rose and fell, environmental disasters must have displaced people, foreigners introduced new pantheons and people would have a sense lots of stuff happened within their lifetimes.

There's also this idea (in the most radical feminism) that being “natural” aka not using any makeup or adorning oneself, not shaving, etc. is a form of fighting against “the patriarchal system”. However, it is my understanding that what we view as “natural” is a social construct as well.  Thank you so much.

We can also think about migrations like the Huns or the Turks which go from east Asia to Europe. And so what is unique about the modern term Globalization? Could it be argued that there is no point in which we get Globalization but rather global trade just kept increasing over time but was always there? Of course there are moments like the European discovery of america in which global trade dramatically increase, but I always get a sense that when people talk about Globalization they refer to something very modern rather than something that has existed for a long time on some level.	1643080785.0	sc3qwx	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc3qwx/what_do_historians_mean_when_they_say/	What do historians mean when they say Globalization?

ezqmix0j	Content warning: violence against women, mentions of rape and abduction   In the *Star Trek: Deep Space 9*, the dynamics of a colonial empire and its conquered subjects are heavily explored in the Cardassians and Bajorans, respectively. In the episode "Wrongs Darker than Death or Night," the Bajoran officer Major Kira consults a religious icon which shows her a vision of the past, which shows her mother being taken by Gul Dukat, the colonial administrator, to the space station in orbit of Bajor. While there, she is taken from her family and forced to become a "comfort woman" for him.   Over time, she develops feelings for Dukat, which upsets and angers Kira, who had believed she died when she was very young. She sees her as betraying her family and her people for having some feelings for Dukat, who treats her with kindness. Other Bajorans also see her and the other comfort women as collaborators, and view them with almost the same distaste as they do for the Bajoran overseer Basso.  This prompted the question to me: is this how people saw the comfort women of Korea during Japanese occupation? To me, it seems clear cut that these women were victims of heinous acts of rape and abduction, but were contemporaries less sympathetic? To what degree were they seen as on the side of the Japanese?

50kfw5hs	After the death of King You of Zhou in 771 BC, the Zhou dynasty entered a period where two individuals claimed sovereignty. Yijiu, the exiled crown prince, later recorded as King Ping, and Yuchen, the brother of King You, later recorded as King Xie. This stalemate ended when King Xie got killed in 750 BC.  However, King Xie was not mentioned by Sima Qian in his writings. This seems pretty weird to me, since King Xie was mentioned once in Zuo Zhuan, which Sima Qian knew and used.  He probably also had a lot of sources that we don’t have today, since he can provide the genealogy of the kings of Shang dynasty, the dynasty before the Zhou, with good accuracy. Besides, he was able to establish a year-by-year chronology back to Gonghe regency (841 BC). Thus, I believe it is safe for me to assume he should also have records about the late Western Zhou dynasty.  So, is there any consensus of historians on why Sima Qian did not mention him in his work? Did this occur by accident, or on purpose? If by accident, why the records of Shang survived better than the records of Zhou? If on purpose, why did he decide to omit him?	1643085370.0	sc57sq	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc57sq/why_king_xie_of_zhou_is_not_mentioned_in_shiji/	Why King Xie of Zhou is not mentioned in Shiji?

h3efk	From the second chapter of *The Dawn of Everything*, David Graeber and David Wengrow examine the influence of missionary accounts and travel journals, detailing long exchanges with Native American interlocutors, including Native American critiques of European society, on European notions of social equality. But, they maintain, intellectual historians reject these accounts as the European authors inserting their own ideas into the mouths of Native Americans.   >Many influential Enlightenment thinkers did in fact claim that some of their ideas on the subject were directly taken from Native American sources – even though, predictably, intellectual historians today insist this cannot really be the case. Indigenous people are assumed to have lived in a completely different universe, inhabited a different reality, even; anything Europeans said about them was simply a shadow-play projection, fantasies of the ‘noble savage’ culled from the European tradition itself.4  Here they reference: Chinard, Gilbert 1913; Healy, George R 1958; Berkhofer, Robert 1978a, 1978b; Dickason, Olive Patricia 1984; McGregor, Gaile 1988; Cro, Stelio 1990; Pagden, Anthony 1993; Sayre, Gordon 1997; Franks, C.E.S. 2002. Later they go on (emphasis mine):  >What makes this especially odd is that no one denies that many European explorers, missionaries, traders, settlers and others who sojourned on American shores spent years learning native languages and perfecting their skills in conversation with native speakers; just as indigenous Americans did the work of learning Spanish, English, Dutch or French. Neither, we think, would anyone who has ever learned a truly alien language deny that doing so takes a great deal of imaginative work, trying to grasp unfamiliar concepts. We also know that missionaries typically conducted long philosophical debates as part of their professional duties; many others, on both sides, argued with one another either out of simple curiosity, or because they had immediate practical reasons to understand the other’s point of view. Finally, no one would deny that travel literature, and missionary relations – which often contained summaries of, or even extracts from, these exchanges – were popular literary genres, avidly followed by educated Europeans. Any middle-class household in eighteenth-century Amsterdam or Grenoble would have been likely to have on its shelves at the very least a copy of the Jesuit Relations of New France (as France’s North American colonies were then known), and one or two accounts written by voyagers to faraway lands. Such books were appreciated largely because they contained surprising and unprecedented ideas.10   >   >**Historians are aware of all this. Yet the overwhelming majority still conclude that even when European authors explicitly say they are borrowing ideas, concepts and arguments from indigenous thinkers, one should not take them seriously. It’s all just supposed to be some kind of misunderstanding, fabrication, or at best a naive projection of pre-existing European ideas.** \[Indigenous\] American intellectuals, when they appear in European accounts, are assumed to be mere representatives of some Western archetype of the ‘noble savage’ or sock-puppets, used as plausible alibis to an author who might otherwise get into trouble for presenting subversive ideas (deism, for example, or rational materialism, or unconventional views on marriage).11  My question is, are these views representative of modern, mainstream intellectual historians, or have Graeber and Wengrow cherry-picked (or been over-reliant on dated histories) in order to form this view? Have we seen a shift away from this with intellectual histories such as JL Heilbron's *Galileo*, which strive to relocate their subjects in a social and cultural context and therefore sidestep these pitfalls? Or is the historical consensus still that these Native American speakers were all sockpuppets after all?	1643095856.0	sc83z4	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sc83z4/graeber_wengrows_contend_that_intellectual/	Graeber & Wengrow's contend that intellectual historians reject the influence of Native American intellectuals on Enlightenment ideas of equality and egality.

a116cfrx	Hello! I'm trying to do research on Sengoku Japan's (specifically 1500s) daily life. Food, clothing, housing, what materials were available, and what jobs were available outside of samurai. Things along that vein.   I'm having trouble finding good information on much of it.   Specifically, I'd like to know about laundry. I understand hemp clothing was primarily worn by peasants v the silk used in the aristocracy. It is my understanding that cotton was limited at the time.   How did they do laundry? Was there different care for silks v hemp clothing? How often? I assume that daimyos had laundry people and the lowest did it themselves, but what of anyone who fell in between? Did they have soaps? What were they made of? Did they make them themselves or were there soapmakers?   I've been able to find this sort of information fairly easily for Europe of the same/ similar time period, but when I specifically look for Japan or especially the sengoku period it becomes difficult. Edo is a bit more abundant. How inaccurate would it likely be to assume mid 1600s information was still fairly accurate 100 years prior?   Any help at all would be appreciated!

91avc	I read [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/evmbec/for_a_country_that_had_a_huge_empire_and_access/) which pointed to rationing as a reason for the blandness of British food.  Also [this answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/n3ta3x/comment/gwtujdd/) which suggested that the working class never had access to a wide range of spices.  But it's hard for me to understand these answers - I am currently living in Vietnam. Vietnam has a long, and recent, history of war and rationing, yet also has quite a famous food culture.   Exotic spices and expensive ingredients are not required to make good food, techniques and cultural knowledge passed down seem equally important.  One distinctive part of Vietnamese food culture is significant use of herbs. I don't have a link, but I remember reading another answer that said that using wild herbs was also common in European cooking, in the past (and the present?).  Could it be related to early industrialisation, people moving from their communities and losing knowledge about plants? Working more and having less time to cook and pass down cooking to their children? Of course these reasons would equally apply to other industrialised parts of Europe which aren't as famous for eating boiled veg and meat, so I'm a bit stuck.	1643107226.0	scatsz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scatsz/is_british_foods_perceived_blandness_really_due/	Is British foods' (perceived) blandness really due to rationing?

2gmaob93	In some medieval/fantasy works while the PoV being a sneaky-peaky guy (Assassin, thief, robinhood-style outlaw.etc) sneaking into (or sometimes escape from) a hostile city or a castle of the evil lord, they'll encounter well-equipped, well-armoured (sometimes with enclosed helmet), sometimes even crossbow-equipped guards, rather alone, paired or in a formation, who are either[patroling the inner corridors of the castle](https://youtu.be/f7iCUyAd8ig?t=104) (**rather than outer walls**),[city streets](https://youtu.be/rqtYA7-oyFM), or [being spawned](https://youtu.be/a3nCRT6cm14?t=27) everytime someone cries for "GUUUUUARRRRRRRRRD" and shooting the protagonist like it was a gunfight but with crossbows.  Though there sure will be fully-equipped guards standing at fixed positions or patrolling the outer walls, but are those tropes above have reality basis? As i imagined that due to a mostly-peaceful environment that these guards (if there're any) was facing and lower paygrade they had, won't they be less equipped and less trained, or only wears full-armour when a full-out invasion is imminent? Not to mention specific equipments including **spears, pavise and crossbows**, are they really nessesary to equip such weaponry while you're just patroling the castle corridor or a calm night city street during a mostly peaceful circumstances? Are there real-life examples of someone did infiltrated into some castle and fought a fierce indoor fight with fully armoured guards?  What about the well-known trope of **"Prison Guards"**? Are they well-equipped and fully armoured too, just to watch over some inmates with poor health?

5g06v	With inflation all over the news, I’ve been wondering how the current rate of inflation compares to estimated rates from hundreds or even thousands of years ago. I assume there are limitations to how this could be estimated, but would think one could put a finger to the wind and estimate annual CPI for any historical society with a monetary currency, and written records of the value of a given basket of goods.  I understand that there have been four main periods since CPI was first recorded in 1913 where it rose more than 5% annually. It seems to align (at least in the US) with periods of war or great uncertainty.   Couldn’t find any studies looking at estimated CPI figures since the dawn of mankind, but given what a hot topic it is these days, I’m curious to learn how we’re actually tracking compared to century-long averages, if such a thing exists.	1643113302.0	scchc6	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scchc6/how_do_average_rates_of_inflation_over_the_past/	How do average rates of inflation over the past century compare to those of the past 1000 years?

9j13ju35	Hello historians, TL;DR at the bottom. I'm curious to know if any evidence exists of a slavic language before old church slavonic became widespread among the various slavic tribes/nations.  My understanding is that what the slavs spoke before old church slavonic is widely unknown to us. We have a reconstructed language in proto-slavic that is based on the proto-indo-european language but what is the evidence that supports this? I'm looking for sources to read.   My belief so far, based on my research, is that it's highly unlikely that the slavs all spoke one language up until the creation of old church slavonic. In other words, old church slavonic is the universal slavic language but, before that it's unlikely that all slavs spoke the same tongue.  Also, my understanding of old church slavonic is that it was not just an alphabet, but a language based on the dialects of slavs living near Macedonia possibly due to their proximity of the orthodox church and the saints cyril and methodus who created the language.  TL;DR- Is there any writing, historical accounts or other hard evidence that supports a universal slavic language before old church slavonic? Or was old church slavonic the reason why modern slavic languages share close similarities?	1643115426.0	scd476	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scd476/evidence_of_slavic_languages_before_old_church/	Evidence of slavic language(s) before old church slavonic?

And women are depicted as having unofficial power coming from their place in a social network, not a legal structure.

entu2nn7	 I have no experience in historical research and I am looking to explore the prosecution of LGBT people in the military. I am aware of some instances of a subculture that allowed homosexuality however I keep reading about supposed punishments and such although there are no sources listed at all.  What I'm looking for are primary sources and possible secondary source books and studies. I would also like to find some primary sources myself however I don't know where to start. I have tried to look in court martial records in The National Archives but they are really a giant spreadsheet with no specific laws broken (I suppose indecency can mean anything). I would also like to know what specific laws were people breaking by being gay etc at the time period with sources and records if these were carried through to the military also.  I would also consider interviewing for first hand accounts but I cannot fathom how I would collect them.  I have limited access to sources as I cannot afford to pay for any. I can access local (South England) and The (British) National Archives in person.

ajdl30e8	This question can be broken down to two parts:  1. When writing a proposal for a PhD, where do hypotheses as to what could be something new come from? I know this is a philosophical question, but how does one know ahead of serious reading and researching which research question(s) or framework could lead to novel findings or novel perspectives? (Novelty being an essential element of a PhD)  2. Having started a PhD in a particular region/period/focus, how does one go about finding something new (or finding out that there is not something new)? The best advice I have found so far (which was very counterintuitive to me) was to read the literature on the subject in a reverse chronological order to assess the state of what is known and identify what could be missing. Assuming that is done, how does one know that the gap could be filled with a few years' worth of research?  I realise that I am asking in other words: how does one systematically deal with uncertainty and mitigate the possibility of not finding anything new or having anything new to say, but I would appreciate any thoughts on this.  Of course, the honest option to quit the PhD once having concluded that nothing new can be said about said region/period/focus is there as well.	1643139744.0	scm1uv	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scm1uv/how_does_one_go_about_finding_something_new_in/	How does one go about finding something new in history?

6la8cg73	During the 60's, rock n roll went to become insanely popular, however it was a lot of British acts that made it go mainstream and innovated on it in the early years, before 1967 (hence British Invasion). These bands grew up listening to classic rock by some white musicians like Elvis Presley, but they also listened to Muddy Waters and that sort. It allowed them to become more fascinated with the blues thus they evolved the art form in small sub genres. Becoming the Beatles, the stones and smaller bands which didn't gain more notoriety in the states like Small faces.

yo94t	In the Wealth of Nation there's the following passage: "Many different causes contributed to relax the discipline of the Roman armies. Its extreme severity was, perhaps, one of those causes. In the days of their grandeur, when no enemy appeared capable of opposing them, their heavy armour was laid aside as unnecessarily burdensome, their labourious exercises were neglected as unnecessarily toilsome. Under the Roman emperors, besides, the standing armies of Rome, those particularly which guarded the German and Pannonian frontiers, became dangerous to their masters, against whom they used frequently to set up their own generals. In order to render them less formidable, according to some authors, Dioclesian, according to others, Constantine, first withdrew them from the frontier, where they had always before been encamped in great bodies, generally of two or three legions each, and dispersed them in small bodies through the different provincial towns, from whence they were scarce ever removed but when it became necessary to repel an invasion. Small bodies of soldiers quartered, in trading and manufacturing towns, and seldom removed from those quarters, became themselves tradesmen, artificers, and manufacturers. The civil came to predominate over the military character, and the standing armies of Rome gradually degenerated into a corrupt, neglected, and undisciplined militia, incapable of resisting the attack of the German and Scythian militias, which soon afterwards invaded the western empire."    For context: it's of a discussion where he maintains that standing armies are generally superior to militias, and that militias from a nomadic husbandry society (amongst which he ranks the German tribes and the Scythians) are generally superior to those from other societies.	1643146475.0	scokjc	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scokjc/do_presentday_historians_share_adam_smiths_belief/	Do present-day historians share Adam Smith's belief that the weakening of military discipline and the army's corruption led to the fall of the Western Roman empire?

4lsd2	I think this is probably a fairly unique question!   I teach fourth grade in California and would like to do a project that rethinks the legacy of the missions. As someone who got a degree in history in undergrad, I also care a lot about using as accurate information as possible while necessarily “simplifying” certain things for developmental understanding.  My project is this: students are going to have a “trial” for the deaths, torture, and erasure of native culture that occurred during the mission period of California.   They are going to have to find historical evidence to support who they think is “most guilty” between Junipero serra, gaspar de portala, junipero Serra’s men, and the system of empire.   I know the answer to this is obviously “they all are to an extent,” but I want my students to really start to think critically about causality, historical evidence, and contexts of power.   I have a couple questions that you could help with:   Is it reasonable to say that Serra took orders from portola (as governor)? Did he receive sponsorship and funds from him? Spain? Essentially who would you say was “above” him?   How would you describe Serra’s men? Who took orders from him? Would it be reasonable to say that they were the ones who actually enforced most of the negative things that happened to native people at missions? Is there any evidence that Serra himself administered any type of torture?   Are there any primary sources that you can point me to that especially get at some of these issues (ex: show the relationship between portala and Serra)?

cihco	I ask this because of things like Godwin's Law which says that the longer an argument on the internet goes, the more likely it becomes that someone mentions Hitler or the Nazis. But lets say we live in an age before the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany. Prior to 1933, I would imagine that the name "Hitler" probably didn't mean anything to the average American.  However, there obviously still were contentious quibbles between people. And many of these quibbles must've entered the realm of hyperbole and bad faith arguments. And I imagine there must've been some famous historical figure that was frequently used to draw comparisons to whatever point of view someone was arguing. Is there any documented evidence in literature, diary entries, or newspaper articles of a specific historical figure commonly used as a comparison in arguments the way people use Hitler today? Or does it kind of depend on time and place? I imagine that it might have depended on whatever enemy the United States had just fought a conflict against. However, World War II ended almost eighty years ago and Hitler is still used as a go-to reference that a lot of people use when arguing against someone.

3guu6rxo	Today, if someone praises communism, they would most likely be taken for a joke or an idiot. Communism failed every country it was tried in and the 5 communist countries left aren't even really communist anymore, but either capitalist, socialist or some abomination that thinks it's communist but is actually a Monarchy.  However, before and during the Cold War, communism not being tried before has a significantly more valid point. Not many people could look at the results and say communism sucks because it always failed wherever it was tried.  So why was communism hated during the Cold War, and more importantly, before the Cold War. There were many countries, a good number of Britons and Americans among them, that believed the USSR to be a greater evil than Nazi Germany (before the Holocaust was revealed to be a thing). Churchill himself said something along the lines of "If Hitler invaded hell, I would support Satan" in reference to the Soviet-German war.  Even during the Russian Revolution, Lenin held a democratic vote which the Bolsheviks had LOST, despite their popularity and promises to give the Russian people what they want. Communism wasn't even adored in the first communist country.  Why was communism never liked all that much since the beginning.	1643156748.0	scsbgz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsbgz/why_was_communism_hated_beforeduring_the_cold_war/	Why was communism hated before/during the Cold War?

vfjp3	There are 7 days in a week, which I read was first devised by the Babylonians and carried forward to Europe. Some Roman calendars had 8 days, but at some point 7 prevailed and became the standard.   However, unlike a monthly calendar based on the moon or sun, it’s completely arbitrary that today is Tuesday rather than Friday. So at some point in history, someone(s) had to decide that today would a particular day rather than another day, and it was carried forward from there.   When was this decided and by whom? How far back can we confidently say that any multiple of 7 “days ago” was also a Tuesday?	1643160255.0	sctk61	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sctk61/when_did_the_days_of_the_week_become_fixed/	When did the days of the week become fixed?

I'm often wondering if this approach to technology in games is fundamentally right or wrong. Certainly, often it does seem to fit historic reality well, e.g., writing was invented and pretty much stayed.  Other times it doesn't seem to fit at all, e.g., aqueducts in ancient Rome.  I guess my question comes down to the permanence of ideas. Is it a valid abstraction to assume that once an idea has been established , it stays? E.g., get some "researcher points" and invent "chariots".  Or is it much more historically accurate to abstract to a maintenance model, e.g., we need to produce at least 5 "research points" to keep "chariots" after inventing it or else we'll lose it after X rounds/years?	1643182526.0	sd0f30	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd0f30/in_pc_games_like_civilization_technology_is/	In pc games like Civilization, technology is portrayed as linear and progressive, i.e., once something is invented, it stays invented.

j1c3bp38	In particular, famous examples of policies that are obviously intervention in the domestic economy. Reagan famously proclaimed that "government is the problem", but I don't imagine that he managed to completely eliminate state involvement in the economy, so I was wondering how the state continued to play a role and how it changed.  I'm aware that Reagan's 1981 tax cuts were substantially reversed in 1982, and someone also pointed me to the rise of protectionism during his presidency e.g. the 1988 Omnibus Foreign Trade and Competitiveness Act, but I was wondering whether there were other examples of state economic intervention during his presidency, as well as other publications on this topic. Thank you!     Some books I've come across (can't access them though): "The Political Economy of State Intervention" by Gavin Poynter (2020), "Administering The New Federalism" (1986), "Beyond Reaganomics: the long economic crisis and the rebuilding of America, 1974-1988" (2020)	1643190609.0	sd2cen	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd2cen/what_examples_are_there_of_government_economic/	What examples are there of government economic intervention during Reagan's administration?

dl74xa6t	The birthyear of the character of Dr. Watson, in the "Sherlock Holmes" stories is 1852; at some point in the 70s, he receives his medical degree and then joins the British Army as a surgeon. After an eventful military service, he suffers a bullet wound at the Battle of Maiwand (1880, making him 28 at the time) and also catches typhoid fever. He is discharged from military service with an invalid's pension and return to Britain on the HMS Orontes either in '80 or '81. In 1881 (presumably at the age of 29), he moves in with Holmes in 221B Baker Street. The two then have numerous of the adventures described in the stories. In *The Sign of Four*, set in 1888, Watson, then at the age of 36, becomes engaged (for the first time as far as we can tell), and marries in 1889. We don't have any definite date of birth for the wife, Mary Morstan, later Watson, but we know she was 17 after 1878.   Now my question is: how representative would this sort of biography be of British men in the Victorian era, or more precisely of urban males with tertiary education? I think the popular belief about this time would be that women were to be married by their late teens or early twenties, and an unmarried man after the age of, say, 25-30 would be an oddity as well. We'd think this sort of extended adolescence, cohabiting in your 30s à la *Friends* or *Big Bang Theory*, is a motif of 90s and onward sitcoms. We wouldn't expect it in Victorian Britain.   Would this be a common biography? Or is it an unusual case that's simply needed to make the setting work?	1643197140.0	sd40pk	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd40pk/is_dr_watsons_marriage_a_wild_outlier_in/	Is Dr. Watson's marriage a wild outlier in Victorian Britain?

uipfo	The idea of a specific recipe for a dish with a name must have evolved somewhere. I guess that could be a parallel evolution in several parts of the world, perhaps a Western concept that has been imposed on other cultures, or an idea that took root in one culture and spread to others because it's useful.  For many people the concept of recipes is kind of irrelevant most of the time. They just combine what they have available in ways that make sense to them, based on cooking methods they learned from parents etc. This seems more natural to me, and is, I assume, the oldest and most widespread way of making food.  At the other extreme we have people that only make specific dishes with names and precise written recipes with little variance. Most cookery books/channels/etc only offer food in this way. I'm curious how this distinction evolved over time.  Further reading suggestions highly welcome. I'm currently reading a few food history books that may answer this question, but I'd be delighted to find more to add to the pile!

dvpz8	Recently I was in the Leeds Art Gallery, UK, and inside there was a painting of an extremely strong-looking woman representing Brittania with a drawn sword poised to kill an Indian tiger. In the back you can see a distinctly Indian background. Whilst the racial connotations of the painting seemed obvious to me, the gender implications do not. It's clear even without reading an accompanying blurb that the painting depicts the defeat of the Indian sepoy rebellion/struggle for independence in 1857 as the triumph of an explicitly white, 'civilised' (the woman is wearing classical clothing) and militarily dominant (shining steel sword) Britain over a savage and bestial (tiger) India, with golden domes in the background suggestive of the wealth to be found in the subcontinent. For reference here is a web page about the painting, titled 'retribution' by Edward Armitage [https://victorianweb.org/painting/armitage/paintings/5.html](https://victorianweb.org/painting/armitage/paintings/5.html)  What I found harder to understand is why the representation of Britain was specifically *female*. A bit of searching on the sub and wikis resulted that there is some link with greco-roman goddesses, what I want to dig deeper into is what the choice of female or female-coded gender representation of a nation state meant culturally, socially and even politically. i.e. Armitage could have painting a similarly muscled apollo-esque male fighting the tiger and all the previous connotations about race etc. would still have been just as clear.  In doing my rather cursory search I also came accross the Niederwald monument, which boasts a statue of Germania, a strong female representation of Germany. Furthermore in France I am aware they have Marianne statues that fulfil a similar role. And of course, the statue of Liberty in New York harbour is that of a woman as well.  I am most interested in Britannia, or any wider studies that compare the roles these figures play but niche answers around the statue of liberty, Niderwald and Mariannes would be very interesting as well I am sure!	1643202787.0	sd5oti	/r/AskHistorians/comments/sd5oti/why_were_there_specifically_female/	Why were there specifically female representations of C19th Nations?

4spn9	The Budapest Memorandum was a document signed in 1994 between the U.S., U.K., Russia, Ukraine, and other parties. The document itself, and many political scientists, say that the Memorandum was primarily a non-nuclear proliferation treaty and less of a defensive pact. And that the only time any party may be obligated to act in defense of Ukraine is if Ukraine was threatened with a nuclear weapon, and even then, the only actions they are obligated in taking is to ask for the United Nations Security Council to get involved. By the Memorandum, even right now the US has no obligation in defending Ukraine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20171019081043/http://dag.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/44537/A_49_765%3bS_1994_1399-EN.pdf?sequence=21&isAllowed=y  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances  Why is it that the terms the U.S. and its allies agreed to are so tepid?

6ck1pwvu	Hi all,  I was watching a series about Napoleon on Amazon Prime and there was some discussion among the historians featured about whether the French revolution was necessary. One historian in particular believed that neither the French nor the 20th century revolutions were necessary, that the extant social order in both cases had the means to enact the necessary reforms. In fact, he went a step farther and said the traditional social order ALWAYS has the means to enact necessary reforms and violent revolution is NEVER necessary.  While I am not a political extremist and I am horrified at the prospect of post-revolutionary terror, I'm not sure that is true for the French and Russian revolutions. I am not a historian but my understanding is that the existing social orders were far too autocratic and "sticky" to prevent the necessary reforms and also that the suffering and deprivations of the common people were so outrageous that drastic action was called for in both cases. For instance, Russian literacy was 25%, which is staggering for a 20th century European nation (this was excacerbated by a policy of intentionally restricting education to nobles and the middle classes to keep the peasantry ignorant and submissive).
