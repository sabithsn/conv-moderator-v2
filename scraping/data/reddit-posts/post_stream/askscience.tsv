I'm reading Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos and at one point it says that marine iguanas dive underwater, scoop a large amount of algae and then bask in the sun to increase their body temperature until the algae have been boil and cooked, at which point they are soft enough to be digested. It even says that the digestive system forms a kind of pressure boiler.  I've found this fascinating, but I haven't been able to confirm it.

7cndjrxx	Hi! This is for You rocket engineers out here! From my (very limited) understanding, a big problem with reignition of a liquid-fuel rocket engine in space is the 'sloshing' of liquid within the tanks.  When the engines are already fired it causes no issue, since the g-forces during acceleration keep the fuel at the 'bottom' of the tank, where the pump is.  But how is this risk, of the pumps running empty, mitigated during reignition? I can imagine you could give the rocket a "push" with reaction thrusters to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank and then start up the pumps, but I haven't managed to find any real literature addressing this problem.   If You know something about this I would be interested to hear Your take on it!

6whjh0ws	Suppose I have the power to submerge a fourth of a vertical, circular tube 50 feet in diameter and 500 feet high inside a deep vat of water so that the base of the tube isn't touching the base of the vat. Then, suppose I insert a rigid seal with an airtight grip around the inner edges of the tube at its submerged base and then begin pulling upwards on the seal so that the seal makes its way up through the tube while maintaining its airtight seal. The tube would remain stationary, vertical, and partly submerged the whole time I pull the seal upwards.   I'd imagine that pulling the airtight seal upward would create a vacuum under the seal that, as the seal rises, would draw in/"suck" water into the tube from the vat. Would it then be possible that I pull the seal all the way up to the top of the 500 ft tube and create a water column that reaches the top of this 500 ft tube? Kind of like a syringe, but on a massive scale.   I keep hearing that the most I can "suck" water upwards is around 30 feet at standard atmospheric conditions. But I found an old /askscience thread where one Redditor was saying how negative pressure and cavitation, like in a piston "sucking" up water in a tube, can help one "suck" water to a vertical height of more than a mile.

I was wondering that because I don't understand why the  lime settles down if it more it can dissolve in warm water. Is it only  because of the steam that can't hold the lime?

I'm reading Kurt Vonnegut's Galapagos and at one point it says that marine iguanas dive underwater, scoop a large amount of algae and then bask in the sun to increase their body temperature until the algae have been boil and cooked, at which point they are soft enough to be digested.

7cndjrxx	Hi! This is for You rocket engineers out here! From my (very limited) understanding, a big problem with reignition of a liquid-fuel rocket engine in space is the 'sloshing' of liquid within the tanks.  When the engines are already fired it causes no issue, since the g-forces during acceleration keep the fuel at the 'bottom' of the tank, where the pump is.  But how is this risk, of the pumps running empty, mitigated during reignition? I can imagine you could give the rocket a "push" with reaction thrusters to force the fuel to the bottom of the tank and then start up the pumps, but I haven't managed to find any real literature addressing this problem.   If You know something about this I would be interested to hear Your take on it!

6whjh0ws	Suppose I have the power to submerge a fourth of a vertical, circular tube 50 feet in diameter and 500 feet high inside a deep vat of water so that the base of the tube isn't touching the base of the vat. Then, suppose I insert a rigid seal with an airtight grip around the inner edges of the tube at its submerged base and then begin pulling upwards on the seal so that the seal makes its way up through the tube while maintaining its airtight seal. The tube would remain stationary, vertical, and partly submerged the whole time I pull the seal upwards.   I'd imagine that pulling the airtight seal upward would create a vacuum under the seal that, as the seal rises, would draw in/"suck" water into the tube from the vat. Would it then be possible that I pull the seal all the way up to the top of the 500 ft tube and create a water column that reaches the top of this 500 ft tube? Kind of like a syringe, but on a massive scale.   I keep hearing that the most I can "suck" water upwards is around 30 feet at standard atmospheric conditions. But I found an old /askscience thread where one Redditor was saying how negative pressure and cavitation, like in a piston "sucking" up water in a tube, can help one "suck" water to a vertical height of more than a mile.

Why does this happen? As far as I know warm  water is capable of holding more salts and lime then cold water. Is this  right? And my question then is, why is that even the case, why is there  a difference in the amount of slat/lime, water can hold with different  temperatures. I was wondering that because I don't understand why the  lime settles down if it more it can dissolve in warm water. Is it only  because of the steam that can't hold the lime?

2d510dz7	An undergraduate in a health related field here I’ve come across some really confusing stuff regarding this topic. I’ve always been kind of health conscious from a  young age and interested in this kind of stuff.   I was under the impression that saturated fat and cholesterol both contribute to raising serum cholesterol levels.   However one of my professors who’s now a epidemiologist/professor and was a practising cardiologist stated that dietary cholesterol raising serum cholesterol levels has been debunked and that saturated (and trans) fats contribute to serum cholesterol levels but not dietary cholesterol.   I’ve been reading on this and am more confused than I was before.  I see stuff like this   Harvard School of Public Health:  >Choose foods with healthy fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid foods with trans fat.   >Although it is still important to limit the amount of cholesterol you eat, especially if you have diabetes, for most people dietary cholesterol isn’t nearly the villain it’s been portrayed to be. Cholesterol in the bloodstream, specifically the bad LDL cholesterol, is what’s most important. And the biggest influence on blood cholesterol level is the mix of fats and carbohydrates in your diet—not the amount of cholesterol you eat from food.   But the American heart association and FDA recommend limiting cholesterol consumption etc. and have also come across many studies showing dietary cholesterol does effect heart health as well as websites claiming that a lot of studies are industry funded and not reliable.

ec1ey	Hi Reddit! I'm Dr. Yasmin Hurd, the Director of the Addiction Institute within the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System, and the Ward Coleman Chair of Translational Neuroscience and Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. I'm an internationally renowned neuroscientist whose translational research examines the neurobiology of drug abuse and related psychiatric disorders. My research exploring the neurobiological effects of cannabis and heroin has significantly shaped the field. Using multidisciplinary research approaches, my research has provided unique insights into the impact of developmental cannabis exposure and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the drug's protracted effects into adulthood and even across generations. My basic science research is complemented by clinical laboratory investigations evaluating the therapeutic potential of novel science-based strategies for the treatment of opioid addiction and related psychiatric disorders. Based on these high-impact accomplishments and my advocacy of drug addiction education and health, I was inducted into the National Academy of Medicine, complementing other honors I have received in the field. Recently, I was featured in the NOVA PBS film "[The Cannabis Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-dxMTDzMLY)," which premiered in September and explores the little-known risks and benefits of cannabis use.

hfdak0u0	Generally, when popular science outlets try to explain an object being in orbit simply, it is explained as "constantly falling and constantly missing" or similar. I can kind of see what they mean when they put graphics of it up, but it's in no way intuitively easy.  My thought before I saw that explanation was simply that gravity and the centrifugal force from rotating around the planet/star/etc. cancelled out, and hence the object stays in the orbit and experiences net zero acceleration/gravity.  Does the math support this interpretation? If it does, is there anything else with it that is incorrect, or is it just different ways of thinking of the same thing?	1642865075.0	sa4s88	/r/askscience/comments/sa4s88/can_orbit_be_understood_as_gravity_and/	Can orbit be understood as gravity and centrifugal force cancelling out?

65gfe8uh	I'm actually in the math-heavy design stage to build an actual mini axial gas turbine. There are reasons why a centrifugal one is used as part of a turbocharger, but the scientific challenge really got to me. I'm even building an extra 4-axis lathe to mill the blisks for it.  Anyways. I have no problems with the design of the blades or the velocity triangles. BUT EVERY book about fluid dynamics or turbomachinery OMITS THE EXACT causal link of how a stator (if the compressor is of such design) creates pressure. It usually vaguely talks about the stator being a diffusor, but on the same time the flow area of the annular stream continually grows smaller and smaller through the compressor.  In other words: How does it work that a flow is diffused (subsonic design) and at the same time the flow area is reduced. Obviously this can't work the way I describe the question, but the phrasing of the question is well formed to exactly depict how much I understand and what's still missing.  So, what exact characteristic of the stator (is it the curvature, the thickness, the nozzle spatial geometry,...) causes the pressure to rise from the velocity AND how do I bring this in accordance of the steady reduction of flow are throughout the compressor?  I REALLY appreaciate an answer as not even fluid dynamic books really get this specific and just generalize that point.	1642879739.0	saa1mb	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/	How does an axial compressor create more pressure?

1v9zietd	Take tigers for example. There are several distinct subspecies and populations, all of which are endangered. I know that each population would have evolved to adapt to their specific environments. The Siberian Tiger and the Sumatran Tiger would have evolved to be comfortable in different climates and environments. So I understand not just tossing any two tigers together.  But why is it crucial not to introduce genes from the Malayan tiger into Sumatran tiger populations? In each native range, the tiger fills an important ecological niche, so wouldn’t SOME tigers, even if they’re “mixed breed” be better than no tigers at all? And before populations became so fragmented, wouldn’t there have been significant overlap and interbreeding on the edges of each population’s range?

127ery	So I've heard this many times before in the context of astronomy and JWST and I realized that I don't quite understand the implications of this statement: "we perceive infrared as heat". Our eyes see visible light frequencies, we have detectors that capture this visible light emitted from far away and our brains process it and that's how we see the environment around us. But about our perception of infrared as "heat":  * Stars/flames that burn hotter appear blue, stars that are colder appear red. Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes? Since infrared is heat and blue stars are hotter, I would expect more infrared from blue stars. Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red? Or is "heat" and "hot temperature" not actually the same thing in this case? * Our skin "feels" infrared as "heat". But does our skin only detect infrared by direct contact, so we have to be touching something to feel that it's "hot" and tense its temperature? Or does it also detect some infrared radiation going through vacuum/air? When we feel the heat from a glowing red heater for example, do we feel the infrared radiation emitted directly by the hot metal, or do we feel the direct contact with the hot air that was heated by this nearby element and traveled to us across the room? * Infrared cameras see "heat" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat/IR? * When our skin feels infrared, is it only sensitive to a certain part of the infrared spectrum? Does the infrared range our skin feels correspond to a small range of IR frequencies which correspond to a range of temperatures, that happen to be a "safe" range for our bodies to come in contact with? For example, when something feels "very cold" is that just a signal for our brain that any colder is dangerous, and what feels "very hot" tells our brain that any hotter is also dangerous? But fundamentally it's just a small sliver of the possible temperatures in the universe and there's nothing really fundamentally special about them?	1642879214.0	sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/	What does it mean to say that "our skin perceives infrared as heat"?

4bzsf	I'm working on a sci-fi novel, and while it's fantastical in nature, I still want to make sure I at least get the terminology as correct as possible.   There's a creature in the setting that essentially grows inside of a human body if that person is infected. This creature will kill its host for the majority of cases, but some humans can survive. The survivors are malnourished, heavily prone to addiction, and in all likelihood will die a horrible death due to addiction or other direct/indirect reasons. Of those survivors a small percentage may get benefits where they may get some sort of extraordinary ability (think of the comic book/movie Venom), but they're still constantly fighting being eaten from the inside out, needing to take medications and do other things to keep the creature inside in check.  So my question is, is a creature like that still considered a parasite? Or can parasite provide no benefit to its host at all? Is it a symbiont instead? A virus?	1642807643.0	s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/	Can parasites provide some benefits to the host?

58lwvdg0	So I have a question that there may not even be an answer to. I doubt there would be any scientific studies on this as there would be too many variables to be able to control the study. But I am curious about what other think.  But let me explain a little better what I mean before answering.  There are a few scientific facts first: 1. When a woman is born she already has all the eggs she will ever have. Women do not produce more so that's it. 2. When a woman is pregnant she (typically) will stop ovulating for the duration of the pregnancy, and may not start again for up to a year after giving birth.  So let's say a woman has 10 healthy to term pregnancies. We can average that out to 18m per pregnancy where she does not ovulate. Over those 10 pregnancies that adds up to 15 years of not ovulating.  So theoretically could that delay her from starting menopause for up to 15 years?   Also please don't come at me over this question. I am being genuine in my curiosity here and just wondering what others opinions might be. And by no means am I planning on having a whole heap of children to try and delay my own menopause. I have 3 children and that is enough for me.

aj9jprmf	I know this seems like a simple question, but the context of this question comes from a debate I heard between two classmates. One claimed that sex of an organism was first and foremost a question of gamete type. The other claimed that sex was a question of general reproductive function, i.e. a woman with Complete Androgen Insensitivity syndrome would not be male because despite having testes, the rest of her body was geared towards female reproduction.  Their analogy is that if a left shoe was put on a right foot, it would still be a left shoe because its structure is organized around the left foot, regardless of what it's being used for or wether or not it's functional. Basically, that a "male phenotype" was an organism organized towards the production of sperm, and that this is born out by the definition of sex that comes up on Google.  >either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions.  The however, the gamete-based definition seems to be favored by dictionaries like miriam webster which say that "female" is  >"of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs"  And vice versa for men. The Oxford Dictionary similarly favors it with even less ambiguity.  >Denoting the gamete (sex cell) that, during sexual reproduction, fuses with a male gamete in the process of fertilization. Female gametes are generally larger than the male gametes and are usually immotile (see oosphere; ovum).  Which of these perspectives is correct?

2d510dz7	An undergraduate in a health related field here I’ve come across some really confusing stuff regarding this topic. I’ve always been kind of health conscious from a  young age and interested in this kind of stuff.   I was under the impression that saturated fat and cholesterol both contribute to raising serum cholesterol levels.   However one of my professors who’s now a epidemiologist/professor and was a practising cardiologist stated that dietary cholesterol raising serum cholesterol levels has been debunked and that saturated (and trans) fats contribute to serum cholesterol levels but not dietary cholesterol.   I’ve been reading on this and am more confused than I was before.  I see stuff like this   Harvard School of Public Health:  >Choose foods with healthy fats, limit foods high in saturated fat, and avoid foods with trans fat.   >Although it is still important to limit the amount of cholesterol you eat, especially if you have diabetes, for most people dietary cholesterol isn’t nearly the villain it’s been portrayed to be. Cholesterol in the bloodstream, specifically the bad LDL cholesterol, is what’s most important. And the biggest influence on blood cholesterol level is the mix of fats and carbohydrates in your diet—not the amount of cholesterol you eat from food.   But the American heart association and FDA recommend limiting cholesterol consumption etc. and have also come across many studies showing dietary cholesterol does effect heart health as well as websites claiming that a lot of studies are industry funded and not reliable.

ec1ey	Hi Reddit! I'm Dr. Yasmin Hurd, the Director of the Addiction Institute within the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System, and the Ward Coleman Chair of Translational Neuroscience and Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. I'm an internationally renowned neuroscientist whose translational research examines the neurobiology of drug abuse and related psychiatric disorders. My research exploring the neurobiological effects of cannabis and heroin has significantly shaped the field. Using multidisciplinary research approaches, my research has provided unique insights into the impact of developmental cannabis exposure and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the drug's protracted effects into adulthood and even across generations. My basic science research is complemented by clinical laboratory investigations evaluating the therapeutic potential of novel science-based strategies for the treatment of opioid addiction and related psychiatric disorders. Based on these high-impact accomplishments and my advocacy of drug addiction education and health, I was inducted into the National Academy of Medicine, complementing other honors I have received in the field. Recently, I was featured in the NOVA PBS film "[The Cannabis Question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-dxMTDzMLY)," which premiered in September and explores the little-known risks and benefits of cannabis use. I'll be on at 3 p.m. (ET, 20 UT), ask me anything!	1642766482.0	s997hz	/r/askscience/comments/s997hz/askscience_ama_series_im_the_director_of_the/	AskScience AMA Series: I'm the Director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai who studies the neurobiological effects of cannabis and opioids.

65gfe8uh	I'm actually in the math-heavy design stage to build an actual mini axial gas turbine. There are reasons why a centrifugal one is used as part of a turbocharger, but the scientific challenge really got to me. I'm even building an extra 4-axis lathe to mill the blisks for it.  Anyways. I have no problems with the design of the blades or the velocity triangles. BUT EVERY book about fluid dynamics or turbomachinery OMITS THE EXACT causal link of how a stator (if the compressor is of such design) creates pressure. It usually vaguely talks about the stator being a diffusor, but on the same time the flow area of the annular stream continually grows smaller and smaller through the compressor.  In other words: How does it work that a flow is diffused (subsonic design) and at the same time the flow area is reduced. Obviously this can't work the way I describe the question, but the phrasing of the question is well formed to exactly depict how much I understand and what's still missing.  So, what exact characteristic of the stator (is it the curvature, the thickness, the nozzle spatial geometry,...) causes the pressure to rise from the velocity AND how do I bring this in accordance of the steady reduction of flow are throughout the compressor?  I REALLY appreaciate an answer as not even fluid dynamic books really get this specific and just generalize that point.	1642879739.0	saa1mb	/r/askscience/comments/saa1mb/how_does_an_axial_compressor_create_more_pressure/	How does an axial compressor create more pressure?

1v9zietd	Take tigers for example. There are several distinct subspecies and populations, all of which are endangered. I know that each population would have evolved to adapt to their specific environments. The Siberian Tiger and the Sumatran Tiger would have evolved to be comfortable in different climates and environments. So I understand not just tossing any two tigers together.  But why is it crucial not to introduce genes from the Malayan tiger into Sumatran tiger populations? In each native range, the tiger fills an important ecological niche, so wouldn’t SOME tigers, even if they’re “mixed breed” be better than no tigers at all? And before populations became so fragmented, wouldn’t there have been significant overlap and interbreeding on the edges of each population’s range?

127ery	So I've heard this many times before in the context of astronomy and JWST and I realized that I don't quite understand the implications of this statement: "we perceive infrared as heat". Our eyes see visible light frequencies, we have detectors that capture this visible light emitted from far away and our brains process it and that's how we see the environment around us. But about our perception of infrared as "heat":  * Stars/flames that burn hotter appear blue, stars that are colder appear red. Does this mean blue stars emit less infrared and more visible light, or they also emit more infrared but we just can't see it with our eyes? Since infrared is heat and blue stars are hotter, I would expect more infrared from blue stars. Does this mean the blue objects also emit more red but the blue overwhelms the red? Or is "heat" and "hot temperature" not actually the same thing in this case? * Our skin "feels" infrared as "heat". But does our skin only detect infrared by direct contact, so we have to be touching something to feel that it's "hot" and tense its temperature? Or does it also detect some infrared radiation going through vacuum/air? When we feel the heat from a glowing red heater for example, do we feel the infrared radiation emitted directly by the hot metal, or do we feel the direct contact with the hot air that was heated by this nearby element and traveled to us across the room? * Infrared cameras see "heat" at a distance obviously, is that different from how our skin detects heat/IR? * When our skin feels infrared, is it only sensitive to a certain part of the infrared spectrum? Does the infrared range our skin feels correspond to a small range of IR frequencies which correspond to a range of temperatures, that happen to be a "safe" range for our bodies to come in contact with? For example, when something feels "very cold" is that just a signal for our brain that any colder is dangerous, and what feels "very hot" tells our brain that any hotter is also dangerous? But fundamentally it's just a small sliver of the possible temperatures in the universe and there's nothing really fundamentally special about them?	1642879214.0	sa9uvg	/r/askscience/comments/sa9uvg/what_does_it_mean_to_say_that_our_skin_perceives/	What does it mean to say that "our skin perceives infrared as heat"?

ahihdift	If we pretend there are two people, each located in a seperate room, who are both infected with the COVID-19 virus.

4bzsf	I'm working on a sci-fi novel, and while it's fantastical in nature, I still want to make sure I at least get the terminology as correct as possible.   There's a creature in the setting that essentially grows inside of a human body if that person is infected. This creature will kill its host for the majority of cases, but some humans can survive. The survivors are malnourished, heavily prone to addiction, and in all likelihood will die a horrible death due to addiction or other direct/indirect reasons. Of those survivors a small percentage may get benefits where they may get some sort of extraordinary ability (think of the comic book/movie Venom), but they're still constantly fighting being eaten from the inside out, needing to take medications and do other things to keep the creature inside in check.  So my question is, is a creature like that still considered a parasite? Or can parasite provide no benefit to its host at all? Is it a symbiont instead? A virus?	1642807643.0	s9o4de	/r/askscience/comments/s9o4de/can_parasites_provide_some_benefits_to_the_host/	Can parasites provide some benefits to the host?
55298ay9	According to the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coriolis_force) page on the Coriolis effect it occurs when we are dealing with two reference frames, a rotating one and an inertial one. If the earth is in the rotating frame and an airplane is experiencing Coriolis effect doesn't that mean the plane is in the inertial reference frame as depicted in this[animation](https://atmos.northernvermont.edu/news/coriolis-effect-demonstration/)  from the university of northern Vermont? How could that be though? Wouldn't that mean the stars would stop rotating when observed from an airplane and and when flying from the north pole to Mexico you would aim for Africa and let Mexico rotate in to it?  Alternatively if the plane is not in an inertial reference frame and it's just rotating with the earth, what would any pilot be correcting for?	1642890236.0	sadtha	/r/askscience/comments/sadtha/how_does_coriolis_effect_change_the_trajectory_of/	How does Coriolis effect change the trajectory of an airplane?

58lwvdg0	So I have a question that there may not even be an answer to. I doubt there would be any scientific studies on this as there would be too many variables to be able to control the study. But I am curious about what other think.  But let me explain a little better what I mean before answering.  There are a few scientific facts first: 1. When a woman is born she already has all the eggs she will ever have. Women do not produce more so that's it. 2. When a woman is pregnant she (typically) will stop ovulating for the duration of the pregnancy, and may not start again for up to a year after giving birth.  So let's say a woman has 10 healthy to term pregnancies. We can average that out to 18m per pregnancy where she does not ovulate. Over those 10 pregnancies that adds up to 15 years of not ovulating.  So theoretically could that delay her from starting menopause for up to 15 years?   Also please don't come at me over this question. I am being genuine in my curiosity here and just wondering what others opinions might be. And by no means am I planning on having a whole heap of children to try and delay my own menopause. I have 3 children and that is enough for me.

I know females will eat juveniles but in terms of adults eating other adults of their kind, I've only see cases of males doing it. The only exceptions being in snakes and a mother tiger who ate a rival adult male	1643090416.0	sc6p50	/r/askscience/comments/sc6p50/are_there_any_cases_of_adult_female_vertebrates/	Are there any cases of adult female vertebrates cannibalising adults of their own species?

h2xlk	Basically, when it's 22°F without snow, it's bitter cold and the air hurts everything it touches but that same 22°F with snow on the ground is now much more bearable, it actually feels "warmer".

13q5bc	If I use my mouth/lungs to blow air with some speed, I can feel that gust of air a meter away, but not ten meters away. Are there some formulas for how far a fast moving gas can retain speed, or how much it slows down, moving in a gas like air? It would probably depend on several factors, including the initial speed and pressure of the surrounding gas.  A concrete example: is there a speed *v* such that if we accelerated CO2 to that speed, aimed upwards, it would make it out into space with enough speed to permanently leave the planet? Or would Earth's atmosphere slow it down to capture it again, regardless of the initial speed?	1643196673.0	sd3wcp	/r/askscience/comments/sd3wcp/what_determines_how_far_fast_moving_gas_can_move/	What determines how far fast moving gas can move through a gas?

pnook	I've read a few articles that state the antimatter is pretty rare in the universe. If I understand correctly, positrons are antimatter. Yet PET scanners are run for many hours each day in hospitals around the world, so it seems like they can't be too rare. If antimatter is so rare, where do the scanners get the positrons they use? Can PET scanners run out of positrons like a car runs out of gas?	1643180572.0	sczxdg	/r/askscience/comments/sczxdg/where_do_the_positrons_come_from_that_are_used_in/	Where do the positrons come from that are used in PET scanners?
