hpjuozsf	Not only are they intellectually inferior to those that don’t, they are also lacking in self-value. Worshipping others that are rich or famous infers that you believe they are superior and you yourself are inferior to them; otherwise, why would you be worshipping them?   Often, these people know more about a random actor than their own immediate family members. It’s sick and weird to care that much about people that don’t know you exist and you’ll never spend time with.  Furthermore, thinking you know anything about any of these people is proof of stupidity. “He is so kind and smart.” And how could you possibly know? You watch a few interviews and hear gossip at the office based upon an article in a magazine? Just stop lol.  EDIT: If you only plan on replying to state that I am an asshole or equally stupid for being judgmental, don’t bother. I am aware. I also don’t think I am smart, so you don’t need to mention that either. I barely graduated Highschool, never took the SATs, and have never taken an IQ test.

Velma isn't hot, she isn't sexy, she wasn't a childhood crush, She's just not all that. This just simply isn't the case. No amount of people posting lewd Velma cosplays will convince me I'm wrong.

f1wjagbj	When it comes to their drug being criticized, no drug user is whinier than an alcohol user. Pot users are close, but the fact that weed's illegal in most states and carries stigma (like people assuming people who smoke pot are stupid, unmotivated, etc.) justifies their whininess.  But alcohol is more mainstream, so people who are really into it don't face much if any criticism, making them have a thin skin. A skin so thin, that the mere presence of a person who doesn't drink and isn't being remotely preachy about it is enough to bother many of them. It's like lots of them hear "I don't drink" as "I am superior for not drinking. Bask in my glory, you inferior scum." I've worked in restaurants for the past few years, and I usually lie when people ask what alcoholic drinks I like because if I say I don't drink, people often treat it like I'm trying to flex.  Also, you can just look at reddit whenever alcohol is criticized or the bad effects are pointed out. Most other drug users are like "yes, it does x, y, z bad thing, but I'm careful and/or I enjoy it so I don't care." But alcohol users are like "wine is healthy" (it has stilbenoids and anthocyanins, which are found in lots of foods without alcohol, which [increases cancer risk even with moderate usage](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/alcohol/alcohol-fact-sheet)) or "everything causes cancer." Then drink irradiated water instead of regular water. Oh wait, but that's a stupid idea since some things are way more cancerous than others.	1642789698.0	s9hdrb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9hdrb/alcohol_drinkers_often_have_the_thinnest_skin/	Alcohol drinkers often have the thinnest skin when people criticize their drug

oohhe	Breastfeeding isn’t worth the hassle: - breastmilk is only marginally more healthy than formula - breastfeeding takes longer than a bottle - men can’t help and do it - it burdens the rest of the family with whatever needs to be done while the baby is eating - it hampers your ability to go out on dates/with friends/etc.	1642790774.0	s9hry5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9hry5/breastfeeding_isnt_worth_the_hassle/	Breastfeeding isn’t worth the hassle

But instead we burry our heads in mobile games and make sure our read receipts are on so people know there getting ignored.  Go look at your screen time and see how much time is being thrown away.

7mrgna4z	As a kid everyone always told me I'd grow up and regret wishing I was a grown-up.  And that turned out to be complete BS. I'm 23 and am the happiest I'd ever been. (yeah yeah, still a kid etc. but whatever u get the point)  As a kid you're basically a lump of little shit that's being dragged around the world with no purpose or control over what's happening to you lol.  You basically have 2 options — you're either born privileged with enough food and good parents; then, you're mostly comfortable and have a pretty easy life. But you still neither really have a purpose, other than to grow up, nor freedom. It wasn't fun for me, I was just bored and knew there was more to life I had to wait before I could enjoy.  Or, you are born into a bad family or an orphan, in which case you're powerless in many senses of the word and have to take and deal with a lot of shit while having no say in the matter.  I have a suspicion that some people who claim that 8 is the best age are just lazy and don't want to have responsibilities. Life is about aspirations, some hardship along the way, overcoming which is the purpose of life and eventually makes you happy.  I know at 50-60 people wanna relive their life — that doesn't mean that being a kid per se is good. I'd probably wanna come back to my 20s or 30s	1642794352.0	s9j4cr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9j4cr/being_a_kid_sucks_ass/	Being a kid sucks ass.

e2f6oaep	I’ve increasingly noticed the tiptoeing around certain topics and ideas in comment threads, especially when it comes to criticism (positive criticism even). The effects of this seem to be generally negative. There is now a feedback loop of people who seek improvement, are told they’re doing great, and thus not improving. Or in the worst case, people posting their content to explicitly capitalize on this phenomenon for egotistical reasons. I think the beauty of a public forum is to be able to receive feedback and give feedback, in an open manner, in which honesty is paramount.	1642795553.0	s9jkqf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9jkqf/reddit_has_become_a_hub_for_the_hypersensitive_to/	Reddit has become a hub for the hypersensitive to seek social validation

4pcle9gy	Alright now that you clicked the clikbaity title let me explain.     I don't believe ANYONE is born gay, straight, etc... and anytime I've conversed about this with someone they disagree.     When you are a kid, s\*x is not something that is on your mind, you have no concept or understanding of it. I think that your sexual preference is a result of all the random events in your early life culminating to your ultimate sexual preference, and yes certain genetic things may PREDISPOSE you to a certain direction but that's it. I also believe that sexual preference is malleable to an extent, many people "discover" they actually have a different sexual preference after a traumatic (which doesn't make it any less valid by the way), exciting, or unexpected event.  Not that it matters lol, the end result is the same, but regardless- I think its nurture, not nature.	1642800942.0	s9lm7b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9lm7b/no_one_is_born_gay/	No one is born gay.

2ff65xe2	 If you use it recreationally, do not think it will provide you with any benefit.  It increases your risk for heart attack, stroke, addiction ( to weed, it’s not a gateway drug), brain damage, negative impact on fetal development, and testicular cancer.   I understand that it has its uses in medicine. It can help with PTSD, pain, and possible neurodegenerative diseases but as in any medicine, it has it’s place. If you are smoking weed, it can cause harm to you. I think people forget that it is a drug. It isn’t going to on its own cure your pain, anxiety, or depression. If you have issues, seek medical help, do not self medicate. It’s possible you don’t even have the condition you are trying to treat or you are making it worse.   Essentially, sure, you can smoke weed but don’t lie to people and yourself and say it isn’t causing you any harm or it’s helping you unless you have a prescription.   (Regular medications can cause harm too, if the benefits outweigh the negative/risks it’s okay to take, and that is why you need a consult with a doctor and maybe even a second opinion)	1642804881.0	s9n42z	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9n42z/weed_is_not_good_for_you/	Weed Is Not Good For You

2gl5s0io	I've noticed a lot of friends and family that I'm close to have used the R word recently when I know they'd never ever us the N word. I think it's probably because society has made it clear that the N word is one of the nastiest and most derogatory words you can say to POC or in general. But society hasn't put as much pressure on the R word and I don't understand why because it's also nasty af and I HATE to hear it come out of my friends mouth or anyones for that matter. Using the R word is as just as bad because in a lot of situations the mentally/intellectually disabled can't defend themselves where as most people can if they were called something.

And it fucks me up as a teenager of 19 20 yrs of age that no matter what someone says to me Or does to me I tend to understand that person's situation and justify it instead of blaming them. It's very difficult to think about myself because nobody is black and white everyone has shades of grey but still I'm expected to pick sides and get mad instead to just pray to heal this person whatever he went through and give me peace to be selfish with no guilt attached to.	1642812333.0	s9pszr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9pszr/just_a_thought_i_feel_is_very_important/	Just a thought I feel is very important

I didn't know exactly what she meant at the time but said okay.  I searched online and apparently it's common got people to go on multiple dates without being exclusive. I get that people on tinder do this, but in real life? Do people not consider a relationship exclusive even after sleeping together?? If someone asked me out on a date and I knew it was non-exclusive I would decline. It's one of the main reasons I don't do online dating.  Does not want this and one night stands make me socially conservative and in the minority?  I only ever showed interest in 1 girl at a time growing up, and I was raised to think other people did the same. Thank god I found out in this way or else I'd probably be heart broken.	1642813016.0	s9q17h	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9q17h/i_wouldnt_date_someone_who_is_seeing_multiple/	I wouldn't date someone who is seeing multiple people at once

f15oa1wp	Using a throwaway because this opinion may get me publicly crucified (and perhaps rightfully so, this is just a belief based on my knowledge of history and, given my public school education, that could be limited).  This isn’t saying I condone the way the United States has historically treated the Native Americans, because I don’t. Not one bit. I believe that the bad rap we get for that is well warranted and should never be forgotten. I also believe that the “savage” stereotype that was given to them in that time period is completely backwards, because they had every right to attack people who came onto their land, especially people with bad intentions.   However, in the earliest eras of civilization, so much land was stolen and conquered. There were genocides and wars over it, so much death and destruction and cruelty, but people don’t as often refer to other countries or republics as stolen like they do America. In a lot of places in the world, the entire state of their government is built upon a foundation created by those who conquered the land hundreds of years ago, yet there aren’t as many nationwide held controversies regarding them.   A lot of successful land conquering of the past did not seem fair or just, and America’s definitely wasn’t, but they did end up overtaking large portions of land and keeping them, and in a lot of cases with other places built on “stolen” land around the world, the fact is less controversial and the land is simply seen as the rightful home of those on it.   Why is this not the case with America? I believe that Native American reservations should be funded a lot more by the government, but I don’t understand why people use “colonizer” as an insult or get so genuinely angry about what has happened, talking about it in a way that suggests something should be done. I especially don’t understand the people who discredit particular aspects of the country due to it being “stolen” land. What are people supposed to do? At this point it has been The United States longer than the land it was when it was conquered, and there’s no possible way to give it back or something. What is the best possible case scenario of continuing to fight against anything regarding the subject that isn’t to do with properly tending to/funding/expanding Native American reservations, because I can’t think of a resolvable issue about this country being stolen besides that one.	1642816416.0	s9r5ac	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9r5ac/i_dont_understand_how_america_was_stolen/	I don’t understand how America was “stolen”
f766tod	So, I like plants.  I visit the plant subreddit often.  And people there be like “omg, is this where the new leaf will come out” or “omg, my plant is growing 2 inches left of where it should be! Will it be okay?”  It’s growing.  It’s green.  It’s fine.  I visit lego subreddit, “omg I discovered this new way of building this thing! But this move might be illegal!”  It’s a toy.  It’s a fun toy.  Did you have fun? Then you’re fine.

8zxr15yc	Cars are safer than they ever have been. But even the safest cars can only help you so much if you get into a high speed collision. If you have a direct head-on with both vehicles at 60mph you are probably going to die regardless of what 2022 Volvo you drive. The best vehicles are only able to save your life in a head on if each vehicle is traveling a maximum of 40-45mph.  For freeways, these are safer for higher speeds than two lane highways. Most freeway crashes involve grazing the outer parts of a vehicle as it spins before it comes to a stop. (Stay in vehicle with seatbelt on until you’re sure it’s clear). Everyone travels the same direction.   On the freeway if you lose control while going 60-65mph you’re likely going to slow down before impact and often it’s enough slowing down to give you a fighting chance of survival if you do have a bad direct impact on something.   But if you lose control at 85mph…. The odds are much much worse if you have a bad hit on a pole, rocks, or barrier.   The safest cars in the world today still can’t save your life when you have a direct hit at high speeds.  It is my hope that 20 years from now the majority of cars on the road will be able to automatically avoid most collisions with their crash prevention tech.   But until that day comes, slow down. It’s not worth saving 5 minutes to have a much higher chance of death.	1642821990.0	s9sx1y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9sx1y/speed_limits_on_freeways_should_never_exceed/	Speed limits on freeways should never exceed 65mph.

1d3iu1k4	I see in the news "Woman throws puppy in bin" and "Neighbor shoots annoying barking dog" or something to that effect and all hell breaks loose and people get arrested for doing so. Fine then.  So what right do you have as a pet owner to take your pet to the vet and have them put down when they get sick or can't walk or eat? How can you one day decide, "Yea, he's not looking too good darling. I think it's time." Who made you god. It's a fucking animal, there's millions of animals in the wild, "Hey Pumbaa, Simba is 100 yrs old and not looking too good. Lets just take him to the edge of the cliff cause I can't see him looking like this." No, it's not like that. If you had to do this to a family member or friend you would go to jail. Yes I know there are places that you can do this but they have asked for this to be done under their own will. A pet can't talk, are you making yourself feel better by doing this or do you think you are making the animal feel better by doing this. Is the pet asking you to take him to the vet to be put down? How can one day you take it to a vet which most times is unfamiliar to them and have strangers around and most times people leave as they can't stand seeing them being put to sleep. Yes I do have pets, I house them, feed them, they have toys and more, I show little affection to them. When the time comes I myself will not be taking the pet to be put down. My wife or my kids can but not me. And they know what my feelings are towards pets and they knew what I thought before we got pets. Do I want the pet to suffer??? Most probably people will see it as "animal cruelty" or "neglect" or some crap and most probably will have to take them to the vet. I don't dislike pets, if you have great. Not a problem, but just make their last few days memorable, enjoyable, a favorite place (a park, at home, the beach) in the warm sun, their favorite toy next to or whatever and hopefully they slip away.	1642827642.0	s9umb8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9umb8/you_have_no_right_to_take_your_pet_to_the_vet_so/	You have no right to take your pet to the vet so you can have them put down (euthanised).

hornecxj	Life is short. We all have the same amount of time to get stuff done each day. We have to feed ourselves, work, learn how to solve new problems, take care of our family, and still find time to enjoy life. Time is precious.   You should not feel pressured to use those precious moments stressing out over things you’re not affected by, especially when it seems like nobody is stressing about the things you care about.   You’re not a bad person if you feel overwhelmed by the amount of issues there are to learn about and not enough time in the day. Or if you can’t keep up with the flavor of the month.   Seriously.   People only want to make you feel that way because it’s a problem affecting *them.* They probably know/do little about other people’s problems. Even if they do, that’s how they *choose* to spend their time. You (likely) don’t owe anyone your life.   It’s okay to ask for help.

33mh5ukw	 I  grew up very poor, I started a company in high school making aerial  photography drones that could pick up a DSLR on a 3-axis gimbal. (pre  2013, DJI didn't even exist yet). They were $1000-$2000 in parts  (covered by the down payment, so 0 overhead/investment) and I could sell  them for $16,000-$22,000. I've since started 6 more companies that also net $100k+ a year, before I was 22.  I  also predicted/invested in Nvidia, Netflix, Tesla, Disney, and others. I  also bought Bitcoin when it was $0.08.... about 2000 of them. Recently  made 1.2M off Doge from a bot I created years ago and I literally forgot  it existed till I got an error message after it sold all the doge. I  made $1.2 million by accident literally in my sleep.  It  is laughably easy to become a millionaire. And bc almost everyone I  shared this story with said, oh you got lucky, or your just smarter it's  not fair.  So I wanted to prove  how easy it is. So I started another company, a power washer, a can of  yellow paint (parking lot paint), and window cleaning supplies, $250 all  up bc I got a nice as power washer bc I did the math and it was 30% more  expensive but 75% faster, no brainier.  I  made $5,000 my first week (cash btw, taxation is theft) working 70  hours including travel. One of my opening lines is "how satisfying is it  to pay someone market rate and watch them work harder than you've ever  seen? How about for 20% less than market rate on the first 2 jobs?" And  then I fucking haul ass. My customers agree, they feel like it's too good  to be true. And the main reason I haul ass is to hit more jobs in a  day.  $5,000 times 52 weeks a year  is $260,000 a year. I had enough money to buy a van and hire 6 people  full time in under 2 months, and expanded to 6 vans and 17 employees, I  pay them $18 an hour but they have to haul ass like me, I work with  them. I hit $1.6 million net profit in under a year of starting.  Now  I'll say it again, people who are poor choose to be poor and deserve  it. I have a hard time starting a company that nets less than $200,000 a  year.  Especially with the  bullshit that is the current wage shortage (labor shortage my ass)  people should just start their own goods/service companies. And if you pick  an MLM, it's just natural selection at  that point.  The list goes on and  fucking on, this chain is easily possible. Power washing, landscaping,  hand for hire on Craigslist, reselling shit from China on Amazon with a  2000% mark up, wholesaling/flipping houses, and then renting single  family homes (currently the best return on investment and a bomb proof  retirement plan, passive income from appreciating assets)  And  these are all the legal ways to make millions, it's even easier if you operate like the people at the top do, it's a dog eat dog world, morals are something we pulled out of our clever little asses, power comes to those who take it and there are people that don't give a fuck about you taking yours RIGHT NOW, do something about it.	1642830537.0	s9vgbc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vgbc/people_who_are_poor_choose_to_remain_poor_and/	People who are poor choose to remain poor and therefore deserve it.

ip14603n	I truly believe your success in life is fate, IQ and intelligence have a very strong genetic component, In addition, most people who are rich inherited their wealth. Also, other factors that affect success are entirely based on luck and genetics people who are more attractive are more likely to get promoted and more likely to get hired in the first place. Not to mention if you look at places like new york, for instance, the majority of people who live in the poor areas are people of color. Your race is based of genetics, mental illness and learning disabilities are also highly based upon genetics and those things also greatly affect people's lives every day.   In addition, who your parents are also matters, for instance, if both your parents have a bachelor's degree you are far more likely to get a bachelor's degree in your lifetime. Success in life is based off genetics, and luck along with who your parents are people don't want to admit this because people believe in a just world fallacy. They think that poor people deserve to be poor because for lazy, or that women deserve the sexual assault because of the way they acted people refuse to accept that life isn't fair.	1642830739.0	s9vimi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vimi/your_success_in_life_is_determined_at_birth/	Your success in life is determined at birth

Problem is insurance companies make you pay the same amount to see any of them.

These movies look/sound amazing, have good acting etc. The story is up for debate, but if u would show one of those movies to a person that has never seen a SW movie, then I'm sure that they won't call it a complete cinematic failure  It's just star wars fans being star wars fans I guess   Just my opinion tho	1642846463.0	s9zgct	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9zgct/the_star_wars_sequels_arent_the_worst_thing_in/	The star wars sequels aren't the worst thing in cinema history
gm5tgqyo	Too many parents are absolutely fucking useless and an obligatory course on how to parent properly would at least increase the chances of them not being complete fuck ups.   In the course you should 1.) learn about basic care & hygiene 2.) personality development & building confidence 3.) mental well-being & developing a proper relationship. These things are actually pretty simple, so I find it sad that you have to tell many people nowadays because they are neglectful.

Also, there are a ton of vitams, minerals and things such as spermidine (which is proven to lengthen life span) in sperm which is beneficial.   And instead of just cumming good ol nutrients into your crusty ass sock why not recycle it so your body can make use of the nutrients and shit?   And anybody who says it's gross is just saying that because they got some internal fear of being perceived as gay or some shit, literally manliest thing you can do.

3uduwlqt	Having sex and wanting a child is not the same thing.  Even if u use condoms or pills u can get pregnant. Which is the reason why abortion is legal: because wanting sex and wanting a child are two different things. In Germany, women are even allowed to drop their children anonymously in hospitals if they don't want to be parents.  But why should men then be forced to be fathers or pay for the child, when women are allowed to choose not to be a parent after being pregnant and even after conceiving the child?  The fairest thing in the world is to allow men the same rights as women: to not want a child. ABORTION SHOULD STILL BE THE CHOICE OF THE MOTHER. But the father should have the choice to not want the child, losing all duties and priviliges he has over the child.	1642851936.0	sa0tgo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa0tgo/having_sex_is_not_the_same_as_wanting_to_become/	Having sex is not the same as wanting to become parent nor should it be

fdphc0v	Sorry not sorry.  I've talked to countless people who have some money management issues that could be fixed if they just go with what they normally use.  Netflix, Hulu, and other video streaming services are around $8-10 a month give or take. That averages around $90-120 a year roughly. If you don't use these services often, then why are you paying so much?  Same goes for XBOX live and PlayStation plus. If you're only using the service a few times a year, then why pay month to month.  There's also people who don't go to the gym but pay a monthly gym membership. I can't even.  When there's free ad-free radio apps like caprice radio, It's crazy how people pay for pandora or spotify.  I don't even want to get into car payments. You could buy a used Toyota and be fine and save $200+ a month and just get by on liability insurance to save even more money    There's people who have multiple subscriptions and payments and they complain that they can't put any money away to save, yet they made those spending choices and complain about living paycheck to paycheck.

5bwhv431	I work in mortgage lending and I’ve had it with these whiny crybaby’s. About half of the applications are from people born after 1985 and a decent chunk of them have combined household incomes of less than $60k/yr. Here’s the main differences between those who can afford the mortgage v/s those who can’t:  Can afford: student loan debt, a couple of non-store branded credit cards, sub$30k auto loans.  Can’t afford: student loans, several branded and non-branded credit cards spent to the max., auto loans over $50k.  Just spent over an hour with a “woe is me” idiot who was blaming everyone else under the sun for his financial straits. Both husband and wife making less than $15/hr (but WFH). Over $100k in student loan debts (pretty common for their age group) and almost maxed out Credit cards. Again, most of that generation has a pretty similar credit profile but here’s the kicker: they had an outstanding balance of $22k on an IKEA Credit Card and two auto loans (one for $55k and the other for $80k). I asked if the cars were in any way required for the work they do-No. Than what makes you go out and get cars with monthly payments that are preventing you from putting food on the table? Given what you earn just what did you need to fromIKEA for $22k? Every answer he gave me was how society had done him wrong. Did society make you go out and spend $150k on cars? Did society demand you get and max out credit cards from places like Kohl’s and IKEA?   Just when do people start taking personal responsibility for the situation they are in?

dldrdaxu	"It's the curse of the internet that's becoming more and more apparent these days.   I don't think people were meant to have access to the ability to instantly and bidirectionally communicate with several hundreds or throusands or even millions of people at once. I think our brains aren't adapted or possibly even ready to fully comprehend the consequences of that scale of social interaction.   Also the usual lack of a face or any personable elements online kinda makes it harder to empathise with people during online discourse.   Outrage is also the most viral and powerful emotions  to stir controversy and discussion online, and in an almost 'natural selection' kinda way out competes the other types of emotion expressed online (like joy, sadness).  The result is when stating a controversial opinion online, people are predisposed to take 'offence' and get angry at you, and are the most 'vocal' and hostile interactions. These outrage response end up strongly amplified in a positive feedback loop with other outraged people ad infinitum.   The result is a group of people mobbing one person with the most visceral and venomous responses, that don't see a person, just an opinion that they perceive to attack their identity. The dog-piling creates an echo chamber of outraged users, doing increasingly harmful things like harassment, death threats and doxxing etc.   And boom, from a single opinion, you are now the target of a vicious outraged Mob that wants you to at best be silenced, and at worst wants you to suffer and not exist anymore.  And this isn't even going into how some social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are deliberately designed to incentivise this kinda Mob behaviour because outrage and mobbing 'increases user engagement."	1642865571.0	sa4ya4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4ya4/hijacking_udiamondisnotcrashs_comment/	Hijacking u/Diamond-Is-Not-Crash's comment.

I have smoked weed off and on for years and sure sometimes it feels good, but it is over hyped.

We talk a lot about the environmental impact of products, fuel, travel etc, but not much about th eimpact of creating another human who will consume and affect the earth. I don't know if it's taboo, but I think it's very important to talk about.  I can imagine the rights to have children as being something tradeable.  The planet needs a bit of a rest from human activity it seems to me	1642869801.0	sa6ffv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa6ffv/we_should_have_a_global_limit_to_how_many_kids_is/	We should have a global limit to how many kids is allowed to have
apuiuyc4	[1 in 5 Maryland students are chronically absent.](https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-chronic-absenteeism-20180604-story.html) That stat rises to nearly 40% of students in Baltimore. [Another study shows that 83% of Baltimore students are chronically absent.](https://foxbaltimore.com/news/project-baltimore/city-school-with-83-students-chronically-absent-graduates-nearly-half#:~:text=Project%20Baltimore%20did%20some%20digging,2019%2C%20spiked%20to%2083%25.&text=If%20a%20student%20has%20more,they%20are%20considered%20chronically%20absent.)  You could pay teachers a million dollars per year, they're not going to drag the students in. This is a problem in parenting. The parent has to get the child to school. It's not the teachers' job to do that. It's solely on the parent.  Now this is an extreme example that illustrates the worst way parents raise their children. However you have to remember parenting is on a spectrum. These parents in Baltimore are doing the shittiest job they can. On a scale from 1 being the worst parents and 10 being the best, this is a 1. So here's the thing. Lets say the parents get them to school. Great. You got step 1 done, now the student has to be polite, respectful, and willing to learn(or reasonably so, they are kids after all.) The child has to be socialized to a certain degree in order to learn. And that's the parents' job. During the formative years they have to instill at least the basic amount of discipline and manners. If you have a classroom and 25% of the students won't stop talking no matter what you do. The teacher is fucked.  What's the teacher supposed to do? Suspend all of them? Then you get tons of bad parents who don't know how to socialize their child(because they were never socialized themselves) coming in angry at the school, not because their child is disruptive, but because they have to take time off from work to watch after their unsocialized child. So nothing changes here. Not only that, that 25% of disruptive kids are disrupting the learning of the other 75%.  While I lay blame on the parents, I'm not naïve enough to believe you can change them. How do you change these parents? These parents were once the children who were not going to school. They were the children who were disruptive in class. They were the children who were brought up unsocialized and chronically absent with no respect for education. As you get older your brain becomes less and less able to change and adapt. Your ability to learn and grow is hampered. So these parents are not going to change and you shouldn't expect them to. It's a vicious cycle.	1642870762.0	sa6rp6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa6rp6/the_biggest_problem_in_education_are_the_parents/	The biggest problem in education are the parents
6xkpgh8p	Unpopular bit: "Animals were here first" is not a good enough argument. In the wild, territories and resources have to be constantly defended from rivals who can take over them at any moment. Humans are just another rival. We may not be as strong as other animals, but we're damn smart, so smart that we can make pets out of the animals we think we can't rival. And that's exactly what made us a species so successful. By the law of the jungle, we deserve to be at the top of the food chain. We deserve all the land and resources we took from othee species.  Popular bit: But, of course, we're still part of the same nature we subjugate. Because we know more about it than the average mammal, it's also our duty to take care of it. We understand (I hope) that it's not wise to destroy the flora and fauna that give us food and make life in this world possible in the first place.

fobql	There are two kinds of lazy, smart lazy and stupid lazy.  Smart lazy means you put some effort into getting yourself into a situation where you can now get away with working less.  Stupid lazy means you just try to put in less effort with no consideration to the consequences.  Office workers are stupid lazy. Reddit and other message boards are full of office workers who talk about how they only really do a few hours of work a day, how they want to cut down from 5 days a week to 4 because they can easily get their work done in 4 days, and the latest is that they all want to work from home because they can't be bothered to get dressed and come in to work.  Here's what their stupid lazy is going to get them.  They cut down to 4 days a week, they cut out the office and just work from home.  Then companies figure out that they can pay someone in Iowa half the money, because rent in Iowa is $500 and you can buy a house in rural Iowa for $75,000.  Then companies figure out that they can pay someone in India 1/3 the Iowa salary, and the Indians will work 50 hours a week instead of the 30 that Americans were reluctantly doing.  Congratulations, you lazy fucks, you just outsourced yourself.  Now  you can go get a real job where you have to come in to work.  Nobody's going to be able to work from home in truck driving, nursing, warehouse work, restaurants, or plumbing, so you might as well figure out which of those you want to do now.	1642878909.0	sa9qxp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9qxp/officer_workers_are_stupidly_lazy/	Officer workers are stupidly lazy
86hm6ad8	I hear all the time where people say "trust the data," or "believe in the science." If they are extra sharp, they will have memorized a bunch of random statistics.  The problem with this is that most people have no idea where the data they are citing is coming from, and do not realize the general *potential* fallibility of research.    Research is susceptible to a wide variety of pitfalls (i.e. p-hacking, spurious correlations, sample/selection biases, funding bias, etc.).  In fact, the MAJORITY of published research is later found to be wrong or inaccurate in some measure.  So while I would separately argue that the entirety of the scientific process, over the vast expanse of time, eventually comes to truths, what most people are doing is quoting and "believing" in the results of a random research paper...and that is no different than believing in magic.	1642879010.0	sa9s7t	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9s7t/people_who_blindly_say_believe_in_the_science_are/	People who blindly say "believe in the science," are unscientific and might as well believe in magic.

222l00z1	I know that regular people litter and pollute, and large corporations (like 3M or DuPont) pollute even more. But it's world governments (mainly the US and USSR back in it's day) that should be doing more about global warming rather than pushing it off on the consumer.  Hundreds of nuclear bombs have been set off since it's inception. In the sea, and in the air. Hundreds of bombs have been set off IN THE ATMOSPHERE. In the early days, there was even concern that a nuclear explosion and set the atmosphere on fire and burn the planet. You're telling me that had nothing to do with global warming??  All that being said, I *try* to do my part. Avoid single use plastics, replaced sandwich bags with the silicone ones. If nothing else, it saves me some money.

ehnxxko5	If one household makes $100,000 a year and another household makes $300,000 a year, many people would assume the household that makes more money would be happier. This just isn’t true. Sure the household with more income probably has more expensive vehicles and a fancier home, but those people are most likely just as happy in life as the lower income household. Both households have things they want that they can’t afford and that never really changes. People always want more and that’s just part of the human condition.   More money will not increase your level of happiness once you reach a certain income. Most people need food, shelter, transportation, health insurance, a job, a retirement fun, and a family to be happy. They also need a safety net just in case a catastrophe happens such as illness or job loss. Once those things are met, money no longer will make most people happier in their day to day lives.  Families living in lower income households could increase their level of happiness with more money. I’m not saying a poorer family can’t be happy, but the stressors of living in a lower income household are great enough that money could relieve some of that tension. For example, when someone in a lower income family is diagnosed with an illness, a question they might ask is: how the hell are we going to pay for this? Not having those worries and that stress increases overall happiness.	1642883861.0	sabisp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sabisp/happiness_is_only_increased_by_monetary_gains/	Happiness is only increased by monetary gains when the increases wealth provides life’s essentials.

i6wz9yjs	March 2, 2020 Hayden, Alabama (Blount County)   Breana’s body was found shortly after 12:00 pm in her bathroom at her home according to her husband, Steven. She was an RN and had worked the nightshift from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am. After doing her reports, she would normally get home around 8:00 am.                            ·       I received a phone call from her husband, Steven at 12:23. Steven said, “Hey, what are you doing?” I told him I was at work and had just finished eating lunch, what are you doing? He then said, “Well, you better get over here, your sister has done tried to kill herself.” He said it so nonchalantly, I didn’t believe him, and asked if he was being serious.  ·       When I arrived at their house, there were a lot of ambulances and police cars lining the street.  ·       I walked in and saw Steven sitting in the living room with his parents on either side of him. He was staring at the floor. His parents both had tears rolling down their faces and seemed very shook up, while he sat there extremely calm looking at the floor.  ·       I asked him what happened and he told me “I was standing outside, and heard a thump, but didn’t think anything of it. I thought maybe she had dropped her cell phone.” “I then left to go to the bank and the dump, and was gone for about an hour. When I got back, I noticed that there was a light on in the bathroom, but the door was shut.”  ·       He said he picked the lock with his fingernail to get in and she was lying on the floor with her head to the door and that there was a needle lying beside her on the floor. This was an 18g needle. There were other unopened needles found at the scene of various sizes, however, all of the puncture wounds appeared to be from an 18g needle. She had been an RN for 12 years, and would have known not to use an 18g needle.  ·       Her body had multiple bruises and injection sites – about 80. Her feet and hands were covered in bruises and injection sites. Her palms appeared to have defense wounds and her feet had bruises that looked like fingermarks. However, these were on the inside of her feet and did not look like they could have been made from dragging her, but from someone possibly holding her down.  ·       Two of Breana’s co-workers have told us they did not notice any marks or bruises on her that night.   🚩🚩🚩Red Flags🚩🚩🚩 The investigator stated that the paramedics said he was practically tripping over them trying to remove garbage from the bathroom while they were trying to save Breana’s life.   He gave three different timelines of the events that happened that day.  The investigator told us that he and Breana were arguing back and forth over an affair while she was working that night. While Steven had told us that she was in a good mood and they had been cutting up all night by text.   He refused to let the sheriff’s office search his truck, and he refused to let them have his phone.   ·       He joked about his handwriting not being legible, when asked to write his statement, so I had to write it for him.  ·       One of the officers working the scene was a family member, therefore the investigator was reluctant to question Steven as needed.  ·       The home was searched, nothing was found. Also, the next day, my Mother and I went to get clothes for her to wear for her funeral. We searched her entire panty drawer from top to bottom to find a decent pair of underwear and did not see anything out of the ordinary. A few days later he had planted a bloody napkin in that drawer. These photos are attached in comments.  ·       Two days later, after Breana’s death, two empty vials of fentanyl were found in a drawer in the spare bedroom.   ·       Steven found more evidence later on but never reported it. When I asked if they needed that evidence, I was told they already had enough.  ·       Several items were planted throughout the home where Steven led me to find them. (This was about a week after her death).  ·       Before the investigator left to obtain a search warrant for his truck, she instructed the other officers to watch Steven’s truck and not to move it. According to the investigator, the truck had been moved when she returned, along with the garbage.  ·       His uncle, who is a deputy at BCSO and family were allowed to stay inside the home the entire time.  ·       I was told by the investigator that there were family members of Steven’s there before the paramedics arrived. The paramedics station is a block and a half from Steven and Breana’s home. His parents live 5 miles (8-10 minutes) away.  ·       The original investigator, has now been removed from the case and from the Blount County Sherriff’s Department.  Breana worked two jobs, one full time at Princeton and the other was a part time job at Birmingham Surgery Center.	1642885590.0	sac5e9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sac5e9/the_mysterious_death_of_breana_noojin_nix/	The mysterious death of Breana Noojin Nix

ig6pm94y	There is a misconception I have encountered in my life that social work and healthcare jobs are "easy" and "everyone can do them". This is absolutely not true, and it's completely valid to say that one cannot do this type of job, similarly to how some people cannot be good at other types of jobs.   Social work and healthcare jobs are absolutely not easy. They are some of the hardest jobs out there and yes, they do require a specific type of person to do well at them. Society really undervalues the type of skillset required to do these jobs. Just because in some cases being social worker does not require a degree, doesnt mean anyone can do it. I think pushing people towards jobs they cannot do is going to ultimately be very harmful. It creates inneficient, frustrated and angry workers, which could end up being a disaster for everyone.	1642890087.0	sadri5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sadri5/social_healthcare_work_is_not_for_everyone/	Social / healthcare work is not for everyone

aq84wsjs	Everyone's obsessing over Idris Elba, Tom Hiddleston, and Tom Hardy, but I truly feel James Corden is a terrific, unconventional, inspired follow-up to Daniel Craig.  1. Idris Elba, the current favorite for many, is 49 years old. Starting a Bond franchise at that age isn't ideal. James Corden is a fresh-faced 43. 2. We've done the suave, sexy, chiselled Bond to death (literally). James Corden can bring in a fresh angle to the story – how does an everyday guy without a supermodel body become the greatest spy in MI6? 3. With Hiddleston or Hardy, it'll be hard to differentiate their interpretation from Craig's because they're all so sexy. James Corden will naturally be completely different from Daniel Craig, 4. For anyone still concerned about his well-upholstered figure, he already lost 25-30 pounds over the last couple of years and has thus proven capable of a body transformation. 5. At 27M, he has among the highest subscribers for a late night show, allowing him to heavily promote the film and ensure financial success. 6. With Ocean's Eight, Cats, Cinderella, among others, he has steadily been building his acting resume and is primed for a big break.	1642896913.0	sag7pj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sag7pj/james_corden_is_a_great_pick_for_the_next_james/	James Corden is a great pick for the next James Bond.

But then I continued to scroll and seen a comment: “people who are anti circumcision.” In my head I thought “people are against this?” Of course I know what the procedure is and why most parents do it, but I’m also aware some parents choose not to circumcise their children, I just never knew why.

46n93q1i	Maybe one day I can get over this hang-up, but when I see pregnancy announcements I don't usually feel joy, I just feel jaded and sad. Children are seen as a blessing, but I see another carbon footprint. If children are blessings then the people they grow into must be too--but the average person isn't seen as a blessing or miracle, they're just another person.  This is going to sound so neckbeardy and I wish I knew how to phrase it differently, but whatever.. For me, to see children as a blessing is to see the growth of the human race as a blessing, and I don't. I value people as individuals but as a whole I see the way humanity digs its own grave and the collective problems we bring upon ourselves just by nature of our existence (not the fault of the average person-- we're just meeting our needs and I understand that) and I can't bring myself to let it go. Then, at worst, we obviously have people who intentionally inflict pain and suffering. Those people were once children too, but they're not blessings.  I know kids are a blessing to their families (as they should be) and I do think that all children should be protected and loved, but my anxiety about the world on a larger scale takes away from what otherwise would be a positive view of children.	1642904197.0	sain4c	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sain4c/i_dont_see_children_as_a_blessing/	I don't see children as a blessing.

Whenever I see or hear them, my belief that alcohol as an inherently dangerous thing is affirmed and is a firm contributer to sexual assault.  I also think the same things in regards to parties, specifically college parties, because due to the fact that alcohol and drugs are prevalent during parties. I once saw a statistic that said that 1 in 5 rapes that happen in college happen at college fraternities. Which is an insane statistic.  I also have known people who have done sexual crimes while under the influence. My sister, while drunk, tried to get one of my cousins friends to sleep with her, which was sexual harassment.

And them some cool dude comes to save the day and dig out the qualities of this uncomprehended person? Me too.   And, just to be clear, I do think that, most of times, people become lonely because they have problems to aproach strangers and talk to them. Making new friends is just too hard for some people. Hell, I am one of those people.   BUT, and there comes my unpopular opinion, sometimes, these lonely people simply deserve to be and stay that way.   Sometimes, they may have a nasty personality. Or may be too rude. Or narcisistic. Or manipulative. Or violent...  You get the point. Some of them are people that no one want around because of the simple fact that they are not worth the time and effort necessaries to build a relationship.  We don't live in a movie.

ek1wevo9	I see a lot of people who feel pressured to go to college based on the way things are nowadays, or enter into careers like engineering simply bc they are high paying when it is clear that it will not work for them and that they would be better off learning a trade or doing almost anything else.

7bwcbmco	In today’s world, it seems that no one really gives a shit if you say you’re sorry for something. It doesn’t erase the wrong, just reinforces your guilt. People don’t want to hear “I’m sorry”, they want you to have not done the thing you’re sorry for in the first place, myself included. I had a former friend apologize for all the shitty things he did and I could care less about his “apology”. I just wished those things never happened in the first place. I think a better phrase would be, “It’ll never happen again.”   If you demonstrate you’re sorry, like truly sorry, that’s one thing…like buying your roommate more ice cream after eating his without permission.

mro27fk	I’ll preface this with I have my own personal beliefs about college but I absolutely understand the difficulty that goes into getting accepted and attending one regardless of how flawed the institution of higher learning is particularly in America.   Posting that you got into a college, especially a competitive one, is something I have no problem with. It is an accomplishment a lot of high schoolers (as well as general adults) work hard for and sharing your accomplishments on social media is pretty common but when you make that your entire profile (including the college you’re attending in your bio, multiple posts about said college, discussing your frat/sorority politics,etc.) I truly don’t understand what’s to gain.   My biggest problem is that I feel like this, along with the media, creates a fantasizing image of the “college experience” and contributes even more to the culture that is cultivated around college in America. I’m currently in college and it’d be hypocritical for me to tell people not to go or not to post anything that would remotely attract others to college. It only irks me when it feels like a cult and it’s almost like you’re giving your college free advertising to convince other people why they should go into enormous debt because of your sororities matching uniforms.	1642918723.0	samznb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/samznb/making_the_college_you_attend_a_personality_is/	Making The College You Attend A Personality Is Weird

2glgahr3	There's several reasons for this. I just find it more convenient that during the winter all I have to do is put on another layer or two, and I'm warm again. During summer, when it gets really hot, you can only take off so many clothes before it turns illegal. Even being stripped, you still have the potential of being way too uncomfortably hot. I hate the heat.  I just find the cold more comfortable. I love the air in the winter; I like the increased darkness, the lack of insects, and the peacefulness of nature. Although snow looks really disgusting after days of sitting along a road, I love the way it looks when it's fresh.   I don't care much for winter sports, but I do occasionally like skiing. Its not a highlight of my liking for Winter. It's just an add on.   A part of me likes the cold because I find my peace and enjoyment being in very forested, mountainous and temperate areas of the world. Of course, these areas are colder, and thus, are more isolated. Because people don't like the cold. They prefer the heat. And being an introvert, I'm fine with that. I do like human interaction, but don't want to be bombarded in the hustle and bustle of modern society. I'd rather live a more simple life, in a small temperate town surrounded by mountains and big trees. And so, I like the cold because it makes me happy to think about me in this sort of peaceful setting.    That being said, I know humans are warm blooded. Naturally, we enjoy warmer weather. It feels really good to me on a really cold day to walk into a heated building, or step foot in a warm car. Or take a hot shower. BUT, at the end of the day, my opinion always falls on the cold side. I know this is very much an unpopular opinion, which is why I shared it to this community.	1642919418.0	san6fr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/san6fr/i_prefer_colder_weather_over_hot_weather/	I prefer colder weather over hot weather

844q1spo	I feel like so many people poke fun at young (or even older!) adults that like to go to Disney without kids and just enjoy the experience. I’ve never been to any of the Disney parks myself, but it does seem odd that so many people thoroughly DESPISE these adults and constantly make them the butt of their jokes.   Maybe I’m missing something, but I think it’s quite sad that adults are teased for being in touch with their sense of wonder. As a shy, nerdy young kid, I remember feeling warm and fuzzy any time I watched Mr. Rogers. Being in my 30s now, I still watch him from time to time and I still feel like I did all those years ago. I would hope that you all remember that despite the what the world might think, it’s okay to be childish sometimes. It’s okay to play and find wonder in the things around you. And if Disney is what does that for you, so be it.

4jkph2lf	It's 2022, religion doesn't serve quite the same function in society as it did at its onset. At one point it provided an explanation of the natural world and hope for the world thereafter but now it's clear that the major religions are just tools of ignorance and oppression.   To be clear I don't think every person who follows a religion is evil nor do I think we should necessarily remove it and it's history fro our cultures completely. However I do believe that religion is ultimately evil and if you support it you provide it a breathe of validity and are therefore complicit in its transgressions against humanity no matter how good your intentions due to the overwhelming proof that it's just a means for influential types to bend you to their will and if you refuse to see that then well, you're the asshole.

i2fzjb1h	I saw this YouTube video of a guy getting sentenced to 43 years in prison and he starts freaking out, crying like a baby, shrieking, and makes the guards drag him out of court. He robbed a dude at gunpoint and held him for 30 mins threatening to kill him.  It got me thinking that I totally agree with giving violent criminals like him lengthy prison sentences. If he only got 10-15 years maybe he could have a chance at being rehabilitated. Maybe we could spend millions and millions of taxpayer dollars trying to help this guy. Maybe it takes and he does better.  Then again, maybe he gets out and kills someone next time. Why should we risk it?  Statistically we know that the vast majority of violent crimes are committed by young people and that as you age you become less likely to do those kinds of things. So it makes perfect sense to keep violent criminals locked up until they are old.  Nothing will do a better job at changing someone's threat level than 50+ years of aging.	1642930921.0	saq2xm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saq2xm/lengthy_prison_sentences_are_better_than_trying/	Lengthy prison sentences are better than trying to rehabilitate violent criminals.

3tss0k76	First and foremost: Of course sexual harassment is never okay. Of course you should never feel unsafe. I am a woman in the nightlife and I have had some encounters that I got angry about.  However.  Right now I am experiencing a lot of woman getting angry over stuff that is not aggressive at all from the male's side. The "dont sexualize me" does not really make sense to me when you are on a bar. Many persons went there to flirt and maybe have sex. Also the women. Thats sexual. It is not bad to be sexual.   I do get that a guy wanting to have sex with me but I dont find him attractive is creating aversion inside me. But he did nothing wrong. I can just politely be like "I am not interested I am sorry, thank you for the compliment." If he doesnt stop after that then you can start to get annoyed. The thing is the same of my friends who will talk shit about a man for flirting with them unsuccesfully or call him a swine will be happy if a charming handsome man does it. But how should the men know if they are your type? Trying to get in bed with someone is not objectifying them. It is simply trying to get in bed with them.  Again, maybe this is because I live in a country where I am not in danger. I walk pretty safely on the roads, I can trust most men. Unless there is agresion, someone trying to have sex with me is not something I fear will turn into something bad. A catcall is not harassment to me. Its a compliment unless there is agression in the voice or they follow me.  In case this is very unpopular remember that that is the point.	1642933726.0	saqrcv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saqrcv/the_aversion_against_males_trying_to_get_in_bed/	The aversion against males trying to get in bed with us has gone too far.
1lvxy914	For the life of me I can not figure out how these brainless thugs deem it important that neighbors listen to their shitty music at 4:30 and have a positive reaction out of it.   In fact, multiple renters had knocked on their door at intervals throughout the night in vain to try to get them to turn down or shut off the music. Always some ignorant excuses for the said renters to return to their own room. Right after that, blasting till kingdom come again.  When I was in college, this was the norm every weekend, but at least they either still had the two brain cells left to afford the decency to turn everything off at 2:00 at the latest, or I could find some peace if I did a walk around campus just for fresh evening air. These people in this area clearly can’t be as decent as college frat kids.  As I am writing, they’ve switched to EDM and are still going at it. How the fuck do you sleep with this?  And Houston Police Department is still showing appreciation for taxpayer money as always. Routine “spell your street name, closest cross street, apartment name and number; yes sir, dispatch will be sent to xyz.” And guess what? Someone might get killed in that cesspool of a room because of some drunken brawl, and they still would not show up.  My family all work during the weekend. My mother has to be at work by 10:00. My brother’s schedule is always hectic. At my old job, I have to be at the office by 9:00. No exception. Well yes, I can rig my phone to ring right into my ears 20 times to be up for work. But it doesn’t take rocket science to see it’s not a sustainable and healthy way to live or work.  There is no excusing this behavior. It’s simply trashy. And if you have to deal with this kind of stupid and childish behavior every week and somehow still come out in defense of these thuggish subhumans, you either have the patience of a saint or a brain more useless than theirs.

I used to love wow back in the day then i got addicted to swtor and now i dont like any mmo but also i dont feel like good singleplayer games come out anymore. 2019 and 20 were probably the worst gaming years in a long time. (Btw im on pc so i only focus on pc games) i wonder if u guys feel like this too.. I thought new world might be fun but it sucked too.

38m55afs	I know this is an unpopular opinion because of the sort of reaction I get from folks when I tell them this. I find it odd/creepy if someone dates someone that is more than 2 years younger/older then them. I even hold this belief for adults. I find it weird if a 30 year old is dating a 40 year old. Like what? Couldn't the 40 year old just go for someone from their own age range? They had to mark up someone much younger?   Anyway this is just my opinion and I don't tend to tell this to people as it tends to get negative reactions. I've held firm in this belief since I was very young and don't plan to abandon it. I personally will never date anyone beyond the 2 year gap that I have in place. And the closer to my age that they are the more inclined I am to a relationship with them.  I feel similar regarding deep and personal friendships. I'd rather befriend people from my age range then some 50 year old.

9pu3c1w4	One claim people often make is that Tom Brady "had no choice" but to leave the New England Patriots, because he was underpaid, overworked, and underappreciated by Bill Belichick, Robert Kraft, and his team. While he had every right to accept a contract with a different team, the very premise that he had no choice because he was somehow a victim is just not the truth.   Tom Brady was paid comparatively less than many other quarterbacks of his tenure and skill, but he accepted those terms himself. Each team has a salary cap, meaning that they have a collective budget of salary for the entire team. Brady was given the choice to accept higher pay, but was told it would lead to other members of the team being cut, and he actively chose to accept the lower salary each and every time. That is a choice he made himself, he didn't have to do this.  Secondly, the claim of being underappreciated... how? Having a million fans screaming your name around the world is underappreciated? A cult of personality around you is underappreciated? How does this make sense?  Finally, he refused to be a team player and work with other members of the team to help them improve and advance. The last several years on the Patriots he is said to have been a difficult person to work with, believing that it was not his responsibility to help his team and that they were not good enough to work with him. That is his fault, not theirs, for choosing to have that attitude.  I am sick of the Tom Brady as a victim narrative. Spare the nonsense, please.	1642950880.0	savrve	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savrve/tom_brady_was_not_mistreated_by_the_new_england/	Tom Brady was not mistreated by the New England Patriots, and his leave was not inevitable or inherently moral.

Sure, I can see an argument for that but there people just automatically throw it on the list as if it's a given when there are probably at least 2 movies released every year that are overall more entertaining, better acted, better scripted, better edited and just better in general.    &#x200B;  Even Wizard of Oz stands up better than Citizen Kane does in every category I mentioned above.	1642951110.0	savuo6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savuo6/citizen_kane_is_not_the_greatest_movie_of_all/	"Citizen Kane" is not the greatest movie of all time, not even close.
fq9vinfj	Toilet paper is gross. The practice of using it is gross, and the end result is gross. Either you end up with a dirty ass, or you need to use so goddamn much of it that you waste a huge amount of paper to accomplish a task that can be easily accomplished by a small quantity of water. Or maybe you're one of those people who takes ultra clean crispy shits and this doesn't apply to you, but these people are few and fucking far between.  The whole reason the western world is addicted to toilet paper is because capitalism permits a system where corporations that benefit from your monthly spend of $20 on TP can afford marketing that stigmatizes other alternatives such as bidets, so that they can keep selling you a product that you hardly need and keep you hooked on the cycle.  A bidet attachment costs like $50, and can be used for years. The 16oz or so of water it uses costs basically nothing, and the end result is vastly cleaner and more sanitary. Furthermore, I have been to some countries where toilet paper can not be flushed because the plumbing doesn't support it, so you end up putting soiled toilet paper in the fucking trash, when all this could be avoided by simple, fresh water that every toilet in the world is already hooked up to.  I'm not here to put anyone's preferences on blast, but from a purely functional and economic perspective, toilet paper is a highly inefficient system (also requires municipal sanitation departments to do more work to separate solid waste from liquid waste) and the only reason it exists is because capitalism, through the magic of the dollar, has stigmatized a substantially more sanitary, economical, and environmentally friendly option.	1642951128.0	savuv8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/savuv8/wiping_with_toilet_paper_is_filthy_and_a_monument/	Wiping with toilet paper is filthy and a monument to capitalism at its worst
bxpnp1ae	Mandatory disclaimer, I *do* understand that many relationships are abusive in ways that are not blatant. I *do* understand that abuse can take on many different forms. I *am not* saying that abuse is only someone beating you or calling you the worst possible things in the history of language. With that out of the way, I do think that if you were to consider everything that people call abusive, well, abusive, there probably wouldn’t be one single healthy relationship in the world, of any kind - parent-child, spouses, friends, siblings, etc. Some of the things that the internet throws around as abusive are character flaws, different styles of communication / attachment / love language, cultural or generational differences. Things that can be annoying, sure, even downright upset I g, but hardly abusive.   The worst part of this is that, like with other things, it takes away a little of the strength of the word abusive and of really abusive relationships.	1642952120.0	saw7fo	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saw7fo/the_notion_of_an_abusive_relationship_is_way_too/	The notion of an abusive relationship is way too broad nowadays

4jlyg91e	*Obviously*, real life experiences are important. It is important that one has real experiences. People learn a lot from living their lifes, and not everything is learned in schools.   *However*, many people straight up misuse the fact that they have gone to "the school of life". The argument is mostly used by people with little to no formal education. Often, it is used in such a way that people say their opinion is more valid than others', as they apparently have less knowledge/experience.   The problem is that often, people with lesser education uses the point against people with higher educations/people with larger wealth etc. Doing so, they not only undermine the knowledge of others, but also assume that other people haven't had tough experiences/gone through hard times (...).

5b7qkst2	Not sure this qualifies as unpopular opinion, but in social media, and recently just noticed/realized that in r/FreeCompliments r/FirstImpression and r/DemEyesDoe that a lot, at least, of the women who post feel the need to show off their bodies, versus their beautiful smiles, eyes, etc.  Girls, you don't need to show cleavage, wear tight clothes, etc. to be beautiful, to show off your amazing eyes, and to even ask people what their first impression is of you. I honestly believe that the most confident girl is one who knows her beauty ultimately is her personality, her smile, her sparkling eyes, etc. She doesn't feel the need to dress seductively, for lack of a better word, for others to like her and for her to be attractive. You want people to notice your smile first, or your eyes, or your laugh, personality, etc. Not your body because that wont always stay the same amd if people (guys especially) like you first or most or only fir your body, it's superficial and no girl deserves that. Our looks should be the cherry on top,not the primary focus, if that makes sense. Social media is so much about looks, and a lot of it, like Instagram is fake.  I'm healthy, in shape as best as I can be atm, have an hour glass figure, oval face shape, and almond shaped eyes, but I sure as heck don't feel the need to show off my body, I want others to like me for my personality, my smile, eyes, etc. not only for my body or really not my body at all.   Hopefully that all makes sense. Girls, you're beautiful and your bodies are beautiful, but you should be loved and liked more so for who you are, personality, etc. not purely your body. You are priceless and so much more than your body, and if anyone treats you otherwise, please cut them out of your life.	1642953439.0	sawo63	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sawo63/girls_feeling_like_they_need_to_show_off_their/	Girls Feeling Like They Need to Show Off Their Bodies to Be Attractive

bxpnp1ae	I’m sure many people will say that this is popular, but I’d argue that on Reddit it very much isn’t. If you go in any thread at all about anything marginally related to someone in the age bracket of 18-20 years old, you will see a bunch of comments acting like if they do not have a job, or still live at home, or act in any way differently then what a “mature adult” should, they’re lazy, losers, they have been raised wrong, stuff like that.   18 year olds are not adults. You don’t turn an adult magically at midnight when your 18th birthday comes. *This* is a very childish idea.    Besides, even science nowadays agrees that your brain and body are not fully developed until you are about 25, anyway. The acne you have at 22 is still considered teenage acne by dermatologists. The general shape of your body at 23 is still not seen as fully “set” by P.E. professionals. Your hormones are still a mess at 21. Why do we act like suddenly at 18 you should have figured it out, act like a mature adult, etc?   This is coming from someone who was very precocious, by the way. It’s not about my personal experience, more about how annoying it is to see people here on Reddit and on the internet in general bashing 18 year olds for not being fully-grown adults when… they aren’t.	1642954636.0	sax4im	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sax4im/18_year_olds_are_not_adults/	18 year olds are not adults

People would rather harm everyone around them for their own benefit instead of collectively helping society.  The “freedoms” places like the US has leads to this false lie that everyone with a problem, whether it be crime, homelessness or drug use, is their fault because we’ve built a narrative that collectivism is bad. That there’s no way these people are victims of the environments we’ve made by selfishly neglecting others for individual game.  I can go on forever. Too much freedom is bad.

9579b5pr	Spiritual formats have gotten so closed minded and are more focused on "the rules" of something. Whether it's tarot, meditation, bone throwing, praying, yoga, crystals, etc.  Spirituality is a practice, not a religion. It's not "cultural appropriation" that someone is doing Vipissanā while listening to Buddhist quotes or Christian music. Just because you practice a combination of spiritual beliefs doesn't make you a colonizer or appropriator.  Respect having cultures having closed practices, but stop hating on people who are actually informed and want to reach enlightenment is their own respected way.

It’s hard to find a good movie that isn’t a glorified television episode or a multimillion dollar hi tech comic book/real life Saturday morning cartoon.   The studios are rarely making original movies that don’t set themselves up for a sequel. Even good trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” was followed by a corrupted version of “The Hobbit”.

Lincoln caused a civil war over freeing slaves that divided the country and still has caused divides today.

ccovtxtm	To me drinking alcohol on a consistent basis leads to nothing beneficial. The euphoria fades very quickly after the first drink and it just becomes sloggish and tiring the following day and the rest of the night. To me it's honestly comparable to doing Benadryl or DXM in effects and hangover, it's just not worth it and also fucking highly addictive for what little it gives you. Coke and Molly are hella dangerous in their own right, yeah. However, coke gives you more of a nightlife/party drug advantage and it introduces you to a lot of new people or girls if you try not to abuse it too hard. The same thing can be said about molly. DMT and psychedelics introduce you to a fascinating world in its own right and can be mystical or magical experiences. Drugs like methamphetamines and heroin are considered the worst drugs because of how addictive they are, but the highs are allegedly so goddamn powerful that more than often, the addiction is "worth it" in a sense for that individual. Alcohol objectively has all the negatives of drugs combined. It has bad comedowns, the high isn't worth the addiction, it doesn't really open you up to new social horizons like molly and coke do, it doesn't give you any mystical experiences, and you can blackout and vomit everywhere and mysteriously have your roommate vanish for the next few days... Yeah fuck alcohol.	1642974866.0	sb50qh	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb50qh/alcohol_is_the_shittiest_drug_ever/	Alcohol is the shittiest drug ever

d6wmlauf	Unless you’re extremely lucky and was able to find a therapist that you can connect with and truly understand where you’re coming from, therapy can get really toxic.  Most therapists go to school to study in order to become good therapists but I feel like that’s only half the training. I feel like therapists need more experiences in life to understand their clients more in order to give proper advice. And I’m sure therapy can be great in the beginning, because who doesn’t like a new perspective. But going forward and to build and maintain that connection in order for the patient to truly open up and trust the therapists advice is harder to come by.

All you are doing is seeking help from random people on the internet to diagnose a “tip of the iceberg” problem that more than likely stems much much deeper than what you think it does.  Speaking from experience, solving one issues that you THINK is a problem will only temporarily prolong the deeper issues. Relationship dynamics are extremely unique to you and your situation.

rk1og	I would really like to see some other people in big roles for a variety of reasons.   For one, I’m really tired of seeing the same people cast over and over again. Most recently I saw Leonardo de caprio as a scientist in “don’t look up”. Ok, cool, so versatile! How about, literally any good actor for that role? Or Brad Pitt as an astronaut in whatever that movie is called. Give me a break, besides the break in immersion I get every time I try to watch one of these movies.  Another reason this bugs me is that I see billions of dollars flowing to a relatively small group of actors. Sure it’s good for them, I’m sure they love mopping up all the money in the industry. But this is just the same kind of insane inequality we see everywhere in our society, magnified dramatically.   I know some will argue that it’s just good business, people want to see the same people over, and over, and over again. And that therefore you want to hire from this tiny pool of people so your movie makes more money. Maybe that’s true, maybe it’s not, but it’s certainly the justification given.   Either way, I’d like to see any number of literally thousands of men and women who are skilled actors filling these roles. Both to get more great actors in the mix, to give more the ability to make a good living in the field, and because I’m quite tired of seeing the same old people in these roles.  Just to clear it up ahead of time, no I’m not a jaded actor, or doing anything related to the industry whatsoever. I actually work in one of the few remaining meritocracies so no complaints here.	1642980521.0	sb766q	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb766q/im_really_tired_of_the_same_cadre_of_actors_being/	I’m really tired of the same cadre of actors being cast across movies

4pp8ns2p	Back in the old, wild west, days of the internet it felt like certain jokes/images/gifs gained popularity more organically than today. People found something funny because they captured a zeitgeist or they were an in joke for a particular little community where the meme was almost like part of a cultural language; or they were used to communicate something where if you knew, you just knew. People didn't seem to set out to create memes, people just wanted to have fun and some things took off. It was fun to watch something grow out of obscurity or to watch people going "what the fuck is this?" knowing that you got it because it came from *your* community.     These days, if they're not outright manufactured by an advertising company they're being churned out by meme-mills like r dankmemes where people just throw shit at a wall and see what sticks; or they're something totally random that's been catapulted into orbit by some social-media-influenza with more followers brain cells.

The harsh truth is Russia can do without Europe but Europe needs Russia in the form of gas.

csx47car	Every bit of stored nuclear waste has more energy value in it than it started with. That’s why we use ‘breeder reactors’. The design purpose the nuclear reactors was to create plutonium for bombs, which has an even higher energy value than the uranium used to make it. When a fuel pellet is pulled out of a reactor it has a layer of "ash" on it that contains the plutonium as well as other byproducts of uranium fusion that slows the process efficiency, and the pellets get removed for reprocessing which removes the ‘ash’ and the good fuel underneath can be put back to work in a breeder reactor, and the plutonium can go into another of a variety of power supplies designed to maximize its potential.  The reason we have un-reprocessed nuclear fuel in storage is because of nuclear arms treaties limiting the amount of processed plutonium anyone can have at any time, and we basically don’t use any except in radio isotope generators for space craft. We could easily dispose of it safely and permanently by casting the pellets in leaded glass and dropping them down 30,000’ deep bore holes; no worries. We could even drill the holes in a reactor pattern and dump the reprocessed plutonium down hole to flux away where nothing gets harmed, and use it to power a geothermal type plant for hundreds of years.  We do not have nuclear waste, we have bomb materials storage. That’s why mankind doesn’t see any benefit out of nuclear energy, compared to what is available. And that’s why we learn about nuclear wast and all the problems, to keep us from demanding it done right. If we had full value from nuclear energy,  [Our 4500 year old scarcity based economy](http://www.urbanagandenergy.org/evolution-explained/) that profits from exploiting human suffering ends, and [the Hydrogen Economy](http://H2space.org)begins and we switch to excess based Nash Equilibrium economics that allow us as a species to finally industrialize space and start really moving on.

8df848ud	First of all I want to say that everyone is different and if you don't agree with this that's perfectly fine I'm not expecting everybody to believe the same things that I do.  1. Everything is basically legal besides sex in high school. Like you can't smoke you can't drink and you barely can drive so why would something so mature be giving two immature people just learning life. It's bound to basically be a mistake.  2. Most people in high school will use it as a way to get away from life as an unhealthy coping mechanism. Not everyone does it for that but when it happens it's too late and then they are bound to do it again until eventually they finally come to their senses and when they realize it kind of leaves a little bit of an indent.  3. Most sexual assault victims in high school never come out because they feel as though they are too young and never will be believed. Why give something so powerful to people who aren't ready for it's yet. Not many victims come out in high school because they are too young and inexperienced. The orange ready to have to go through so much trauma so early in life  4. America has one of the highest teen mom pregnancies in the world and in a lot of generations. Even though some schools are actually teaching it safely many people are still getting pregnant I feel as though even though you can teach something so early not many people are going to listen making it a double edged sword. Even if you try to normalize it so young not many people will listen and trust your advice so you normalize something that many people probably aren't going to listen to you and by allowing this you are allowing more people to enact something they are not going to safely do.  5. Believe me when I say a lot of people have regretted the first time and it usually ends up happening in high school when I've talked to a lot of people most people who regret it are in high school as opposed to people who waited until after high school to lose it even though some have regretted it After High School I feel as though it's much lower.  6. We used to have to have kids so young in life over fear of a lot of things when we were Neanderthals. So many things could essentially kill you and that's why in theory we had to reproduce so young because we didn't have much time. But as our average age expectancies Rose it allows us to basically have a longer span of time to do things such as schooling. At the time we weren't able to have much schooling besides basic learning as we grow older because we did not expect to live on. But with Society we don't need to rush into things so carelessly. Now we can wait to do a lot of things that we couldn't before because we didn't have the time to still having kids so young is essentially a flaw. Society expects more from us considering we don't have to have kids so young and we can wait on them while we practice something we desire a degree on or even study up on a few things before calling to college.  7. Many Teen Moms acts out as they are older such as going to parties or things of that matter when their kids are able to do things for themselves or when they have more time. I've met people who act too childish at times because they spent their entire youth guarding a child and trying to be a parent and they never were able to potentially grow up. Just because you have to grow up doesn't mean you actually do grow up permanently.  8. The amount of people who accidentally get somebody pregnant high school and then just stopped caring about the child is insanely High or they just stopped caring as much. The mental strain that it has on the single mom of a high school student is never talk much about. Most moms don't get the spotlight of being able to have a success story on Tik-Tok. We all think so many moms have such good lives because Tik-Tok make it seem that way especially when all the success stories are from people who got out of that bad situation. But what about all the Teen parents who had their kids taken away or who was never able to see their kids again.  9. Giving such a mature role to somebody who is Childish doesn't often mean they are going to become a mature nor does it mean they're going to make the right decision. Most likely normalizing it will give our generation much more problems than we realize. I don't know why we have so many fourteen-year-old mom's but it scares me because I feel like people around them made them mature when they didn't have to and their youth was taken away the moment they had a child. You can still live your life but many of your friends will leave and you don't have as much support as you want to believe  BTW if you are a Teen Mom don't take this negatively I don't think any child is a bad choice they are all blessings I just don't really think sex is something we need in high school. And I hope all of the moms out there who had kids too young are well and safe but I think we have to somehow change this before the Next Generation. I think that people need to accomplish their goals before having to stop them.

If you've tried therapy, you've tried medication, you've tried to change the enviroment you're in, you've tried 101 things and over years you're still in a pit of depression/suicide, I think you deserve to end your suffering.

6gtynmc	Listen, he was an asshole and his behavior was entirely unacceptable. We all agree on that. However, I really think people should consider the entire situation. He went in that shop and ordered a drink for his son, specifically requesting it not have any peanut products in it because of his son’s peanut allergy. His son drank the smoothie and then had to be rushed to the hospital to be treated for his severe allergic reaction. I don’t think it’s completely insane for a father in his position to lose his shit a little bit. I get that he went way over the line and said racist shit and everything, but I mean come on, he was surely afraid for his son’s life (or at least general well being) and then he lost his job and is being shit on by pretty much the entire internet.

3tweixm4	I would like to preface this by saying that I do not and never will condone injuring, killing or causing physical harm to anyone. My opinion is based on the premise that these actions are necessary to preserve human life and therefore the sacrifice of human life is counter to the motivations and goals of my proposal.  I believe that in modern times, we have lost the capacity to conceptualize the notion that moral actions do not always fall under the rule of law. We have put the world into the hands of people who are actively destroying it for their profit. The oil pumps, the pipelines, the landfills and the garbage islands are a direct result of the actions of a conglomerate of elites who have put their needs above the needs of the many. Their primary motivation being profit and greed, the inability to produce wealth would therefore pressure them into complacency under the threat of gradually diminishing profit.  Destroying the means to produce pollutants, distribute or access them would lead to a positive result after a sufficient period of time. Sabotaging or destroying equipment destined for those ends seems to me to be a reasonable option, as long as loss of life and injury are not a consequence of that sabotage.	1643001481.0	sbe6sg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbe6sg/some_forms_of_property_destruction_and_industrial/	Some forms of property destruction and industrial sabotage are morally correct as a form of activism.

gnggu9xj	For whatever reason, it’s become an unpopular opinion today that parents aren’t allowed to have their own set rules in the name of “pushing their kids away.” I got blasted by other parents because I grounded my daughter (17F) and have disallowed her from using her car because I found condoms in her glove compartment. She also isn’t allowed to see her boyfriend (18M) If she doesn’t like it, she can leave once she is 18. But my rule was no sex. Yes, good job for being safe about it- but do you applaud a drunk driver for wearing a seatbelt?!

Humans are highly social beings and not having anyone to share intese intimacy with that goes beyond sex or being a close friend, will leave a lot of people very alone and sad at the end of the day.   On the other hand, i think a lot of people aren't able to provide this kind of intimacy to each other which makes being with them worse than being alone!	1643010659.0	sbgs7s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgs7s/normalising_being_alone_is_a_quite_dangerous_road/	Normalising "being alone" is a quite dangerous road we are heading down.
63zdpkls	I think every instalment after Syndicate just lost the unique story and passion we know old Ubisoft for.  Don't get me wrong, Syndicate was nowhere near AC2 in terms of quality, but it was clearly the end of their thematic tone after 2015.   Everything after 2015 felt like a generic RPG. Origins, Odyssey, Valhalla, they felt NOTHING like the Assassins Creeds we grew up and loved. I am not a gatekeeping elitist, and I am not against games changing the formula IF it's done properly and with a clear goal in mind. But these new Assassins Creed games feel soulless. Sure they might look a bit better, and the mechanics feel smoother (other than the stealth, there is no stealth in these new games Lmao), but they haven't got any heart.  These new instalments are shit, and the reason I think that this is an unpopular opinion is because most people actually seem OKAY with the diversion in story quality from these games. They're okay with it because the mechanics and graphics are cleaner, at the expense of decent writing and an engaging story/interesting characters.  If you think these games are overall good, that's fine, but you don't like them for being Assassins Creed games.	1643012689.0	sbhbcj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbhbcj/the_latest_assassins_creed_games_suck/	The Latest Assassins Creed Games Suck

xbv17	First of all, sports fandom is kind of a weird thing in it of itself. I love sports and am a fan of my teams, but I think it's kinda lame when grown ass adults get super emotionally invested in whether their team wins or loses, and i definitely used to be that type of person as a teen and young adult. I do feel some nerves during crunch time of the games, but i dont let the outcome really affect me that much. if they win, dope. if they lose, oh well.  Also, the people that try to gatekeep fandom are super lame to me. Sports are really just an entertainment product, so there isn't really a right or wrong way to consume them. there is nothing wrong with being a fan of certain players and rooting for them individually, rather than having a specific team that you root for. And people always talk about being a diehard fan of a shitty team, like that earns them sympathy points, and act like its a taboo to switch to being a fan of another team. If I'm a fan of a team that's inept and their ownership is shitty, then that team does not deserve my support.

1zrx17vd	TL;DR version: 5G towers are not a threat to aviation, and airlines are lying to you because corporations want control.  Cell communications do not interfere with avionics. The recent uproar over the 5G towers near airports is not based on any actual concern for safety, but as a method of exerting unnecessary control over people. Tough understand how this sounds, this isn't some tinfoil hat conspiracy. Allow me to explain.  They continually make the same comments about general cellphone usage. This simply isn't true. First, we need some numbers. Cell towers have an effective range of about 500yds and a power consumption of about 1-1.5kw. the FAA also generally requires roads to be at least 1000 feet away from the end of a runway.  Signal strength drops off with the inverse-square law. That means that the signal degrades very rapidly. Beyond the effective range of a transmitter, you may not even be same to detect it. With a 5G Tower, you hit about 3% of the transmitted power at the distance between the end of the runway and the transmitter.  So you have a cell tower that can pump RF out to 500 yds. But at that range, you have a few (as in single digit wattage) of RF getting to a plane.  But it gets better. General aviation, something like a little Cessna 172 or Piper Cub, generally operate between 500-1000ft. This means that small aircraft regularly fly in the "danger zone" of 5G. This happens with systems less hardened to RF radiation than larger aircraft. However, they experience no ill effects. Yet you are supposed to be worried about what'll happen to an objectively better-engineered aircraft that was designed to survive direct lightning strikes.  Now, RF emissions can screw with aircraft. On an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, the AN/SPY-1D has a power consumption of about 6MW. So 3-4,000 times the amount of energy in a 5G tower. And when the Navy conducts flight operations on such a ship, they need to create a cutout in the radar for a helicopter to approach. But this is usually done at a distance of a few thousand years. So again, 5G could be a problem, but only if it was at several hundred or thousand times the power of the current antennas.  So why create all this commotion? Why tell us to put phones in airplane mode to begin with? Well, a fast moving cell phone can cause a lot of network congestion. You can move between multiple cell towers quicker than the cell towers can refresh and drop off your moving cell phone. With several airplanes with several hundred people each, this can basically create a cell phone blackout around an airport. Each person is simply tying up space on multiple towers simultaneously, and the system just bogs down. The FCC, not the FAA, is the interested party in this case. They are the ones who pushed for airplane mode functionality on phones.  As for the airlines themselves, there must be some financial motive or underlying psychopathy from the CEOs that's driving this. 5G functionality near airports substantially undercuts the ability to sell Wi-Fi inside the airport, which many airports and airlines use for income. It wouldn't surprise me that the lost money from airport Wi-Fi subscriptions is financial cause enough to try to make cell phones unusable near an airport. Or maybe it's simply the fact that one in five CEOs are complete psychopaths, with no redeeming human characteristics. Maybe they just like the fact that they can take away your ability to call for help.  Regardless of the reason given, the concerns over cell phone use and air travel are fake. The planes avionics are more than capable of handling whatever RF transmission or EM spectrum radiation that a cell tower, cell phone, laptop, or even a lightning bolt puts out. But here we are, having corporations deciding what we can and can't have, and nobody bats an eye. Nobody wants to be well informed enough to tell a corporation to fuck off for the benefit of the people. I guess that's what they call late stage capitalism.	1643023158.0	sbjybu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbjybu/the_5g_risk_to_aviation_is_made_up_to_control_you/	The 5G risk to aviation is made up to control you

2onb7jl5	This recently came up again in one of my internet circles: Oh, it's such a good thing that Disney cast a black actress to play Ariel in the live action *The Little Mermaid*.  No. It's not. It's lazy is what it is.   Listen: as much as people hate to admit it, the majority of Disney fairy tale movies come from Britain and Germany. Most of them are bastardized (yes, I am using that word correctly, thank you) versions of the *Grimm Fairytales*. (And if you don't believe me that the fairy tales have been mangled, let me remind you that the word "grim" in the English language does not mean "happy" and there's a reason for that.) Others (such as *The Little Mermaid* specifically) come from Hans Christian Anderson, who was Danish. Which, again, is from that tiny little bit of Europe.  Branch out. Africa has mermaid lore. South America has mermaid lore. (Hell, South America has *freshwater* mermaids!) These mermaids are all different! You can even branch out! Chinese mermaids are different from Korean mermaids which are different still from Japanese mermaids.  I think it says a lot that the most popular Disney movies are Moana and Encanto, and neither one of them are based in freaking *Europe*. That mine has been tapped out, close it and open a new one somewhere else. Anywhere else! For crying out loud, Disney hasn't even tapped Irish, Scottish (*Brave* was just the tip of the iceberg of stuff they could do there), French, *Russian* fairy tales and folklore.  In short: if you're going to give me a black mermaid, Disney, then I damn well expect a black story to go with her (or him).	1643026975.0	sbl10f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbl10f/i_think_disney_is_just_being_lazy_at_this_point/	I think Disney is just being lazy at this point.

You parents and adults that think you remember childhood, very, very likely don't actually remember it.  You remember that you went through those feelings, sure.  But you don't actually remember what it truly felt like.

The comments on that thread are filled with self-righteous, disgustingly schadenfreude-riddled redditors going on about how saying ‘no peanuts’ is different to saying ‘my son has a peanut allergy’. How TF do any of these redditors know that he didn’t specify the allergy to the Robeks staff? For all we know, he could well have emphasised it.	1643031726.0	sbmhpe	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbmhpe/not_a_single_redditor_knows_whether_james/	Not a single redditor knows whether James Iannazzo specified his son’s peanut allergy or not
52eeclje	As the title goes, I never get the point of camping, it’s basically people looking to put unnecessary efforts on themselves.  It’s not like picnic, where you bring pre-made or ordered food and stuff to hang out with your friends with a short period of time. I don’t understand why do people have to suffer and prepare extra chairs, camping necessities and cooking food in nature, it could be cold or hot, with uninvited bugs, it’s not hygiene and most places are not equipped with proper amenities, not to mention doing the dishes.  Lastly, the idea of sleeping in car or in a camp outside on purpose it’s just mind-blowing, why would you suffer when you have a real shelter built for people (home) to prevent you from extreme temperatures, rain, snow or wind, etc. The idea of sleeping out can never be more beneficial than sleeping in your own bed, I really don’t understand why people suffer from this.  I can see the point of chilling in nature or parks for a certain period of time, like picnic, but sleeping out and cooking on scene is going way to far, you’d need proper sinks, pan, stove, oven, and dishes to make dishes, building everything on scratch and using those camping stuff are always leaving trashes behind and make it extremely troublesome. You’re not meant to have modern dining outside, we’re not primitive anymore, except for like a small barbecue bonfire session, I really don’t applaud for the idea of bring silverware and pans there.  Sorry for my English, also a bit overwhelmed by the only camping experience where I got really sick (equipped with everything), don’t know if any of you feel the same!	1643032797.0	sbmu21	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbmu21/i_really_hate_camping_and_dont_understand_it/	I really hate camping and don’t understand it

4o6fyy3z	I tried to post an actually helpful, non dogmatic, centrist opinion about our current world state can be resolved via UBI, merely offering an idea of how we can end our problems and not stating any misinformation whatsoever, but because of the filter, it was not allowed.  To respect the rules of this sub, I will will refrain from sharing what I wanted to share, but how helpful is the battle against misinformation really if it prevents good ideas too...not saying we should allow people to spew hate and lies and unfounded claims...but to deny people the right of asking questions and sharing helpful centrist concepts for difficult topics seems backwards to me...the perfect recipe for staying where we are and not growing. If we can't talk about it how can we resolve it? If its mentionable its manageable as Mr. Rogers would say.  Its not better to be safe than sorry all the time and the limitation of free speech really needs to be carefully examined at how far we take it and the risks it causes in terms of preventing actually helpful ideas to be seen.

With that said, self care is so crucial and being miserable isn’t going to lead you to success.   You don’t get brownie points for crying yourself to sleep every night. Or overeating and drinking too much because you’re stressed. When you’re diagnosed with cancer, like my dad was, no one’s going to care that you spent 30 years grinding.

Also, if you're an adult with crooked teeth then get a consult from an orthodontist. There are more reasons to fix your teeth besides aesthetics.  However,  aesthetics are the main reason because of the social consequences that percolate to every aspect of life.

There are entirely too many functioning alcoholics among us who are in grave denial. People around us enable us because it makes them forget about their own alcohol problem and feel less guilty.   People should have to go through mandatory counseling about I'll effects of alcohol and long term excess consumption before they're allowed to drink legally.  Suburban bars encourage drunk driving.

3yrrmzii	I am a guy in my mid 20s. Due to this I get a lot of posts about people my age not knowing what they are doing in life. Working dead end jobs, failing out of school and just feeling overall lost in life.   Due to this there a lot of social media influencers who have gained popularity by telling in my age group that it is "ok" to be lost and not have a clue what you are doing. That eventually you will figure things out and to not stress about it.   I understand that not everyone's life works out they plan and that major life events can derail anyone's progress. But telling young people to not stress about having no plans or goals in life is horrible for their future.   I also understand that people can get a "late start" in their lives and still be very successful. But spending years of your life failing to start shouldn't be normal.   Not knowing what you are doing in life should be stressful. It should keep you up at night. It should be the main thing on your mind most days. As much as it sucks having a good career and being financially stable is something you have to spend years working on.   A vast majority of people my age are wasting years of their lives avoiding their problems and big decisions. Wondering what they want to do or feeling "lost" but never trying to solve the issue. Living in their mom's basement trying not to think about the fact that they are losers.     It is ok to take some time to figure yourself out and what you want to do. But actually spend the time thinking and exploring options not smoking weed in your childhood bedroom. Go back to college, learn a trade, get a certificate. Do something before half your life is gone.	1643038295.0	sbormp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbormp/no_knowing_where_you_are_going_in_life_is_ok_not/	No knowing where you are going in life is ok.

lmn8xk0	I often come across posts or video where someone has flipped out and it seems like the entire web goes out for blood.  For example: the recent video where the Florida father flips out at a smoothie bar for peanuts being added to a drink of someone allergic to them. I’m not saying what he did was acceptable (it wasn’t). However as a parent I can see why he was upset and angry. As an online community it’s wrong to pass judgment on someone on a 30-90 second video. The online rage has cost this man his career and his reputation. Do we as a community have that right? Should he be accountable for his actions? Absolutely, but that is not for you or I to pass judgment on. That’s for law enforcement and the courts to decide.   What if it was your child that had the allergic reaction? How would you react?	1643038766.0	sboxr0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sboxr0/vilifying_someone_on_social_media_without_context/	Vilifying someone on social media without context is wrong.
508pd6o7	A push in allot of major universities is to remove Greek life especially fraternities in regards to sexual assault and alcohol. Removing these organizations will cause more harm than good.   Fraternities are governed by both Governing bodies and the schools them selves. Members often have the highest GPA on campus There houses have to be zoned and special built in order to handle large amounts of people. Sexual assault in fraternities (when governed well) is dealt with quickly and severely. International chapters want to keep there image. In a fraternity party you know who is there.   If these governed organizations were removed the increase of apartment parties and underground fraternities would blow up. These are dangerous because there is no oversight. Hazing Sexual assault and drugs run rampant and it’s much harder to deal with accusations because of the openness of the party.	1643039253.0	sbp43y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbp43y/removing_greek_life_in_university_will_not_stop/	Removing Greek life in university will not stop Sexual Assault but Encourage it

ds3kaez5	I always see these videos of "Shopping Cart Police", or "Shopping Cart Narcs".  If you haven't seen them, it's basically either random people, or workers at a grocery/supermarket.  The go around berating people, attempting to force them to put the shopping carts back into the designated holding areas.  First of all, these people generally take an asshole tone.  They "demand" it, often in a way that comes off as almost threatening.  Big strong men telling 50+ year old ladies "believe me, you're going to put it back" comes off as threatening to me.  And it just comes off as entitled as hell.  A dude whose job is to go around and collect the cart starts being rude, and getting on his moral high horse because you're making his job harder... as if it's everyone's full time job to make his HEROIC job easier.  They act like they're EMS or firefighters, or soldiers, and you're disrespecting their difficult jobs that are so vital to society.  I get the idea.  And a few years ago, these videos were actually funny, because the people doing them weren't assholes.  They'd simply ask you to put your cart back, or JOKINGLY/IRONICALLY make it into some serious thing.  But now, these people are actually being serious.  They think it's some heinous moral offense, and that you're a bad person if you're not putting your cart in the holder.  For whatever reason these videos are all over reddit now, and it's cringe.  I feel it's emblematic of a problem in society as a whole of people feeling so entitled that even cart people are now feeling like their human rights are violated when they actually have to gather carts.    To me, it'd be like a maid from a Hotel berating you for not making your own bed, or not keeping your room perfectly tidy, which makes her do more work.  THAT IS YOUR JOB.  I am a janitor for my job.  I don't go around berating customers when they drop little bits of popcorn, and pretend they are evil people for making my job harder.  Because that is my job... it's not their job to worry about the floor being clean.  To be clear, there is a difference between leaving a cart in a dangerous place on a windy day where it's obviously going to cause problems(just to clear that up before people bring it up).	1643040812.0	sbpphi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbpphi/shopping_cart_police_videos_arent_funny/	Shopping Cart Police Videos Aren't Funny

8xdbpvoq	"Oh, what about Lil Pump? Gucci gang gucci gang gucci gang. Haha". No, if you genuinly believe that this is all that rap has to offer, you are wrong. Trap music is just a small part in the whole history of Hip-Hop. There are so many genres of rap, it is insane – Jazz Rap, Glitch Hop, Trap, Melodic Rap, Gangsta Rap, Emo Rap, Horrorcore, Industrial Hip-Hop, Alternative Hip-Hop, Abstract Hip-Hop, East Coast Hip-Hop, West Coast Hip-Hop just to name a few.  "Oh, but only mumble (c)rap is mainstream, other stuff isn't popular! Rap died when 2Pac died.". Kendrick Lamar has nearly 31 million monthly listeners on Spotify and has released several of the greatest albums that I have heard in any genre, mainly "To Pimp A Butterfly" and "good kid, m.A.A.d city". Little Simz has over 3 million monthly listeners and has released one of the best records of last year. Tyler The Creator has 22 million and is one of the kost creative musicians in recent years. Good Hip-Hop isn't just not mainstream. You are just dismissing it.  Finally, if you want to get into Hip-Hop, here are some of my favourites rap records out there:  Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp A Butterfly   Avantdale Bowling Club – Avantdale Bowling Club  Injury Reserve – By the Time I Get to Pheonix   Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill  Tyler, The Creator – IGOR (it is more Neo-Soul, but Tyler usually makes rap music, so...)  Freddie Gibbs, Madlib – Piñata  MF DOOM, Madlib – Madvillainy   JPEGMAFIA – All My Heroes Are Cornballs   BROKHAMPTON – SATURATION (1-3)  Death Grips – The Money Store   The Notorious B.I.G. – Ready To Die   Blu & Exile – Below the Heavens  The Roots – Undun  Backxwash – I LIE HERE BURRIED WITH MY RINGS AND DRESSES   Earl Sweatshirt – Some Rap Songs   clipping. – There Existed An Addiction To Blood   J Dilla – Donuts  Kanye West – My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy   Katori Walker – 1 Minute Of Your Time...  Mac Miller – Faces  Kid Cudi – Man On The Moon: The End Of Day  Lil Ugly Mane – volcanic bird enemy and the voiced concern (it is more Alternative Rock, but Travis Miller usually makes rap music under Lil Ugly Mane, so I will include it.)  Outkast – Aquemini  A Tribe Called Quest – We got it from here... Thank You 4 Your service  Wu-Tang Clan – Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)   P.S.

5g40fktj	I'm not posting this to anger people; I am posting this because I know some of the things I say in this post will be incorrect, and I want to get other people's perspectives on my opinions so I can revise them.   I recognize there are people in truly unfortunate situations, and this post does not apply to those people.   If you haven’t done the things necessary to make yourself a marketable employee, that’s on you. What is a company supposed to do? Hire an incompetent person because they feel bad for you. Minimum wage jobs are designed for people with minimal work experience and skills. I suspect many people complaining about not having a high-paying job didn’t do jack shit in high school. Yeah, the system is corrupt and shitty, and I’m sorry if you come from poverty. However, being born in poverty in America still puts you ahead of most people in the world. If you are from a low-income family, bust your ass off and get into a prestigious private school because they will cover full tuition. As a poor individual, you can go to a school that costs 75k a year for free, an opportunity the middle class doesn’t have. If you can’t get into a private school, that’s ok. Not everyone can, and low-income students often don't have the resources provided to them to get into these schools. However, if this is the case, don’t say fuck it and give up on educating yourself or go to your local state school and party for four years and saddle yourself with enormous debt. Go where you can afford, smaller schools or community colleges. Or if you want to go to your big state school, bust your ass off. You can still gain the experience necessary to make the debt you take on worth it. Or, learn a trade! Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, boat builders, etc., make really good money, and the cost of a two-year degree from a trade school is not high. If school isn’t your thing, go out and become an entrepreneur. If you truly are too poor to afford any education, you have to educate yourself; the internet is a powerful tool. It isn't fair that this is the only option some have, but it is reality. However, for most people, there are so many options out there, and if you are mad because the only jobs you qualify for are shitty minimum wage jobs, then you failed somewhere along the way. This isn’t to say I don’t have sympathy for you; it is so hard to make all the right decisions from a young age, especially without supportive parents/going to a shitty high school. However, stop acting like the establishment is out to get you; if you didn’t do what needed to be done to set yourself up, you have to work harder in the future. Online classes, go back to school, learn a trade, do something other than sitting on Reddit and complain. I know the path to success is a lot harder for some than others; it is so frustrating to see kids with wealthy parents do nothing in high school and end up with an Ivy degree, but life isn’t fair, and that is reality. Everyone is born with distinctive gifts and passions, and while some have way more privilege than others and can cultivate these gifts more easily, that doesn’t mean you should give up and take handouts. Fuck that shit. There are people in third-world opportunities that would kill to have the opportunity Americans have, and instead, you are going to sit there and complain your whole life about how corrupt the system is. Do you want to see real corruption? Leave the United States. Instead of playing the victim, be grateful you live in a country with more opportunities than anywhere else in the world. Educate yourself (go somewhere you can afford, and if that is a community college, so be it), learn a trade, or take a risk and open a business. The beauty of the free market is it will reward you heavily if you create something that brings value to the world. Don’t complain about someone else being wealthy when they have worked their ass off and contributed to the world. Some have to work harder than others, but that’s life, and if you're a realist, you have two options, complain or work harder. Unfortunately, too few choose the latter.	1643041491.0	sbpysr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbpysr/im_tired_of_people_complaining_about_a_lack_of/	I’m Tired of People Complaining About a Lack of Oppotunity in America

ibbw2ve1	A lot of times celebrities will get plastic surgery and if it looks good everyone just talks about how they never age or age so gracefully but if it’s botched then people say “why do they hate themselves?” “Why would anyone get plastic surgery?” or say it’s bc of low self esteem or something.   For ex Jennifer Anniston has multiple nose jobs and plastic surgery but you never hear those kinds of judgements on her, only how great she looks. Courtney Cox, on the other hand, gets a lot of hate for her plastic surgery. Also people judge Lil Kim a lot for her surgeries, but it’s like not her fault the surgeon did such a bad job (also her nose jobs started when her nose got broken due to domestic abuse so I really don’t think people should judge her for getting surgery). There are exceptions, like people who want the most giant boobs in the world or something crazy but even then I think a responsible surgeon would turn them away… People act like a celebrities botched look is always intentional, but I really don’t think the goal for many of these people is to look deformed? I think the surgeon probably just did a bad job in most cases.   I also follow a plastic surgeon and he said that sometimes plastic surgeons can get nervous when they are doing a celebrity and they want it to look “perfect” and then they over-do it do it’s passed the point of looking natural. He said this is what happened to Kenny Rogers. Idk if it’s true but it makes sense.   I guess I don’t understand the judgment against a lot of surgeries too. Why is it if your teeth are crooked it’s perfectly fine to get surgery and fix it but there’s so much stigma if your nose is crooked and you get a rhinoplasty? I’ve never had plastic surgery (did have teeth done though) but I also am a random person and no one cares what I look like. All in all I think it’s very understandable of why a celebrity would get plastic surgery and it’s usually not their fault if it turns out weird looking.	1643042767.0	sbqfql	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbqfql/people_are_unfair_to_celebrities_with_bad_plastic/	People are unfair to celebrities with bad plastic surgery and should put the blame on the doctors instead

I asked if I was terminated and that I had received an email detailing I was. My boss responded by informing me that I wasn’t supposed to have seen this email until Monday, today...	1643044836.0	sbr91p	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbr91p/my_first_and_only_write_up_was_also_my_final/	My first and only write up was also my final write up

But these people really act like they were never children themselves. I don't understand how they go out in the world when the very presence of children in their vicinity is unbearable to them.

68rvi	While working I burn through thousands of hours of music each year. When I need an instrumental playlist for focusing I'll look through "focus" playlists on Spotify or Youtube. Over the past year or so, it's become increasingly difficult to find any instrumental playlist that isn't overrun by "lo-fi beats" and I hate it.   I get it, they're easy to make, musically neutral, and help to fuel a never-ending stream of ambient background noise, so I appreciate it to an extent. But it's gotten to the point where "Music for Coding" is the same as "Instrumental Study", or "Focus Mode".   The scratchy record hiss, lazy piano riffs, and the same three sounds used over and over and over with trite "soulful" samples is so overdone and has saturated the "focus" genre across platforms that it's inescapable without a concentrated effort to avoid it.   Yes, this opinion is entitled, yum-icking, unnecessary, and unappreciative towards artists who churn out music for little pay for a modicum of my enjoyment. But here it is.	1643046959.0	sbs2t7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbs2t7/focus_music_is_now_synonymous_with_lofi_beats_and/	"Focus" music is now synonymous with "Lo-fi beats" and I hate it

3nu8y0dr	Most of my professors and teachers throughout elementary, high school, and college have barely put effort into their classes. Of course, this is not an all-encompassing rule. Some professors are awesome and very capable; some professors, however, are inept.   My brother enrolled in college this year and, one night, I saw him struggling for hours over a Calculus problem. Recognizing the math, I taught him how to solve it in 2 minutes. The rest of the assignment took him 10 minutes. How can a professor be so unable to just teach students something before giving them homework on it? This is also at the college level.   High school and elementary teachers that I’ve had have also historically just not cared enough about their class. They spend more time goofing off with students or talking to other teachers than they do preparing an in-depth explanation of interesting topics. Sorry, but a powerpoint that you read in front of the class just isn’t enough if you start making upwards of 60-100k a year.   A higher salary will breed more competition. People who are willing to put more time and skills into teaching classes would replace a lot of the current staff. This scenario would ultimately do wonders for the education system in America, in my opinion.   The argument can be made that because teachers are paid so little they have little incentive to care. If that’s the case, they should just work in the trades or pursue another line of academic work.   Pay teachers more and give kids a better education. Get rid of bad profs. End of story.	1643052013.0	sbu11s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbu11s/if_teachers_were_paid_60100k_annually_most/	If teachers were paid 60-100k annually, most current teachers would deserve to be fired and replaced.

3whd2g9g	This seems to trigger pretty much everyone when it gets brought up but I've always argued against people who say, "The victim is never to blame".    This seems to be a commonly held belief and one that creates quite a stir but I've always held the opinion that, while morally, no the victim \*shouldn't\* be blamed, you can't say they are totally innocent and removed from blame/fault/responsibility just because they are a victim.  The topic always comes down to a rape and a "was she asking for it?" hypothetical which just leaves everyone uspet so lets not go there.  Instead - what got me back onto this topic recently was the tik tok video of the angry dad throwing a smoothie at a worker after his daughter/son had an allergic reaction to a smoothie with peanut butter in it, even though he asked for a smoothie with no peanut butter.  In this case - both parties "fucked up".  Workers made a mistake and there were lots of people who were essentially blaming the victim - the angry dad - by saying, "well if your kid is so allergic, maybe you shouldnt go to a store where the incident might happen".  Fair point, right?   Well, why is THAT amount of blame okay to be directed at him, the victim, but in other, logically analogous situations, it's suddenly NOT okay to blame the victim?     In the case of the video, it seems like people are okay blaming the victim, because he was an asshole that went WAY over the top and threatened people for a mistake.  That's fair too.  He was wrong.  But he was initially a "victim" so to speak.     It seems very illogical to me.  It's never okay to blame the victim if it's a hot or controversial topic... but if the victim then becomes an asshole - its okay to blame them?  &#x200B;  My opinion - is concrete - which apparently makes it super unpopular, but I hold true that in almost every case, the victim has to accept SOME, even miniscule amount of blame.  Even if it's something as ridiculous as a person walking outside and getting hit by a falling piece of space debris.   If it was the size of a golf ball, you would have been protected if you remained inside, but you ventured outside and knowingly walked into an increased risk of death or injury from space debris.  Its so ridiculous that  no one should reasonably consider it in their daily interactions - but its a choice they made, with a potential outcome they were aware is possible, and they took the chance regardless. They, logically, chose to increase their chance of getting hit by a small piece of space debris by going outside.  I think, even though its ridiculous, theres SOME minuscule amount of blame/responsibility that goes with that.   &#x200B;  Please, help me see how this "wrong".   And not just because it's morally, or ridiculously unlikely "wrong".  Im talking factually and logically.	1643052641.0	sbu9s4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbu9s4/its_okay_to_blame_the_victim_sometimes/	It's okay to blame the "victim" sometimes.

ic30jxcy	It's just silly. Your appearance is possibly one of the most important factors about you and probably will continue to be like that for decades and centuries to come which I find absolutely ridiculous. Firstly, there's the judgements. Unless you're a 10 you will be judged based on what you wear. If you're a bit overweight you can't wear tight fitting clothes without being ridiculed or having your gut pointed out, I've encountered that a few times, I'm not incredibly overweight, a few kg over but I have a bit of a gut and anytime I wear something that makes it obvious it gets commented on which is just annoying moreso than anything, it's led to insecurity where I've my stomach sucked in by reflex whenever I'm around anyone else. Somebody wearing a low quality tracksuit will be seen as an addict, especially skinnier people with a hood up, at least around my area people tend to get judgey over that kind of clothing.   Secondly, it can fuck up a job interview. Now I get hygiene, taking care of your body is incredibly important but having to wear certain clothes to work or having to look the part of a job interview? Nah. I feel like people are more pressured to wear nice clothes for an interview than what they would normally wear and personally I think wearing what you wear any other day of the week is important because it's what's comfortable to you. How you appear plays no part in a job unless that job involves your appearance such as modelling or physical training. Jobs with specific dress codes like construction are also an exception because there's reasoning behind those, there's a necessity to look a certain way or have a certain uniform but some random person working in a cubicle where nobody is ever going to see them? Hell, they should be able to go in, in their pyjamas, it really doesn't matter, nobody sees you, your appearance isn't important, so why should it matter so much.  Thirdly, dating. I should be incredibly clear here because this is probably what I'd get flamed the most for. Having preferences is fine, everybody has standards, you're entitled to your own preferences. I have seen and met people who will not touch another person (dating wise) if they don't meet a certain requirement. Things like not dating somebody under 6"1, not dating somebody who's too muscular, not dating somebody who doesn't have the right curves, bad knees, wonky elbows, weird nose, monkey ears, cross-eyes. Like I said, I get having preferences but rejection based on the fact that they don't meet a physical trait, something which isn't entirely important in a relationship to begin with, is just a bit strange to me. Like imagine you meet your prince charming or your sleeping beauty. They are perfect and tick every box but they don't have good teeth or they are too skinny so they are a no-go. I don't know, I just don't think that it's right but again everyone is entitled to preferences, I can understand that somebody not matching a feature that you would like in another person would be a bit off-putting.  Just to sum it up, appearance is just too important nowadays and I personally just dislike it. I don't like the fact that people get rejected from things based on their appearance (UNLESS their appearance is necessary for x thing like carnival rides or nightclub, it's important to distinguish those from what I'm talking about), things like jobs, dates, ridicule on social media, in public, from friends and from family.	1643056121.0	sbvn81	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbvn81/appearance_should_not_matter/	Appearance should not matter.

549689h8	Seeing this a lot lately. You basically do your job for 1 year and then repeat. Most subjects don't change with time(like Maths, history etc.). So people just have to deal with kids, which a lot of jobs have to. Can't speak for the US so sorry for being uninformed, but in my country (Germany) the degree you need for becoming a teacher is a budget version of the "real" one. In addition to that they have more time off than any other field of work due to schools being closed on holidays.   Another hot take: in my opinion I do believe that actually a lot of people can teach all basic subjects until like 10th grade without much preparation if any at all.  You get payed for what you know not what you do and if a lot of people know what you know due to learning all of the stuff that is taught, I really don't see the issue here.

32jdwadf	People keep making the argument that minimum wage workers shouldn’t make as much as teachers. First of all, those minimum wage jobs often are way harder mentally and physically than a college degree job. Secondly, those minimum wage employees don’t have any benefits , or vacation.

1l24jkgv	A lot of parents brag about teaching their kids the word vagina because they're accurate or scientific terms but most of the time they're not even talking about the vagina and the word they'll looking for is vulva. Teaching a girl that her parts are called a vagina is like teaching her that her butt is called a colon or her mouth is called a throat.  And there are a lot of little girls who grow up thinking that everything between the labia is the vagina and don't wash it because the vagina is self cleaning. Yes it is, but you wash the area around it. And putting all the focus on the birth canal, which is all the word vagina applies to, really makes a girl feel like that's the only thing worth mentioning down there and that is a bad mindset to grow up with.  If you want your kids to know the proper terms for them, teach them all of them. Penis, scrotum, testicles, vulva, labia, clitoris, vagina.	1643060278.0	sbx9d9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbx9d9/children_shouldnt_be_taught_the_word_vagina/	Children shouldn't be taught the word vagina.
8au2juql	I imagine they work way better for guys that are circumcised, but for me I've had nothing but sub-par experiences with condoms. People swear up and down that there is no sensitivity difference, but if I want to last longer I throw one on cause it's like night and day for me. And not to mention I have used a condom maybe a couple dozen times and at least half the time they have broken on me. My first partner in highschool, we actually had a scare because back then I was still under the impression that rubbers were impervious to damage, and I never even stopped to check if it popped.   Basically just writing this post to get an idea of what it's like for other guys, and how it differs based on circumcision-circumstances.   Also for the ladies, I've had more partners request that I not wear a condom than request I wear one, and I can confidently say not a single one of those that asked I go bare back had intentions of children. Is it a different experience for yall?	1643060903.0	sbxif1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxif1/as_an_uncut_dude_condoms_are_a_fucking_nightmare/	As an uncut dude, condoms are a fucking nightmare, and I would 100% rather smash without one and just pull out
i1mvqe6v	I consider this an unpopular opinion due to me not having heard any similar opinions, nor do I have any statistics to suggest this is factual.  However I believe we need to stop telling kids "never talk to a stranger", because it invalidates many people (like me) who have been sexually assaulted or raped by a family member instead.  Regarding teenagers, strangers and the internet may be more of concern. But many children suffer at home. You don't know what happens behind doors.	1643061299.0	sbxntx	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxntx/children_are_probably_more_likely_to_be_molested/	Children are probably more likely to be molested by a family member / family friend instead of a stranger or kidnapper.

She never bears any responsibility for her obscenity and cries on livestreams for sympathy.  She’s not even attractive by plus sized standards. Her butt is flat like she’s wearing a diaper at all times and her boobs are like flap jacks. She obviously has never seriously hit the gym and built muscle a day in her life.

e9bwuc6p	What's your opinion on Australia Day being 26/01 and your thoughts of businesses that advertise and promote Australia day sales/ celebrations? Would you support a business that supports Australia day being on the 26th?  I'll go first.  As a small business owner, being that we are still in our first year of trade (7 months now), we decided to not draw any negative attention to our socials or brand and promote anything Australia day whatsoever. In our marketing plan we had organised for a limited 1 Day only sale of 26% off already on sale items to celebrate Australia day.  Personally I feel that Australia day, to me, identifies collaboration of many people to form one unique strong young country that is resilient in problematic times and comes together to support one another.  I am also aware that Australia day marks the landing of the first fleet in 1788 and that aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians lost sovereign rights to their land, lost their family and lost the right to practice their culture.	1643062131.0	sbxzi4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxzi4/thoughts_on_australia_day_being_2601_from_a_small/	Thoughts on Australia Day being 26/01 from a small business owner.

d7ybwxwq	As someone who has been a drugdealer and had done time in prison I have met many people in prison who had committed violent crimes. I shared a cell with a murderer who was one of the friendliest nicest persons ever. The thing is that these people their crimes are 9/10 related to their mental health. People who were so desperate in life that they pulled to last resort and committed a robbery, did jobs for the mob, sold drugs. The problem needs to be fixed at the source, which is mental health.  So I'm using these two countries as examples because these are the most known, Norway and USA. US prisons: a shithole full of violence, inmates get treated like shit, guards get treated like shit, if you lock people up like animals and treat them like animals they are going to act like animals. As a result of this, people come out more violent and commit crimes again. I used the US as an example because it is very well known, don't even get me started on South American prisons.  Now Norway or almost any other EU country, focuses on rehabilitation instead of punishment. Killings inside the prison are almost non existent, criminals get therapy so they can become a contributing member of society again. As a result of this, way less reoffenders than in countries where prisons are a shithole.	1643135291.0	sckda6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sckda6/the_best_way_to_reduce_crime_is_by_giving/	The best way to reduce crime is by giving criminals mental help

df6s5tqr	There are multiple reasons for this, but mainly is that people are apparently not responsible enough to own them. If you own a dog and frequently take it on a walk like i do you have for sure met at least once an idiot walking with a big dog off the leash.  Let me tell you this, when dogs (of the same sex especially males) meet each other on the streets, they are often gonna try to start a fight.  I meet these idiots basically everyday, my grandma was attacked before when walking my dog and severely injoured by a big off leash dog, that threw her on the ground, because of which she (very fragile at the time) was hospitalised, and my dog was also severely injured and needed surgery.   Just today i was walking my dog and i passed by a house where a VERY big dog lives, this one dog is very aggressive to both his peers and humans (and had in the past bit my sister on her shoulder  as she was walking by the fence!) As i face the house i see the garden gate OPEN WIDE amd the dog in front of it, staring at me and my puppy.  Luckily i was far enough for him not to charge at me and slowly walking back as the gate was closing me and my small dog where safe. (When i pass near his house he always tries to exit and jump out the fence) When i confronted the owner about it he acted with nonchalance saying thay his dog is "good" and "never bit anyone" (not true).  So as far as my personal experience goes big dogs are dangerous and people are not responsible enough to own them. Just think if instead of my sisters shoulder passing near the fence was a mother with a baby in her arms.  Now you may say  >"But mine is a good boy!"  there is no such thing as a good dog or a bad dog, dogs are animals, and act by *instinct* they are thus unpredictable and often act differently than you expect. They may be all cuddly and kind with their owner but they act differently with strangers  >"not every big breed owner is reckless like that"  Enough are tho. I see everyday people walking dogs as big as calfs off leash. Also banning something for the unresponsible action of some is reasonable. If people were allowed to own light machineguns most would not act unresponsibly with it but the actions of a few are enough for that to be prohibited.  Big dogs are dangerous and there is no reason you should own one instead of a reasonably sized one.

551c2cmt	Earlier this week i started looking back at tv shows, music, commercials, and generally everything from my childhood. I got really nostalgic, and it kind of depressed me in a way. Its like something ill never experience again.  Being born in 1999 I got to experience alot more "cool stuff" than kids today experience in front of their iphones and ipads. For example the feeling of finishing pokemon games on the old school gameboy, or watching old school cartoon network shows, the old Scary Movie comedies, listenting to Britney Spears, Shakira, Madonna, and more.  The nostaliga just hit me extremely hard this week, and i thought about how lucky i was (in my opinion) to be born at such a time.

i1qp8	90%+ of working adults don't need advanced mathematics to excel in their daily lives. Those that do are usually using it in a job that requires an advanced degree. Every average adult that doesn't have life handed to them already absolutely needs financial literacy to succeed in life.  This should be taught and tested over at least two full years in high-school. You should not be graduating into adulthood without understanding credit, loans, savings, healthcare plans, etc. We absolutely cannot expect parents to teach their kids this stuff as a vast amount of adults do not understand it themselves. This subject is taught in most education systems, but its glossed over too quickly, and I really don't think it's absorbed by most high-school students. There's an argument for "nothing is", but I think the longer you teach it, the more it's focused on, the more likely students are to keep that knowledge into adulthood.   I also think we should be teaching ethics as a core class from day 1 but that's a separate conversation.	1643139356.0	sclwll	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sclwll/we_should_teach_financial_literacy_over_the/	We should teach financial literacy over the course of high-school in replacement of advanced mathematics.

v336gor	Okay. I’m going out on a limb here. But first. A disclaimer: I’m in no way excusing or justifying what he did. I’m simply presenting another point of view.   So, smoothie guy got more than angry and upset following his child being hospitalised due to a nut allergy.   Now, while he was VERY upset by the situation, I think most/all parents can relate to how upset he was due to his child suffering such a severe reaction, especially since the product he purchased was meant to be allergen-free.  Not that all parents would react in the same way following their child being poisoned, but they would feel equally alarmed and upset and feel deeply betrayed by the shop and its staff.   Now what surprises me is that there were no senior staff members or a manager on site, but the other side of the penny imho is that the retailer and even the serving staff member may have a serious lawsuit on their hands when the dust settles over the hype.   I’m not an expert on FDA regs but I’m pretty sure you can’t serve a product with a known allergen without clearly stating it to consumers. So… his upset tone, just a little bit of it, was justified.	1643141450.0	scmovl	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scmovl/smoothie_guy_had_it_coming_but/	Smoothie guy had it coming, but…

For the people saying "i wouldve decked her" i bet you wouldve turned in to one of those "its just a prank bro" types if it was  a dude though but hype yourselves up keyboard warriors. Lets reverse  the role and say it was a guy standing while a female was "flossing"  behind them; most of us simply wouldnt be that bothered and def not  enough to swing but a female rightfully so may feel vulnerable such as in this video. On another note if a guy was standing in place of the girl in this situation it probably wouldve been the same exact response  does not matter if the subject wouldve been straight, gay or bi. Respect peoples personal space.   "But he didnt touch her"-- if this happened in a work environment she wouldnt of had to swing on him because he wouldve been fired for sexual harassment. Furthermore even if this scenario took place in a night club, this girl is dancing and some stranger comes up behind her dancing; so many girls would push, slap or even punch the "creep".	1643142249.0	scmzpw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scmzpw/the_guy_that_got_punched_in_the_he_attempted_the/	The guy that got punched in the "He attempted the meme.." video deserved it.

We as a humans adapt off of each other in many ways, and there is literally nothing wrong with seeing something from one culture and feeling an attachment to it despite your relations. I'm so sick of mostly white westerners telling me that wearing shirts with Japanese on them is "cultural appropriation" is it?

6fbp3u0v	TLDR: the title.   I was on food stamps for about a year and I’ve missed them every day since. Food is a basic human right and this would be an easy way to help make sure all folks have a way to feed themselves and dependents.  The idea of them being abused is absurd and the stigma and bureaucracy (and strict requirements) keep a lot of people away that probably should be on them.   There are already a lot of requirements limiting what you can use them on in the US. I would be happy to see those relaxed, but as it stands there are only so many things you can buy (no hot food, no home goods, no alcohol, etc) . You want to use them to buy a fancy cut of steak or fish? good on you. Rather spread them out for meals across the month? Makes sense to me.   We all have to eat and the government should support that as easily as possible by just making them universal.	1643150477.0	scq095	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scq095/food_stamps_should_be_universally_available/	Food Stamps should be Universally Available

I have been told by so many people that my suffering doesn't matter because "it's not like it'll kill you." So what, you think healthy, happy people commit suicide? They even refuse to give dying patients morphine sometimes because "they could get addicted". DUDE. They're not going to get worse!  I am SO CLOSE to committing suicide. If I didn't have a couple people who would be screwed over if I died, I would have a long time ago. And yet my care is not considered urgent. I have no psychiatrist six months after my doctor retired, and no doctors will refer me because "only priority patients are being treated right now". Telling them you're suicidal doesn't move you up the list, it just gets your life ruined by being shipped to an asylum. I am consuming 500 calories a day due to extreme nausea and food allergies/sensitivities, and feel like I'm dying, but I don't need a dietician because "it's probably stress-related".

I understand that this isn't necessarily a very unpopular opinion but I have seen so many police hate campaigns or anti-police movements. I would also like to state that violent hate crimes that the police have committed are horrible atrocities and a specific person should not be targeted by their race, I just think that while the police can do horrible things they have also done lifesaving acts of heroism.	1643155033.0	scronb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scronb/although_the_police_can_be_bad_that_doesnt_mean/	Although the police can be bad, that doesn't mean every police officer is a horrible person.

3551d6xv	If someone really wanted a child for the sake of nurturing a life, they’d adopt a child in a heartbeat.   It really doesn’t matter if the child wasn’t conceived by you or doesn’t have the same blood as you, in the end that doesn’t even make a difference.   I think it’s selfish to feel upset about not being able to conceive but at the same time disregard the idea of adoption. Wouldn’t you still be raising your child even if you adopted him/her?   Some couples just want kids for social validation, and others, just to experience parenthood which are selfish reasons imo.

It’s wrong and gross and an example of the fantasies of men in power who want to go back to their own high school experience and recreate their most perverted dreams.  If you are playing a character who is underage, you should treat them as underage and not have them do nude, sex scenes.  This stuff is damaging to young girls who compare themselves to these characters and quite clearly (because the actors are older and cherry-picked) don’t match up.  Also, the show is just terrible and awkward to watch because of all the child sex scenes.  Lastly, and I know people who disagree are going to come at me and say I am prude: fuck that.

So if we are optimistic it may represent 220 million actual people. Which would mean that 1/30 people you meet in real life may use the site in any extent. Which leaves a significant portion of the worlds population most likely not represented. Their is also the fact that most people who would use Reddit would tend to be of a young demographic which leaves even more of the population out of representation. Along with this Reddit’s base primarily attracts people who don’t hugely participate in social lives so that cuts representation even more.

bt55d5uo	I am a ‘scalper’ and I sell mainly shoes which are limited.   Often times I laugh at the pure hatred people feel towards those that are like me. There are in my opinion a few things they don’t understand/think about.   - when shoes are limited, the manufacturer intentionally does this, KNOWING that the shoes will be resold at a much higher price. This keeps the brand ‘cool’, and stimulates sales of less limited, cheaper shoes. Why is there no anger towards Nike when they decide to only make 10k pairs of a shoe, when they know for a fact demand can be in the millions.   - people seem to think all I do is download a bot on my computer, and buy hundreds of pairs. I assure you it is not this easy.   - honestly I think people look quite dumb when they get mad at people like me, while ignoring the profiteering that goes on at the corporate level. But since these corporations are faceless, they don’t even think about that.   - people act like they *need* the coolest, newest shoes. Jesus Christ get a grip. Even the shoes I wear are $100 because I don’t need to spend $1000 on shoes.   A few other things, but I’d like to hear your guys’ thoughts as to why there’s so much animosity felt towards us.

5fwp8y1i	Very sensitive topics coming in.  A lot of people are born into very bad situations all around the world. Sometimes the quality of life ratio to worthiness of living it isn’t in par. I honestly do believe that the more self aware you are of the life you, and others live, the more you understand the death wishes a lot of people have. You guys might have seen that meme of “Life is unpredictable, and the only constant is suffering” or something like that. It speaks some truth. Hell, the whole survival of the fittest theory is based upon death and suffering of others. Without the mass suffering of others,you wouldn’t be here today. Our views on suicide are totally obstruct. Nobody knows the main intent for why humans do it (beyond the triggering incidents) , even less animals. In a 2013 book,”How Animals Grieve”, we’re told about the practices of bile milking. A inhumane practice where bears are concealed in the smallest cages and are purposefully abused for their bile. One day “The mother bear supposedly broke free of her restraints, smothered her cub, and then smashed herself into a wall, ending her own life.” Hugo, a smart species of a whale,spent 12 years of his life in captivity. Unhappy and being seen only as entertainment, He “killed himself by smashing his head into wall after 12 years in captivity.” Now, nobody knows the true intent of “suicide” in animals, and there’s a lot of controversy weather it’s intentionally planned. There’s debates to if they even understand the consequence, or cause self harm to no avail of what happens next. You take a look at the leading species in life, humans, and you can make some connections. So many people suffer for years, decades, or their lifetime. We’re told all humans matter, but are not shown it. In the US alone you can find someone with an unlawful amount of money, and in the same city you’ll find someone who has been extremely suffering. with mental health so bad they stop being seen, or behaving as human. I think life is definitely an experience. The odds definitely need to be in your favor. We need a humane way for those with unimaginable pain to leave safely, because why suffer unimaginable pain for longer ,when you’ll end up in the same soil anyway. I think it does more harm than good to not have. “A way out”. It should be frowned upon by society, but there should be a more humane way.	1643173648.0	scxzof	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scxzof/you_shouldnt_be_forced_to_live_and_there_should/	You shouldn’t be forced to live, and there should be a humane way out.

iufzsuf1	It's true that the labour market is competitive and you need a degree to get your foot at the door for an interview. Beyond that there's little use to the degree as most people have to re-learn the skills they require for the job in the first few months/years of in the job training. Hence, going deeply into debt to attain a university degree is beyond ridiculous!  I find apprenticeship to be a more attractive path right after high school as you get the same level of qualification as a degree at the end of it, along with years of experience. Not to mention getting paid all along the way and not incurring any debt.  That being said, you need to know what exactly you want to do for work to be able to choose an apprenticeship scheme. Whereas you can wobble you way through university and decide to do a completely different thing for work. Obviously, there are exceptions to jobs that require very specific qualification such as medicine and law.  All in all, in my opinion university degree is a waste of money given the alternatives available (i.e. apprenticeships) unless you are looking to go for a career which requires a very specific qualification to get the license to practice (such as medicine and law).	1643174178.0	scy5ew	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scy5ew/getting_in_debt_for_a_university_degree_is/	Getting in debt for a university degree is ridiculous
bmipi7pe	I understand the sentiment behind wanting a space where you can feel connected to the person you've lost, to grieve. But the fact is that a gravestone is purely metaphorical anyway, and once a body is buried, it is never seen again leads me to wonder why we do not just either cremate or use (donate to science, use to plant trees, use for police training, etc like we already do) the bodies of the dead? Burying them only serves to provide one symbolic gesture, an incredibly expensive and surprisingly resource intensive one at that, before being buried underground forever.   Again, I want to rehash that the concept of CEMETERIES makes sense to me. People need a space to be connected with something physical related to their loved ones. Caring for a gravesite can be theraputic. But none of this requires the actual body of the person to be buried underneath it in a 5 thousand dollar box in a deep hole. A hole that risks damaging groundwater, and the ecosystems that said groundwater feeds. I just struggle to grasp why people feel it is worth embalming and burying the dead rather than just doing something less resource/money intensive, or something that works towards the greater good when it genuinely would not affect our mourning habits at all, other than the actual act of burial itself.    I always imagine some human ambassador trying to show our society to an alien culture and having to find some way to explain that our practice of throwing dead people in lavish boxes that we then hide forever is a billion dollar industry, and is a service which people are willing to go into financial debt for.  I realize this could seem offensive, or insensitive to someone who has lost someone recently. I have no Ill will towards people who bury their loved ones, I've just been thinking about this for a long time. I'm sorry if this causes any hurt feelings, but I would love to hear what people think about this, as it's been on my mind for ages.	1643174723.0	scyb1i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scyb1i/our_practice_of_body_burying_is_confusing/	Our practice of body burying is confusing.

And then it gets to a point where people are constantly repeating themselves cause you keep repeating the same thing over and over again.   “I’m so sad and everything is so bad for me and I don’t know what to do”, their response: “ok well you could just do-“ “no i can’t everything is so terrible and I can’t do anything right and I’ll never amount to anything” then proceeds to have that same conversation over and over again. Like what do you want people to tell you at this point, honestly you just wanna hear your own voice because I keep saying the same thing   And that also goes for you not wanting to help yourself and then crying about how fucked up it is so people can kiss your ass and say how bad they feel for you.

bldmnte	Let me begin with this: I am a fourth child born into a narcissist household just above the poverty line. I am about to turn 30, and spent the last 10 years rewiring my brain from the psychological effects of being born into a family that did not validate my feelings, being guilted tripped for being unappreciative of being "gifted" the bare minimum, sexually assaulted due to neglect, etc, etc. It took me years to even recognize how bad it was, and it's not even being close to the worst cases out there.   Everyone hates government intervention. Citizens need to be autonomous within their government.  However, when children are born to families that don't have sufficient support (financial, social, and emotion support), these children have a higher chance of being involved in illegal activity, perpetuating the cycle of degeneracy. This causes more social services resources to be allocated and spread thin.   Couples that wish to have more than 3 children absolutely should, but not at the cost of the collective. Couples should demonstrate social and emotional intelligence, and financial stability. They can demonstrate to foster secure attachment style in their children. Couples that can't demonstrate this, sorry but there's only so much social services to go around.   Permitting wouldn't be difficult, just a basic interview with a social worker coming out and interviewing the children as well, seeing how children interact with parents, a financial review.   In closing, I have no idea how this would be enforced.	1643203167.0	sd5t38	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5t38/having_more_than_3_children_should_require_a/	Having more than 3 children should require a permit.

b9upo8zj	So before anyone asks, no I’m not a furry and let me explain. So actually this occurs on Roblox of all places. My current avatar is a Doge with muscles and those ink things that go on your skin. (My post got deleted for mentioning the word smh) simply because I thought it was funny and it got a fair bit of attention in games. Occasionally however I would have people I have never interacted with walk up to me and say things like:  - Ew  - Gross a furry - You’re ####### sick  It never got to me because I knew that  these were quite possibly just little kids who haven’t learned everything yet, but I was actually interested in if this is how people react to a doge how would they react to an actual furry?  So i made a new account and went to the avatar shop. I bought a protogen mask, a mafia suit, a tail, and some rainbow antlers with Noob heads.   *Holy. shit.*  The amount of hate instantly went up to 11. My favorite example of this was how in a Murder Mystery 2 lobby a guy dressed up as an angel (not joking) comes running up to me. Keep in mind I haven’t said a single word in this lobby. This guy just starts shrieking at me. These are some of his direct quotes:  - ALL FURRIES ARE GAY WITH EACH OTHER! - THEY ARE ALL PEDOPHILES! - ALL FURRIES LIKE TO #### ANIMALS!  And my personal favorite:  - ALL FURRIES WHO HAVE PETS #### THEM!  😐  Needless to say I obviously tried to defend myself, but you can imagine he was having none of it. So I continued the experiment with that outfit for only a week and had a lot of hate thrown at me in multiple of Roblox’s most popular games.   Now obviously there’s a difference between things like jokes or memes, but in my experience it was just straight up toxicity.  I obviously do not support zoophiles, or online dating/nsfw roleplaying on Roblox, but if you see a furry just minding their own business either in game or irl please just leave them be.  And if you still think of them as disgusting, just walk away. Don’t try to “convince” them to stop by screaming at them please.   In my opinion they get enough hate as it is.	1643204968.0	sd6e7y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd6e7y/i_did_an_experiment_and_think_furries_get_way_to/	I did an experiment, and think Furries get WAY to much hate.

44y4n5fh	I really don’t understand why people who smoke weed so often have to wear it like a badge of honour. They have usernames like “stoner420” or “wakenbake” or whatever. They take pictures of themselves smoking or holding their bongs and have to advertise the fact they like to get stoned. Why? I don’t go around advertising medication I take or whenever I have a drink. Get over yourselves stoners, nobody gives a shit that you smoke weed and listen to Bob Marley.

I feel like so many people don’t have any personality beyond being a pothead. I don’t mind a person who smokes weed, I do too on occasion, but why is it such an obligatory part of so many peoples’ profiles? It makes me feel like you’re a loser and don’t have any ambitions in life, and Im instantly kind of disgusted by it. I’d match with so many more people if they didn’t act like weed was their entire life.

fwplst7k	  I (32 F) don't plan to have children, and my current partner (M 45) is totally against them and is not changing his mind. I am okay with my decision but my parents are constantly telling me that since I don't have ANY siblings I will die alone, or worse, I will be having dementia or being sick and nobody will be around to help me because... partners don't stay and even if they do, women usually live longer (let alone that I love more than 10 years older than me men). Chances are that if I get to live by 80 I might break something and I will die in the place I fell starving and thirsty for days. I am gonna "melt"...

2wipb5be	Either of these things happen, this category of people will be the first ones to go insane. They wish for that, but if it actually happened, they wouldn't last a day. I get the idea that being self suficient is awesome, but 95% of people just can't do it, or don't have the will to, including me. I would hate growing my own food and doing that every day. Also no electricity if that happens. Which automatically implies no heat in the winter and no Air Conditioner in the summer.  No running water, no TV or Internet. Yeah, maybe you can live without those two, but you definitely can't live without the others. Oh, did I mention that criminality will literally skyrocket? Yeah, maybe in you city/country/neighbourhood the criminality rate is high already, but in the event of a societal collapse or something similar, it would be 1000 times higher. People will do anything to survive. Literally. We've had a very small glimpse of this in 2008-2009 financial crisis. Millions lost their jobs, couldn't pay rent or mortgage, could barely make ends meet and the criminality increased like crazy. I still remember that time in Europe, especially Eastern Europe car thefts and house break ins became very common. Almost daily you would see something like that on the news.   And don't even get me started on zombie apocalypse. People who wish it believe they will be like Tallahassee from Zombieland. Or like Daryl or Shane from The Walking Dead. No dude, you won't. Oh and did I mention no showers, no brushing your teeth, no healthcare of any kind, no meat (eventually animals would stop existing, and it would be sooner rather than later). Oh and good luck fighting zombies if you live in Europe, Australia or pretty much anywhere else besides America where almost nobody has any guns and you can't find any.  Yes the world has a lot of problems, but wishing for societal collapse or apocalypse is just what an idiot would say. And usually people who wish for these are the same people who have a meltdown whenever there is even a small power outage in their house or area. You wouldn't survive societal collapse and you DEFINITELY wouldn't last more than maybe a few weeks at best in a real zombie apocalypse	1643209974.0	sd86pa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd86pa/people_who_wish_for_a_huge_societal_collapse_or/	People who wish for a huge societal collapse, or even an apocalypse are just huge idiots

ah31d5bl	As an employee, I would never go back to a situation where I have to work in-person. But from a corporation’s perspective, it makes MUCH more sense to mandate coming into the office   - Your employees can’t sleep on the job or pretend they’re working when they’re not (or at least it’s a lot harder too) - It’s a lot easier to maintain a company culture  - Your employees are more productive and less distracted  - You have a use for the office space you paid so much money for    The ONLY benefit from the company’s perspective is that it makes their benefits package look a lot more competitive.

g47q3c77	First of all, not everyone is college material.  By having most people attend college, we either end up failing a lot of people or we dumb down the academic standards.    Second, college can be expensive.  Do we really want a bunch of young people taking out loans which may take a decade to pay back ONLY IF they get a decent job afterwards?  There's no guarantee that they even graduate, and there's no guarantee that the jobs are going to be there OR if they are even ambitious enough to go out and get them.  Third, we dissuade them from taking good paying trade jobs in construction, welding, electrician work, etc.  Not only that, it's almost like we convince them that those are dirty/lower-class jobs which are beneath them.  They are not.  They're decent honest jobs which can pay pretty well.  There are certainly other reasons which I don't want to write up right now, but this should be a decent start.	1643213805.0	sd9mtd	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd9mtd/the_fact_that_we_encourage_everyone_to_seek/	The fact that we encourage everyone to seek higher education (college) is a bad thing.

ao36t	Anybody *can* be rich in a capitalistic society.  But anyone can be poor, too.  Can’t have one without the other, and in equal measure.   People just have to have done the things necessary to become rich, continue doing the things required to stay rich and do more things to increase their wealth.  Some can’t - and exponentially more simply won’t - do those things, and that’s perfectly cool.  But don’t now be angry that those who have / do and will then have and be entitled to more, and seek to steal their shit because you wouldn’t / couldn’t do the same.   In that way, capitalism is a perfectly equal system.    And that’s why a vocal minority of wannabe socialists / communists hate it…..not because it is unjust….but because it is perfectly just, instead.   A vocal minority just doesn’t like the inarguably equal  results that their own in/actions have naturally produced and now not only want a do-over, but in perpetuity…and by stealing the money of those who worked for different and better outcomes for themselves.

It really does not like a normal person when you don't coming home on that time cause an animals are know to back to their places, why does not us?  3. It does because usually when your foot are dirty, some "negative vibe" really like it. 4. Quite true also cause blessing were given in the early morning. For an example, look at the animals which are know to find their foods in early morning. So, if we do not wake early in the morning..does it's such a shame?
