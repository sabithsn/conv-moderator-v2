3alrc4pb	Hello, a longtime coworker who I am close with and is from Russia just lost her husband. He had many health issues and she was his caregiver for many years so she has taken his death very hard. I wanted to see if there was something I could do/give during the funeral in a few days. I don‚Äôt know too much about Russian traditions for funerals but want to be thoughtful and respectful. Thank you.	1642819024.0	s9rzdu	/r/russian/comments/s9rzdu/are_gifts_for_funerals_acceptable/	Are gifts for funerals acceptable?
