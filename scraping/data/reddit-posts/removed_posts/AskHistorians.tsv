73nm8f5q	So for example, why do we as English speakers refer to "Germany" instead of Deutschland? Why do Spanish speakers refer to England as "Inglaterra"?

jatdh	I am fairly certain a period of history like this exists, but I am uncertain. My first thought is early 20th century America, but if someone could give me an alternative example, or examples, I would appreciate it.   I am looking for this specific period to explore the hypothesis that extensive deregulation, or lack of regulation, leads to totalitarianism the same as extensive regulation.	1643142088.0	scmxke	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scmxke/i_am_looking_for_a_period_of_history_where_large/	I am looking for a period of history where large de-scale regulation, or a lack of regulation, led to corporate monopoly/a totalitarian state.

6la8cg73	During the 60's, rock n roll went to become insanely popular, however it was a lot of British acts that made it go mainstream and innovated on it in the early years, before 1967 (hence British Invasion). These bands grew up listening to classic rock by some white musicians like Elvis Presley, but they also listened to Muddy Waters and that sort. It allowed them to become more fascinated with the blues thus they evolved the art form in small sub genres. Becoming the Beatles, the stones and smaller bands which didn't gain more notoriety in the states like Small faces. Point is Britain was ahead of the game till America had the Doors, and other innovative bands. Could America have had more progression with music if they desegregated earlier on?	1643142885.0	scn87b	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scn87b/if_america_desegregated_earlier_would_america_be/	If America de-segregated earlier.

cckyme74	If I am recalling this correctly I may have initially read about her in Popkin's "A New World Begins" (2019). She was only mentioned briefly in the second half of the book but it is killing me.  After forgetting her name I have been searching for QUITE some time to find the woman who I'd consider, THE most beautiful of the French Revolutionary era. The only FACT I have to work with is that she was thought of at the time to be incredibly beautiful. (and that she has a wikipedia page.) Outside of that I have some vague, possibly incorrect memories which are as follows: She was a politicians wife or mistress in the provinces or south of France (read: not Paris)(?) after the Thermidorian reaction(?). She may have been of the royalist or conservative persuasion. I thought maybe she was Tallien's wife but seems not to be the case (unless he had a mistress after his breakup?), this may imply its someone in Tallien's circle or someone he interacted with? I think she's wearing a green dress in her wiki portrait. And maybe only has a few paragraphs in her wiki as well. She's a brunette bombshell. She isn't one of the top most famous women (for sure would put all of them to shame in the looks department) of the era but she may have personally influenced her man to lean right? As I said, those are fuzzy memories and may be incorrect, but any help would be greatly appreciated!	1643147935.0	scp2lf	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scp2lf/searching_for_a_beauty_of_the_french_revolution/	Searching for a beauty of the French Revolution.

pfizo	Homo Sapiens have existed for about 300,000 years.  The first civilizations emerged in Mesopotamia about 6000 years ago, followed by Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas a few thousand years later.  Compared to the 300,000 years that humans have existed, the emergence of civilizations around the world appears to be very recent and close together.  Why is that? Is there a reason that civilizations developed independently on different parts of the world at roughly the same time in the context of 300,000 years of human existence?	1643152042.0	scql6i	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scql6i/if_homo_sapiens_have_existed_for_300000_years/	If Homo Sapiens have existed for ~300,000 years what took so long for civilizations to emerge?
cihco	I ask this because of things like Godwin's Law which says that the longer an argument on the internet goes, the more likely it becomes that someone mentions Hitler or the Nazis. But lets say we live in an age before the rise of Hitler and the Nazi party in Germany. Prior to 1933, I would imagine that the name "Hitler" probably didn't mean anything to the average American.  However, there obviously still were contentious quibbles between people. And many of these quibbles must've entered the realm of hyperbole and bad faith arguments. And I imagine there must've been some famous historical figure that was frequently used to draw comparisons to whatever point of view someone was arguing. Is there any documented evidence in literature, diary entries, or newspaper articles of a specific historical figure commonly used as a comparison in arguments the way people use Hitler today? Or does it kind of depend on time and place? I imagine that it might have depended on whatever enemy the United States had just fought a conflict against. However, World War II ended almost eighty years ago and Hitler is still used as a go-to reference that a lot of people use when arguing against someone.  Are there any examples of a commonly references individuals in other cultures such as the UK, France, or Germany that come up time and time again in such a manner?	1643154064.0	scrbtw	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scrbtw/i_am_an_adult_living_in_the_united_states_pre1933/	I am an adult living in the United States pre-1933.

3guu6rxo	Today, if someone praises communism, they would most likely be taken for a joke or an idiot. Communism failed every country it was tried in and the 5 communist countries left aren't even really communist anymore, but either capitalist, socialist or some abomination that thinks it's communist but is actually a Monarchy.  However, before and during the Cold War, communism not being tried before has a significantly more valid point. Not many people could look at the results and say communism sucks because it always failed wherever it was tried.  So why was communism hated during the Cold War, and more importantly, before the Cold War. There were many countries, a good number of Britons and Americans among them, that believed the USSR to be a greater evil than Nazi Germany (before the Holocaust was revealed to be a thing). Churchill himself said something along the lines of "If Hitler invaded hell, I would support Satan" in reference to the Soviet-German war.  Even during the Russian Revolution, Lenin held a democratic vote which the Bolsheviks had LOST, despite their popularity and promises to give the Russian people what they want. Communism wasn't even adored in the first communist country.  Why was communism never liked all that much since the beginning.	1643156748.0	scsbgz	/r/AskHistorians/comments/scsbgz/why_was_communism_hated_beforeduring_the_cold_war/	Why was communism hated before/during the Cold War?

The world has been rapidly changing for a long time now, what kind of predictions or beliefs are there about the ways in which the world, or national/global political and social organisation, is going to develop in the future?

4spn9	The Budapest Memorandum was a document signed in 1994 between the U.S., U.K., Russia, Ukraine, and other parties. The document itself, and many political scientists, say that the Memorandum was primarily a non-nuclear proliferation treaty and less of a defensive pact. And that the only time any party may be obligated to act in defense of Ukraine is if Ukraine was threatened with a nuclear weapon, and even then, the only actions they are obligated in taking is to ask for the United Nations Security Council to get involved. By the Memorandum, even right now the US has no obligation in defending Ukraine.  https://web.archive.org/web/20171019081043/http://dag.un.org/bitstream/handle/11176/44537/A_49_765%3bS_1994_1399-EN.pdf?sequence=21&isAllowed=y  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budapest_Memorandum_on_Security_Assurances  Why is it that the terms the U.S. and its allies agreed to are so tepid?
