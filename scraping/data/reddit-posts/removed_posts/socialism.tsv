76x0g6yl	Full disclosure I'm no socialist but interested.  So I was having a discussion with someone in a different subreddit but they shot me down when asking this question.  The discussion revolved around equal profits for all workers. I want to know does that mean equal risk as well?   For instance when starting a business and creditors need insurance do all workers provide their assets for possible liquidation?  So a prime example would be as soon as you want to get hired at a place of work you would probably have to do a buy-in of sorts like your car to carry some of the risks as well. Can someone please explain this concept to me?	1642781179.0	s9e476	/r/socialism/comments/s9e476/curious_to_hear_about_how_a_business_would_work/	Curious to hear about how a business would work in a socialist environment

bzx2j	Having been raised in America, the American Leftist is influenced by Judeo-Christian morals. Most Judeo-Christian flavors of religion were historically an enslaved underclass, and as a coping mechanism developed a Slave Morality that values victimhood and suffering as holy. The American Leftist is influenced by this Slave Morality, and identifies with the lower classes, so exalts weakness and fragility as desirable and respectable traits. This is out of a subconscious desire to reject the perceived ruling-class values of might and discipline.  In practice, this creates a degenerate behavior of sabotaging any Leftist organization that approaches authority. In the mind of the Slave-Morality Leftist, a Leftist that approaches authority is similar to the ruling class, which is imagined to be a betrayal of Leftist morals. This ultimately results in purity spirals of attacking anyone who is achieving any degree of conventional authority, instead putting at the forefront those who are the most outraged, the most offended, the most fragile, and the least capable of asserting their will onto society at large.   We have seen this happen at Democratic Socialists of America party meetings, where the attendees endlessly raise personal grievances to grind all activity to a halt, narcissistically making themselves the center of attention. The leadership of the DSA hesitates to reject these people, because they fear alienating the downtrodden underclass. The most egregious are those that are offended on another‚Äôs behalf, as they use others as pawns in their attention-seeking.  Formalized leftist organizations, like the DSA party, are not the only victims of the Slave-Morality Leftist. In less formal groups that have no explicit command structure, the Slave-Morality Leftist demands hyperfixation on the most loudly offended, and the most aggressively complainant. Meetings and discussions seize as people compete to be the most victimized, demanding hyperfixation on the endless tiny details of grievance upon grievance. Whether this is from a sincere desire to make the most harmed the most heard, or a manipulation tactic by attention-seeking narcissists, the result is the same: The complete halt of operations and inevitable death of the organization.  As should be apparent, a movement or organization that rewards incapability and suppresses the direct ability to assert one‚Äôs will, cannot influence society to a meaningful and lasting degree. The American Left must reject the exaltation of weakness, and instead praise and reward elements of power and authority that are leveraged to enact Leftist change in society. Should the American Left continue its rejection of capability, there is no possibility for development beyond Capitalism in the United States.	1643139180.0	sclubi	/r/socialism/comments/sclubi/slave_morality_and_the_american_leftist/	Slave Morality and the American Leftist
