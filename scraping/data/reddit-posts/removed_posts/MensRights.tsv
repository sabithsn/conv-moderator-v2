2v9ngucp	This post could be pretty messy, I apology first  I've been having some deep thoughts lately as to why are misandry so persistent and prevalent (outside of this community of course), if you actually take time to read [horrible subs like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/), the pattern is pretty clear, its basically lies supporting lies, with enough numbers of people and louder voice, lies became the perceived "truth". No matter how logical and truthful you are, if you are in a group that has less number and are mostly silenced, you basically stands little chance of combating discrimination.  First let me get one thing straight to avoid misunderstanding. There is nothing WRONG with using the word "Feminist", since the feminism ideology is one of the main contributor to Misandry, which ultimately leads to the everyday discrimination we are facing.  But by only discussing the root of the problem might not addressing the currently situation, Its like we are in a middle of a Chess game, and we can't just magically start the game over, we will have to figure out the next step within the current composition, feminism won't just magically disappear, if you get what I mean.  There are downsides by ONLY using the word "feminist"  1. Misandry happens before feminism is even a thing, misandry could have been as long as human existed, in a nutshell feminist are likely to be misandrist but not all misandrist are feminist 2. Most average misandrist don't even identify themselves with any ideology let alone feminism, just look at [this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/), just how many of these people are actually serious feminists? And there are  rarely instance where people that identify as feminist actually supports men (I know its sound crazy, but there are feminist really do believe in equality), one example I came to mind is Cassie Jaye the producer of Red Pill Movie. Heck, even Warren Farrell used to be feminist. 3. But we can't just use the word "Women" either because this is overly generalizing and keeping potential ally out of our doors, we really need any support we could get, including Women who supports us, its numbers game after all. By saying stuff like "Woman hate us" we could sometimes be aiming at the wrong people.  But there is one thing we could be undoubtedly sure of, our true enemy is universally the Misandrist. They don't have to identify as ideology, they don't have to be in any political spectrum, they just simply hate men due to their own bias.  As trivial as it might sound, we would have to take one step at a time, first we need more numbers, by changing the way we address our enemy, it might not be much in the short term, but if could give us significantly more ally in the long term.	1642815289.0	s9qsaw	/r/MensRights/comments/s9qsaw/we_should_start_using_the_word_misandrist_more/	We should start using the word "Misandrist" more when we are addressing our enemy
5qqjd365	Hello everyone, post the senseless argument of introducing Marital Rape without any clinical evidence Indian MRA's have started the trend #MaritalStrike, which is now attracting attention from the celebs of the country and huge backlash from global feminists. It's time for men to unite against this constant bullying by feminists via the laws and the gynocentric social order.	1642851715.0	sa0rm3	/r/MensRights/comments/sa0rm3/marriage_strike_by_indian_mras/	Marriage Strike by Indian MRA's

Feel free to suggest points I may have missed.  **Home**  ¬∑ Be cautious of helping around the house. That can be seen as bowing to The Patriarchy. When your spouse asks for help, make sure to consider his request in the context of The Patriarchy. You should be declining his requests for help often. If he becomes despondent, and/or ceases asking for help, that‚Äôs a sign that you are succeeding over The Patriarchy.  ¬∑ You may feel an innate urge towards leaving Corporate America, and staying home to raise you children. Remember, this is an instinct borne of thousands of years of evolution. It must be suppressed. It is much more important to rise in Corporate America, and outsource child raising to caretakers and other lesser individuals.  **Career**  ¬∑ As society has advanced and shed its old ways, people have come to realize the value of Diversity, particularly in management roles. Contrary to olden times, when hiring was done based on merit, you should plan to have a leg-up on getting hired. Also, expect quick movement up to management ranks.  ¬∑ When in management, remember that You are the one who is In Charge. Do not solicit advise from more experienced peers, and certainly don‚Äôt solicit advise from your direct reports. Doing so would be seen as a sign of weakness. Rather, direct people what needs to be done. Anyone who pushes back is likely a member of The Patriarchy.  **Society**  ¬∑ Every male-owned small business is looking to cheat you. Do not believe anything from your mechanic, home contractor, or anyone else. You know what is best, regardless of your experience in any of these fields. Once you make your demands known, you may find some of these businesses are hesitant to work with you. Don‚Äôt worry, that‚Äôs just a sign of their membership in The Patriarchy.  ¬∑ It‚Äôs important to have a constant focus on Environmental issues, particularly Global Warming. Do not question the underlying motives of the existing narrative. Also, don‚Äôt worry about your own personal actions, as they can never make a difference. It‚Äôs not important for you to make any changes in your daily life, rather simply remember to repeat and support the existing narrative.  ¬∑ It‚Äôs equally important to have a constant focus on Social Justice issues. Again, do not question any underlying motives of the existing narrative. Particularly the possibility of Social Justice Issues being used as a distraction from growing wealth inequality, and the relentless rise of a corporate oligarchy. Remember, the United States is the most racist, cop killing-est, Patriarchal country on the face of the earth. Don‚Äôt pay any attention to anyone who says otherwise, particularly those who are using so-called ‚ÄúData.‚Äù	1642986962.0	sb9gff	/r/MensRights/comments/sb9gff/the_modern_womans_guide_to_life_and_to_defeating/	The Modern Woman‚Äôs Guide to Life, and to Defeating The Patriarchy
h394ibm1	If it is, I'm out. I have liked what I'm seeing in this subreddit so far for these recent months but I'm seeing some posts that are really conservative crap and sometimes even misogynist shit.  If this is a conservative movement, I'm out. I don't want to side with homophobia, misogyny or racism and you've got to know that if this is the case then this movement is not going to win no matter what.	1643154721.0	scrkmy	/r/MensRights/comments/scrkmy/i_really_hope_that_this_movement_is_not_siding/	I really hope that this movement is not siding with conservative right-wing or anything like that.

p7tjr	Hey guys. Remember last night when you got gas alone? Then went inside and got a snack alone and didn't feel unsafe? What about that time at the bar on a date when you went to take a piss and came back to your drink untampered with and waiting for you? Did it even cross your mind that someone could or would have drugged it? Of course it didn't. These are things men don't think about. Could something bad happen to a man in one of these circumstances? Sure. But it's less likely. And you all know it. But let's ignore this and all the other male privileges we have for a second.  I've been subbed to this subreddit for about a year and I just have to say. Most of you are fucking pussies. If you read the first paragraph and got offended or pissed off, wanting to call me a cuck or a liberal, this is directed at you. Go ahead. Call me names. Ban me from this shit subreddit. I don't care.   I've seen some legitimate arguments for men's rights on this sub. There are some real injustices that are targeted at men in the world. But most of you don't care about the real issues. After women spent years unable to vote, unable to share opinions, unable to speak out about what some man has done to her out of fear that she will be scoffed at and nobody would believe her. You get on this subreddit and bitch that a women is in your study group and you think there should be men only groups? Or that a girl was able to join boyscouts, but a boy can't join girlscouts? Shit there's still countries where women are treated like property. But you have it bad because a girl joined your son's little league baseball team, and baseball is a MAN'S game damnit!  If this is how you actually feel, fine. Do something about it. But no. You can't. Because it's too late. It's too far gone at this point. We're passed the point of no return. Shut the fuck up, get off your fucking computer, and go out and be the change you want to see in the world. I saw a post about a college kid wanting change in his school because he felt men were treated unfairly. He posted asking if he should speak up and have his concerns addressed. And all you fucking incel keyboard warriors told him not to. Told him he'd regret it. Told him it's no use. Well if it's no use why bitch online about it? Wouldn't you encourage someone to try and make real world change? Or is it just easier to pretend you have it hard online when we all know we don't.  Needless to say I'll be banned from the sub and won't be returning. Which is fine with me. I just had to get this out there. Good luck living your terrible hard lives. I know you want the world to feel pitty on you because... well I'm not sure why to be honest. But it doesn't. You could put your efforts into something meaningful online. Or you can circlejerk each other's tiny porn addicted cocks because wOmAn HaVe MoRe RiGhTs.   TLDR: This sub sucks.	1643175421.0	scyid4	/r/MensRights/comments/scyid4/this_sub/	This sub.
btan65b5	I have a question for us man here. Why can't not start living without woman in our life?  I mean just ignoring them don't go near them or start talking with them.  Why can't we just be us and live our life accordingly to our rules and ambitions?   Sometimes I have to say Mgtow or Herbivore Males are right, the don't need woman in there life's to be happy.  The have hobbies, friends and a god job live by there own rules.  Instead of reacting to what females say and did. Just ignoring them is better and by ignoring them I mean much more.  It is just a question from me, a fellow male advocate	1643190867.0	sd2er9	/r/MensRights/comments/sd2er9/man_start_living/	Man start living
