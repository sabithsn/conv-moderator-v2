gsdo2	Long story short, I filled out the w2 and stuff back in 2019, I effectively filled it out for 0 withholding because i was under the impression that the less withholdings you have, the more they pull for taxes, the more likely you are to get a refund come tax time. Im married, my wife filled her out for 2 (because one for her one for being married and filling together), i have mine for 0. Somehow I paid less taxes than her even though I earn more. went to file taxes, and we're paying in at the moment.

The same sentiments have been echoed by others as well with predictions that we will reach approx. 9.64B by 2064 (weirdly precise predictions) then taper off to 8.8B by the end of the century.  As long as population decline is occurring across the planet and not just in certain regions/countries and provided the decline is proportional to the current population of a region then isn't it a good thing? I always thought overpopulation (or eventual overpopulation) was a bad thing for the environment due, in part, from competition of resources.. if we are already causing untold damage to the environment at 7B do you think we'll be any better at 10B or 20B - its not as if we'll all suddenly reach a utopian state of perfect equilibrium with our environment.   I understand its still important to understand the factors driving this decline to ensure it doesn't go too far but I feel like our current population size is already pretty large?	1643208451.0	sd7m9u	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd7m9u/eli5_why_is_populationbirth_decline_a_bad_thing/	eli5 Why is population/birth decline a bad thing?
elfop	I’ve been working in restaurants since I was 14 years old. There’s always that one old lady or man that orders the soup of the day and sends it back because it’s not hot enough.   I recall one lady in particular that would ask to microwave the soup for 4 minutes minimum until it’s basically boiling!! The number times I burned my hands while getting that soup bowl out of the microwave..   Is there a reason for this??	1643210386.0	sd8c7x	/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/sd8c7x/eli5_why_do_old_people_say_their_soup_is_cold/	ELI5: Why do old people say their soup is cold even if it’s not?
