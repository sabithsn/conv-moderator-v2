eayrhriy	Today around noon my partner sent me a text asking if I want to come over to his friends place for drinks. I let him know that I didn’t want to drink because I have work tomorrow at 9am and that I wanted to leave be 11pm so we get home by 12 and then I get a decent sleep before work.    He told me to come at 5pm so I left at 4pm (it’s also a 40min drive to his friends house) because I wanted to get food beforehand and I let my partner know. I’ve just left home and 10 minutes into the drive he calls me and asks if I can go back to get him some spare clothes, so I do.  Finally, I arrive at his friends place so I call him to let him know I’m here and then he asks me if I can go buy him some alcohol because he’s run out. So I go buy him some alcohol and then I come back to the friends house. Luckily the bottle shop wasn’t a long drive.   Then, it’s getting close to 11pm and my partner said we will leave at 10:50pm. I tell him it’s time to go and then he changes his mind and says he wants to stay now. I would’ve left earlier if he wanted to stay longer and he knows I have work tomorrow morning and it’s a 40 min drive back.   I was meant to drop one of his friends off home on the way but then he ended up going home with another friend. So my partner calls me when I’m already halfway home and asks if I’ve dropped off the friend and I said that the other friend took him home and I asked him why. He said that he wanted to know if I was in the area because he wanted me to pick him up and take him home with me.   I said no and he said he will sort something out.   I’m a bit sad he didn’t come home with me but I won’t stop him from hanging out with his friends.   I am a bit upset because I felt like I was being dragged around a bit.   Am I rhe asshole for being upset at him?	1642771996.0	s9au2k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9au2k/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_partner_for_dragging/	AITA for being upset at my partner for dragging me around?
7s8bg5cy	So I'd known her since high school and we aren't close friends, more like acquaintances. I do computer repair in my spare time and she was always willing to pay me in the past. She called me one day and asked me to repair her and her daughter's computers. I went to her house and did both computers. At the time I was charging $50 to work on a computer. I decided to be nice and knock $20 off because it was the same house. I told her the price and she looks at me and says "I shouldn't have to pay you, we're friends." I just stood there staring at her. I then decided if she thinks the fact we are friends is a good reason not to pay for services rendered, I'd cure the problem. I cut off all contact and sure enough, she called me a month later needing something fixed on her computer. I simply said, "That sucks, I hope you find someone to fix it." and hung up on her. She then proceeded to complain on social media about what a jerk I am because I won't help her. When someone would ask why I wouldn't I tell them. Some people called me a jerk for not helping. I don't feel like I'm the asshole here, but I'll admit I'm a bit biased in my favor.	1642773745.0	s9best	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9best/aita_i_cut_off_someone_ive_known_since_high/	AITA I cut off someone I've known since high school because she refused to pay for computer repair because we're friends.
it6cxvv0	Throwaway and I'm on mobile, sorry for formatting.  My (30f) husband (32m) have been happily married for 7 years, never before have we had issues and never argued.   For context as its important - our relationship heavily revolves around video games. Gaming is a main hobby for the two of us and we will play a lot either on our own, together or with friends.  My husband got a new job last year, and since then it is almost like I've witnessed a new side I've never seen before. He will constantly want to go out drinking with people from work and would like to spend a lot of time with them outside the office.  It came to heads recently when I proposed going out for dinner, this was the moment he blew me off and went out with his work colleagues (whom he does refer to as 'friends').  I asked specifically if going forward weekends can be for us only as I feel like we don't spend enough time together. This was agreed to, but he didn't agree with my statement of "We don't spend time together" as in his eyes, we spend time together on games daily. I don't see sat behind a monitor playing games as spending time together, and clarified that if he thought spending time together behind a screen was meaningful, then that goes for texting his work colleagues too.  He came home yesterday, stating he was asking to go out this weekend but he had said no because "It's what you want." The tone he gave off was extremely mad with me, and when I asked him about this, he thought it was a AH move of me to ask him not to go out on weekends.  I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here for requesting weekends to ourselves. I'm not asking him not to go out and I've specifically said to maybe just go out on a Friday but please can our 2 days off work during a work week be for us.  So Reddit AITA?	1642775875.0	s9c5us	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9c5us/aita_for_asking_my_husband_not_to_spend_time_with/	AITA for asking my husband not to spend time with work colleagues?
ivdohswv	Throwaway account in case I am able to be identified.  &#x200B;  I work for a pretty big company in my country and as part of my role I conduct a lot of interviews. One thing we do is called a "Lunch interview" where we interview the candidate over lunch, except this is held in the canteen and the lunch offered is the same items available to all staff. This is to see how they treat the place and how they interact with other employees around. This part of the interview isn't nearly as intense as the rest as we aim to take a more casual approach focusing on team fit and communication skills.   Anyway, the role I was interviewing for is a new role which seems to be pretty demanding in terms of what is expected. The candidate had the right qualifications and decent experience so it was looking promising. Everything seemed to go well until we began to make the lunch. They put 2 slices of bread in the toaster and after a couple of seconds of waiting popped the toaster and removed 2 clearly untoasted pieces of bread, jokingly saying they preferred warm bread. I thought this was a bit strange but tried to carry on. Then after he buttered the bread he asked if he needed to wash the knife. I was thinking "of course you wash the knife who else is going to wash it for you?" but I just politely said "yes please".   In the debrief I brought up these issues and said I was concerned about the team fit and that they may cut corners. The other interviewers on the call agreed with me and we decided not to move forward with them. I told my wife about this later in the evening and she said I was being an asshole about it and we lost a good candidate. Unfortunately she doesn't understand how corporate life is (she works as a waitress) but she was saying how disappointed she was with me. I feel like I was right to trust my gut instinct on this and honestly I'm just looking to get other opinions on this, preferably from those who work in a corporate setting.  Also, if this gets any traction I will be deleting the post to make sure I don't get identified.	1642776360.0	s9cc1a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9cc1a/aita_for_not_hiring_someone/	AITA For Not Hiring Someone?
iveb98wv	I was involved with a married man. I already know IATA for that… but I believed we were going to be together. He told me they were done and we would get married blah blah. I was stupid. Anyway, I eventually came to my senses and left. But when I found someone else, married guy gets all possessive and jealous, saying he wanted to get back together and that he’d divorced, sold the house etc. I figured he was playing games so cut ties. Years later he tells me he’s got stage 4 cancer. At first it felt good to drop all the baggage and just be a friend to him through his hard time, until I sensed him trying to weasel back into my life. After some light stalking I see he and wifey went on a holiday a few weeks earlier and turns out they still live together (I’m sure never even split), and I bet she has no idea of his wandering nature. I told him I was done and he blames me for being selfish and cruel during his hard time. We don’t talk at all anymore but I’m wondering if IATA for not letting go and being there for him when he needed support?	1642776805.0	s9chum	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9chum/aita_for_not_supporting_my_married_ex_thru_cancer/	AITA for not supporting my married ex thru cancer treatment?
ivaw6xcw	My family is fucked up in a lot of different ways. My dad was a serial cheater and my mom had a really bad temper. My dad's business went bankrupt because he stole money from it. He has a horrible reputation and my mom took all of the anger of dad's fuck ups on us. We grew up in a small town and my parent's antics were a running joke in the town.   My girlfriend actually met someone from my home town and learnt about my family.  She is very upset that I hid this from her. I have always been vague about my family and I don't talk to anyone from my family apart for my sister.   She is upset because we have been dating for 3 years and I haven't talked to her about my family. She is sad that I didn't trust her with my past. I trust her but this is not something I like to talk about at all. I have moved out and moved on, I am not planning to go back there if I can.   I get it though, she talks about her childhood a lot and about her family, When I talk about my childhood, I talk about my friends and I avoid talking about my family. I understand why she wants to know about my family and I feel bad that I hid this from her. She is my girlfriend, I feel like she deserves to know this,	1642777149.0	s9cm0l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9cm0l/aita_for_not_telling_my_girlfriend_the_truth/	AITA for not telling my girlfriend the truth about my family?
7jrr3p17	I swear I'm not trolling, I'm actually fighting with my friend over this and have no idea what's going on.  So I (f27) got a rescue kitten from a farm, an adorable black kitten (I put a pic recently on r/eyebleach if you want to see how adorable he is). I gave him the name of a white french singer (Brassens) because the kitten needed a name at the vet, but I wasn't sure I was going to keep him at that time. I talked briefly with my friend, J (f25) to see if she wanted to adopt him as I wasn't planning on rescuing a kitten and I'm starting a new job, so timing wasn't great. In the end, she decided to not adopt the kitten. But had she adopted him, she wanted to call him Kanye. I said as a joke "isn't it a bit on the nose to call a black kitten after a black celebrity?" To which she replied "well in my opinion it's a hate crime to name a black cat after a yt, probably problematic, old french dude"... I thought she was joking and was just offended I laughed at the name "Kanye" but she wasn't, and yesterday she wrote to me "I asked my date, who isn't white and he also thinks it's a hate crime to give him the name of a white old french dude". I told her I couldn't care less about her date's opinion even if he wasn't white, and then she was "surely you're joking, a POC is telling you it's a hate crime, I can't believe you right now" and she's legit pissed about it. J is algerian, I'm white, but ffs I didn't name the kitten Jim Crow, I just like Georges Brassens songs. But since two people, one of whom is my friend who usually have a good opinion on things, think I'm a hate crime committing AH, I ask Reddit for the verdict.	1642778765.0	s9d7ua	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9d7ua/aita_for_naming_my_black_kitten_after_a_white/	AITA for naming my black kitten after a white French singer?
faesbky3	so i (f21) got a job in a local supermarket last year as a christmas temp, i was only contracted three months.   around the middle of december, i was ill and missed a week of work so i went back on the 23rd and 24th of december before the shop shut for a few days. i found out that week that contracts had been extended, mine included, but no one had told me anything. i have a manager and a few team leaders, not one of them got in contact with me to tell me this. my original contract was supposed to end on the 30th of december.  i found out from a co-worker, who is also a temp, and i was pretty annoyed bc of how i found out and how late i found out.   i tested positive over new years and i didn’t hear a single thing from any of my managers/team leaders, not even a quick text to ask how i was.  i’ve had a lot of problems with the authority figures where i work bc they don’t have any communication skills whatsoever. my times have been changed and i haven’t been told, therefore i have shown up to work late. i was shown two different rotas the other week and was told to go off the wrong one so again, i was late for work and had to change my plans for the whole week bc the rotas were completely different.   and just today, i found out that my contract has possibly been extended again. it’s supposed to end around the beginning of feb (sometime between the 5th and 8th, again nothing has been said to me so idk). i know it’s *possibly* been extended bc we can look at our shifts online and i’m still scheduled until mid-march but i haven’t been told anything by anyone.   my mother also works in this shop and she has for over ten years. she’s getting pissed off with me bc of how upset i am with the lack of communication going on.  so reddit, aita?	1642783444.0	s9ez90	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ez90/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_workplace/	AITA for being upset with my workplace?

jdy87	So I'm on mobile so I'll try to make a long story short. My girlfriend and I are planning on buying some property with my down payment so we're able to move out of our houses. We need a realtor and we got a lot of recommendations from friends but I told my girlfriend I would prefer to go with a male over a female. I explained that I would be spending most of the time with the realtor and that would probably include a lot of alone time and that makes me feel uncomfortable. I am a very respectful guy who comes from a very religious background, I just do not believe that men and women should be spending extended periods of time together if they are not in some sort of relationship (friendship is also fine). It is my personal belief and it's not something that I push on others. I also want to avoid any allegations or anything of the sort as I have seen on the news women accusing men of something and it's just someone's word against someone else's word. I feel as though it would make me a lot more comfortable to have a male realtor but she said that I'm following some sort of "mike pence rule". I do not feel like I am hurting anyone's career as a lot of people out there will hire a female realtor with no issue but it's just something I have a problem with but now she's saying I'm being sexist. I do not believe I should be pushed to do something I am uncomfortable with, I am not an animal but I just do not want to be accused of something. I told her that if she could ensure that she is there every time then we could but she said she couldn't confirm that as she's very busy with her schooling. Should I just forgo the realtor and just use a notary for the paperwork? Am I being the asshole here?	1642785110.0	s9fmf5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9fmf5/aita_because_i_dont_wanna_hire_a_female_realtor/	AITA because I don't wanna hire a female realtor?
zqo4ghr	So let me first start off by saying that no, I haven’t asked my BF to cut his hair. I’m not going to and I don’t plan on ever doing that. And I also don’t plan on pressuring him to do that either.   So the whole time we were dating before, he’s always had short hair his entire life and it wasn’t until ab 3 years ago he started growing his hair out. I’ve never been a fan of long hair on men. My entire life. It’s always been a huge turn off for me. Like, it’s probably one of my top 5 turn offs, and I know it sounds harsh and I get that a lot of people can’t relate. But I can’t help what turns me on and off lol.   But here’s two things I think I should also mention. He’s always disliked it when I wear makeup. He’s explicitly told me many many times that he prefers it when I don’t have any makeup on and when I’m 100% myself. I used to dye my hair blonde for years and years and he never liked it as much as my natural hair color which is basically black. He would also make comments all the time that he doesn’t like when I dye my hair different colors. Or when I wear makeup. Now, I understand that makeup and hair are in TOTALLY different ballparks because you can just put makeup on and off every day in a flash.   So I know that hair is a big part of a person’s identity, which is why I’m here posting about this. He’s asked me before of course if I prefer him with long hair or short hair. I told him I like his short hair more, and I can tell it upset him. Understandably so. I get it. I mean I don’t like it when people tell me I don’t look good in a certain hair color, but I think dyeing it isn’t the same as growing it out.   This is basically more like a conscious thing that I struggle with a lot. OBVIOUSLY I still love him to death. I would never ask him to change anything about himself because I don’t like telling people if they look better in X/Y/Z. And no, this hasn’t affected my relationship with him because I still love him and am attracted to him no matter what he looks like. I’m kinda lost if I should communicate with him that it basically turns me off, but I definitely think it would be a really bad idea to bring it up like that.   At the end of the day, I know this is such a minor problem. It’s really not the biggest deal in the world. It’s fine. I just think about this a lot and I feel bad that I don’t like his hair. I mean honestly it would be great to hear some advice if anyone has gone through something similar so I can figure out how to go about this. Or if this is something just not worth mentioning. I know I’m not the only person in the world who has not liked a certain way their partner has changed their appearance hahah.   So… AITA?	1642787396.0	s9ghl1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ghl1/aita_for_wishing_my_bf_would_cut_his_hair/	AITA for wishing my BF would cut his hair?
d2fzjmtv	For context, no one is really calling me an asshole except for myself. My mom died in March and her wish was to be buried next to her brother. I was going through a lot of grief and asked my step dad to take a couple spoonfuls of her ashes from the urn before she was buried. he said ok, and I took some home in a ziplock bag. I basically cuddled it at night for a long time.   It’s almost a year later and I just feel like an asshole. I really wished I asked her when she was still alive to take part of her ashes, but she had cancer and it was just difficult to talk about, so I never really thought to ask. So I basically took her part of her ashes without her permission and there’s not really a way to ask her if it’s okay. Everyone is saying it’s fine but I don’t really know if it was. It’s hard to tell with my step dad because sometimes he’s just trying to be nice and not confront people, so I don’t know if it’s really okay or if he’s just saying that.   I’m mostly thinking about this because my 2 year old sister and step dad moved across the country, away from the rest of the family about a week ago and it got me thinking about saying goodbye and stuff.  so basically, AITA for going against my moms death wishes? Should I just take it back to the gravesite? Wish I could ask.	1642787868.0	s9go3i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9go3i/aita_for_taking_part_of_my_moms_ashes_before_she/	AITA for taking part of my mom’s ashes before she was buried?
fsuz7w8s	So me (14 female) and my friend (13 female) have been friends for a long time. And yes I know we are both young but I don’t know what else to do. We’ve only been friends since August but we’ve grown really close during that time and feels comfortable with telling me things that’s he wouldn’t tell other people. One night she told me that she didn’t feel good and I asked what’s wrong and she was freaking out. She said I didn’t want to tell you this but I’ve been snorting pills. I asked her what kind are they, where did she get them from and she said she found them under her bed. She then sent me a picture of them and I did my research on the numbers on the pills and they were pain killers. Not like you have a head ache and just take one, like you just broke a bone or have cancer pain killers. She was also snorting her moms weight loss pills and and thinks this is all fine. She claims she’s been Doing this for months but I don’t think she really has. I told her she needs to stop because after all she did just text me telling me they made her want to pass out and she threw up. I’m really worried for her and don’t know what to do. So would I be the asshole?	1642787912.0	s9goo5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9goo5/wibta_if_i_told_someone_my_best_fiend_was/	WIBTA if I told someone my best fiend was snorting pain killers?
fceiivgs	I (20f) was at the gym when I saw a man (20s) that looked super good. I am always super extroverted and love complimenting people so I go up and say “Hey you look really good!” While he was resting. Im about to make my leave when he asks if I want his number, I say thanks but Im not looking for anything, it was just a compliment. He scoffs and says “women these days…” and goes back to his weights.    I told my friend what happened and he said that I should just keep it to myself next time as when a dude get complimented his mind goes to one thing.

ivlxhr6m	My gf and I have been together for 4 years.   Her parents were very toxic. One example is I would sleep over at her house a couple nights a week and her parents always had the temp at 75/80 and I’d always turn it down to 65/70. Her parents eventually told her it was getting expensive and asked me to pay for the extra to cover it. She would pay for it for me which upset them because they thought it was my responsibility.  Her dad also said the n word to me. We were driving to pick up a birthday present for her and I was playing my music. I guess my gf would always play the clean version of rap for her dad, and he got upset and asked why all music now a days says the n word BUT ACTUALLY SAID THE WORD. (I’m black and she and her family are white)  When they fell out (for other reasons) I told my gf how her dad was racist.   My gf went NC and then LC and now is repairing the relationship. She started having daily phone calls and even goes over once a week. I feel like it’s disrespectful to me because they don’t like me. We hit hard times and they helped her pay a couple bills but I know they are trying to show her I can’t take care of her.  Last night I told her she needs to stop going over there and she isn’t allowed to talk about me at all. She told me I was being unreasonable and they are just trying to make sure we are ok, especially in the middle of a pandemic. AITA for wanting her to stop talking to her parents so much and stop going over there?  EDIT: my gf went LC and NC because her mom had a history of bringing up her weight and monitoring her eating habits (she used to be overweight, but has recently lost a lot of weight) and her mom had always made her feel ashamed of her stretch marks etc. her mom was trying to force her to go to college when it wasn’t what she wanted to do (she has a nice career now anyway) it had nothing to do with me  EDIT #2: my gf and i have argued over her father using the word because she “knows” he meant no harm and just wanted to be educated on why the word is used so much but i know it was racist. She educated him after the fact and said she didn’t agree with him using the word. When she was younger she used to use the word with her friends (she had the “pass” - all black friend group who obviously need to learn never to give a pass) but once she educated herself she stopped using the word and now it makes her uncomfortable at even the thought of using it which is why sometimes i joke with her to get her to say it but she won’t and tells me to stop.   EDIT #3: my gf found this post and now wants to talk to me so I’ll give an update in a bit. I think you guys are wrong with the YTA and hopefully she does too. This sub is obviously very bias and thinks everything is abuse	1642788612.0	s9gysn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9gysn/aita_for_telling_my_gf_she_has_to_stop_seeing_her/	AITA for telling my gf she has to stop seeing her parents
ive0fvl2	I’ve been really distant and disinterested towards my boyfriend because of what he did in the title above. I was abu*ed in my last relationship.   My boyfriend was helping his cousin move out her apartment that she shared with her boyfriend. The guy was supposed to have left to go drive a load cross country. Apparently he came back, while outside he started to put hands on my boyfriends cousin, my boyfriend who was down the sidewalk saw this, ran to his car and fired a shot in the air. Then he proceeded to drop the magazine out the magazine well and rack the slide back to the rear catching the other bullet that was in the chamber. Placed the magazine and bullet on the car and used it against his cousin’s boyfriend face with the butt of the firearm and the rest is history.  He was arrested and etc. his cousin initially sided with him but later became uncooperative with authorities leaving my boyfriend (her cousin out to dry).   When I found this story out I became distant towards him because I’m scared of him. My boyfriend says he has never physically laid his hands on a woman and that he’s sorry but he had to defend his cousin.    He has never shown any kind of aggression towards me he hasn’t even yelled at me, EVER.	1642788864.0	s9h2gx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9h2gx/aita_for_being_distant_and_disinterested_in_my/	AITA for being distant and disinterested in my boyfriend after finding out he got in trouble defending his cousin against another man
en0s3ay6	I (24F) got married to my husband (22M) 4 months ago. I spent THOUSANDS of dollars on my wedding photographer because she had amazing reviews and I loved her style. We talked, did the contracts, and I paid. This was all about a year in advance. At about the 6 month to the wedding point we did engagement pictures (included in the price). I asked her usual turnaround time and she said 2 weeks tops. A month later I finally got my pictures back after texting a couple of times and her leaving me on read. I brushed it off because I loved most of the pictures besides few she said she’d edit people out of the background and didn’t but I didn’t push my luck with it. Come wedding time everything was great. She had my shot list, she was on time, and she was professional. Well here I am 4 months later and I haven’t seen a single wedding picture. Not even one. I was told her turn around was 4-6 weeks with sneak peaks during that time. I message her about once every 2 weeks and she responds about every other time. Her excuse has been that her internet went out and she couldn’t do anything, but I know she lives in a college town so she has access to campus, Starbucks has wifi, he’ll even McDonald’s. I’ve tried not to rock the boat because I don’t want her to delete pictures or do a half ass job but I’m frustrated. I’m even more mad because I know people personally who have had newborn shoots, senior portraits, and maternity pictures taken after me and they have them all back. I know it’s less pictures but still. I don’t know if she lost the pictures and just won’t tell me or what. Am I the asshole if I blast her because people should know what they are getting into with her.  Edit to add: I just realized she’s actually given edited pictures back to a friend of mine who had a their wedding 6 weeks after mine.

gxkxir14	I f(27) just found out my younger sister’s (21) husband is infertile. My sister really wants a child and was very disappointed when she found out. I felt really bad for her and tried to my best comfort her. A while ago, she announced that she’s pregnant and we were all really happy for her. She told me that her husband let her do it with another man so they could have a child- I thought that was weird but it’s not my place to judge.   She wants to hold a gender reveal party for her child and asked me to help. Of course I’m doing everything because she is tired from her pregnancy. Recently, I was helping her deep cleaning her room and found my husbands shirt. At first I didn’t think anything of it and moved on.   Then, while I was putting up the decor for the party, my sister went in her room to call someone. I didn’t mean to overhear her but she was really loud. Basically she said something about “I’m so happy it finally worked blah blah blah no will have to know” that sounded really weird but then I remembered my husbands shirt I found in her room.  When she came out, I asked her who she was talking to. She just blushed and said “someone special.”  Throwback to the day before the party, I find out that i got the job I’ve been applying for. I decided to call my husband and tell him this but he wasn’t picking up ANY of my calls. I then decided to call my sister but she also didn’t pick up. I decided to go to her house instead but once I got to her there- I saw her with my husband… holding each other. I overheard them saying “our baby is going to be so beautiful”  I was livid. I called my husband again but I saw him look at his phone and go “she won’t leave me alone”. I was so angry and heartbroken but I knew lashing out wasn’t give me the satisfaction I needed.   I decided to act like nothing happened, but behind their backs, I was planning to crash the gender reveal in the worst way possible. I decided to invite my sister’s ex who use to abused her. I know it’s mean but I didnt care.   At the party, while they were eating the cake, I called her ex and told him all about my plan. They weren’t on good terms so he decided to come over to upset her. When he arrived, she was livid. She was throwing tantrums and trying to run away from him but he wasn’t really doing anything. A response to recalling traumatic events I assume. While running, my sister slipped and fell down really, really hard. At that moment she started screaming, “my baby my baby”. My mom dealt with the whole situation and a couple days later we found out she had a miscarriage. My sister was devastated and still can’t figure out who called her ex.   I’m pro life and finding out about the baby’s death made me really guilty. So much so that I don’t know if I can be forgiven for it.  Today I found out that my mom knows about what I did and is threatening to tell everyone. I told her I did nothing wrong. I really don’t think I did because I would never intentionally hurt my sister. Am I the asshole? I’ll apologise if I am.	1642789347.0	s9h91q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9h91q/aita_for_ruining_my_younger_sisters_gender_reveal/	AITA for ruining my younger sister’s gender reveal?
icpvl0yg	I (24f) married my husband (38m) about a year ago. He and his ex-wife have two kids together and co-parent as much as they can. Their oldest (16m) who lives with my husband and I. And their youngest (10m) who lives with Kim.  I love and adore both my step-sons, and their mom is great.  I try not to parent the boys too much because they’ve only known me about three years and I never want them to think i’m trying to replace their mom. I do show up to any school events that i’m able to and try to make sure they know i’m there and that I love them though.  Recently the oldest came home from school and said he didn’t think god was real. My husband immediately grounded him, took away his games, phone, and even canceled his upcoming birthday party.  I’m not religious so I didn’t see what the problem was. I tried to talk with my husband but he said his ex-wife agreed with him and I wasn’t actually a parent so he didn’t need my input.  This is where i’m probably the ass-hole. My husband works at a hospital and typically has 12+ hour shifts with 0-2 days off a week. So I gave my step-son my old iphone 7 and made a pre-pay account for him and just told him to keep it out of his dads sight. I let him play his games when dads at work and I was even able to do a small birthday party for him with a couple friends over.  Unfortunately my husband came home from work earlier than expected and caught oldest in our bedroom (it was quicker to put the games back where husband hid them instead of running across the house to do so) playing the game. He lost it, so I came clean about letting him play games when husband was away. Eventually step-son brought up the birthday party and phone, husband was absolutely furious and told me I couldn’t “play parent” and had no right to make any decisions in his sons life. Now we’re not talking, he’s been sleeping in the guest room so i think I might be the asshole.	1642790185.0	s9hk8r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hk8r/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_ground_my_stepson/	AITA for not letting my husband ground my step-son?
ivkvt5xm	My (26F) boyfriend (26M) wanted to meet me on Friday around 5 PM, but I couldn’t meet him because I work till 6 PM. At around 7 PM he said he would come meet me as I was free now but at around 8 PM he texted saying he can’t come as his bike is with his brother.   I am ok if he isn’t coming because he is tired/ he has work/ or some other reason related to him but I’m not ok with the reason that his bike is not available to him when he needs it. This happened earlier and I told him to keep his bike with him when he knows he needs it. He gave the bike to his brother just before telling me he was coming to meet me. His brother didn’t return back on time so he couldn’t come to meet me. This upset me.  Second thing, my boyfriend’s parents have a car which he can use. But he didn’t mention anything about the car. So I thought  the car might not be available which is why he cancelled the plan to meet me instead of coming by car.  But then I get a call from him saying he was going to meet his friend and I could understand he was going by car. He could have come to meet me by car if it was available instead of cancelling meeting me.  This upset me more.  He understood from my tone I was upset and asked me the reason. I mentioned the following reasons - bike not being available  - though car was available he didn’t come to meet me   His reason was he didn’t think about car. But his friend asked him to get his car that’s when he realised he could go by car. He apologised for everything. But I just couldn’t make terms with the fact that he didn’t realise he can come by other means of transport like he’s going to meet his friend.   I was upset, sad and angry. So I told him I didn’t want to go on the date which is in Saturday because this situation has upset me. He replied saying it was my wish. He didn’t try to calm me down, Neither tried to change my mind about the date. I felt like he doesn’t give a damn about me nor he is concerned about me.   When I asked him why wasn’t he trying to change my mind, he said he apologised and that should be enough. He also said it was my fault to cancel the date and he’s not going to beg me or convince me to come.   I feel expecting your boyfriend to convince you after he messes up is ok. Please tell me if this thought is wrong. I’m ready to change to be a better person.

6q8i937r	This happened around four years ago now however it still plays on my mind.   At the time I was with my ex (both 21) for about a year until he started a new job and became close with someone else 4 years younger than ourselves. I was suffering with my mental health at the time and it caused him to want to be single, therefore he became very involved with this other person. A few weeks later he began trailing back to me unsure of whether or not he made the right decision of breaking up. It was very back and forth for a time before finally getting back together. However I learned that they had sex a few times and he wanted to remain friends with her. I felt weird but I was so blinded by love that I tried my hardest to brush it off and forget about it. I was even encouraged by him to become friends with her. His tone would change anytime I had a negative reaction to him bringing her up in convo and honestly looking back now it seemed like I had two choices, either be friends with this girl and be ok with it or the relationship fails (again blinded by love). He went as a far as to tell me not to post any photos of us incase she saw and got upset. (she didn’t know we were back together). They were still in heavy contact and were even still expected to go to a couple of concerts they had booked together in the near future. Overtime she began acting up about he and I spending more time together and I remember a convo with him one night where he said if she keeps acting weird I’m not going a take her to these concerts. After hearing that I just thought well f*ck it. I have reached breaking point. So about a week later I purposely decided to post a photo of us on social media knowing she would see it and she went ballistic. She ended up messaging him calling him names calling me names being very verbally abusive and that was the last straw for him and cut contact with her. At the time I did that I felt a sense of pride and relief but now four years down the line I’ve had time to reflect and find it very bitchy that I did that and think now the problem wasn’t us girls to one another but HIM to us? Again I wish I knew better back then to just walk away rather than stay to try and fight… but in terms of doing what I did was I the asshole??	1642790739.0	s9hrin	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hrin/aita_for_purposely_triggering_another_person/	AITA for purposely triggering another person knowing they would end up furious.
hx8fh4ig	(Long time lurker, first time poster)  My mother T and I (19F) recently got into a heated conversation over me taking this semester off to focus on my mental health and I wanted some outside opinions on if I would be TA for doing so. For context, my mother and I have had a rocky relationship since my parents divorced in 2012. Both my bio parents have mental health issues as do my 4 siblings, but only 2 of my siblings are currently being treated for theirs. I personally have struggled since I was a child and bullying in school escalated this. I did go in-patient at 17 during my senior year of high school after I was kidnapped and assaulted (I was picked up by the cops and my mom immediately put me inpatient), however my mother would only allow me to be treated for Bipolar Disorder and only allow the psychiatrist to give me Sertaline as that worked for her, according to her own words. However, that medicine didn’t work for me the brief 2 months I was on it and made me more depressed, and now it has been about 2 years since I was last treated for anything. I finished my first semester of college and made the deans list while also juggling the care of my nieces, nephew and younger sister while my mom works 70+ hour weeks (my nieces and nephew were abandoned so we are raising them and my mom works with the vaccines). I’ve been spiraling and have to force myself out of bed to manage the house while she works, and adding school back on top of that is too much for me. I tried to bring it up with her today before she left for work and she said that I am making excuses, there’s nothing wrong with me, and that I should just push through. But I know that if I don’t take a break I will fail and lose out on my scholarships I have. I don’t want to disappoint her, and I feel a tad bit like TA for even asking to do so.

a6lafbhi	I, 18f, am a full time college student studying 15-18 credit hours a semester and working 30 hours a week on top of that. I live with my parents and have a car note I have to pay every month. I have worked for Starbucks for almost 2 years and became a shift manager right as I turned 18.   My parents are the ones who initially pushed me to get a job and it was more manageable back in high school. Now,my location is super toxic, im constantly being yelled at due to supply shortages, and a lady even threw hot coffee at me the other day because she said it wasn’t 205°F like she asked. That was my final straw.  I have wanted to quit my job for a while but my parents have told me I must work a job with a minimum 25 hours a week if I am to live at home during college. I don’t pay them rent or anything, they just want me to have a job to pay off my car. But I use the refund check from my university to pay for the car up until the next semester where I then do the same thing. I still have about 1,000 left after I pay it off. I really don’t need a job.  Last week I finally quit. The constant yelling from customers and lack of management support was my breaking point. I had expectations by my own manager that I couldn’t met because she left me with 2 baristas closing and we had to be out in 30 minutes with the close perfect or I would get corrective action. it just because really strict and impossible for me to enjoy working 30 hours. I was also really struggling to balance work and school. Im worried that as a result of the stress, I could risk my GPA and spot on the deans list.   When I told my parents they were furious. They said I should have found another job before i quit and had discussions with my parents about quitting. I told them i have intentions to get another one very soon but i just needed a break to focus on school for the next few weeks. They haven’t talked to me for days.

is5h3mye	My friend (F32) and I (F30) have been friends for a few years now and she had her first baby 2 years ago. While she was pregnant, I helped with a lot from putting furniture together to planning gender reveals and showers, etc. and I was more than happy to do so. After she gave birth, I continued to help but also stepped back a bit to give her space to learn and grow as a new mom. I didn’t want to stress her more. I still supported her and reached out weekly to check on her, sent gift baskets, helped with pets, but didn’t want to overwhelm her. As the baby has gotten older I have tried to get our friendship back to where it was, talking and seeing each other more frequently, etc. I ask her to spend time together, even include the baby in our plans, but we still don’t seem to see each other often. I tried making weekly coffee plans, suggesting going out to dinner, hanging out at the house with the baby, etc.   Back about a year ago, my fiancés brother and SIL planned a small gender reveal with family and it was sort of a big deal as this is the first baby in the family. My friend asked that I watch her baby that same night so her and her husband could go on a date night (I always put the offer out to watch the baby). Well I explained to her I had a gender reveal and she sort asked that I watch the baby after and I explained I would have to leave early from the gender reveal to do that and she didn’t seem to care. I wound up standing my ground and telling her it wouldn’t work and that I could do another night.   Then I was asked to watch her pets while she went on a trip. Which I have done before and isn’t an issue but this was going to be not even a week after my wedding which means I wouldn’t be able to take a honeymoon at that time if I said yes and she’s very aware it was a week after my wedding.   Fast forward, this trip was a few weeks ago and I did watch the dogs bc my wedding got cancelled and her sitter bailed. All this time I was under the impression it was a family trip with her, her husband and the baby. It wasn’t. She went with two of her other friends and their partners. I had no idea.   She has gone out with friends, other mothers from her babies daycare, etc. But I haven’t seen her since the first weekend of November for my bachelorette. Before that I can’t remember when I saw her last.  Also, I am the babies god mother and she doesn’t involve in the babies life almost at all. I’ve found out the baby had taken her first steps through Facebook. I only see pictures of the baby through Facebook, etc. Should I just be done with this friendship? Should I have another talk with her?  I have tried to bring this up and she has said it’s hard to adjust as a new mom and I’ve told her that I completely understand that and i don’t feel any differently about her or our friendship since she’s had a baby. But at this point it feels like I don’t fit in her life anymore. After I found out the trip was not just a family trip I’ve become a bit distant.

(far but I just know I want him to be my husband and would like to be married before 30, I’d be 28 by the time I’d WANT the wedding.)  Today I told him this, that id like to be engaged before 2024 hit. He replied “no, that is too quick”. I just changed the subject because I didn’t want to argue about something like this and his statement made me feel stupid as fuck for even mentioning it to him. He knows I have slight abandonment issues, and saying something like that would mess with my head and thinking he doesn’t want to. I think I could be over reacting, which is why I didn’t want to argue. However, I am upset that he thinks 3 years deep is too soon (Because I truly disagree) and upset that his only response was no and shut the whole idea down instead of telling me what he’d like. I feel he will switch up and say he wants to after I tell him I’m upset and I don’t want a shotgun wedding bc I “forced” him to propose. WIBTA if I told him how I felt and said I’d never bring it up to him again, the ball is in his court?	1642791438.0	s9i0p0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9i0p0/wibta_for_being_upset_at_my_bf_said_getting/	WIBTA for being upset at my bf said getting engaged after 3 years together was ‘too quick’?
m39acu3	Me (23f) and my gf (20) are both law students. I have an internship at a law firm that she helped me get. Today I applied for a job there and got it! I still had a little bit of work to do and to make a good impression I wanted to finish it by the end of the night. I came home and hugged my gf and we cuddled for a little bit. Then I went to take a shower and started working (I had about 1.5 hours of work left to do). I also wanted to get the work off my chest so I would not have to worry about it on the weekend. I finished working around 8.40 pm and noticed that my gf is upset and had been crying. She’s upset with me because I didnt give her enough attention today. I told her that I did cuddle with her and wanted to get work done so i could spend the rest of the evening and the weekend with her. She said “yeah we cuddled for like 2 minutes, then you went to take a shower and just started working”. She has work to do as well and is currently studying. So now she is angry with me and ignoring me and Im not sure if Im the asshole here. I could have cuddled her more or left the work for later. I also called her an hour before coming home to let her know I got a job and we talked for around 20 mins then as well.

ivndxqzy	Many years ago, several guys from my high school got expelled as a result of something they did to me. The general gist is that they printed out explicit photographs that they took of me (no such thing as social media back then) and plastered them all over the school. I got bullied so badly as a result of all of this that I had to legally change my name and we moved to a different state. This was almost 20 years ago so I’ve moved on, but it was a pretty traumatic experience. I have only one childhood friend who I have maintained contact with. She is now getting married and one of the groomsmen is good friends with one of the guys who was expelled. I told her I don’t want to go to the wedding bc I don’t want to see anyone even remotely related to those guys. My friend assured me that none of those guys will be there and that no one would ever say anything to me about what happened. She is pretty upset that I don’t want to go bc she doesn’t have sisters and I’m her only close female friend. The bridal party was supposed to be me and her two future SILs.

ivnyr2as	My coworker/friend moved to the US in Dec 2019, as you can imagine her 2020/2021 sucked, she was looking forward to experiencing American holidays. She did join me & my family for Xmas, I had to warn her about my weird cousin, "Tom."   Tom is in his late 30s, lives at home w/ his mom, always getting fired from jobs, spends most of his days playing video games, going on reddit subs like conspiracy, red pill, mg tow, stupid shit like that. He's also trying to find a woman around 18-20 yr old, b/c he doesn't want a damaged kid, as he believes women who give birth in their 30s are more likely to have "r*tarded" children - I had my daughter in my mid 30s (she's fine)and he talks about this subject a lot. He also spends a lot of time on 4chan/8chan & parler (or whatever took its place, not sure if it still exists, but he did use it at some point). He brings up a lot of reddit things in real life, calls people NPCs, etc. It's really fucking cringey, no one knows what the fuck he is talking about most of the time, outside of myself b/c I'm on reddit a lot too, but I don't bring it up with well adjusted people.    During the party, I start to talk about a certain scientific topic as it deals with my job. Tom starts to talk over me, and making dumb person sounds, like "hurrr durrr." And tries to argue with me about my subject of expertise. He was inferring that me and my friend were idiots regarding the research we were discussing. It was exhausting, so I just dropped the topic.    I had what I thought was a private convo with my friend about his behavior . I ripped into him calling him a pathetic loser, who has nothing going on in his life, that he's a border line p*do looking for 18 year old girls, an idiot, etc. Tom heard a lot of this and complained to his mom and other family members about me. I was told to not let Tom get to me, he can't help the way he is, and I should apologize.	1642792298.0	s9icla	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9icla/aita_for_talking_shit_about_my_neckbeard_cousin/	AITA for talking shit about my neckbeard cousin behind his back?
in813hxf	Throwaway account because I (25,F) dont want my cousins to find this. So the wedding is of a cousin on my dad's side.Me,my mom & my brother aren't really close with them because of things that happened in our past but my dad still is. Hes fiercely loyal to them. We are a brown family so i guess that adds context. The wedding is of my aunt's daughter. They are wealthy but rustic.. idk how else to put it. the wedding is gonna be in their home & everyone is supposed to stay there?  i dont want to do that because i know they are gonna be bunking multiple people in the same room to sleep & stuff & i dont want that.    i dont really know anyone & most of their acquaintances are creepy conservative men who make me feel uncomfortable . most of them also talk in a dialect that i cant speak & i have nothing in common with them to talk about. They wear traditional clothing & leer at me whenever i have visited once or twice.  The bride is wierd & tried copying everything i did  whenever i was younger. she even tried to get into the same profession as me but couldn't make it through the exams. She's overweight & would constantly shame me for being fit/gyming  I told my dad i won't be going unless they put us up in a 4-5 star hotel for the 2 nights we'll be there. He went off on me saying i was an entitled bitch & had no respect.  i told him its the least they could do after hes financed a portion of the wedding. we got into a massive argument & now i definitely wont go.   My mum & brother (17,M) aren't going because he has exams coming up.

it82wrke	 (these are all fake names for privacy reasons)  so me(f15) and Emily(f15) has a friend Jackie(f15) and we have all been friends since we were in kindergarten, we have all been through our ups and downs in the group but we always seemed to float back to each other. Jackie has always been a bit of a narcissist and hypocritical when it comes to arguments but we try to look past it. last year we were all on a group face-time and Emily was talking about an encounter that made her uncomfortable and Jackie told her she was “being dramatic and over reacting” Emily then hangs up on the face time and calls me in our own call, crying and breaking down. We look back at all the terrible things Jackie has said to us over the years and how she is constantly a bad friend, so we cut her off, and we had what felt like the best 4 months in our friendship for a while, Jackie then one day writes me a letter and hands it to me at school, when i got home i face-timed Emily and opened the letter. In the letter it says how she wanted to apologize for how she acted, keep in mind Emily was doing online school for that semester, so I texted Jackie that i wasn’t the one she owed an apology to, and she should apologize to Emily, then Jackie then replied how she didn’t want to be friends with Emily anymore and that Emily caused too much drama. long story short Jackie and Emily eventually made up and we have been okay since then.  recently Jackie has been acting as someone we don’t want to be friends with, Jackie constantly feels the need to be correct in an argument and when she feels cornered she will just yell out “just forget it your right your right”, she also constantly yells at her mother and cusses her out saying “she’s being a bitch and doesn’t know shit” cage aswell constantly sneaks out of her house and brags about how she smokes and drinks constantly with other kids, she even bragged once about how her friends smashed a beer bottle over a drug dealers head and stole 600 dollars worth of weed, and she brags about how she steals her moms car and illegally drives around without a license and under the influence. and her reasoning for this is because her mom went through this so why shouldn’t she, yes her mom has had problems in the past but i don’t feel that gives her the right to be a bad person to everyone else.   her behavior has gotten so bad we have even suggested for her to seek help about it but she refuses saying she doesn’t have a problem.

hn138f6r	I (23f) just started working at a department store as a cashier. I’ve been hit on at work by customers before and asked for dates. Most of the time, I have a hard time saying, “No,” and give them my number because I’m doing my best to learn assertiveness. I have a friendly personality that often gets confused with flirty but I always remain professional at work. With customers, I make it a goal of mine to give each a compliment, even if they’re rude, just to attempt to make them joyful. I was ringing up this guy last night and we were having a funny conversation; when I was done, I complimented him as he was leaving. He stopped and said that he appreciated it and never heard my compliment before. I asked him if he really has not and at the same time, he asked me out to dinner. I paused for a couple of seconds and tried to play it off like I didn’t hear him by repeating my question, but he just repeated his question back to me. I was eventually hoping my body language would show him that I wasn’t interested and immediately uncomfortable by it, but it didn’t work. I wanted to tell him no, but would feel bad for rejecting him at work especially around by all my coworkers who were in ear shot. After a long 15 seconds, I said sure and he asked for my number. He told me he is 33 and I immediately felt unease. He texted me that night and wanted to talk on the phone after I got off work. On the phone with him, we set the date for today at 3:00pm his treat. I asked him what made him want my number. He started laughing and told me how he like my personality and obviously my body, my curves, and admitted that he was checking me out and liked what he saw. I’ve been told me before and know well enough to assume that if I went out with him, he would try to hook up after.  Also, he would laugh at everything I said and every question I asked him. That gave me some sense that he would never take me seriously. I asked him three questions: the first being, why did you want my number, what are your intentions, and what are you expecting from the date. I just wanted him to just get it out and say what he wanted, given how he kept saying how much he liked my body. He just kept laughing and said that I ask too many questions and that I sound nervous and to relax. I told him, “No, I’m just being direct.” I got tired of him laughing at me so I said that I was almost home and I was going to hang up. I was having second thoughts about the whole time and debated on what to do. I texted my best friend and asked for her advice. She said that he was a walking red flag, that I should block him on everything, and to not show up for the date. I told her that I would feel bad because I have never done that before. She reassured me that his behavior was creepy and to be confident on blocking him. So I did and deleted his number. I’m nervous because he knows where I work and could confront me at anytime tonight so if I see him, I’ll try to avoid him or get a manager to help.

So they’ve said to keep it a secret.   I’ve already been told by an uncle, to stop giving my parents health updates. I had a brother sick last year &  I was told that he’s more important.

hxwm4	My husband and I have been married 3 years, together for 6 years. We have two children, both under 4 so sometimes our lives are tense. My love language is affirmations and physical touch (hugs, hand holding, snuggling) and my husband is a very emotionally distant person. Sometimes when I ask for a hug or a kiss he'll just ask me "Why?" or tell me "Oh so I'm supposed to drop everything I'm doing to give you a hug when you want one?"  I have brought it up numerous times that it feels like, if I don't say "I love you" first or ask for hugs that I would never get one or hear him say he loves me. He constantly apologizes and says he'll work on things, but 6 years later and he's still doing it.   Well last night after the kids went to bed he was being particularly lovey and snuggly, immediately I thought something was wrong because he rarely acts like that. So I asked him what was wrong, thinking that maybe he just had a hard day at work or needed to talk about something. Apparently that was the wrong move because he withdrew from me and now after going to bed and waking up is just sort of ignoring me.   I asked him what was bothering him and he said "You were very mean to me last night and  hurt my feelings." I pointed out to him that it was just odd since most of the time it feels like I have to force him to be lovey dovey. So now I'm sitting here thinking that it's all my fault and I ruined something. I feel like I'm going crazy. I'll be the first to say that I maybe could have handled it better, but it was just very uncharacteristic behavior for him.   TLDR: My husband is not a lovey dovey person. Last night he was very lovey and my first thought was that something was wrong and he needed to talk about something.   I'm now the bad guy because I was "mean" to ask him what was up.	1642793077.0	s9inc7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9inc7/aita_for_asking_my_30f_husband_32m_what_was_wrong/	AITA for asking my (30F) husband (32M) what was wrong when he was trying to be lovey?
ivmokks2	I have this older cousin call her Linda (on my mom's side). Linda and I were on the phone, she was wishing my son happy birthday. Afterwards we were chatting and she brought up that a close friend of hers had a baby with a chromosomal disorder.   I believe it was Trisomy 18 (not sure) but they had all this testing done but despite that the baby slipped past all the testing. I wanted to get some more context so I asked "if you don't mind sharing how old was the mom when she gave birth."     And Linda kind of snapped on me, saying are you implying that it was the mother's fault that the baby has this illness. I was like no, I was just curious because it is correlated with age. And I don't know what happened but she just got nasty with me quickly. She started saying women aren't responsible and they aren't just birthing apparatuses . Like I was just curious what happened. As a father this is interesting and scary for me and just getting as much context as possible.     I talked to my wife about it she thinks that I should have been mindful, because Linda is still single and 42 and wants to have a family of her own. And that me bringing up the mom's age made her feel insecure. That if she does have a family she would be responsible if the baby had any disorders. I get that, and if I knew that going in, I wouldn't have brought it up. But I feel that Linda's response was out of line.	1642793274.0	s9ipvj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ipvj/aita_for_asking_the_mothers_age_when_my_cousin/	AITA for asking the mother's age when my cousin told me her best friend had a baby born with a chromosomal disorder?
ivo7r82d	33F and I have 3 daughters, aged 13, 11 and 8. I have been seeing my BF "Chris" for on the ups of a year and a half and he has a daughter "Hannah" aged 16. This whole fucking thing is baffling to me so I dont blame you if you find this story hard to believe. I have a hard time believing what's actually going on.   So Hannah is what an odd child. I say that with no disrespect. However, she takes shit to an extreme. Animal lover to the extreme, vegan to the extreme, etc. To a point of literally beating you with her words constantly about how trash you are if you even consider eating meat and theres like no stopping her either. We have tried getting a hold of it, so has her mother. Nothing works.   Now I didnt fucking realize that this "animals are pure and cant be hurt" attitude also included bugs; lice. We have Hannah every other weekend and had no idea she even had head lice up until recently when my oldest daughter started itching like crazy. They share a bedroom and apparently brushed as well because they do eachothers hair. So I go through my kids head and she has lice. I figured it was from school until Hannah walked in on our conversation and very blatantly said "Oh I've had them for like so long. Arent they cute?" Excuse me?? This is when she admitted that she already knew my kid would get it because she uses her brush but not to worry because they dont do any harm, just itchiness. Hannah works PT as a waitress for a local restaurant so I demanded she fork over the funds for lice shampoo since she knowingly gave it to my child and her dad agreed and also told her to go through her head as well if she wants to come back to our home. Hannah immediately flips out and says she refuses to "kill an innocent creature" or "pay to have them killed" simply because we are "heartless and have no respect for living creatures".   She is currently not allowed back at our house. Her dads decision, not mine, as it was not my decision to make. We have been getting calls and texts from multiple different family members (except her mother- who is also at her wits end) stating we are AHs for turning our back on a child simply because they have head lice and state we should be more accommodating (as in buying caps to wear when the kid is here). AITA?

9vm2lnke	I (27M) live with my gf (29F) in a small place. I was able to save up enough after college and from living with my parents for a few years to buy a place nearby both of our jobs. She currently has a ton of student loans from getting her Masters but is making 50k + bonus more then me. We both make good money but it's a significant difference by the end of the year.  The issue comes with asking to split the living expenses. I want to have a fair 50/50 split with living expenses (food, utilities, dog care, et). I feel like the mortgage is part of our living expense but want to exclude her loans from this split. She wants to include her loan payments as she sees it as a monthly expense to us. The mortgage ends up being about half the amount of renting anything comparable in the area. She thinks I am doing this to get money out of her to pay for my house while I view it as if we were renting from someone in the area. It seems to be an impasse as neither of us will budge from our positions.  Of course this situation would be different if we were married but we are not, so I feel like I want nothing to do with her loans. So AITA for not budging on this?	1642794198.0	s9j2ej	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9j2ej/aita_to_ask_to_split_living_expenses_but_exclude/	AITA to ask to split living expenses but exclude her student loans

Recently I have purchased an apartment. It's a one-bedroom apartment, quite small but it does have a separate room. My sister and I live in the same city, I work, she studies. She currently lives in a dorm.  She would like to move in with me in my apartment but I don't want to live with her. I just like my alone time, I like to be able to bring a girl back if I want, I don't like the fact I'm feeling like an older brother all the time when I'm with her, I almost regress to my childhood in a way.

it37kl63	Throwaway account, don’t repost anywhere else   I (M22), am currently dating “Z” (F20). We’ve been dating for about a year and half. Before I met Z, I was talking to a girl named “S” (F21). S and I had mutual feelings for each other, but when I told my friends from high school about S, they told me to avoid her, and that she’s crazy. I took what they said into consideration, but still continued to talk to S as I wanted to give her a chance.  Things between me and S were great, but during this time, I wasn’t sure if I wanted a relationship, and started distancing myself from S. I decided that I wanted to go back to Tinder to see other options, but I didn’t tell S as I didn’t want to hurt her feelings. One day, S asked me if I wanted to hangout and I told her I’d let her know. Truthfully, I was actually going to go see Z, but I didn’t tell S, and I didn’t get back to her that I couldn’t hang out. The next day, S was really upset that I “ghosted” her, and every time she asked me to hang out afterwards, I told her I’d let her know. In actuality, I was already really into Z, and wanted to be with her. S seemed to catch on that I wasn’t into her anymore and she stopped talking to me.   I’m wondering now if Im the AH for not being been straight forward with S, and that maybe I shouldn’t even have talked to her in the first place given the reaction she had when I “ghosted” her.	1642794522.0	s9j6g7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9j6g7/aita_for_going_back_to_tinder_when_i_was_already/	AITA for going back to Tinder when I was already talking to someone?
4vyi1whh	To give a bit of context, I work at an office job (kinda).  For the last two years, my work meetings have been moved from being physical to digital (same as many of you I guess). The way they usually happen is that one coworker presents his recent work, then we give him feedback and suggestions on how to proceed next. There are 2 coworkers presenting per meeting, and about 10 people attending (9 coworkers and one supervisor). We are not required to turn on our cameras, but most of us usually do.  Three months ago, coworker A was presenting his work and everything went fine. Then it was coworker B's turn to do the same, so A stopped sharing his screen so that B could share his. B starts to present, then after about 5-10 min there is a sudden stop and no one is talking for a good 10-15 seconds. What we had noticed is that coworker A seemed to have forgotten that his camera was still on, and he was happily digging his nose for boogers and eating them. One of us tried to speak to him at that moment to make him realize he was visible, but it seemed like he had muted the meeting because he wasn't hearing us at all and didn't react. So coworker B kept going with his presentation, and we all tried to ignore what was happening at the same time.  After the meeting ended, I felt bad for A so I sent him a quick text message saying "Hey! You probably didn't notice, but you left your camera on during the whole meeting.". I was hoping that he would then make sure next time to double check that it's off before doing anything else. I didn't get any answer back so I let it go and kinda forgot about the whole thing.  But since then, A has been absent from every single meeting we had (we have one meeting every other week), and now he's moved to another position at work (which was already planned, so that's unrelated) so he's not part of our meetings anymore. Some of my coworkers said that I was a bit of an AH to mention it directly to him and cause him some embarassment, instead of letting it slide and everyone not mentioning it.  So, AITA?	1642794741.0	s9j9ix	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9j9ix/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_his_camera_wasnt_off/	AITA for telling my coworker his camera wasn't off?
5606g4ln	My ex and I have been in this toxic back-and-forth and she recently invited me over. She said she needed a massage, and followed the message up with “no funny business.” It was like 7:00 PM and I live an hour away. I responded that I’d be down and drove to her house to chill. We were fairly intimate when I got there, hugging, cuddling, and her sitting on my lap. But when I went to kiss her she stated that she didn’t want to, because she wanted to be friends. I stayed for a bit longer, and then left. I was noticeably disappointed, and she kept asking me what was wrong. I told her I was upset by the whole situation, because I’d interpreted her initial text as a booty call, and then I got there and she didn’t even want to kiss. She told me that she found my behavior unsettling/creepy and thought that I was using her for sex, to which I responded with an apology but explained how I was confused given our relationship and the context.

ivoqqgij	I (24m) have been on dates with this girl Linda (22f) and I thought she was the nicest girl I've ever met. Beautiful, slender, down-to-earth, and funny. I thought she was cool until our fourth date, where we went to a nearby Friday's.   We were talking about me finally visiting her place. She offhandedly said, "I'm sure my brother would love you." I asked what she meant by that, and she clarified that her brother is her roommate. I asked why her brother is her roommate, she asked why it mattered. To be honest, it's extremely weird that she is roomies with her own brother. That's very uncommon and creepy.   I kept pestering why she lives with her bro, she kept saying it was easier because she trusts him with her life, which sounded oddly romantic (I have no siblings if that matters). She seemed very annoyed, but we continued the date. After I left, I blocked her on Tinder.   Here's the reasons: - There is no reason why you should live with your brother at 22. Typically siblings grow apart once they reach adulthood. It sounds very weird.  - She described him in oddly intimate ways, saying how her brother is her best friend, how she trusts him with her life, etc. It's creepy.  - I don't know if I want to date a girl who's THIS close to a sibling. It feels like I'm gonna be constantly watched. It's uncomfortable.

ivmceh86	Players:  A3-Aunt 3rd birth placement  A9- Aunt 9th birth placement  N-Niece  SW-Social Worker  Short backstory  I (57F) have been NC with my mom (78F) for over 30+ years. Due to years of abuse. All correspondence has been through my daughter (42F)   Before we start everyone lives in the southern part of the State with the exception of myself I reside on the West Coast of the State  Now for the issue in July 2021, I received a call from my daughter informing me that my mom was in the process of being evicted from her govt apt due to the state of the apt.  I had contacted A9 (63F) for help with finding a nursing home because she put my grandmother in one, and I wanted the info. A9 decided to conference A3 (77F) into the conversation.  Then there were several conference calls with A9 & A3 trying to bully my daughter into taking mm knowing she doesn't have the room. Keep in A3 & A9 haven't spoken to or checked on their sister in over several years and didn't include her in the sibling's list at my grandmother's funeral.  Now all of sudden we care and want to dictate. I got tired of the dictation through group text and conference calls so I told them if they weren't going to be part of the solution stop being part of the problem.  Then I got blocked which was fine by me I hadn't heard from them since I attended my uncle's funeral in 2017.  I ended up having to call the police to do an emergency check and my mom was found laying on the floor from having a stroke and her blood sugar was in the 400s, she was rushed to the hospital where she stayed for a month from there she went to the nursing home where she is currently staying.   Fast forward to Tuesday, Jan 18, 2022, I get a phone call from her SW asking me if I knew my mom was moving in with her niece (40ishF)? Which I had no clue of neither did my daughter. I asked where she got the info and she said that my mom was going around telling the nurses. But due to mental issues, we have to take everything she says with a grain of salt. The SW contacted the niece to confirm the story found out the story is true.   So am I the ah if  I tell my cousin that if she takes her from the facility and something happens to her not to contact me?  Why I might be the AH as my mom's only child if something happens I'm the one that would be called and responsible, but since they didn't consult me or ask my advice I feel they are taking on the responsibility.   No, one has poa or guardianship.  No,  she hasn't been diagnosed with being mentally incapable because she can pass their evaluations, but can't hold a logical conversation in her State she has rights.

fnv7iwog	I bought a new car using my own money and it was delivered today at my family's house. My previous car was really starting to wear down and I felt like getting an upgrade. My Dad really liked it, my sister didn't care that much about it, but my mom I could tell based on her resting bitch face, was pissed. She didn't say anything directly to me but I overheard her and my Dad talking about it. My Dad asked what she thought of it and she replied "Immaturity but whatever". I asked her what she said, it escalated from there and she started whining about me not having a job when I literally spent entire days looking for applications and also economy. I told her to fuck off and stop being a bullying bitch. She replied saying why don't I spend the weekend in the car and at that point I just had enough, got some things upstairs and stormed out.  I bought the car with my own money, my own choice and she fucking shit talks me behind my back with that passive aggressive nature, I had enough.	1642796198.0	s9jtkh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9jtkh/aita_for_buying_a_new_car/	AITA for buying a new car
eodl8hcx	I'll keep this as short as possible. I was in a discord voice call with 3 friends. Friend A, Friend B, Friend C. Friend A suggests that we should play cs go, while everyone else wasn't really in the mood. Friend C was playing other game at the moment and he told us he couldn't leave because if he were to leave, he would get his account banned. Me and Friend B were just there, doing nothing (FYI we played cs go for a long time and I am not the best player out there, like really not the best player out there cuz I suck at csgo and also my laptop barely runs the game at 20 - 30 fps). Me, knowing Friend   B can get REALLY toxic and not fun to talk to while playing csgo, kept denying. Friend A kept insisting and finally we all agreed on playing. Before entering the game, I took a look on steam, through my friend's profiles. I saw a game named "Spacewar" and didn't know what that was. I clicked on it and it just sent me to the home page. Now, for a bit of context before what I'm about to tell you, a few weeks ago, Friends A, B and C started playing Phasmophobia and GTFO. I knew a few things about Phasmophobia but nothing about GTFO. I asked them what that was and they told me. Now, about  Spacewar, I was curious and asked "Hey, umm, what's Spacewar?". They started going crazy and kept saying "JESUS CHRIST DUDE WE TOLD YOU LIKE A MILLION TIMES" and when I told them that they were referring to GTFO they said "JESUS CHRIST YOU TARD". "OK, maybe you told me sometime and I forgot. Mind telling me again?". They started joking and kept ignoring me as I was asking them and after 5 minutes I decided to leave the voice call cuz they were annoying as hell. ALSO, some months ago, I kept asking the same question 3-4 times, another question unrelated, and not even daily nor weekly, perhaps every 2 weeks. It was a small thing that I always forgot about. Friend B, the owner of the Discord server we chat on, gave me admin roles in order to view some channels and mute people when necessary. He made a new rule saying "if X asks a question that was also asked and answered in the past, I'll strip him of his roles". Guess what happened after asking what Spacewar is. So, reddit, I'll leave it up to you, AITA?	1642796981.0	s9k3yi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k3yi/aita_for_asking_for_a_thing_i_didnt_know_about/	AITA for asking for a thing I didn't know about
bm4k8c0t	I (23m) love and adore my parents and I appreciate them very much. I still live with them as do my older siblings which is very common in our culture. My mum (52f) is very family-oriented and is about one of the kindest and most caring people you can come across. Between the two, my mum has always been the more involved parent although sometimes she becomes too involved and in my opinion has trouble understanding boundaries and respecting space.  I have benefitted in many ways (e.g. financials for just one example) by still living with my parents. At times, I do feel bad but they tell us they would like for us to live with them for as long as possible/we want. While it has a lot of perks, when you're still living with your parents you (quite understandably) sometimes perceive as if your every move is seen, micro-analysed, and feel a lack of space/privacy. I feel as if I am at a stage where I am needing to develop an identity of my own, along with the identity I have within the family. I just feel like I need space for myself, to be not so see-through (like consistently under a lens) and just have a few things to myself.  Lately, I have been going out of the house (hanging out/catching up with friends etc.) without divulging much. I am not averse to letting my parents know when I am about to head out and what time I expect to be home. This much is common courtesy. However my mum also typically likes to know more specific (and what I feel like are intrusive) details such as with whom, where I am going, what I am going to do. This may seem trivial, but it makes me feel somewhat overly watched-over and micro analysed that sometimes I can't fully enjoy my time out. I approached my mum about my need for some boundaries and I guess, if I were to put it into words, overall I want to have a little bit of mystery about my life from them. When I tried to discuss this with her, she became upset at what I was communicating and I think also a little bit upset with me on a personal level. I do feel bad about how that whole conversation went, although ultimately I think what I am asking for was reasonable.  To add context, I don't believe I have given my parents any major concerns to worry about. I have always been a good kid and would like to think that I grew up to be a responsible young adult. I have never worried my parents with any vices - smoking, drugs, delinquent/anti-social behaviours, associating with the wrong crowd etc. By no means do I claim to be a perfect son but you get the (rough) picture. I work and am just about to graduate from university with very good grades (1st class Honours). Anyway, is there something wrong with me? Am I being overly sensitive?

4mh7a9jh	So me and my friends were in McDonalds yesterday for dinner, it was cool but there was this one kid, looked around 5 or 6 who just constantly kept running around the place being noisy, shouting laughing etc. Eventually it got to the point where it was ruining my time so I snapped on the kid and ran up to him and began just screaming in his face. He began crying and ran to his mom who just kept shouting at me it was embarrassing I went red. Anyway my friends went home after this without saying anything to me. I regret this only because it was embarrassing for me but I think that kid was a stupid spoiled brat who got what he deserved. Of course his mom is an idiot and when I think about it I'm actually angry I just stood there embarrassed and didn't give her a piece of my mind too.	1642797172.0	s9k6u0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k6u0/aita_for_shouting_at_a_loud_kid/	AITA For shouting at a loud kid?
66za88tq	I'm visiting my partner and decided to order lunch for us.  My order came to $65; the recommended tip was 10%, or $6.50.  Knowing that Doordash is a crappy company to work for and that gig work is a crappy job to have, I never go with the recommended tip; I usually go for something between 15% and 20%.  Today in particular I doubled it from $6.50 to $13, or 20%.    A block away from making the delivery, the driver texted me:  >if possible, could you help me a little more with your tip, today   Not gonna lie - I'm kind of offended by this.  I feel like I've been more than reasonable to make up for Doordash being crap in light of my decision to order from a known crappy service provider.    I kind of wanted to modify the tip downward by like a lot, along with a note saying "Driver tried to shake me down for more money a block away from delivery," but I'm absolutely certain that'd result in the driver getting fired, and I don't want that.  I think if I were to contact DD in any way about this, that'd be the outcome, and lowering the tip would absolutely definitely 100% for sure make me the asshole.   I have a sneaking suspicion, which may be uncharitable and/or unfair, that that text would never have been sent if my order were attached to a masculine name instead of a feminine one.   (For the record, if anyone's curious, the delivery route was about two miles down a single major arterial followed by three blocks of side streets to get to the house.)  What I finally did was nothing.  No response, no modifying the tip, nothing.  So, reddit, judge me: AITA?	1642797224.0	s9k7ir	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k7ir/aita_for_a_20_tip_to_a_doordash_driver/	AITA for a 20% tip to a Doordash driver?

7y6nrpzq	I (18f) am currently living in an all girls dorm on my campus. During the day my neighbors are constantly blasting music and yelling. I’ve talked to them multiple times about turning the music down and being a bit more quiet while I study. They turn the music down for a bit then turn it back on. I can kinda understand playing music and having fun during the day. If it gets too loud and distracting then I go to a different spot on campus. At night they turn the music off but are constantly yelling and being loud. I’m not sure what they are doing but it gets annoying because I have no where to go during the night because all places on campus are closed. I’ve knocked on their doors multiple times at night and told them to be quiet but they do the same thing. Quiet down for a bit then go back to what they were doing. It’s a bad situation for me because I usually do my studies during the night because my day is filled with work and classes.

748q77pe	I(f14) and my sister(f16) were raised by my mother and our older siblings for as long as we could remember since our dad was a deadbeat and her husband was in africa. My mom would always talk abt when her husband would finally come to america, he would help us out with everything and take out the trash and do “manly” duties. (Btw both my mom and her husband still believe in gender roles.) About 2 years ago at the start of covid he finally came and absolutely nothing changed, if anything it was just another person to clean after, he would leave his dishes in the sink, would let her take out the trash at 11 pm at night while sitting on the couch watching tv knowing we live in an extremely dangerous neighborhood since he had a gun pulled on him when he got back from work, and he would never help clean the house or cook the food that he eats the most of. Every time me and my sister try to bring it to her and his  attention she immediately gets defensive and starts yelling at us and telling us we’re disrespecting the “man of the house” (mind u my moms the money maker). He’s also obviously very sexist and misogynistic with some of the things i’ve heard him say like “back in africa, when ur wife got out of line, u could just smack her and put her in her place, but here it’s a problem” and would constantly tell me that i need to know how to cook for my future husband. He constantly says he’s goings to changed but hasn’t. Also, I am so happy that my mom is finally happy with her husband in America but his behavior is becoming so intolerable.

ivq2kvga	Hi all recto-specialists -   I (31 M) purchased a home (4Bed) last year on my own - which I currently live in with roommates. I met my girlfriend (31 F) a couple of months after I made that purchase and we've been together for \~8 months. Her Lease for her current apartment runs out in a couple of months and we've been talking about moving in for a while - we've done a multi-week move in and things generally seem fine.   Since we are getting close to moving in, I brought up that she should sign a month-to-month lease detailing her portion of the expenses 1200$/mo for rent + 1/3rd of utility costs. I would also not be renewing the lease with the existing roommates so it'll just be her and me living at the house. For reference - the mortgage is 3600$/month and the utilities add up to around 350$/mo and the current two roommates pay a combined 2225$/month of rent - which would be going away. This difference in her share vs my share is to offset for the fact that I make more money than her (\~100k vs \~250k in 2021).    While she originally seemed open to the idea of signing a lease - she has decided that this lease will be a deal breaker. To her it feels too business like and reflects a lack of trust.   From my perspective - there should be a lease agreement signed for all rent payment transactions so that both parties are protected.   Thoughts? Am i off base here thinking a rental agreement is important to have?	1642799138.0	s9kxqc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9kxqc/aita_for_asking_my_gf_to_sign_a_lease_with_me_as/	AITA for asking my gf to sign a lease with me as the landlord?
ivqhogwc	I tend to ramble a lot but I'll keep this as concise as possible. Throaway since I don't know if anyone in my family uses reddit and im not willing to find out thru this post.  So I (20NB) and my parents (66M, 57F) have been invited to a cousin's girlfriend's house to spend the weekend for a roadtrip.  This house is more like a vacation house for her family and as far as I know, and all our extended family from my dad's side has been invited (15 people for now).  The reason of my discomfort is that... I've only met this girl once and the feeling of being and staying in the house of what's essentially a stranger makes me very uncomfortable — also the sheer amount of people that will be there, which sure, is all family, is very stressful to think about. Especially knowing that the girl will be hosting alone. (I am unsure of her age but my cousin (20M) said she attended the same school as I and was 2 years below me, so about 18-19?)  I'll also be starting classes on the 24th, and going on a trip so close to entering college feels very tiresome.  When I explained this to my mom, she told me I was overreacting and that if I was so uncomfortable staying over, then I wouldn't be able to travel anywhere alone- which, sure, she has a bit of a point there.  I can't ask my parents if I could stay behind because they're.... overprotective. And hate the idea of me staying alone overnight despite me having taken care of all house chores for a month while mom was away.  Some extra info that may be relevant; I have social anxiety, and though I'm medicated, the quarantine and death of my ESA have made me lost a lot of progress when it comes to my recovery. I was also bullied until the end of middle school- and any mention of anything related to my former school (which taught elementary, middle, and high school alltogether) still makes me extremely anxious.  My whole family and I are latino living in latin america.  Here's where I might be the asshole: Ever since the pandemic started, We haven't been able to see my dad's side of the family (especially my grandma) and I have greatly noticed how much my dad misses his siblings and mom. I have to admit I've always been closer to my mom's side, especially as a teen; so me wanting to reject this trip might feel even worse for him- as if I was rejecting that side of my family.	1642799639.0	s9l4lm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9l4lm/aita_for_being_weirded_out_about_staying_over_at/	AITA for being weirded out about staying over at a stranger's house?
ivmokks2	I have this older cousin call her Linda (on my mom's side). Linda and I were on the phone, she was wishing my son happy birthday. Afterwards we were chatting and she brought up that a close friend of hers had a baby with a chromosomal disorder.  I believe it was Trisomy 18 (not sure) but they had all this testing done but despite that the baby slipped past all the testing. I wanted to get some more context so I asked "if you don't mind sharing how old was the mom when she gave birth."  And Linda kind of snapped on me, saying are you implying that it was the mother's fault that the baby has this illness. I was like no, I was just curious because it is correlated with age. And I don't know what happened but she just got nasty with me quickly. She started saying women aren't responsible and they aren't just birthing apparatuses . Like I was just curious what happened. As a father this is interesting and scary for me and just getting as much context as possible.  I talked to my wife about it she thinks that I should have been mindful, because Linda is still single and 42 and wants to have a family of her own. And that me bringing up the mom's age made her feel insecure. That if she does have a family she would be responsible if the baby had any disorders. I get that, and if I knew that going in, I wouldn't have brought it up. But I feel that Linda's response was out of line.	1642799736.0	s9l5x1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9l5x1/aita_for_asking_the_mothers_age_when_my_cousin/	AITA for asking the mother's age when my cousin told me her best friend had a baby born with a chromosomal disorder?
ivq56uxu	I have to preface by saying I've always hated doing dishes (handwash) and I'll do anything *but* that. Growing up I was the dishwasher even though I had siblings. They *never* had to do it and I vowed I'd never hand wash dishes as an adult unless I absolutely had to. I couldn't wait to be in a place that had a dishwasher!   When my husband and I 1st moved in together I told him my stance. He hates doing them too but said as long as I help once in a while he's ok with it. No problem. We haven't been in houses that has had dishwashers unfortunately (rentals) and I've helped out every so often because he cooks and has back issues. I do all of the other chores.  On to the problem. We recently bought a house that needed renovations in the kitchen. When we bought it, it had a dishwasher (excitement!) My FIL got the kitchen reno'd as a present for us but when he did, he had the space for the dishwasher covered by cabinets and drawers. He either sold or just ditched the dishwasher. I was upset about this and, again, told my husband my stance. He kind of shrugged it off.   We now have a 5 month old son and I've been extra busy with him so a *lot* of the household chores have been lacking. My husband still cooks but we had a huge argument about me not helping with "anything"anymore, mainly dishes. He's very upset that I "don't touch them" even though I know he's really in pain. He says the amount of times I've done dishes has equated to nothing. However, we all have clean clothes (just not put away) and the house is presentable if company comes over (not very tidy like it used to be). The kitchen on the other hand is a warzone. He says it's my fault because he can't keep up and I need to help and I'm being an AH about it.  I admit the times I've tried to do more than a few dishes I'm interrupted by the baby so nothing really gets done but deep down I really don't want to do them anyway. I vented to my mom and grandma about it and they sided with him saying since he cooks, I should do all the dishes. I disagree though.

cw998quo	Quick backstory, I (M29) recently bought and moved into my first flat, exciting times and what not. Everything was fine for the first 5 months of living here.  A little explanation about my block, 80% of it is owner occupied/private rental and the other 20% is council housing.   Recently a flat 2 floors down was recently moved into by a youngish couple (I know this particular flat is council tenanted) and they've begun to play incredibly loud music/bassy music late into the night/early morning, like till 1AM sometimes. I wrote it off to begin with as it was mostly Friday and Saturday nights and I'm not one to deprive people of celebrating the weekend and having fun. But recently it's spread out to most days of the week (4 to 5 out of 7).  I've tried knocking on the door to ask them to turn it down slightly, but no one answers. I've popped a note through their door (as my council advises) asking them if they wouldn't mind just turning the bass down slightly (rest of the volume is barely audible) but to no avail.   As a last resort I've reported it to the council who placed them in there who advised they will take steps to remove them from the property if they don't stop doing this. I don't really want to put them in a position of not having a home so I'm kind of conflicted.

5zomtdjw	This all happened a week ago. A guy from my class came up to me and randomly started flirting with me. I tried my best to forget it and went back to my convo with my friends. Two days later he tries asking me out. I kindly say no and for him to not take it personally. The next day he asks to go on a date with me. I kindly declined again. Here I started explaining I can not date him because I am straight and that it is because my parents are strong catholics and that they would probably kick me out of the house if they found out I'm dating a guy. He gets a bit mad but understands. The next day him and his friends approach me again. They basically asked why I didn't date him and ''Why are you so homophobic?'' I tried my very best to not get angry as they did not know about my family's traditions and all that. I explained it again and they got really mad. At this point the guy who originally asked me out slipped past the conversation entirely as the guys were trying to manipulate me into dating him. Fortunately I managed to get out of there as well because the bell ringed and the last lesson that day started. The guy's friends were looking me dead in the eyes the entire lesson and I felt very uncomfortable. The guy came up to me after the lesson ended and apologised for how his friends acted and that it won't happen again.

15q82lab	I sent my boyfriend an instagram post that basically said “ you won’t be remembered for how good your resume was or how many hours you worked, people will remember the moments where you were imperfect and remember them fondly because those are the things that can be unique to you and those are the most lovable even if you find it hard to accept them yourself”  I was trying really hard to be kind and encouraging because I think he’s working himself to a point where he’s getting extremely stressed over an upcoming thing at work. He came in the room and got really mad at me telling him that I’m taking a shot at him and not caring about the work he’s doing. I tried to explain what I meant by the post and that I was just trying to be helpful and supportive, he was still angry so I started crying uncontrollably ( I have a concussion so I’m a little more emotional that usual) I just wanted to be left alone so I told him not to touch me and go away. He got even angrier and said “ fuck, I’m trying my best” then just went back to work even though it’s his lunch break.  Am I the asshole for sending him the post? I guess it could have been perceived in a way I don’t understand.	1642800895.0	s9llk3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9llk3/aita_for_sending_him_an_inspirational_post_when_i/	AITA for sending him an inspirational post when I know he’s been really busy and stressed with work?
8lta5fej	My parents and I have decided to take in my cousin (13F), saving her from her mother that's a prostitute (no shame in being so) and was willing to sell her off as well, the girl was living in horrible circumstances. But my younger brother (16M) has always disliked her, he never felt comfortable around her, and they couldn't stand eachother from a very young age, and the situation now is no different, they ignore eachother completely, and my brother is always in a bad mood, since he came back from school and found her in our house, we haven't told him she was coming, because the situation was too urgent, my brother is so angry, refuses to eat with us, and gets even more pissed when he finds out she uses our shared products such as shampoo, conditioner etc...  I feel like my brother is in the wrong here, but I can't help but feel like we did wrong by bringing (practically) a stranger into his space and I feel responsible for his mood and grumpiness, as I was the one to urge my parents to act up without giving it enough thought. So am I the asshole for not respecting my brother's boundaries and getting mad at him when he acts up?	1642800846.0	s9lkxx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lkxx/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_brother/	AITA for getting mad at my brother?
iunfjyvb	I 18F was staying with my dad and his long time girlfriend Kathrine she was always very nice to me and I have grown to love her. One day my dad told me that she is pregnant and I was very excited. I helped her get ready for the baby and set up his room.   When he was born they named him after me and my sisters and we were all very happy. My dad and Katherine got engaged and we were a happy family for 2 years   I went on a week vacation with my friends and when I came home Katherine and the baby were gone. I later found out that she had cheated on my dad the whole time they had been dating and he kicked her out.   My dad did a paternity test and found out that the baby was not his. We were all very mad and sad. I have not talken to her in 2 years. I went to go surprise my dad from collage when I got home I saw her making food in the kitchen and the kid on the couch turns out they have been dating and living together for 4 months.   I told my dad I will not be coming over if she is there and I don’t want to go anywhere near her. My dad said I am being dramatic and that she wants to see me again. I refused and went back to my dorm. I told  my sisters and they said it’s up to me and that I did nothing wrong but my dad says I’m being an  asshole and I should apologize for leaving and refusing to see her   Am I the asshole?	1642800981.0	s9lmps	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lmps/aita_exposing_my_stepmom_on_facebook/	AITA exposing my step-mom on Facebook
3mo4382i	I (14F) am an artist who often creates and designs characters. Usually I just create them to draw but some of them have their own stories.  My friend (14 non-binary) also draws characters, which are these kind of brightly colored demons. Inspired, I started creating some of my own, usually with pastel colors rather than neons. They didn’t really mind it which was nice of them.  Another character idea later popped up in my head. It was a long-haired feminine demon with split hair colors and striped horns. While I drew her, I decided to give her x-shaped pupils. That would soon upset my friend once I showed them.  They claimed that I ‘stole their idea’ because I ‘used too many traits’ from their characters. It wasn’t one specific character that I ‘copied’. All I did was take traits I liked from their different designs and mashed them together. (I’ve heard of other character designers doing that and often use this method in my art)   I was very upset at the fact that someone would get mad at me just for some similar elements in character design.   When I told them that I didn’t copy them. They didn’t believe it and told me to change the design of MY CHARACTER that I MADE. I told them that the character I drew is mine and that I won’t change just it for someone who thinks I copied their design (which I didn’t).   I really feel like the asshole whenever I think about this. What do you think?

99nawbvi	Partner (31M) and I (32F) got awoken from his child (3) crying in the evening around 2am. She was previously up a few times in the night and I went and checked on her and she was fine and went back to sleep. She continued to cry, so he got up to check on her and she ended up puking. He lost it on me saying how dare I let his child sleep in her throw up and essentially made me feel like garbage for it. I was mid changing all of the bedding when this was occurring and I got upset at him for his comments and threw a stuffed animal at him and left the room. Today he takes no responsibility and says I’m in the wrong for taking my anger out on him physically by throwing a stuffed animal.  AITA?

amo7uv09	Alright, I kinda feel guilty but kinda not? She's 16 and I know she has been 'messing around" with a boy she's seeing (he's 24). I don't like him and I told her to stay away. We argued and she basically told me to f*ck off and not worry about "us getting pregnant". Well I know my parents don't really care about this very much and I figured I could teach her a lesson. But before I say it let me be VERY CLEAR OKAY?? I. DID. NOT. WANT. HER. TO. BE. PREGNANT. Okay? Keep that in mind before you hate on me? I just wanted to scare her. So when he stays over (which I think is disgusting because my parents just let him stay in her room and he always creeps me out) I know they're "having fun". Well I did what I thought would scare her I use a pin to prick each of the condoms her bf uses. He keeps them under the bed (I found them when looking under there for art supplies, she paints a lot). I kept quiet about it for nearly a year. Well obviously they must have broke or maybe they aren't even using one, because now she's pregnant and due next May. My parents are kinda livid and I think it's partially their fault and my sisters fault. Because she's kind of a sl*t for being with a boy older than me. I don't think he intended this though, even if he is kinda creepy. I don't think I should tell them, because even though I'm moving out soon, I want to keep an open relationship with them because I love all of them a lot. My family is very religious and have been shunning us. I've prayed to our Lord to let the baby be health because it deserves life. Her boyfriend also has not talked to her since finding out. Should I confront him?

ivqu50sh	My (25m) girlfriend (25f) and I have been dating for about a year and a half now and for the most part, everything is great. One thing that has always made me feel a little uncomfortable is that she is best friends with a guy she dated.   Backstory: They were really good friends in undergrad and then dated for a short while (2-3 months) after college but things didn't work out because he was a little too emotionally needy. This was a little under 3 years before we started dating. Since they broke up, he's tried getting back together with her on a number of occasions to no avail. In fact, he pretty much has tried this up until we started dating.   It was weird to me that they are still close friends because I think intimate relationships fundamentally change the nature of friendships, and that she doesn't seem bothered by the fact that he is still into her. To her, it doesn't matter because she can't control how he feels and she knows herself that she doesn't feel the same way. I trust her in that she wouldn't do anything wrong, and even though it makes me feel a little uncomfortable, I think it's a nuanced situation that is hard to fully sympathize with. If the friendship is important to her and makes her happy, it's definitely something that I should sacrifice a little personal comfort for.   Recently, her ex/best friend broke up with a girl he has been seeing for about 2 months now. I don't think I'm being dramatic when I say that he's been a complete mess since then. He's been calling my girlfriend multiple times a day to vent and ask for advice. They text all the time, even when we're doing things together. Anyway, I think that it's fine for her to give him some importance now since breakups suck, and at the end of the day, I'd want my SO to be a good friend for those who care about her. Also, it's a temporary thing that will (hopefully) get better with time for him.   One thing that annoyed me significantly however is that most recently he "jokingly" asked if we were in an open relationship. I got pretty upset when my girlfriend brought it up somewhat blithely. I definitely did not find it funny, and I find it a little hard to believe that there wasn't any genuinity to the question. Even if I completely trust her (which I do) not to do anything wrong, I don't think it's unreasonable to feel uncomfortable with her being this involved with helping out an ex figure out his emotional needs.

8vspqrst	AITA-I house/dog sat for a friend this week. I also do this on the Rover app but this was separate. She did not tell me she has cameras in her home. She has two dogs that I was watching; a 5 month old Samoyed puppy and an older husky. She stated in her very detailed list of directions that “the dogs could be left for 4 hours, 5 hours max and the puppy in her crate”. I left the house for 5 hours and she lost it on me, that’s when I realized she was watching me on cameras. She became very malicious and nasty towards me via text. Now she is stating she will contact Rover to report me (again, this wasn’t on Rover), she is going to contact my exam department to become a physician assistant and tell them I lied on an application, and tell all of the neighbors that I babysits/house sit/dog sit for that I neglected her dogs and left them alone “for more than 5 hours.” I’ve only been friends with her a few months and she’s very aggressive in a lot of instances. None of my friends care to be around her as she is an angry drunk. Should I get a lawyer? Am I an asshole for leaving the dogs for just over, probably 20 minutes over 5 hours? I really don’t know what to do bc #1 Rover is my source of income. #2 I could lose my chance at taking my Physician Assistant boards which means the last 10 years are a waste. #3 I love the families I care for-their kids and their dogs are so sweet and I would hate to lose them from my life.

hy2m7zm9	My partner (26M) and I (31M) had been dating for 8 months, and due to covid, living together. We were in a short term place and looking for something long term when his father decided to sell his house, in a very rural and particularly unsafe area.  We decided to hold off on a lease together — he was going to help his Dad move and get the house ready for sale. The house isn’t in good condition but it’s not utterly unlivable.  Fast forward a month when I come out to visit and the trip is awful. Everything that can go wrong does. On the last day after a silent two hour drive to the airport he drops the ultimatum on me that if I don’t move out there, we’re over.  Relocating to that region wasn’t something I was willing to do from the beginning and we agreed that I would come out and visit monthly while he was there. It’s also not a viable place for me to do my job (even though it is remote, consistent internet is a big problem there).

ca2hlbet	This requires a bit of background so I’ll try to explain this as cleanly as possible. I started dating my boyfriend soon after him and one of his ex’s broke up. We have a great relationship but at the beginning of it, she tried to text him and get back together which led to him blocking her on social media and basically doing everything but blocking her number (she is his dead best friends younger sister and he feels a loyalty to him to be there in an instance something were to happen). When we moved in together fairly early in our relationship, she told a close friend of his that she was pregnant. She was already dating someone else and enough time passed that I was confident it was not his. She posted about it on Facebook as well. We hung out with his sister who is friends with her and he asked if his ex was getting big after she brought her up. Turns out the ex had lied and was not pregnant. She had been drinking the entire time so it’s unclear if she lost the baby or was saying it as an attention ploy. My SIL was then confident that she had never been pregnant as they hang out regularly and it was never mentioned.   My boyfriend and I have decided to start trying to conceive and I am beyond stressed by this ex potentially trying to come back into our lives as I have a feeling she will reach out once she knows we are expecting. We only have Facebook as our social media’s and I only have my closest friends and family on there after being stalked (so I know how to make it as private as possible but I need it for a work log in so I cannot delete it all together). He never posts on Facebook either so the way most people will find out will be by word of mouth. I have always imagined telling our families soon after we find out and I’d love to tell my sisters. I just don’t want to tell my SIL until we’ll after we’re past the first trimester as I don’t want the added stress of the ex finding out. I know SIL would not blurt it out but they drink socially together often and I wouldn’t trust it to remain a secret.   AITA for not wanting to tell her? Would I be an asshole for wanting to share it with my sisters?	1642801356.0	s9lrz1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lrz1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_tell_my_sil_when_im/	AITA for not wanting to tell my SIL when I’m pregnant?
8hrg8lbx	Hey,   the DM made a little inbetween session for the players with reserve charakters. I got to play this reserve charakter for the first time. Combat started within minutes and I was pretty lucky with my rolls. The combat was rough, but we managed. Another enemy entered the battle and in the end we got knocked out and kidnapped. With that the session ended and the DM asked for feedback. I told him how the combat was fun, but that I was bummed about losing my reserve charakter.    DM:"I planned for you three to lose this fight. I had tried this a few times during the campain, but this time I succeeded. Also you didn't die, you just got kidnapped"   Me:"You planned for us to lose our reserve charakters?"   DM:"Just to kidnap them"   Me:"It is my reserve and I got to play it for the first time. I don't approve that I was set up to lose it right away"   DM:"kidnapped"  I let the other two players give their feedback and wrote the GM privatly, that despite having four charakters in this world, three of them were now not available, leaving me without a reserve. He did not respond. Btw one of my chars has been kidnapped for ingame months by this point.  I am pissed and want to confront him again. Telling him that setting us up to lose our reserves was a horrible idea.

15c28s	My roommate has a very consistent habit of getting take out, eating half of the food in the container, and leaving the container with half eaten food in a plastic bag on the floor next to the trash can (especially when the trash can is full.) Aside from the fact that I find the idea of food rotting on the floor next to the trash can disgusting, I also have a cat who is on a special diet because of health issues, and could be put at risk of serious illness if he finds and consumes human food. This is usually the fact that I bring up anytime I find the food out on the floor, and I’ll joke about my cat eating everything to hopefully make my roommate not upset when I bring up the food on the floor.  Lately I’ve just started going through their trash anytime they place it in a bag next to the trash can, so I can make sure there isn’t food (I don’t mind empty/clean recyclables on the floor, but we do have a box for recycling that I’d prefer they use.) If there is food in the bag, I throw it out and ask them to make sure trash goes in the trash can, and I usually get a passive aggressive response about the bag not having food inside (until I tell them it does) and then they agree not to do it again. I can tell they’re getting annoyed and don’t see why I’m seeming to make a big deal out of it, and I’m starting to feel naggy, but this habit really bothers me.

ivtf4bd2	I’m guilty and I deserve to get in trouble. I used to go on live-streaming apps and watch and persuade young girls to do sexual things on camera. I did it for years. I used to get them them to send me Snapchat videos and pictures. I don’t do any of that anymore but I’m always worried that someone will bust down my door and expose me for what I’ve done. It’s possible because on those accounts that I made I left behind a lot of potential evidence about who I am and where I live, because I wasn’t really a smart guy.   I still use live-streaming apps now but I only talk to adult women now. I don’t want to go into details but just know that it’s definitely possible for someone to connect the dots and find out who I am because I made a lot of mistakes when I was doing all those terrible things.   The chances are really low I guess that I would get caught now, but the possibility is always in the back of my head. I just want to live a normal life now.

itsvepr5	I'm renting a room at my friend’s (Ernie)house.  We met in college.  Work in the sane field.  Ernie rented another room to this girl named Amber. She’s friends with his sister.   I’m autistic and very shy around females.  I really wished he would’ve consulted me before allowing her no move in.  My mom is not happy about me living with a female that isn’t related to me.    I try to avoid her whenever possible.  Ernie has started having sex with Amber and it’s uncomfortable to be around.  I tried talking to him about it like maybe he shouldn’t be doing that when I’m home all day.   He has now been avoiding me.  I went to the kitchen to make a snack and Amber & Ernie was making out in the living room that I had to walk through.  I said get a room under my breath.  Amber gets pissed and said maybe I should get a house.  I yelled back everyone was fine until she moved in.      She yells at Ernie and said I’m a creep and a virgin.  I tried to tell Ernie that I was here first and the sex stuff is making me uncomfortable.   He said he understood but he thinks it’s time for me to move out.  He said I’m too immature for my age.  Many people have sex all if the time.    I talked to Ernie today but he insisted that I need to find new living arrangements because I’m not getting on here.  I called Amber a bitch and saying it’s all her fault for being a whore and putting me in this position.  Ernie after that said I need to be out in 90 days or he will evict me.  I was here first and it’s been my home for 2 years.  Ernie said I was in the wrong.

iuzd0ltl	My parents told my sister and they would pay for 4 years of college (meaning if we go over they wouldn’t pay for the extra years) and they would only pay for the semesters we got a 3.0 gpa or above. They also made it clear living expenses were our problems and we had to work summers for it. My sister has a degree in finance and finished in the time frame and got over 3.0 in all semesters so her education is free. My degree is in chemical engineering which is 4 years but most people end up taking an extra year because it’s so hard. Also I couldn’t get 3.0 in half my semesters so in the end of the 65k for my tuition they only covered 32k of it and I still have loans of 33k. I know they were very clean about what they wanted but I think they should have been more understanding towards me as engineering is harder than finance and I’m still having trouble finding a job in my field. I’m currently living with them and working part time but not in my field and the money barely covers my loans. Plus they said they want me out in 3 months and I feel like they are playing favourites with my sister who was always better with school.

glwxvp43	For context I (19f) had wisdom tooth surgery on the 12th this month. It wasn’t the worst pain but I didn’t feel great and my mother offered to help take care of me (I live with my grandparents and I didn’t want to put that responsibility on them). I got prescribed hydrocodone (norco) and it hit me pretty hard, I was extremely nauseous, couldn’t sleep, in a lot of pain and drowsy to shit. My mother had to be constantly reminded through text by my boyfriend to give me my meds and some food. I never asked her for anything once. 2 days after my surgery (I was still on pain medication and incredibly drowsy) she essentially made me go drop my grandmother off at the hair salon because she was too busy watching tv with my sister. So I had to go and drive my grandmother while still under the influence of opioids (I know this is my fault but my mother wouldn’t let me stay home). I  dropped my grandmother off and immediately had to pull over on the side of the road and puke because of how drowsy and nauseous I was. My boyfriend found out about my mother making me drive and confronted her about it and she just acted like a victim and tried to blame it on me for not taking my meds correctly (I was). Because of my pain meds (that I’ve been off of since Sunday) ive been very constipated and haven’t been able to use the restroom for over a week. I asked my mom today about possibly going to the hospital because I’m having severe abdominal pain, tried many laxatives, coffee and water and I called 3 different urgent cares who all told me to go to the ER. I called my mother to ask if she’d be okay with it because she’s the primary on my insurance and I might need some assistance with medical bills and she basically told me that the hospital wouldn’t help me and I’d be too scared of getting an enema (I’m not I’ve already tried one)Tomorrow is her birthday and I know I might sound like an asshole but I don’t even want to see her after what’s happened.

ivtz27hs	This happened last week and my daughter is still super upset about this. She’s also still holding a grudge against my wife and I.  My (44M) daughter, Bella (16F), is a sophomore in high school this year. She was planning on attending her school’s Sadie Hawkins dance with a group of friends. She did not plan on asking a boy to the dance. She was really excited about it too and made plans with her friends. They were gonna eat at a nice restaurant and take pictures around town before going to the dance. They were then going to go to an afterparty afterwards. Bella even went out and bought a nice dress with her own money for it.  I thought that she was going to have a great night. Unfortunately, something came up last minute. About a week beforehand, there was an announcement at my work saying that an office party was scheduled on the same night as the Sadie Hawkins dance.   Unfortunately, someone had to babysit our younger kids (8M, 6F) so my wife and I told Bella that she had to stay home that night to babysit her siblings. Bella had an absolute meltdown after hearing that saying how it’s unfair how my wife and I sprung this up on her last minute and how she already made concrete plans for the dance. She then said she is refusing to babysit that night.  I told Bella that life isn’t fair sometimes and that she had to babysit them because they can’t take care of themselves on their own and it might be too late to find a babysitter. I also told her if that she didn’t stay at home and went to the dance that she would be grounded for a month. She reluctantly agreed and has been mad at my wife and I ever since.   After that night, Bella was even more upset finding out that she wouldn’t be paid for babysitting them. She argued that we would’ve paid another girl her age $10/hour to watch them so it’s unfair how she wouldn’t be paid.   I told Bella that as an older sibling, it is an expectation to help out with her younger siblings when needed. I also told her that we didn’t want to pay for a babysitter when she can babysit them at any time. Bella about lost it after I mentioned that saying that she shouldn’t have to be on-call for us 24/7 and that it is not unreasonable to expect a payment for watching her siblings all night.   My two little kids told me that I was being unfair to Bella, but to be honest, they are too young and don’t know any better. They don’t know the situation on hand.   My wife is taking my side here, but I am still questioning whether what I did was justified or not.	1642803244.0	s9mhv8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mhv8/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_her_school/	AITA for not letting my daughter go to her school dance?
ivu0eo3c	My (40f) son Matt (18m) lives with me. His father is not in his life. He left when Matt was 12. Ever since, Matt has become reckless. Failing grades, going out drinking, etc. His curfew was 12am, but now because of his behavior, I am changing it to 9pm. I know he's 18, but he still lives under MY house. Until he can get a place of his own, he needs to obey my rules.   Thing is, Matt didn't take kindly to this. He's started opposing me in almost every way, such as starting parties once I'm gone or calling my cuss words. I confronted him as to why hates his mother so much, to the point where I cried. He dried my tears and said he's a monster and probably needs therapy. I told him he's my beautiful boy and I love him. For some reason, he took me to his room to show me something.  From that point on, he slowly unzips his pants and shoes his 9 inch cock in front of me. I haven't seen his cock since he was a 10-year-old boy. I didn't realize it became that big. Then, he tied my wrists and dicked me down on his bed. He fucked my pussy until his cum was all over it. He shoved his big dick in my mouth until it was down my throat until I gagged and puked all over it. He licked my puke off and stuck his fingers in my ass.   He fucks my armpit and cums on it, licking the cum off my armpit. Then he tossed my salad and licked my leftover shit (I just pooped an hour before this and forgot to wipe) and kisses me afterwards. He fucked my eyeball until blood leaked on his cock and now I'm blind. He fucked my ear too. Stuck his cock inside it and now his manhood is full of earwax. A week later he gave me STDs and cancer.   But I still didn't lift his curfew. He got angry and drove off.

ivr6bu40	I'm 30F, have 2 sons aged 9 and 7. My gram (71F) likes to take my kids maybe once a month because she doesnt like being alone (first time ever living alone).   Long story short, my uncle (53) and aunt (41) have an issue with my grandmother having my boys over to her place. They claim I'm selfish, inconsiderate and apparently a "user"- as in they are claiming I use my grandmother as a free sitter. Despite my grandmother continuously telling them that it isnt the case and that she asks for them specifically because they help her around the house (they help her cook and clean) and are basically the only family that visits without having motive.   So originally I just ignore these people. I never had a good relationship with literally anyone in the family due to covered up ab*se so it's not like it hurts me any that these people have a log up their ass. But lately its becoming a problem. My grandmother asked for the kids last weekend and during the visit my uncle shows up and, to my children, says "What, your fucking mother out partying?" Since this point my uncle is now trying to forcibly remove my grandmother from her home, stating that she can no longer live by herself due to me "using" her.  Stating that if an emergency happens, she is going to end up dead because she will have my kids. How this makes sense is beyond me but whatever. He is just making her feel like trash basically and blaming me for it. She thinks she cant do anything because she gave up her guardianship over herself to my aunt 3 years ago after my aunt told her she wasnt responsible enough to handle her own medication following my grandfather's passing.   When I found out he was trying to forcibly remove her (as in he went to her house and started packing her shit) I called Adult Protective Services. This has caused a world of grief because now guardianship has been stripped from my aunt and its caused a drift between my grandmother and her kids. I've been told I'm a selfish cunt- not by my grandmother but by her children.

e4uxncc0	This happened about 3 years ago, pre-covid so that was not a factor. Now a little context. I have always been a very studious person, got good grades and even got my full tuition at university paid for by a scholarship. My parents have been putting away money for both my brother and I since we were born. They had a 529 plan (a savings account that can only be used for school-related expenses) for each of us.   Now since my tuition was free they used this money to pay for the room and board expenses when I went to college. Well FF to the summer after my sophomore year. I decided to take a few summer classes and also work almost a full time job after class. They were 6 week accelerated courses and I experienced extreme burnout after I completed them.   I had reached a bit of a breaking point and decided that I wanted to go on a solo vacation and have a little fun for a change. I had never been to Europe but I did a ton of research about different places I wanted to visit and places to stay. I talked with my work and was approved to take a 2 week vacation.   After I booked the tickets I told my mother about the plan. I had saved up around 8k since I started working in high school so I was using my own money. But my mother was furious, she didn’t want me traveling alone (20 at the time). Also she told me that if I had the money to go on a international vacation that I didn’t need her help with school and if I went she wouldn’t pay for my room and board anymore. I had already booked the tickets so there was nothing I could really do. Plus I was very excited to get out and experience the world. Well she didn’t talk to me for the 3 weeks leading up to my trip and after I returned she followed through on her word. I had not planned on the expense of room and board and I had to take out a 10k loan. I didn’t argue much at the time because it’s technically her money but I definitely think it was unfair for her to try to control me using the money she saved specifically for my college.   Looking back I see so much wrong with her logic. First of all, why would I even have a job if I wasn’t allowed to use it on myself? Also since I was 20 years old and didn’t have to follow her rules so instead she held my college fund over my head.   I have since graduated and now there is still thousands of dollars in ‘my’ 529 plan that cannot be used anymore.	1642803711.0	s9mo9m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mo9m/aita_for_going_on_a_trip_to_europe_when_my/	AITA for going on a trip to Europe when my parents were paying for my college
ivu3tp1l	I 13f and my friend in this topic 13f, let’s call her emily we’re on FaceTime and we were making fun of my ex boyfriend 13m .   For backstory my ex and I broke up in July 2021, let’s call him “issac” and my friend “Emily” used to be his neighbor before she moved near my house, according to my ex they were best friends for 5 years. After I told her me and him broke up, she told me that she had hated him the entire time they were friends and that she had always thought he was annoying.  While me and emily were on FaceTime, she was telling me embarrassing story’s about him, and she told me a story about how he was outside with his friend and talking about how he had 2 gfs while we were dating. I asked her why she didn’t tell me this and she said she had simply forgot. I kept on questioning it and then she said “I didn’t forget, u too just seemed so happy and I didn’t wanna ruin it for you guys.” And I told her that I didn’t want to stop being friends with her, but I wanted some space because I don’t know how I’m supposed to be friends with someone who kept something that big from me. She said okay. I texted my best friend 13f and explained it to her and she said I overreacted and should’ve just been okay with it since it was in in the past.

ivt8ziap	I've been divorced for about six years and share 50/50 with my ex-wife. Our houses are literally separated by a park.   Our middle son hit 12 and it was agreed beforehand that at 12, our kids can have more say in their living arrangements. Basically legal custody will always be 50/50 until age 18 but physical custody could shift to 75/25 when the child turns 12. This comes out to one or two more days a week more with the other parent (we do one week on, one week off).  Our 12yo was a firm Mama's boy until he hit 10. Now he'd rather spend time with me. We have a 17 who mostly spends time at his mom's. Our 8yo is 50/50.  My son asked if he could spend more time at my place. A major part is he has more privacy at my house. His mom doesn't knock before entering, goes into room when he's showering to talk to him and won't let him do his own laundry. Plus it's hard sharing a house with a 17yo.   I explained this to her and she flipped out. She said privacy is bs because she's there to help with our 8yo not him (they share a room). She thinks it's about him playing us against each other.   There's not much she can do. It'd be a waste of her time and money to fight it. After trying to talk to her about it, I said he can stay with me an extra day a week.	1642804745.0	s9n22i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n22i/aita_for_letting_my_son_stay_longer_at_my_house/	AITA for letting my son stay longer at my house?

I’m concerned for her safety as my daughter.  I still pay child support on her two siblings so I take the screenshot to court with me saying this is how my daughter was raised.  The judged said ok.  He will look into it.  Well they did but since she’s in a different state I can’t do anything.  I tried calling her school and they said there’s nothing they can do.  I even tried calling her work to tell her boss.   But no once cared there.  I get a restraining order in the mail because it said I have been harassing my adult daughter.

ivuml8jo	Friend and I went to Vegas. We decided we would split our winnings/losses. We started with the same amount of cash to be fair. On the second to last day my friend had lost it all... I continued to play, but he was stuck watching. I kind of felt bad (I was down from our original amount), so I offered to split if he wanted to play. He said no, so I went to a table to buy in... and he said OK, lets split.... but didn't play again that night... which if I knew I wouldn't of given up 1/2 the money. I split my remaining money 50/50 as per our agreement.  Fast forward to the last day, I ended up losing more of my 1/2, but he hit a lucky streak and doubled it. He didn't offer any of his winnings, or to cover my further losses.  I was prepared to lose what I came with, but considering that he left Vegas with more than me, even though they got down to $0, and only continued by keeping 1/2 of my money made me feel off... but I didn't confront him.

h33v26iq	My (32M) finance (29F) and I have pushed back our wedding twice now due to COVID. We said after the last delay that if it happens again we’re not going to have a wedding and we’re just going to sign a paper. We really want to have our wedding in July, however, the recent surge has us nervous again.  In order to alleviate those nerves, we have decided to require everyone attending our wedding to be fully vaccinated. There are some people on our guest list that I don’t fully trust, so we’re asking everyone to send to us either a picture of their vaccine card, or proof through their state’s department of health. We recently brought this up with our in-laws and they were appalled. They said we had no business meddling in people’s lives and that there medical decisions are their own to make and are private.  We absolutely agree that their medical decisions are theirs to make, and we are not going to argue with people why they should/shouldn’t get the vaccine, we’re simply stating to attend our wedding, you must be vaccinated and supply proof. If you don’t want to get vaccinated, that’s your choice, but you won’t be attending our wedding. My in-laws ended the conversation calling us “thought-less assholes” and left.

ivuc4v69	Hear me out with this one, I'm beggin ya.   I f(17) have been with my boyfriend m(31) for six months now. I know the age gap is a scandalous topic that everyone loves to talk about so here we go. Yes, met when I was 17.  I had to grow up a whole lot faster than other kids with two barely present parents and three little siblings to raise. I spent my afternoons walking to both the middle and elementary schools to get them, walk them home, make them dinner and fall asleep over my own homework after they slept and i finished my chores. I feel like I worked hard and grew up fast as a kid and it's left me a bit more nature than some.   I met my boyfriend at work, I am in retail and he was a customer, chatting me up a few times a week and then eventually giving me his number. He has quite the baby face and I expected he was around 20 or 21, I didn't ask at first. And neither did he. We hung out often, went on dates and by date four he asked to make things official.    We went to a movie the other night and got ID'd for the R showing. I handed my card over to him so he could pass both to the attendant and he saw my age while waiting for his card to come back. He freaked out, stopped buying the tickets and took a walk.   I waited in front of the theater for him and he came back to me shocked and angry I was 17 and had said nothing to him. The topic hadn't come up naturally in conversation yet and I figured he was just a bit older than me so I failed to understand the gravity of his concerns here.   He told me his own age in anger and spouted off about an illegal, immoral, 14 year gap that made him feel disgusting. That he thought I was young but like 22 or 23 and definitely not 17.  We haven't spoken in three days since this and I've never seen him so angry. I didn't think I was making a mistake and it really just wasn't something I was concerned about, but suppose I should have told him looking back? I shouldn't have assumed his age either? I don't know, we both just assumed and said nothing to each other.   AITA here?	1642805296.0	s9n9bg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n9bg/aita_for_not_telling_him_my_age/	AITA for not telling him my age?
ivtj5w3x	Hello everybody!   I (22nb) moved back in with my family last year due to an emergency. So I now live with my step siblings. For context, my step siblings were adopted and are all different races. They’re Mexican, Black, and Indigenous. They were either adopted at birth or as toddlers so grew up with my stepmom, who is white. To my understanding she has done her best to keep them tied to their cultures as much as possible.   Ever since moving in I’ve been a tad isolated. I’ve made a few friends online from gaming and lgbtq+ groups.  There’s one girl (19f) I’ve become especially close to and have talked to her about my family situation. For context, she’s Indigenous.We were video calling while playing a game online and I got up to use the bathroom. I flipped the camera from my desk to my bed so she could see my dogs and not just my window.   By the time I got back she had hung up and had thrown a whole bunch of messages at me that she saw my dream catcher above my bed and that she refused to play with someone that appropriated Indigenous cultures for aesthetics and that it was no wonder my siblings felt disconnected from their cultures if they lived with a racist like me.   I tried to explain to her how I got the dream catcher and the context but she refused and blasted me in our online group chat, telling everyone I’m a racist that is probably terrible to my POC siblings.   Now to explain the dream catcher. I know now that if you’re white and getting a dream catcher that you should only get one as a gift from an Indigenous person or support them by paying for their work. But I got this dream catcher nearly 16 years ago and it was homemade by my older sister. I was around 6 and she was in her freshman year and learned how to make them in one of her classes as an arts and crafts project. When she came home with one I asked for one too, and she gathered what’s supplies she could find and helped “me” (I mostly watched seeing as I was 6) make one. It’s old and raggedy now, but I can’t ask for a replacement from my sister, as she passed away nearly 5 years ago in a car accident. I have maybe an unhealthy attachment to it, as when I moved here initially and it was still at my exes home I cried and couldn’t sleep until I got it back.   I don’t want to offend anyone, but I’m struggling with the idea of throwing it away or hiding it out of sight because it feels like I’d be hiding my sister away. But I’m scared to offend anyone or to be harassed for being racist for it. So WIBTA if I just left it where it was?	1642805520.0	s9ncii	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ncii/wibta_if_i_didnt_get_rid_of_a_dream_catcher_even/	WIBTA if I didn’t get rid of a dream catcher even though I’m white?

ivwe0iul	A girl in my building (21F) was appalled when she found out I (20F) got a summer internship with a top investment banking company. She was furious and couldn’t believe I managed to secure an internship with a prestigious firm when I’m a grade below her, and she couldn’t.  She was like “I never saw that job posting.” And I was like “Yeah, because it was never posted. If you bothered to show up to info sessions on finance/IB or joined a student consulting group or took literally any initiative, you’d know most jobs actually aren’t posted publicly.”  I literally have invited her to info sessions, and she’s told me she’s busy napping or getting lunch. Meanwhile, I take every opportunity possible. She knows nothing about IB or getting internships because she completely neglects the extensive help our school offers. We’re one of the few colleges where IB firms actually come to us on campus and recruit.  “She was like, how the hell would you know about the job, then?” And literally accused me of having sex with someone to get an internship, so I guess I can add sexism to her list of character flaws. I was like “Because I’ve actually been doing what I’m supposed to and have been doing IB networking for two years. I got an internship through a personal connection I made. You’re a junior. You should have way more connections than me.”  And she was appalled, saying almost like a toddler “That’s not fair. It wasn’t available for everyone to apply!” I was like “Yeah, and what about it?” That’s the whole point of connecting with people in the industry.

g4klp51l	I suck at telling stories and also english is my 3rd language so ignore my mistakes  A little background, my brother (33m) is a horrible man who tried to do "something" to my older sister when they were little (he 15 my sister 10). He never supported our family in anyway even though his wife and kids used to live with us. My father is an old man who cannot work. Whenever my mother ask my brother for financial help he got angry and said "you guys are not my responsibility" when my father and we sisters were feeding him his wife and his kids. His wife used to beat me and he never ever did anything about it, he always stood by her side on this matter. His wife used to curse and abuse my innocent mom and it never bothered him. A few months back he married another woman (muslim men can keep 4 wifes at a time) in secret. When she asked him about his family he told her that his mother is dead and his kids are mentally unstable.  It broke my mother's heart that she actually died from this.  My sister had 2 miscarriages and i came to know that he said he prays daily that she may never have kids just because she told his wife about with he did when they were kids We were so angry at him because of my mother's death that nobody wanted to talk to him ever. He came home at her death. Everyone was too depressed to say anything to him at that point. But After that my father kept in touch with him. He calls him everyday. Now its my sister's wedding next month and i don't want him to stay at our home. We had a huge fight when i told my dad and my sisters that i don't want him to come in this house. I said he killed our mother and my sister said you always act like she was just your mother. She was our mother too. We are angry too. You just want to create drama. So now I've asked them to choose between me and him. If he stays then I'm leaving forever after the wedding.   Am I the asshole?	1642807847.0	s9o71j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9o71j/aita_for_saying_this_to_my_family_that_if_my/	AITA for saying this to my family that if my brother stays in our house then I'm leaving forever
ivvsgmrf	I'm known for making inappropriate comments on the fly. I don't mean any harm, I just love joking around. For context, I'm a young 26-year-old woman married with a husband. So obviously I'm not creepy on purpose.   On my niece's birthday party, she has just turned 11. I hugged her and wished her happy birthday, and got her a gift. Being my old self, I commented on how bigger her butt has gotten and touched it going, "look at your big fat butt! Might as well call you Kim Kardashian!!" My niece awkwardly laughed and went to her mom (my sister).  My sister dragged me aside and said I made her daughter cry, claiming that she was extremely uncomfortable. I was confused? I told her I do this shit all the time and even her daughter knows this. She continued to talk about how her daughter has been taught about good touch bad touch and to not accept any inappropriate advances from adults. I just bluntly said "No wonder she overreacted then."  I don't know why, but she kicked me out of the party. My husband and I left. My husband was angry with me because she really wanted to hang out with our niece. He then proceeded to say that my comments are different to a grown adult than a small child, and I should know better.   I'm just like boo. It's a stupid joke and she's just a kid. She doesn't even know who Kim Kardashian is. Btw, we're a Hispanic family and for generations it was common for us to comment on family members' bodies. When has my sister become so PC and Americanized with this shit?	1642808139.0	s9oawq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oawq/aita_for_telling_a_child_that_her_butt_looks_big/	AITA for telling a child that her butt looks big?
iva09d4v	My (M) friend (M) recently got a tattoo on their wrist. It was of an animal since it was part of their middle name in Swahili. They aren't the biggest fan of the animal, but decided to get one of it anyway, since they said it's part of who they are, in hopes that the tattoo artist could make it look nice.    So this is where the conflict comes in. He sent me pictures of the new tattoo on their wrist asking if I liked it, was it nice, etc. I replied that I only really like dogs (I just never really cared for other animals/wildlife), but that if they liked it and had some sort of sentiment then that's really nice! He then proceeds to send me a handful of paragraphs saying that they were not happy with what I said. They felt like that I was being passive aggressive/trying to hint that I thought it looked bad. He says it doesn’t matter if I liked it or not but that I should have at least said one nice thing about it because the tattoo was going to be permanent on his body.     I tried to explain that it was not the case at all, and that I had simply meant that I would not personally get it and that since it was something that had sentimental value to them, then that's all that really mattered. He then goes on to say it doesn't matter, as this is something permanent and because of the way I reacted, they're going to forever doubt the tattoo.

ivx7rfgj	I (22F) have been married to my husband (23M) for almost 4 years now.  The first 2 years were normal and monogamous, but then he came out to me as asexual. After a lot of talking he really started pushing me to start seeing women (which is fine, I’m bisexual, so it didn’t bug me at all). Well, flash forward to now, despite having 2 kids I still have a really nice body and I send pictures (pretty much nightly) to my girlfriends, many times it’s on my husband’s phone because his camera is a bit better than mine(not to sound conceited but I’m pretty good looking). Today I went on his phone to trade Pokémon and saw that he had a picture of some random girl wearing virtually nothing pulled up. I talked to him about it and he said he’d been subscribed to some account for a little less than a month (and I looked at their content, one was a video a girl putting on a bikini and playing with her a**). I am in no way a prude but it did make me feel really insecure seeing him pine over videos like this when I already make similar content and he doesn’t care or seem attracted to it- I am seriously considering divorcing him because it feels like I’m wasting time with someone that just doesn’t like me.	1642808681.0	s9oi28	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oi28/aita_for_not_wanting_my_asexual_husband_to_look/	AITA for not wanting my “asexual” husband to look at porn?

cxv6g4qu	I (23F) do not drink, and I haven’t had sex yet and my coworker (30F) seems to bring it up whenever she can.   For some backstory I (23F) started working at my current place of work since this past summer. My coworker (30F) has been working at my current place of work since March of last year. My (current) director (33F) was promoted shortly after I was hired, but worked with my coworker since she was hired back in March. My 30F coworker makes it known that she is buddy buddy with the director (which brings in my hesitance when trying to tell people I am uncomfortable)   Flash forward to today, I made a joke that my coworker (30F) peer pressured me to take a sip of wine at the office. When she was offered a glass, she turned to me and said “wow they really didn’t ask you huh” me *in my head* it’s no surprise I don’t drink.   Does she say that to get a reaction out of me? Not sure, but I didn’t give her one. Then she makes fun of me for it, then proceeds to tell me multiple times to take a sip. So I do. I make the comment of “you didn’t have to peer pressure me into it, asking once would have sufficed” her “wow. Peer pressured you? I’ll just go tell our director (33F) that you lost your virginity and she’ll be like WHHHAAATTT”   I guess my main problem with it is that she has no problem lying to our upper management about it. Regardless if it’s true or not I think the comment is so uncalled for.  I didn’t confront her about the comment, instead just continued to do work then left without saying a word.   So AITA if I report her to HR? Should I just mention something to our director?	1642808914.0	s9ol1d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ol1d/aita_if_i_report_my_coworker_to_hr/	AITA if I report my coworker to HR
hm9g5r2s	My roommate and I live in a small, rural, Midwestern town in an apartment complex in town. When I mean rural, I mean 20 minutes to the next decently sized town. There is a small university in our town and quite a few fast food restaurants, but only one coffee shop. That said, I love coffee. I drink it all the time. I also love going to coffee shops to do my homework (as I am currently a college student).  My roommate works at the only coffee shop in town which is about a five minute drive away from where we live so obviously I frequent it quite a lot to get work done. The next nearest shop is in the next town over which is about a 15–20 minute drive depending on how fast you drive. Certainly a more economic decision to go to the shop in town.  When my roommate and I first moved in together I quickly found out that we were both coffee aficionados: we both own several methods of brewing coffee and the kitchen is always well-stocked with fresh coffee. Nobody else in my life really shares this passion for coffee that I have, and in true ADHDer fashion I would talk about it quite frequently. Admittedly, probably too much. She told me at a certain point that she'd appreciate it if I would refrain from talking to her about coffee when she was off from work as it felt too much like "talking shop." I thought it a bit of a strange request but of course I obliged, I wouldn't want to come home and talk about making pizza all night. So I thought that issue was resolved.  Now, as I've established, I go into the coffee shop where she works quite frequently, several times a week. I certainly stay out of her way and don't engage in unnecessary conversation unless she prompts the conversation, I try to be a normal customer and get in and get out. You know, basic decency. Well, tonight, I got home from work and she had been back for a few hours (she worked the opening shift, I worked a midshift and had gone to get a bit of homework done for a few hours prior). The long and short of it is that she told me that she would appreciate it if I would stop coming into the shop and instead maybe go to the one in the next town more often than not. She said that she didn't like having the person that she lived with at her place of employment when she was working, she said it would be like her coworkers hanging out at our apartment when she wasn't working. I said that hypothetically, if I were friends with one or more of her coworkers, that it would be unreasonable for her to expect me to not bring them over to visit on her off days, and therefore—using her own analogy—it's unreasonable for her to expect me not to go to her workplace to get work done frequently. She of course disagreed, the conversation more or less fizzled out, and it was left unresolved.  AITA for not wanting to avoid the only coffee shop in town because my roommate works there?	1642809018.0	s9omen	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9omen/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_the_coffee_shop_that_my/	AITA for wanting to go to the coffee shop that my roommate works at?
7acrlpzf	I M/17, am with my Boyfriend J/18, I have had numerous health problems all my life caused by Endometriosis and others, I had a miscarriage in October 2021 due to these health problems. I have been offered a hysterectomy by my doctor.  I suggested this to J and he isn't willing to support me if I go through and have the surgery, I have been with J 2 years and he is my best friend but both of us always dreamed of being parents. I was told I would never be able to conceive again as my womb was badly damaged from the miscarriage, so even if I was to have a hysterectomy I would most possible never conceive anyway.   J, gets angry anytime I mention it and I have now received a letter saying they will go through with the surgery when I turn 18 which is very soon and he saw the letter and called me a selfish asshole, saying I am ruining his chance of ever having children.  He says he loves me and will support me if it means we can stay together which I really want as I love him so much, but J really wanted to be a dad as he grew up an only child with an alcoholic mum and no dad in the picture, I mentioned adoption or surrogate as my friends from childhood have offered but it is his choice, I honestly love him and understand in some of the things he has said because I always dreamed of being a mum but when I lost my baby 3/4 months along I felt like my heart had sunk. He isn't as on edge now my best friend has offered when we both turn 18.  &#x200B;  So Am I the asshole for asking my boyfriend to support me if I go through with the hysterectomy?	1642809325.0	s9oqju	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oqju/aita_for_asking_my_partner_if_he_will_support_me/	AITA For asking my partner if he will support me if I choose to have a Hysterectomy

She wanted to take my child out for cinnamon rolls and cake after my child cried over hearing she wouldn't be as prioritized anymore.  Today, when she picked my kid up for their half of the week, she squeezed her and kissed her and told her that she'd still love her even after the baby came and that she'd love them equally as they were both her kids.  She then turned to me and said that she wanted to keep my kid for the whole week or two so that I had time to have a break from parenting, and I told her that I didn't want or need a break and that she was not to violate our agreements.	1642809441.0	s9orys	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9orys/aita_for_telling_an_adult_to_mind_boundaries_with/	AITA for telling an adult to mind boundaries with my child?
dqu7naum	For as long as I can remember I've always been second to my mom's boyfriends and his kids if he had any. I've always had to do whatever her boyfriends wanted me to.  Well her last boyfriend was well, it was obvious he was narcissistic and was gas lighting her. He was basically a walking red flag. I got yelled (screamed) at when I told my mom this. When they broke up the first time my mom blamed me for them breaking up, told me I never listened and it drove him away  Fast forward when we moved in after they got back together, I followed every ridiculous rule he gave me. No humming if I was laying on the floor in my room, no laughing loudly (I was told I had to laugh into a pillow), no singing, no practicing my instrument when he was home, and many many more. Now he had three kids of his own and his oldest was 6 years younger than I. And they had less rules than I did. Basically they got to do everything they wanted.   They broke up, I had to live with my best friend for a month cause we had no house, pretty shitty to go through at 16.  Now when we moved in to our house that we have now my mom was constantly getting on me. I was always getting yelled at for the dumbest things.  A couple months in to living here my mom gets a new boyfriend. He's really nice but yet again I'm constantly alone. And now she wants to move in with him.  Well she told me I can either move with her or find somewhere to stay until I graduate. Yay time to figure out where I'm gonna live again only a year later. Now being 17 you'd expect my mom to ask my friends parents these question or at least help me out a bit well thats not what happened. I'm doing all of it on my own and my mom has not and will not help me at all. The other night we got into an argument and I finally broke down and told her exactly how I felt. I'm so stressed out I can't get anything done in school and I've cried so much in these past 2 weeks that I constantly feel dehydrated. I broke down crying and told her I just wanted her to help me, but since I have it figured out already I didnt need her help anymore. And I told her how I'm tired of getting really close with people just to end up moving away. She starts going on about how she's always the bad guy and heaven forbid she's happy for once. And told me I don't care about her happiness. When obviously I do since that's all I've been doing all my life. I'm just so tired of being a burden to her and I don't want to be second to anyone anymore.

bcb1dqmk	   Chapter one the big fight  I logged on to make my daily joke as I was online a lot less. I put the gif in the chat made for lewd things. Then my phone stopped and restarted. When it opened the second time I found it was not sent. I did not see the picture so then I sent it again. The gif would not be sent so I made it an image, and tried to Send that listed if the gif. The image seemed like it was sent but disappeared a few seconds after. My phone tends to do this. So I sent this again. Then wolfy (one of the admins who is dating the owner of the server.) said something and showed me that it was being removed, not glitching out and not sending. I'm not sure why they were acting like I was pissed at their cheerios. (Wolfy's pronouns are “they” and “them” now, but I think he still identifies as a male) and he decided to try to ban me since I put “porn” in the restricted chat for lewd things. It was already restricted so I did not see the problem I tried to argue for myself and he threatened to ban me more. The third person of the shit show maple ghost has now joined, and at this time they were dating my roommate. They fought on the side of wolfy. Maple switched the topic to me saying the n-word in a discord server I was never in. I tried to call my roommate cosmic for an alibi, but he was grounded and could not help them at a point I was like this is the end. I will get banned and at this point, I am done with this shit said “if you ban me that will just make you a hypocrite.” Wolfy did not like it and so he banned me.   chapter two communication   I still had contact with a few of the people and decided to try to get clarification on something Maple said. Which was “some people have been waiting to ban you.”, so I contacted cosmic (at this time he got ungrounded) and asked him. He said wolfy, “maple, and le virtue”, but that is all he knows about. I then reached out to freq she said that she did not know any more than cosmic. Then I went to Angel who was the owner of that server. I started with “do you know why I got banned?” She said that everyone said, “you were arguing with admins and said the n-word.” I tried to get in a call so I did not have to spend an hour to type it all out she said no she already knows the n-word was a lie. Then I asked what she thought about me getting banned she said “I think it was stupid” “but wolfy is still pissed off so I will not let you join. Then we cut contact as I was not friends with her and she deleted the one server I was still in with her. I gave it another 2 weeks and then was paid $50 to spam wolfy with the picture he banned me over. The same week I had cosmic put a discord invite for anyone who wanted to keep in contact with me. Wolfy got mad and threatened to ban cosmic for bringing me up. That is what I was mad about most.   &#x200B;  There are 2 more chapters but I can't fit them all in one post.	1642809971.0	s9oz3r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oz3r/aita_i_have_been_in_this_3_month_long_fight/	AITA I have been In This 3 Month Long Fight

isb742eg	My (f18) brother (m25) has autism and gets away with anything because of it. He is constantly saying slurs that he is not in a position to reclaim, he is also very rough. He throws things, has broken windows, doors and literally anything else you can think of he has probably broken when angry. He has been very aggressive with me, my parents, my other brother Zach , his friends and even just strangers on the street. He has been acting this way ever since he was young and has never faced the consequences of his actions.   Any time I or Zach bring up his awful behavior my parents get really upset and defensive and they accuse us of being ableist. I understand that due to his autism my brother may have a hard time differentiating what is socially acceptable and what is not but at this point I think he acts this was just because he can.  I’ve decided to talk to my parents about it again and try to get them to see sense.

Words can’t express how angry and jealous I am right now. I was a weeb in high school and I got picked on all the time and never once did any beautiful girl offer to comfort me whatsoever.   All they did was sleep with the guys that bullied me. Where was my pity fuck? I guess I should be happy for that guy that she slept with but I only envy him. The part that makes me the most upset is that she said he acted more confident after she slept with him. I bet he did.

(Yes I know I waited too long 🥲) anyways on the ride back to our house my fiancé started posting all over social media as the post title “stepping into a hallmark movie”  cut to arriving home and my mother calls to “congratulate” us   She starts by “did you cry?” I said of course I cried it’s an emotional moment why wouldn’t I cry she proceeded to say I didn’t raise no pussy and I shouldn’t be crying as well as why would I propose during the day? Basically criticizing every moment but there’s a kicker  She begins to start making fun of my fiancés post by saying “Hallmark movie? Hallmark movies are all fucking stupid.”   Mind my fiancé is listening the whole time anyways I get irritated and just hang up shortly after my fiancé starts crying and that shouldn’t be the way to end a special day in our lives so I tell her to ignore it and I will call my mother tomorrow and make her apologize for the things she said and that was that.  Cut to the next day I call my mother and tell her how she upset my fiancés feeling and disrespected the whole engagement and just criticized everything and that she needed to apologize   She refused to apologize and even starting talking about my fiancé bringing up her depression as well as saying she isn’t going anywhere in life and she’s wasted the past 4 years to school and has nothing to show for it. I was instantly upset 😠   So I said if your not going to apologize and now your adding more stuff to the fire I will be cutting you out of my life and hung up   Cut to a month later the whole family is divided and some of the family is pressuring me to just start talking to my mother and they even had the audacity to tell me to apologize to her.

ivxsfclo	I (41Male) started hooking up with my now fiancé (29Male) 6 years ago. During those years he was my fuck buddy so we were nothing serious and he had a guy he was seeing but they were not serious either. At one point I started catching feelings for him and I asked him to be with me and be only with me and to be a normal couple but he refused to. His excuse was that he was afraid of getting hurt because his ex abused and manipulated him. I respected his decision but we continued seeing each other as fuck buddies. We were not official but we did things that couples do, even if we were not a couple.   While celebrating my birthday I discovered that he was talking with other guy because I checked his phone (I know, it’s a shitty move) and I called him out on it, we had an argument when my friends were not around and I asked him to leave. I came back to the party and my friend who I known since we were 14 years old told me to “not suffer from that whore because all men are like that”.   Now, almost three years later my fuck buddy is my fiancé and he confronted me about it last night. He was upset because I let my friend call him a whore even if we were not official, he wasn’t even a boyfriend. He says that I didn’t defend him when this is not true. And he and my friend get along just fine so I really don’t know what’s wrong with him. I told him that I wouldn’t apologize for something I didn’t say, that my friend likes him and that he doesn’t think that about him, I always prioritize him and treat him with respect because he’s the guy I love.

ius74l2e	Two years ago I was an honors student, but right now I am barely passing my geometry class. I have a tutor, which worked out great for a while. The way she teaches is very helpful and she teaches good, so it’s not that I have a bad tutor. I mostly understand what we are learning in the class. I have an irrational fear of extra help in any subject, so I’ve been avoiding going to math extra help because I have the tutor.  Today there was a test. It kept getting pushed back because of snow days, so I had plenty of time to prepare. I studied for hours and pretty much did everything that I could. I only finished half of the test by the time the period was over. I almost never finish tests in the allotted time period. Sometimes my thoughts just move faster than I can write, and other times I know the material but my brain freezes up when I go to take the actual test.  The bell rang at the end of the period so I finished the question I was working on. There were about 10 other people in the class who weren’t finished, either. I called it quits and handed the teacher, Mr. Q, my paper. He looked at the back of it and said, “is this really all you did?” I nodded and couldn’t think of anything to say. He whispered to me, “you better come in for extra help every day for the rest of the year. Or else you’re gonna drown, sweetie.” Then he said, “I know you have a tutor, but you should come to me instead because that isn’t working.”  I literally had shivers down my spine. All I said was “okay, sir.” It was already at least 5 minutes past when the late bell for the next block rang. He refused to give me and the other people late passes. He announced to the class that no one was allowed to come back to finish the test because he had past students who “abused” that right. I was 10 minutes late to my next class.	1642810837.0	s9p9zf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9p9zf/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_extra_help_resulting/	AITA for refusing to go to extra help, resulting in my teacher “threatening” me?
4hactx6x	Hi Reddit. I made a post on r/relationshipadvice and figured I’d try my luck here too. (I’d recommend checking out the post for more details)   So basically long story short my long distance girlfriend (21F)  relies on me for income due to getting cut off financially from her parents.  Most of our relationship is great and we spend most of our free time together but spending most of my income on helping her is draining me alot and sometimes I just wanna tell her I can’t help her anymore. But like it’s hard to imagine doing this to someone I’ve grown so close to and she’s been there a lot  for me over the years (we’ve been together for basically 3 years now)  I don’t know how she’d be able to survive without me and when I imagine cutting her off part of me feels really selfish since I don’t really have alot of financial responsibility myself (still living with parents)  However the other part of me wants to eventually move out and start having some sort of savings (right I don’t really have much of anything) and just in general prepare for the future and just seeing my bank account lose most  of its money every time I get paid has taken its toll on me after working so much (35ish hours a week)  Everything else is great but would I be the asshole for leaving her without me or money if I decided i couldn’t do this anymore?   A few side notes   I have met her in person before (we lived in the same city before we became long distance)  She has had major depression  in the past and I’m worried me leaving would cause something bad and idk if I would be ok with that guilt.   Can’t stress this enough 99% of our relationship is great and we turn to each other for a lot of personal stuff and I could see myself having a future with her 100% if this issue wasn’t there.	1642810940.0	s9pbf0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pbf0/wibta_if_i_20nb_left_my_partner_without_a_stable/	WIBTA If I 20(NB) left my partner without a stable form of income

5rc1l8si	It's currently 2AM and my friend wants me to come see him at his last night shift but i just don't feel like it at all because i worked for around 10 hours today and didn't get enough sleep from the night before due to hanging out with my friends till 4AM  (with my shift being only a few hours away) and it's not the first time something like that happens to me with them (more specifically one of my friends from highschool) pushing me to  hang out when i'm very tired after covering my shifts (i have a full time job at a local supermarket) it would be a lie if i said i hate hanging out with them, our hangouts can definitely be fun when they take place in appropriate times. They can be very pushy about it as well completely disregarding any reason for me wanting to stay at home, telling me things like "oh stop whining you get to sit there while i drive" or "i work more hours than you and i'm fine, stop pitying yourself" and stuff like that. The reason they do that is because my best friend from highschool is going to serve in the military very soon so it's some sort of a now or never situation. I don't hate any of my friends at all and i understand where they're coming from, but i just really need my hours of sleep i don't get much anyway. Does that make me an asshole?	1642811191.0	s9pegj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pegj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_hang_out_with_my_friends/	AITA for not wanting to hang out with my friends?
4d8tynel	Background context: So my grandparents aren't SUPER religious. But I like to think they are midly so. They go to church sometimes (or maybe they go often idk tbh), make a prayer before every meal, and on occasion they've bought us grandkids trips to church camps (which actually were pretty fun minus the religion part). They're viewpoints can definitely be a little old fashioned sometimes for example; when my cousin came out as trans they were very weird about it, that being said they also tried their best to use him/his pronouns and the correct name. They also never complained in front of my cousin.  Problem: So all of us grandkids grew up being being raised by Christian parents and grandparents. I went to church mostly on holidays, went to church camps like 3 or 4 times, and said prayers at holiday dinners. I've went along with this pretending to be Christian for 23 years of my life now. I respected their religion for all that time. So I've recently been thinking why can't they do the same for me? Because I'm not Christian, I'm agnostic. In fact I've been that way since I can remember. I've been thinking about telling them and the rest of my family that doesn't know already. It just feels wrong to lie about what I believe in just to "not stir the pot".  Counterargument: However, I've told my mom about the 'Problem' and she said that I shouldn't tell them. That telling them would just cause a whole bunch of drama and that there's no point in doing that because it's just rude. She also thinks that I shouldn't because they're in their 70s to 80s now and they should live out the rest of their life as peacefully as possible, which I definitely think is a good point...it'd make me feel terrible if this broke their heart or something that's why I'm conflicted on whether to tell them or not. I've already decided not to tell another one of my grandmas because she has Dementia, and telling her would only hurt her and then she'd forget...  Final Questions: But is it okay to tell them or not? Would that make me an asshole if I did? Is me being agnostic rude to them? I honestly don't know...and even if I were to tell them is there a good way to go about it? In person or in a post online (they use Facebook)? Should I tell everyone else and just not the grandparents? Or should I continue to pretend to be Christian until they pass away? It's not like it's that hard for me to pretend, so I think I could put up with it for however more years they live. What do y'all think?	1642810258.0	s9p2ne	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9p2ne/wibta_if_i_announced_to_my_midly_christian/	WIBTA If I announced to my midly Christian grandparents that I'm actually agnostic?
4nj772hr	I’m on mobile so formatting may be odd.  Well I may have made the title fairly misleading, so let me explain.  My parents are Buddhist, my mother especially so. And thus, they believe in karma. And I guess it makes sense. It’s like a spiritual form of cause and effect, but I feel like they take it a bit too far.  They always tell me that I’m a bad person for not doing stuff like holding the door for others, not letting people go first, giving up my seat for women, etc. And I feel like I’m not doing anything inherently wrong, but they say I’m a bad person and my actions will have bad consequences in the future.  And the real kicker is that they say that if I don’t think about family, then how will I think about other people? And I say that I obviously will think about my significant other but idk.  I guess it kinda has to do with how I grew up. In school it’s kind of a first come first serve deal, so I guess that it rubbed off on me.  But I don’t think of this stuff immediately. Like I’ll be spacing out and not really notice anything, and then my parent would be like, “why aren’t you helping? You’re supposed to be a man.” And I think that it’s not my job?

ivw8otk9	My ex-husband has been staying at the house we both still own. (Just another complication/he does have an apartment very close) Our 21yo daughter moved home a few months ago for several reasons. Boyfriend passed away from od and she was using drugs and just not in a good place.  She is now staying out until early morning hours and or not coming home at all. She brought a large dog and cat to the house that we have been feeding and taking care of.  Feelings have been elevated due to all that. Ex-husband and I get along now better than we did before however there are still a lot of unknowns and unanswered stuff lingering.  We also have a 10yo son living in the home. I came home from work in the afternoon to pick up a package that I had forgot. Ex and daughters cars were in driveway so they were both home. Daughter had to be at work in a half hour and ex leaves for work when I get home. Anyhow I walked in the house and no one is in communal living areas. I could hear them talking as I picked up my package.  I saw the bathroom light on and the bathroom is directly across from her room. I heard them talking and it caught my attention when I heard her say she would say it to my face. Not knowing what they were talking about or why I was involved I then said what are you going to say to my face. Neither knew I was home at this point. Ex seems frantic as he comes out of the bathroom in nothing but a towel. The door was not shut. He was not dripping wet or anything.  I can hear my daughter now talking to me however it sounded like she was in the bathroom.  My ex was staring at me and I asked where she was as I could hear the shower running. Yep she was in the shower. I said are you serious. You’re in the bathroom in nothing but a towel while she is in the shower.  This is so beyond inappropriate to me. I find it inappropriate when she walks through the house in a sports bra.  I am so close to throwing them both out. I pay the mortgage and all the bills and have for more than 7 years.  I just walked out and went back to work because I didn’t want to overreact and or let my emotions fly inappropriately.  That was something I would have done when we were married however it would put my job at risk. Which I have missed days due to situations and Covid. Ex adopted daughter 13 years ago right after we got married and there have been so many issues through the years.  My mental health is teetering with this. I am ready to throw them out or move into an apartment.	1642811063.0	s9pcwy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pcwy/aitafurious_momexwife/	AITA-Furious Mom/Ex-wife
ivxbndpm	So this morning me and my cousin 19 year old male. Asked my aunt about money. We are moving and originally she promised $5000 to each. Then when i said we can all rent a house down south it was about me and friends paying for everything. Even my cousin took it this way. She then got mad at us mind you we were not saying we needed it just what the plan was. So now it's almost 8 where I am and she's blaming us for how she feels and we hurt her. She then told me my grandma who raised me and has passed away would be disappointed in me for being upset with her for how she's been acting. She would not let me out of my room I had to run out when given the chance. Not to say I didn't yell or call her names but nothing like this. Now she's saying it is because of me the family is splitting apart when I tried to talk to her and so did my cousin. And yet she still won't listen. Am I the asshole for asking to begin with? Also I have mine and hers messages if people want proof.	1642811023.0	s9pcfc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pcfc/aita_for_asking_my_aunt_about_money/	AITA for asking my aunt about money
ivy7llzn	Okay so I (f20) and my ex boyfriend (m29) have been dating for 3 years and we’ve had a healthy and happy relationship thus far. When I was 12 my father died of lung cancer after many years of smoking, my aunt and grandmother also died of lung cancer so i am very anti smoking and anyone who knows me knows this.   My boyfriend know how much I hate smoking and has always agreed that it’s an awful, disgusting addiction. He has co workers that smoke, so when he comes home he’ll smell like cigarettes after spending lunch with them.  I’ve never suspected him of smoking because he know how much I hate it and he himself has said he hates it too, but recently I walked by his place of work and saw him smoking, he didn’t see me and I kept walking. When he got home I confronted him and at first he tried to deny it but eventually admitted that he had smoked but that it had only been today as he had a tough day at work. I was really upset but I forgave him and tried to be understanding, he promised me he would never do it again and I believed him.  Fast forward a month and his work is having an office party and I went with him. I’m don’t really know any of his co workers well buy one of the Sam (m34) struck up a conversation with me and it eventually got to the topic of smoking, and I found out he’s been smoking since college, he attended college with my boyfriend and that’s when he informed me that my boyfriend had also been smoking since college. I didn’t let it show but was very upset about it. I didn’t want to ruin the party for him so I didn’t mention it until we got home.  When I told him what Sam had told me he straight out admitted it and told me not to be dramatic. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic so I told him that he was just replacing one addiction with another, this really upset him as he doesn’t like to talk about his addiction and hates to admit it too. The argument got heated and I said something awful, I told him I didn’t want to waste my time dating someone who was going to die because of his addiction. He was understandably very hurt by this and told me I was being a bitch.  We decided to take a break in the relationship to calm down, this lasted for 2 weeks and he then contacted me to tell me he forgave me and that we should get back together but I disagreed. Over those two weeks I had come to the realization that I couldn’t stay in this relationship, he was never going to quit smoking and I was never going to be okay with it so I decided to end things permanently. He was very upset by this and thought I was being immature and selfish by putting a “pet peeve” above our relationship.    My friends and mother think I’m in the right with my decision but our mutual friends and his sister have told me that they agree with my ex boyfriend. So what do you think? Am I the asshole?	1642811649.0	s9pkel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pkel/aita_for_leaving_my_bf_for_smoking/	AITA for leaving my bf for smoking?
fbn6563o	I (20F) live with my room mate (21F) in a small apartment just minutes away from where we go collage. It's a small apartment with 2 bedrooms, 1 kitchen, a living room and a bathroom in each room. My room mate doesn't care about collage and her education. She's more of a party person who goes out almost every night. Her room is an absolute MESS. Her clothes are all over the floor, drink bottles are pilled in one corner and moulded food stuffed into a plastic bag which stunk up the place. She's lucky to have me to clean up for her, because I always make sure our apartment is nice, clean and smells good. We both have jobs and we both make a pretty good amount of money for a collage student, but she doesn't help with the bills, groceries and other important things. I'm not saying she has to use all her money to help out, but if she could just give half or even less to make things easier. It's usually me that pays for all  the important things for our home and for awhile now I've been fed up with it but I've never really spoken to her about it. Well 2 months ago our bill went up to almost $7,000. I knew it was my room mates fault and I knew she had crossed the line. So when she came home I yelled at her "Why is our bill $7,000!!!" and replied back calmly "Gosh idk it's not a big deal for me since ur paying it". I was about to explode. I walked away with anger. I went to my room and decided not to pay the bills or for anything else anymore. A week went by without paying the $7,000 and my room mate comes to me saying "Have you paid the bills yet?" I replied with "No." She glares at me as I walk away. 2 weeks go by and again she asks the same thing and I reply with the same thing. Then she snapped and screamed "Why aren't you paying the bills or anything??" I yelled back telling her everything she DOESN'T do and how I feel stressed about it. She ended up paying the bills and now she is completely BROKE. So am I the asshole?	1642811857.0	s9pmx6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pmx6/aita_for_making_my_room_mate_pay_all_the_bills/	AITA for making my room mate pay all the bills?
gomdhbr3	I'm renting one side of a large house. What I mean is, there's a wall that divides the house into 2. Both sides mirror each other but have their own bathroom and kitchen. We don't share anything except for the small space outside  before the main gate. So from the outside, you'll see two wooden gates connected on the left and right side, but when you enter its just one big space with a house that has 2 main doors.   Me (30F) and my fiance (37M) have been renting his place for more than a year. The other side has always been empty until just a month ago when the owners came home for a vacation. Ever since I moved in, I've been leaving food and water outside for the stray cats, and the owners didn't mind it since it kept the rats away.  Anyway, around 3 weeks ago, a ginger cat with beautiful orange/copper eyes starts chilling within our gate. He has a collar, but he was skinny and dirty. We checked around the area to see who owns this cat. I even posted on various pet groups and approached rescue teams to help us, but we couldn't find his owners. Now this cat was different from the strays. He was sweet to everyone, would prioritize pets and snuggles over food, and if anyone sat on the chair outside, he would jump on their lap and start making biscuits. Sadly, my fiance told me we can't take in anymore cats (we have 3).  The ginger car stays within the area almost 24/7, unlike the others who would only come to eat. Now, the owners who moved in, never cared for any of the cats. But when they saw how pretty this one was, they suddenly became interested. Suddenly every morning my dry food outside would disappear or I'd find it in front of their door instead. I thought it was rude that they would take my food and and containers (yes, they took every one I replaced) without asking me if they could. They would shoo away the strays by their door, and will try to persuade them to go to our door instead. But when the orange tabby waits by my door, they would try to take it and move it to them. Now they said they have no plans of adopting it, they just want it around because it looks pretty.   I tell my fiance that this cat doesn't belong in the streets and needs to be re-homed. I live in the province where some people would just run over cats, throw rocks at them, and poison them. Considering how friendly this cat is, I'm afraid he'll get into trouble easily. I call my cousin who has had a cat before, and I fully trust him with caring for pets. I plan on taking the cat late at night and bringing him to my cousin. My fiance doesn't like the idea because he says that if I do that, we won't the cat everyday anymore, the neighbor/owner will have their suspicions, and that I'm being paranoid that something bad will happen to him outdoors.

ivxz1i9u	I f18 has a 9-month-old with my fling named Xavier who's 19. We met at a college party and even though I knew he was drunk I slept with him anyway. When I found out I was pregnant I first told my parents and when though we can't really care for a newborn they said this was my choice and they would support me. I ended up keeping it because I felt attached to my baby already and I told him. He was not present my whole pregnancy except to ask what the gender was. When I needed support because I was in pain he wasn't there and he would leave me on read. Since I didn't feel comfortable around him and he didn't help me during this painful pregnancy I told him my mother would be in the delivery room and he just sent me a thumbs-up emoji. I was in labor for 12 hours and he never once checked up on me and he only texted me a week later saying he wanted to get custody arrangements as soon as possible. So we went to court 2 weeks later and now we switch weeks. I wasn't happy about this because I wanted my daughter to only drink breastmilk, not formula. There were times I asked him for some money for our child since he came from a wealthy background but he would shut me down and tell me that if I didn't have money for our baby I should give him full custody even though I work all day every day. There have been times he would block me when I asked to hang out because I wanted to see him outside of him getting our baby and now he only texts updates to my mother. So when our baby was 6 months old I straight up told him that it was his job to make sure his baby mother was okay since I bought her into this world and he straight up laughed and said he hated me and his only priority was his daughter and he would never want to be friends with someone like me. I feel that once you get someone pregnant you should make sure they are mentally stable if they are around your kid.

ivy4k8qi	I (21F) got caught between two of my closest friends having an argument a couple nights ago.  Let's call them B (20M) and H (23M).  Things between the two of them have been tense for a while since B felt ostracized from the group after another friend was added to our group chat without consulting him.  He had been talking about this with me a couple hours before this happened.  Things came to a head last night when the two of them began fighting in what I had assumed was a joking matter about who would "top" who (B is gay).  I made an ill-timed joke that emasculated H, talking about how he had lost a similar argument with another friend in the group (21F) earlier in the evening and thus had no ground to stand on.  H quickly left the group and blocked both myself and B on Discord.  It was a poorly timed joke and I immediately deleted it from the chat once I realized that I had overstepped.  I tried to reach out to apologize to H over Instagram and was met with H explaining that the argument had majorly triggered some trauma in regards to childhood SA.  Knowing that, I obviously didn't blame H for what had previously seemed like an overreaction and apologized for how I'd made him feel, promising that I wasn't going to make him return to the group if he didn't want to work things out with B, but that I still wanted to be there for him.  I figured that he just needed time to cool off and would unblock me in the morning when he was a little calmer but I am still blocked.  The whole situation has me feeling super ill and unable to sleep, plus gaming with H has been a massively necessary distraction from some issues in my own life recently, so I really want to mend things to the best of my ability sooner rather than later.  I don't want to be overbearing though, especially if H no longer wants me in his life.  Would I be the asshole if I reached out again in a week or so to apologize a second time after I apologized already or will a second apology help prove that I actually feel bad about what happened?	1642811901.0	s9pnga	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pnga/wibta_if_i_reached_out_to_apologize/	WIBTA if I reached out to apologize?

ivzjzq1j	I'm a mother of 3. And my oldest son is 17. He's always been active in sports and "manly" stuff. When he was in the bathroom taking a shower, I decided to snoop on his phone to make sure he wasn't getting into trouble, etc. Well, when I looked through his messages he was in a groupchat with his "bros" saying offensive remarks about women. In the groupchat, there was pictures of women in skimpy clothing and talking about doing her and stuff. It was a very "bro" conversation, and it was kind of sexist I thought. It represented the perfect example of toxic masculinity. I didn't raise him to be like this and engaged with this kind of behavior. So, I put the phone down and came up with a plan. I was going to feed my son soy related food in an attempt to lower his testosterone so he doesn't get into any trouble with women, and actually respect them. I started this the next day, and when he noticed he was suddenly eating soy related food, he jokingly accused me of trying to make him into a girl or something. Then, he could tell by my facial expression that I was up to something. Admittedly, I don't have a good poker face. He gets up all in my face and we get into an argument about toxic masculinity. He claims it was only jokes in that groupchat that I've mentioned and that I'm overreacting. He messaged his dad (we're divorced) about this incident and he tells me how terrible of a mother I am. My son now wants to stay with his dad for some time after I apologize. I haven't apologized yet and I'm wondering if I should to? Am I at fault here.

ivjimjxd	I have an overbearing mom who tries to micromanage my life (as recently as a couple months ago, she was trying to tell me that I *have to* get cosmetic surgery for my private parts).   As someone with anxiety, I strongly believe she has anxiety or OCD (and worse than me) but is in denial (she keeps saying psychologists and a bunch of quacks). There is always catastrophising and blowing everything way out of proportion - there is no detail too small for her to obsess about and remember/bring up forever.  When I came out to her, she tried to get me to see a priest and she would constantly ask me if I was still having my "little problem". She also made me promise that I would keep my religion (even though I was an atheist even then). A little bit later I told her I wanted to move out and she emotionally blackmailed me into staying.   Anyway, fast forward, after losing my job and experiencing depression, I managed to escape and move abroad and my life has dramatically improved and I feel like I'm just now starting to heal from the mental problems I got from growing up with her.   I have met many people for whom moving out and/or abroad is no issue with their families but for some reason, it's SUCH a drama with mine and I constantly feel guilty for even being here.   And now that I am an adult and not living at home, she has a lot less control over and info about my life (intentional). She wants me to move back and be an obedient little straight Christian boy that she can control but I cannot go back to that prison.   Anyway, she is visiting and I am feeling very anxious. I watched that Sarah Paulson movie "Run" and I am like.....is she gonna drug my food? Is she gonna tie me up in my sleep? Jokes aside (half joking...), I am just worried about if she is going to pull a stunt or somehow emotionally manipulate me into agreeing to come home or make me feel bad about being here or some other way to jeopardise my life here.   She's coming for 4 weeks (!!!) and she wants me to stay with her which - with work from home - means I will be spending every waking moment with her (she is not the type to go off and do her own thing). She told me with no hyperbole to buy another freezer for all the food she's going to cook for me, despite me telling her not to cook for me.   I mean I obviously will spend time with her but WIBTA for not staying with her?  tl;dr: WIBTA for not staying with my overbearing micromanaging mom who wants me to be straight and compliant and Christian and who is the cause of my mental issues when she visits?	1642812452.0	s9pue6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pue6/wibta_for_not_staying_with_my_mom_when_she_visits/	WIBTA for not staying with my mom when she visits?
ivzofn2p	I work in a shop, and I am often rotad in for shifts with about 10 hours in-between (it is law in UK to give 12 hours unless asking). Other members of staff are sometimes required to do this, especially those higher up. I have asked in the past not to get these horrible shifts as I struggle to sleep as it is, and being given 10 hours to commute, eat, relax and sleep is just not enough.

imhdt55v	I live with my mom. She just pisses me off. She won't get vaccinated. She keeps saying they don't work. She also goes out to parties all the time with her friends. None of them are vaccinated. None of them wear masks, or socially distance. There are so many people like that in the world prolonging this pandemic and it just pisses me off. I was home alone and all the anger built up until I went in a rage. My mom bought a special faucet for the kitchen sink where you just touch it and it activates. I was so mad that I ripped the whole thing out of the sink. I feel like she deserved it for being so selfish. AITA?

em7lz6ei	I’ll try to summarize this as best as I can, but it may still be long.  For context, I am a freshman in high school.  It has been a particularly difficult year, as we had just switched out of distance learning.  My mom died when I was nine, and I was hospitalized at Bradley for my OCD and anxiety issues for the entire summer.  Got made fun of for both of those things.  I could understand the kids teasing me about the OCD more than I could understand about the other (for obvious reasons).  It had been going on for a while now, and I was getting pissed.  Now, keep in mind, I had told them to screw off several times but they kept coming up to me whenever they had the chance.  There was one girl in particular, who made jokes about my dead mom.  I hated her.  Fortunately, she got kicked out of my class because we were in the AP math program and she didn’t have high enough exam scores.  Her bitchy friend, on the other hand, is very much still in my class.  She’s almost worse than the other.  Thanks to her, I got made fun of because she spread rumors about how much I liked my crush and the “weird things” I’d say.  This has been going on for two months now continuously.  Today, we had to write a short essay in ELA class about what our lives would be like as a main character in a movie.  I’ll cut to the chase.  I wrote in my story that it’d be an action and drama film about school shooters.  Those school shooters were the kids that teased me, although I didn’t use their real names.  The story was about certain classmates bringing in firearms to school, and I stabbed and killed one as they were holding a gun to a fellow classmate.  In my mind, I already knew that this would be a bad idea because like everyone knew who bullied me in class.  Since I had explained in the story that it was my bullies that I had killed after they tried killing a classmate, it was “threatening my class”.  I’m very upset about this, and how schools just take action when something has the word “kill” in it, but when someone’s getting actively made fun of, they say “kids will be kids”.  What do you think, AITA?	1642813091.0	s9q20y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9q20y/aita_for_threatening_my_classmates/	AITA For Threatening My Classmates?
gxws8b2e	 I am 22M was working abroad for a few month , and while i was there i got my gf 22F a new iPhone as her old was too old and she couldn’t make calls on it nor hear any one , and also her sister wanted to get an apple watch for her fiancé. Now keep in mind those weren’t gifts nor payed by me ,but i urged her to get a new one as hers couldn’t even hear who was talking.   She was reluctant at first to get a new phone due to its price , but it was way cheaper where i was traveling so she agreed eventually. We agreed she was to pay but as she was switching jobs and short on cash , I wasn’t in a hurry that much and i agreed to take the payment when she gets payed from her new job in late January, bear in mind i got the phone in November.   As for her sister she wanted an Apple Watch for her fiancé and she was to pay me when i got back. I told them the specs of watch and the size of the watch, price and i got confirmation to buy. I went ahead and bought both, from my own money that i saved.  Here is where i hate it , this sparked a series of fights , and i despise any fights regarding material things between loved ones. My GF is the panicky type , she over thinks it and sparks fights due to that. After i bought the watch , she wanted to return it as her sister changed her mind and she wasn’t sure about it , at the time that was not possible due to 14 day period return policy ended. she said i was not paying attention and telling her false prices and she didnt agree to that , i had to go over alot of chat to get screenshots that she agreed to the exact pricing.   i got back home , we were excited to see each other, i met her and gave her sister the watch, we went out and at the end of the night , gave her the phone, clothes she bought from there along with the things she always wanted but said later due to her money problem , so i bought them from my own money (she wanted simple things like a mini waffle maker , a purse etc) and it was a lovely night.   I was genuinely happy she has new phone which she can enjoy and actually hear her on. She gave money for the clothes she bought and asked me if she can pay when she gets payed from her new job as mentioned above. I agreed. However , during that night her sister kept interrupting our date because the watch wouldn’t fit her fiancé hand (even though she agreed on the size and i confirmed that with them) and she didn’t want to pay.   I told my gf that wasn’t my problem and i did confirm the size with you guys. Now i needed that money cause i didn’t have that much cash flow until i got back abroad. She put the watch for sale and i told her i can wait abit. That was in early December.

ivz6ldy5	 So I’m 23 and I live with my parents. I work part time and I’m a student so it’s not like I’m a bum. I struggle with really bad depression and one aspect of it is I have very low motivation to cook or even put a meal together. I actually really enjoyed cooking as a kid/teen but around the time I turned 17/18 that all stopped. Because of this my eating habits are very odd. I either just eat snacks throughout the day or I order takeout occasionally. My parents are both on Keto and have all these restrictions so we never eat meals together.   My parents, particularly my mom spend a lot of time chastising me for not eating properly. I know I eat like shit. I don’t want to be like this. I’m on a lot of meds and have attended therapy on and off for years. For now, it’s not getting better and their constant nagging doesn’t help. They never offer to cook with me or make me food so it just seems like chastising me for the sake of chastising me instead of genuine concern. My mom can be kinda bitchy and picks on me a lot, especially when it comes to my mental health or my appearance.  I could go on and on about that but that’s not the point of the question.   Yesterday I was at home working on an assignment in my bedroom and my mom randomly came up to tell me she was cooking this traditional dish, lets call it dish A, and asked me if I wanted some. It’s one of my favourite dishes so I said sure. About an hour later she calls me saying food is ready. Eventually I come down and see that she did not make dish A, but dish B. Dish B is a dish that I’ve always hated. My parents love it but all my siblings hate it too. I’ve literally never eaten it in my life. It just makes me sick. My parents know this so I was shocked. So I said, maybe a bit rudely, “Why did you make this, you told me you were making dish A”  My mom: This is what I said I was making  Me: It definitely isn’t. You know I don’t eat this,   My mom: Okay I changed my mind.  Me: But you know I hate dish B. I’m not even a picky eater this is like the one food I hate.   My mom: Why are you being so ungrateful? You should cook for yourself.   I just leave the room because I was confused since she was the one who offered to cook for me. She does calls after me but I ignore her and continue with the work I was doing. I was a bit annoyed and didn’t feel like talking. About an hour later she tries to engage me in conversation and we get in an argument about how much my eating habits suck and “maybe if I ate properly my mental health would improve”, and how I should cook my own food and how ungrateful I am. The whole thing was a bit mentally draining to be honest. I don’t ask or expect them to cook me anything. Sure I was happy she offered to make my favourite dish but I don’t really understand what she was trying to do in this situation.

7eef0u5e	So tonight is cold, almost zero degrees. I went to the gas station and filled up, and I see this car pull in like two pumps over from me.   Before I could even shut the door of my car, I hear "Excuse me?" and its the guy who literally just pulled in like 5 seconds ago. It's a slender dude prob like 60 years old with like long white hair and a long white beard and he said "Could you get in the front seat of my car and help me open something?" and I'm like "Pardon me?" and he's like "Its right next to my steering wheel, could you get in and help me quick?" and I replied "I'm sorry I can't do that" and I pulled away.   It's just a not trusting people thing for me. If it was genuine, my thinking is that he wanted me to click the button of his gas cap while he tried to pry it open, but I don't want to get in his car.   If he asked me to pry it open while he went in the car, I might've. But I don't wanna get in a stranger's car ever, especially on a cold night.

167x2t	I (f39) work in an office with two other coworkers in my department. A new coworker (f45) started early last year. Last year she took a lot of time off for numerous doctors appointments and children. This didn’t bother me until she took a week off during Thanksgiving and then another week out to go on a family ski trip during Christmas. The Christmas ski trip was actually canceled and I only found out because her husband stopped by the office the day before they were to leave. I then asked her if she was still planning to take the time off since they were no longer going out of town and she said, “Well of course. It got approved.”  Our boss (f45) had been fairly lenient about time off since she had taken close to six weeks off over the summer. I admit I was kinda salty about the Christmas time off she took since it doubled my workload during a busy time in our office.   I’m paid salary but I’ve always made a habit of keeping a personal timesheet. At the beginning of the new year I started a new timesheet and included a coding system (no names) that also kept track of the days my other two coworkers are out of the office. Note: this info is also available in a shared calendar.  This week my coworker approached me to say she glanced over my shoulder when I had my timesheet open and noticed I was tracking her. She demanded a reason why I would be doing that and said it was “inappropriate” and “none of my business”. I told her it was not personal against her but more to keep myself accountable. I empathized with her and understood why she would be upset without realizing what she was looking at or talking to me. I apologized if it offended her. I assured her I would not continue to put the info in my timesheet.  Now unless this woman received superhuman eyesight overnight there’s no way she could’ve glanced at my timesheet in the short amount of time I would’ve had it open and been able to figure out the coding. She has access to my computer to complete certain tasks specific to my computer and I was out with a virus a couple days last week, so I speculate she opened the file while I was gone.  During this conversation I brought up the fact that my timesheet is private and I didn’t appreciate her looking at it. She’s familiar with the file since I shown her before. She abruptly interrupted me and said “You always try to flip things around on me. I don’t know if it’s your personality or what, but now you’re trying to make ME feel bad. You never own up when you’re wrong. This conversation is over”  This upset me very much since I’ve never had someone give me that feedback and I always own my portion if not all of the problems we’ve ever had just to de-escalate the issue. This time it tipped me over the edge and I felt like she was gaslighting me because the conversation wasn’t going the way she intended.   Now I’m having a hard time being around her since I see her as volatile and manipulative.

99jv58pp	So I (32 year old male) work for my family business with 18 total employees including me.  At the beginning of 2021, there was about 250k in savings in the business bank accounts.  My mom (63) runs the finances.  My dad volunteers in the business and pulls no salary but works about 30-40 hour weeks like the rest of us.  So my Dad (76) checked the non-business related bank accounts and there was 50k pulled out on a home equity loan.  After discussing this with my mom and dad, it was determined that my mom gave my brother and sister in law 110k to go toward their new home in December.    There is only about 28k in the business account after this 50k loan is being paid back this month.  The rest of the 250k was spent by my mom on remodels, gifting both my brother and I 60k over 12 months and on other expenses that she would not easily identify like bonuses, pay increases, etc.  The point that bugs me is that we are told that the business brings a 20k profit after taxes, every month.  This 250k was confirmed to be there at the beginning of 2021 as the PPP we applied for was forgiven.  She showed up the bank accounts.    I called my brother and let him know as an FYI that our dad is pissed that the business has no savings right now.  He ended the call by stating that I don't need to worry about what my mom does with her money and need to stay out of the money involved between my parents as they are both owners in the business; he ended the call with something along the lines of "it is not your money and my pizza is done in the oven, bye".  Note, that they have told me I am their exit strategy and will inherit it after they die.  My brother knows this.    The biggest concern I have with him getting this gift and treating my concern like he did is their income.  He makes about 94k and his wife is a CPA that is grossing at least 70k.  This is way more than what I make as their gift more than doubled my salary last year.  **So... am I an asshole for letting him know that my dad is pissed about being left out of the decision on gifting him 110k?**  He sure thought I was but I thought I was giving him a  head's up...  I didn't even go into why the \*\*\*\* did you accept that gift from her.  That's another can of worms and a bridge may be burned by bringing it up.    Bonus question...  **Should I be involved in the finances of the business if I am expected to take it over within 5-8 years?**  My brother flat out told me leave them alone with their money.  I think I should be involved but my mom is secretive like she's hiding skeletons in a closet and won't show either me or my dad the books.	1642814519.0	s9qjeh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9qjeh/aita_for_letting_my_brother_know_my_dad_is_pissed/	AITA for Letting my Brother Know my Dad is Pissed about the Family Business having No Money because of Him Getting a Gift
1arjae5i	The Rona situation where I am has only just reached the point of “living with it” approach. That aside, I understand how difficult it is to run a business during this time. HOWEVER:  I have been feeling chronically Ill since Dec last year and also suffer from severe carpal tunnel, and it’s only been getting worse (impacting my grip and coordination and other debilitating physical symptoms such as chronic nausea and dizziness) I work in a demanding industry where your well-being and countenance really matters so if you’re sick and others can tell it’s not a good look. Recently I took two days off to rest and my manager took the liberty of calling me up and saying she was “disappointed in me and hoped for more” “everyone gets sick but sometimes you have to push through it” and other dismissive comments.   On top of this I suffer from High functioning Anxiety. My boss started misleading me by saying things like “take a week off if you need it, if rather you be 100% at work or don’t come at all” when I went to confirm the date I could return to work, she backtracked and questioned “I’m confused. Are you really telling me you need a week off? You’re taking the piss. I only meant it as an expression.”   I feel horrible as it is for not being able to work. I really do. But making me feel bad for a circumstance that is out of my control is not on. When I’m at work , I can say with confidence that I do my job at 200%, hell I carried them through our busy season after lockdown last year. She then said “I’m not sure if this industry is for you, would reconsider your position with us given your condition”   And I did . For the sake of my mental and physical health I decided to step down.   You can already imagine what happened next, they stared to berate me and say demeaning comments like “I’ve never seen so much wasted potential anymore, im so disappointed in you blah blah.   I didn’t even bother doing the notice period because I’m not about to endure two whole weeks of more gaslighting and being put down.   At the end of the day I know it’s a rough time for them too and that staff is short right now but this treatment is not how you treat a staff member when you are in need of them desperately.

64zctpum	This is about subtle signs. So bare with me  Ideally I'd write "Am I being unfair/paranoid  My girlfriend likes to make me jealous, likes to 'play' with me, likes to provoke reactions. If she says something offensive she'll tell me she's joking. Fine. She expects things of me that I'm not able to expect of her. Here's a recent argument that sumarises all of this:  She was coming to visit my place for the first time. She lives 4 hours from me. When I visited her for the first time I asked her to meet me at a nearer station. She said no. This was fine, it happened a few times - nothing to worry about.   With her visiting I said that I wouldn't meet her at a nearer place. It seemed fair.  This was during a normal phone call, but the call started to break down after I said this. We ended the call, and because the difference between jokes and serious arguments is vague I assumed this was her sense of humour.   She messaged me:  Fuck you  You piece of shit  She says things like this as a joke, and I get that. I assumed this was a joke. She had previously spoken about how she likes to test boundaries and provoke reactions. This time I refused to provide a reaction.  She upped the ante. She phoned me. The first thing she said was 'I don't like you'. I asked if this was a joke, and she said "no, I've realised that I don't like you". (She would later say 'but I love you').  She said I made her sad. The conversation became an argument. She said that she spoke to 'the guy at the coffee shop', who she previously used as a way to make me jealous (there was this new person at the coffee shop; he was extremely attractive).  This provoked a reaction. Eventually she said it was a joke. Or a half joke. This was a 'joke' during an emotionally heated conversation. She admitted it was 'inappropriate'. She later implied that the argument was a joke. Whilst I was trying to understand her she was making jokes at my expense.  She was expecting to catch the train to my place the following day. The next morning I mentioned what happened. She said that its because of a language barrier (her native language is chinese) that I don't understand. I said that implying that she was cheating to provoke a reaction wasn't funny - she said I just don't get it.   I deliberately did not give her a reaction; it escalated until she simulated an argument.  She then cancelled the ticket 'so that we could have some time to think about it'.  This evening I was hoping to invite her to my place. Things had calmed down. But she told me that she hadn't cancelled the tickets, just one of them, the return ticket. Even though she sent a screenshot of a ticket cancellation, and said 'now we have more time to think about it', she never cancelled the trip.   She gave a false impression of doing something, during her explanation of why I was wrong for feeling manipulated.  She said that she didn't trick me. It was my fault for not reading into the details.  Nothing like this would be tolerated rom me.   Should I be worried?	1642813566.0	s9q82h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9q82h/aita_or_is_she_manipulative/	AITA - Or is she manipulative?

ivykuial	A year and a bit ago my wife and I bought a unit in a four unit building. It's fairly new and well constructed so even though we walls with the side and back units we never hear them and up until a few months ago hadn't had any problems with them. We know the families in the other three units rent as we have a small condo board where we and the other unit owners get together once every few months to talk about property matters etc.,  Well the new tenants of one of the owners have been a big issue. The wife and kids have seemed nice enough and we actually rarely have ever seen them, but the guy is a problem. He broke the fence by driving into it at 2am. They often have parties and people will wander into our yard and up to our door in the middle of the night and try to come in, they also leave our gate open which is dangerous for two our dogs. Other things too but char limit. We have spoken to him directly many times about these things but it's just made him worse and vindictive.  A few weeks back his landlord called us and apparently his tenant has been complaining about us with things that are completely untrue. He told his landlord that our dogs bark night and day, my wife and I both work from home and they absolutely do not. They only bark when his drunk friends try and open our door or ring the doorbell.  He said we leave dirty diapers and trash in our yard, we don't have a kid (we are expecting in 4 months so we had some kid stuff out front but no dirty diapers yet!) and we keep our yard tidy. We pick up the dog poop every other day as well.   There was some other stuff as well.  We didn't want to be snitches but hearing that really pissed me off so we defended ourselves and also mentioned the issues we had with his tenant and how everytime we had spoken to him about them, he never brought up anything with us. It felt like he thought we were also tenants and was trying to get us in trouble so I didn't feel bad about defending ourselves and clearing the air.  Well this week the landlord called back and said he was thinking of selling his unit because he didn't want to pay a property manager anymore or deal with problem tenants. We have a friend who has expressed interest in owning one of the units multiple times so we told him such and he said he'd be in touch. It seems like that's going to move forward and obviously we are excited!  When we were telling my brother about the situation he said we were assholes and that homeownership has made us callous and now we're getting a family kicked out because we held more power than them as owners. He implied we're out of touch and put a family in a dire situation right after the holidays because we are "bougie" and couldn't handle people having fun.   A couple of other friends said we could have defended ourselves without getting the family evicted too or tried harder with them before talking to their landlord. I felt justified but now I'm feeling conflicted... Are we the AH's?	1642815166.0	s9qqy5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9qqy5/aita_for_getting_a_family_evicted/	AITA for getting a family evicted?

But this morning I go to brush my teeth and she left her razor in the the toothbrush holder alongside both our toothbrushes. This personally grossed me out but I calmly walked to the office and asked her to please not do that. She looked at me oddly and asked why not. I said I just didn’t want a razor that you shave your body hair with next to the thing that I brush my teeth with. Was I just making a big deal over nothing?

8m82fbq6	I (F17) am now a senior in high school.  Last school year, my mental health was pretty low and I didn’t know who to talk to.  I used to try to talk to my parents about my feelings and mental health, but I never felt like they really listened to me.  My boyfriend suggested I try talking to my school counsellor (M40s).  I was hesitant at first, barely opening up the first time I talked to him.  But slowly, I started talking to him more, first just about school related things, but then opening more about my mental health.  Now, it’s been about a year since I first started talking to him and I’m very close with him.  I talk to him weekly about school stuff, mental health, and just my life in general.  For example, today I told him how I just bought my first car and he told me that he’s extremely proud of me.  After I told this to one of my friends (F17), they said it was strange because he’s basically “some random man” and it’s just weird because he’s 40 something years old.  I told her that a lot of it is because I have had issues with talking to my parents in the past.  She called me an AH for choosing to talk to my school counsellor over my parents.

5mkbsszm	The elevator of the hotel I’m staying at apparently broke down so everyone is using the exit stairs to go up and down the 4 floors.  The stairs are old, narrow, have about 6 steps per flight, and have small super narrow/shallow landings at the switchback between each of the larger floor landings.  So here I am, just checked in and loaded up with all my overstuffed bags. Laptop bag, carry-on, and a large duffel/carpet bag. I’m a full on weary traveler mess — frizzy hair, no make up, dowdy outfit, mismatched bags.  I waddled over to the door to the stairwell, and after awkwardly hip-checking the door open, wedged my way in and started climbing, thankful that no one was on the first flight.   But then the mirror at the first landing showed a few people coming down from the second floor landing who were already heading down the stairs. At this point I’m already on the first landing and I’m angled to go up the next flight. The couple and the people behind them don’t stop of course but the girl anxiously looked over her shoulder and then apologized as she went past me. I went to take a step up the next flight but stopped as the rest of the group with them came barreling around the corner. I had already stepped back to make way for the couple and the few behind them. When I saw the additional people and tried to step back again, there was no where for me to go because the people that passed me were now right behind me.  No one in the group was even shifting to try and let me pass or move out of the way. I started to panic as I stood there precariously grasping at my bags and the wall so no one would bump me and I wouldn’t lose my balance.  I waited, but started losing my hold on my bags after 10+ adults and 3+ kids passed me. They just kept coming so when I saw a small break in the group I said excuse me and started climbing.  I new it was a gamble but figured 6 steps gets me out of everyone’s way and the next landing is waaaay bigger so even if I can’t get to my floor I at least wouldn’t pummel someone if I lost my grip on my bags.  I figured the person next in line in the group would likely recognize that this was the logical and socially appropriate thing to do.  But the people above the break didn’t stop on the landing, didn’t even bother to make space.  As I climbed I shifted as far to the side as I could but another kid in the group stepped wide right in front of me and when I tried to avoid her one of my bags fell off my shoulder and I almost fell back.  I apologized as I rebalanced and dragged the dangling bag up after me as I finished climbing and rounded my way on to the corner of the larger landing.  I few people were glaring at me, and I heard one person ask “are you okay?”  Me being the moron I am looks up briefly and says, “no I’m fine.” More glaring so I head around the curve of the group to go on to the second floor. As the line of people finally ends I hear the little girl down the stairwell say “I’m ok but her bag got my arm.” To which a guy said “oh I’m sorry honey did her bag scratch you at all?”  And now I feel like a bitch.

b0ghhaj0	 I'm 19, I work in a mall and I've always liked the most correct things possible, I started dating this girl when I was 13, she was 15. she seemed to be extremely mature and all. I had a troubled family, divorced parents, a mother who appeared to be mentally ill. One day I asked T(Ex) to ask her mother to date her (something common in Christian families in Brazil, not sure if it's like that in the US too) her mother told me to leave screaming, not wanting to to see. It turned out that my family became kind of like my ex's family, my mother treated her like a daughter. giving gifts, financial aid and all that. it happened that she turned out to be Extremely toxic, stopped talking to all her friends, and questioned the fact that I had friends, always saying that she stopped talking to everyone in her life because of me, (AND I NEVER ASKED HER, ONCE I WAS UPSET BECAUSE SHE SLEEPED AT A FRIEND'S (MALE) HOUSE,AND ASKED HER TO NOT DO IT AGAIN, THIS GENERATES DISCOMFORT IN ANYONE) anyway, between comings and goings, we ended our relationship and got back together 6 times in 2021 she broke up with me by Whatsapp while I was working. Since then I've protected myself and met a fantastic woman, my age, who loves the fact that I'm in a good mood and have friends. but I feel extremely uncomfortable that my mother keeps friends with my ex, my ex is always stalking me, talking about me to my mother and all that shit. my mom says their friendship goes beyond our old relationship. anyway, am I an asshole for not wanting her involved with my mother?	1642815773.0	s9qxwn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9qxwn/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_to_remain_friendship/	AITA FOR NOT WANTING MY MOM TO REMAIN FRIENDSHIP WITH MY EX?
3wa6eczd	i’ve been an avid fan of aot for around 5 years now. it’s definitely in my top 10. my boyfriend knows this. he’s seen the first 3 seasons. when we first got together he told me that he was a man of his word and for the past 2 years this has been true. no matter what he’d always follow though with what he said he would. ever since the final season came out i’ve been asking him to watch it with me and i’d always be dismissed with “i’ll watch it when it’s all out” and i’ve left it at that. last week when we were hanging out i asked him again if he’d start the 4th season with me. to my surprise he said yes this time. i’ve had a very bad week and was looking forward to watching it with him. earlier this evening i asked him if he wanted to start watching it today or wait until tomorrow. he told me he didnt want to watch it at all and i got pretty upset. i told him that he said he would this weekend and he said that he wasn’t going to. this made me even more upset. i called him a dick for not honoring his word and he said i was completely over reacting before i stormed out of the room. so, aita for getting mad at my boyfriend for not watching aot with me?	1642816030.0	s9r0q8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9r0q8/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_not/	AITA for getting mad at my boyfriend for not watching attack on titan with me?

ivzc131s	Okay so I (f20) and my ex boyfriend (m29) have been dating for 3 years and we’ve had a healthy and happy relationship thus far. When I was 12 my father died of lung cancer after many years of smoking, my aunt and grandmother also died of lung cancer so i am very anti smoking and anyone who knows me knows this.   My boyfriend knows how much I hate smoking and has always agreed that it’s an awful, disgusting addiction. He has co workers that smoke, so when he comes home he’ll smell like cigarettes after spending lunch with them.  I’ve never suspected him of smoking because he knows how much I hate it and he himself has said he hates it too, but recently I walked by his place of work and saw him smoking, he didn’t see me and I kept walking. When he got home I confronted him and at first he tried to deny it but eventually admitted that he had smoked but that it had only been today as he had a tough day at work. I was really upset but I forgave him and tried to be understanding, he promised me he would never do it again and I believed him.  Fast forward a month and his work is having an office party and I went with him. I’m don’t really know any of his co workers well buy one of the Sam (m34) struck up a conversation with me and it eventually got to the topic of smoking, and I found out he’s been smoking since college, he attended college with my boyfriend and that’s when he informed me that my boyfriend had also been smoking since college. I didn’t let it show but was very upset about it. I didn’t want to ruin the party for him so I didn’t mention it until we got home.  When I told him what Sam had told me he straight out admitted it and told me not to be dramatic. My boyfriend is a recovering alcoholic so I told him that he was just replacing one addiction with another, this really upset him as he doesn’t like to talk about his addiction and hates to admit it too. The argument got heated and I said something awful, I told him I didn’t want to waste my time dating someone who was going to die because of his addiction. He was understandably very hurt by this and told me I was being a bitch.  We decided to take a break in the relationship to calm down, this lasted for 2 weeks and he then contacted me to tell me he forgave me and that we should get back together but I disagreed. Over those two weeks I had come to the realization that I couldn’t stay in this relationship, he was never going to quit smoking and I was never going to be okay with it so I decided to end things permanently. He was very upset by this and thought I was being immature and selfish by putting a “pet peeve” above our relationship.    My friends and mother think I’m in the right with my decision but our mutual friends and his sister have told me that they agree with my ex boyfriend. So what do you think? Am I the asshole?	1642817000.0	s9rc7u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rc7u/aita_for_ending_it_with_my_bf_for_smoking/	AITA for ending it with my bf for smoking

hx5r4en9	My(28M) husband and I(27F) have been married for 8years now, almost the same time I’ve known my best friend(27F)we all used to work together so that’s how we all met, since then, the three of us go out a lot, clubs,bars, parties, you name it, she spends the night over since I obviously don’t want her driving intoxicated. It became a regular normal routine on weekends, we go out, get drunk and back to my place, recently, I’ve felt like they’ve been a little comfortable with each other, my husband is friendly, so I kinda just brushed it off. One Sunday, the three of us went over my moms house, my dad mentioned to me he saw them whispering to each other, I didn’t confront him or accused him, I simply mentioned it and asked him what it was all about, he said he simply asked her if her babysitter called her to pick up her kids yet, when I asked her, her response was the same. I feel like I’m overthinking this too much, I’ve known her for a long time, I don’t ever think she would do anything like this to me,  I personally think if that was the case, it would’ve happened already but why am I feeling like this now?

ggjlgmyo	i (22f) live in a very large house that splits into apartments that are also rented by a married couple (30+ M&F). i rent the front of the house and the front door/front porch is my access to the house. the driveway is on their side of the house and that’s where their door entry is. i park on the other side of the house on the street since we live on a corner. when amazon comes to deliver a package, they pull into their driveway right next to their door and then walk their packages up front to my door. when i moved in over a year ago, i was getting their packages on my doorstep almost daily. i mean DAILY they are ordering things off amazon. because of covid, i hadn’t met them and felt obligated to walk their packages back to their door step every time. once spring came around, i was outside and finally met them, they seemed like a very nice couple. i figured since we had met, if this were to happen again the following winter, they’d feel okay coming to grab their own packages. the thing is, it’s happened even more this winter. several times a week their amazon packages are left on my small porch and they expect me to bring them back. i’ll add that i live in new england and the past few winters have been awful and extremely icy. i work from home and barely leave the house, so in my mind why should i be delivering their packages to them every day if i’m not even leaving? these packages are all from amazon which means i know they’re receiving a delivery photo and they can also edit their delivery instructions to state that their apartment is the one at the driveway. if this happened once in a while, i really wouldn’t mind walking them over. but this is constant. like easily 100+ packages. not to mention they have a dog which they walk daily and walk right past my porch. why aren’t they getting their packages? why is it expected that i walk every single one back to their door when it’s near negative degrees outside and i don’t even need to go anywhere.  i’ve decided to leave the three packages from two days ago on my porch to see if they’ll get them or wait until i bring them back.  1: because it’s been maximum of a solid 5°F all week and 2: i’m kind of done with this  i have really bad social anxiety and i don’t know how i’d go about asking them to change their instructions to make it clear that their door is the one in the driveway. am i being ridiculous or petty?

iw1yt6c5	My dad's fiancee is an educator, so she gets off work right around the time me and my brother get out of school.  My brother was unlocking the door to our house when I heard someone walking up to the door behind me, and I screamed.  I asked her what the hell she was doing at our house when our dad wasn't home, and she said that our dad had sent her there to watch over us.  I told her that we were older teens and that we could be left at home alone and that we'd done so for years and she just shrugged and said our dad sent her there.  She does really annoying things, like try to hug me and ruffle my hair and ask how my day was and yelling at me to do homework and taking away my phone when I get distracted.  I guess one plus is that she makes snacks for us, but other than that, it's all negative.  When I let slip that I had a huge Spanish test one day, she literally made me sit down and study grammar and vocabulary for hours even though I already speak Spanish fluently because I had a B+ in the class and she teaches Spanish and psychology.  And generally, when my brother and I do homework, she sits next to us, grades papers, and watches us like a hawk.  I asked my dad again today why he made his girlfriend babysit us and if he pays her to do it and he said that we need an adult to watch over us and that she doesn't get paid.  Literally how does she even agree to this arrangement of babysitting kids at school and then doing it for free again after work?	1642817688.0	s9rk4n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rk4n/aita_for_asking_my_dad_why_he_makes_people_work/	AITA for asking my dad why he makes people work for free?
10hkyi	Hi, for context I (20M) have 3 other roommates. We live in an off-campus apartment near our college. My three roommates are D (20M), H, and M. H&M are dating, and are a year younger than me and D (they are 19M & F). We decided to live together last year after knowing them for a month or so, and were best friends with them. Since last August, they have ignored us, been dirty both in their room and in public spaces, to the point where the smell carried down the hall. So, me and D don't like them at all.  Just a few hours ago, we got a text from H saying: "I'm in the car outside and just tested positive for COVID. I want to come inside and will quarantine in my room. My boyfriend tested negative so he \*must\* be fine, just letting you know!"   Immediately, D and I asked them if they could get a hotel for a few days until they are cleared by the CDC. We asked why they took their tests at the end of their car trip instead of the beginning, and why M is cleared in their eyes. They became combative, and said we had a double standard since I was sick last semester and didn't quarantine (I had pneumonia, where I stayed in my room \*upstairs\* and D cooked for me so I didn't need to interact with anything. When I went to the bathroom \*upstairs\* I wore two masks, and did so for 5 days AFTER I was cleared by my doctor, and they live downstairs).   They called us assholes for being so unreasonable and offered that they would be masked when they went to go to the bathroom but only M would cook food and then go back to their room which they share. We reluctantly accepted and they have just moved back in.

9eva70pu	I'm on mobile btw, sorry for wack formatting haha.  I (16M) am pretty close with my brother (20M). We're both musicians, him playing bass for a few years and me doing guitar, ukulele, and piano for the same amount of time. With piano, I just started learning maybe two years ago, and this past year I've worked pretty damn hard on learning the first movement of Moonlight Sonata by Beethoven. It's an awesome song, I don't care how overrated it is.  Now, I have my first recital tomorrow. My brother said he'd "try to come" but because he works nights it'd be hard. Tonight he is off work and tomorrow all he does is prep, so it's a light load. Not saying it's not hard work, but it's not like he's doing tons and tons of heavy lifting. The issue here is, he usually goes to sleep at 8:30 or 9. He doesn't wake up until 5 or 6 pm, and he leaves for work at 7 and comes home at 6ish. My recital is at 10 am, so he'd have to stay awake until 11:30 at the earliest.  I really want him to come. He's done this sort of thing before for things he had to go to (for example, we're both in a rock band, and for shows he'll show up and play a set at 11:30). I really want him to come, as does my dad, because this is the first time I've performed something in actually proud of. It's a big thing. My mom however wants to just record it and have him watch it later.

h1yi154m	My best friends wedding is in two months and I am her maid of honor. We had always planned to be each other’s maid of honor so I know she expected to be mine. When she got engaged I gushed all over her, sent customized gifts and flew out to see her to go wedding dress shopping. Recently I planned her bachelorette and spent almost $2,000 between flying, hotels and events. Throughout her engagement period, my brother had been diagnosed as mentally ill and tried to hurt himself. Of course I shared this information with her as I was upset. In the past year, she had never once asked me how he was doing and got upset that I couldn’t show up to her engagement party as we were taking my brother to get treatment. Now that I am engaged, I feel like she couldn’t care less that I’m getting married after all that I had done for her. When my fiancé asked that she be there for the proposal she lied and said she would be on vacation. I try not to talk about my wedding with her but a few times I had asked if she liked certain venues or dresses and she doesn’t respond. She had shoved her wedding stuff down my throat when she was planning and I always answered her.   I decided that I don’t want to honor people who want me to be there for them but can’t do it in return. That said, I made my other friend maid of honor and I feel like my “best friend” is now mad at me.

etzdnycd	My (21M) girlfriend (23F) and I just moved in together 4 months ago after about a year and half together. Before we moved in together, we decided that we would split the rent because we are both in school and working. I am working in the IT field and on finishing a bachelors degree and my girlfriend is working under the table as a caretaker and on a 6 month certification in the medical field.  Last month, my girlfriend had to take off a lot of time for the holidays and as a result was not paid as she normally was used to. This left me to pay all of the rent, normally I’d be fine with this as I completely understand that under the table jobs suck because no PTO benefits, and we all have rough months. I can afford to pay all of the rent, but it leaves money extremely tight for other bills, not to mention me having to cut back on my school payments (I’m trying to pay off school without taking on any loans).   Normally I could understand the issue, but my girlfriend has been treating herself lately, going to the medi-spa and getting $500 lip injections and a facial, going on multiple hundred dollar shopping sprees at Sephora and Ulta, and basically ignoring the fact that I’m drowning in credit card bills because I had to rent on my credit card to pay.  We just found out this morning my girlfriends mother stole her card information and has been stealing money from her without her knowledge. As sad as this is, it leaves me to pay rent again another month, as my girlfriend will not have her half of the rent money for a second month.   I’ve researched the jobs in our area and she could get a multiple thousand dollar signing bonus and a decent raise if she worked at the local hospital or retirement home. WIBTA if I asked her to apply for either of these jobs so she can afford to pay half the rent?	1642819404.0	s9s3vh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9s3vh/wibta_if_i_asked_my_girlfriend_to_get_a_job/	WIBTA if I asked my girlfriend to get a job?
a474mtpj	Background information: my (30f) mom (52f) was a SAHM and my dad (55m) was working all the time to pursue his career, it was very normal for him to come home at 9 p.m.   There were major incidents, which made my childhood horrible. Here are some examples:  - I had friends at primary school, but I was also bullied by others. When I told my mom, she literally laughed it off and told me that my bullies “fell in love with me and knew no other way of showing me”. She basically did nothing about it. When I transferred to secondary school, it became worse. I was being bullied due to my immigrant background. I did not tell my mom because I was ashamed. Also, she did nothing about it the first time it happened and I didn’t feel that I could trust her.  - my grandma and my aunt interfering to whatever I did or said. They felt entitled to comment on my clothes, my character, my grades, basically everything about my personality. My mom told me to just not listen to her, but even though I had told her that it deeply hurt my feelings, they never did something about it.  - my mom and my brother share the same character, so they got along much better. He was her favorite and I also felt like he was being preferred over me. There were some incidents why I felt (or still feel) this way and I tried to talk with my mom about it in my 20ies, but she just said that I just remember it wrong because I was a child (which is funny because she was always the one with the bad memory) and that this is not true at all. So she never took me serious on this one.  - my mom felt entitled to ignore each boundary I set her. Even simple things needed to be intensely discussed with her and were ignored afterwards again, e.g. knocking on the door before entering.   I tried to talk to my parents throughout the years about everything that had happened, but they never took me seriously. When I finally told my mom about the racism I experienced recently, she cried and I forgave her for not knowing (my dad listened to our conversation from the living room, but did not bother to come upstairs and join us, he also did not check on me afterwards). I cannot forgive her and my dad for all what they did and ignored in the past. They also never apologized for everything else, they are being defensive and they keep on telling me that I had a great childhood.   They feel like I’m overreacting and they told me that they are waiting for me to calm down, but I have told them that this won’t happen this time. I, on the other hand, am so hurt, that I cannot further ignore her behavior. Family therapy will be impossible to have because my parents don’t want it.

iw2j2yi5	My husband (m37) and I (f29) regularly butt heads about his priorities when it comes to making commitments, particularly in relation to his Saturday hockey league.  Although matches are only supposed to be 2 x 35 minute halves, plus around 10 minutes in between (80mins max in total) his team insists on meeting an hour before the match, and we also live a minimum of 45 minutes away from the match location (we moved house and that put us further away from the “home” team location.) That means that even home matches take 4 hours minimum, and that’s without delays, late starts and the social hanging around after a match.  He is regularly gone from the house for around 5 hours at least, every Saturday.   This makes it very difficult to make weekend plans, and he is completely in denial about how much time this sport takes up. Other members of his team miss matches when they have other stuff going on, so I know the team allows it. Our plans must include hockey, no matter how important our plans are (for example, we were hosting our house warming, and he decided it would be ok to leave me to clean the house, cook the food, set up and welcome guests, and he could just turn up late once everyone was there when the hockey finished.)  I’m tired of always having to fight for family time. He’s a teacher, so Sundays are always full of marking and work, so we never have time for each other. We’ve only been married 3 years, and yet we never really go out, have fun or go on dates together because hockey takes up the only free day in the weekend.  Tonight we got into a big fight because tomorrow evening, we are meant to be driving 2.5 hours to support his sister in a show she’s performing. The show starts at 7.30pm so the very latest we can leave is 5pm.  I asked him to guarantee that he would leave the match by 4pm at the latest so we can leave on time. He refused and said if it was so important to me to be on time for his sisters show, why don’t I drive over to the match and pick him up so he can go from there. (This only takes 2mins off the Google maps journey time, but would take me 50mins to get to him.)  I told him that it was his responsibility to be in charge of his own timings. The match should be over by 3.30. I asked him to promise that if it got to 4pm and the game was still going on, to please sub himself off and come home because we have a commitment to be elsewhere. He refused to promise to leave on time. I said if he didn’t want to commit to being on time, he can phone his sister and say the timings aren’t going to work, and we won’t be able to come. He refused to do that too.  I feel like committing to a time to he home and ready to leave is the bare minimum I could ask for. He said he already had a commitment to play the whole game, regardless of how long that took.  AITA for saying his commitment to me and his family should come before his hockey match, and asking him to leave “early” if necessary due to the match overrunning?	1642820022.0	s9sb11	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sb11/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_commit_to_leaving/	AITA for wanting my husband to commit to leaving on time, even if that meant leaving a sport game early?
bri8mihb	Now before you say yes, hear me out. I(14m), my brother(14m), his gf(14f), and our friend(14m) was having a normal conversation after school at the park. I see a bunch of kids who I’ve never seen before also at the park. I decide to go introduce myself. I could tell that they had an unsafe upbringing considering the fact that they thought I had a gun when I just had my had in my pockets. The rest of the group came up and they thought I was messing with the kids. The kids did the same thing to them as they did to me. Eventually we all started having fun when our friend, Ty picks up one of the kids and runs off with them pretending to kidnap him. As he was running, he tripped and fell; body-slamming the little kid.  The kid almost started crying and his family went to go attack him. I was all for it when they started to use my back pack, which had my school computer in it to beat Ty up. I went and grabbed my backpack and in doing so I had to push the little girl who had my backpack. She ended up hurting herself on the table. This spark the whole family to beat up me and Ty. My brother and his girlfriend came to try and break it up which resulted in the little kids attacking them too. Obviously we were overpowering them by pushing them and holding them. This prompted them to get sticks, rocks, and bricks to hit us with. They almost hit us a couple of times to.  My brother’s girlfriend stopped and went to hide in a corner and my brother threatened the kids so they stopped attacking him. However me and Ty weren’t so lucky as those kids were hell bent on hurting us. Eventually I started getting beat up by their sneak attacks and double to triple team. I soon realized I had to force them to stop so I started punching and kicking the kids. After a while of doing this, the kids had enough and wanted to call a quits. I along with everybody else except two of those kids agreed. While we were trying to call a quits the two kids were still attacking me and Ty while the remaining of us were “trying” to make piece. I don’t think they were really trying cause all of them were still cussing us out especially one kid who wasn’t fighting at all. I started calling him a b*tch cause that’s what he was, all bark no bite. Isaiah who was the leader of the pack told me to stop. I reluctantly agreed. However Ty had body slammed one of the other kids who were still attacking. She was a little girl(apparently the girl part matters). This almost completely broke the truce and the other kid who was a little boy continued to keep on hitting me and Ty. His cussing got even worse. I tried to calm him down but he slapped me. I chased after him but he somehow outran me.   When he stopped running I told him to stop and we are trying to make piece but he keeps on getting in the way. He told me they came to the park to get bricks to throw at houses not fight teenagers. He agreed to stop hitting us however he kept on running his mouth. At last all of us were finally chill except that little kid who still ran his mouth. He called me a b*Tch and I had had it with him. I ran after him again but this time I had caught up to him and clipped his b*tch a**. His four other siblings came up to me and started cussing me out. So I pushed one of the sisters away, punched Isiah in the gut and the other sister attempted to slap me so I grabbed her wrist, swung her and used her to hit the last brother. The rest of the gang told me to leave.  While I was trying to leave Isiah followed me trying hit me with bricks and rocks. He almost did a couple of times ngl. Eventually my mom came and she ended the whole thing. AITA.	1642820182.0	s9scq2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9scq2/aita_for_beating_up_a_bunch_of_7_year_olds/	AITA for beating up a bunch of 7 year olds

6y699hcy	Okay, so, extremely minor problem but I hate the idea of ever inconveniencing anybody (its bad, i know) so genuinely wondering what other people think of this.  I live in an apartment; it is in a generally quiet building. I have lived here for 20+ years and maybe ten years ago the person who lives below me installed speakers in his ceiling. As a result, past a certain volume i can hear his music VERY well and sometimes feel it vibrating throughout my apartment. It's not a problem very frequently, and usually not late at night, and in general i ignore it--i live in a big city, and noise is part of the package.  After years of never complaining, if its 10PM on a friday night after a long ass week and i desperately do not want to hear his music, WIBTA if i go ask him to turn it down?	1642820246.0	s9sdf0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sdf0/wibta_if_i_ask_my_neighbor_to_turn_his_music_down/	WIBTA if i ask my neighbor to turn his music down?
9c7p964e	I am scheduled to marry my fiancé in a rather large to me (+-200 people) this may and the last six months have been nothing but stress, deposits, arguments with my family, guilt tripping over them wanting me to do X and spend Y on things I don’t want and packages We don’t need. And My fiancé has been bought to tears a few times over the matter.   From the get go I told everyone things like this would happen. I know that all big weddings have some hair pulling and hiccups but this is on another level as I get phone calls from my sister saying my Fiancé is a an asshole for not hiring her $5,000 wedding planner or not taking out a small loan to pay for the top tier liquor at the reception etc…  A large wedding has never really appealed to me and My fiancé has now grown very disillusioned with the whole process. She said today that she is a hair away from calling it off and eloping with me because she knows I’d much rather do that anyway, but would I be the asshole for maybe giving her the needed push to make her give the go ahead or should I put my foot down and insist on eloping? Because I can tell you all now that this I really taking it’s toll on me but I haven’t shown it or told anyone yet for some reason, thanks in advance!	1642820264.0	s9sdkr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sdkr/wibta_for_eloping_for_my_wedding/	WIBTA For Eloping for my wedding?
7a437tfk	Background: my best friend and I have been friends three years. She’s been friends with my ex-boyfriend for almost four years now. She doesn’t talk to him that much and they hangout every couple of months. They had a sleepover in the last week.My ex and I had a pretty bad breakup, but I didn’t care that she was still friends with him.  Now: my friend and I were talking about my ex because he has a new girlfriend. She then brought up the point that all his exes just don’t understand him and he tries his best. I disagreed because that wasn’t my experience with him.  It turned into a very long argument about how she says he’s a great person and has never wronged her. He’s always there for her and I’m not. I asked her multiple times to stop because I didn’t want to argue with her when we both CLEARLY have different opinions (which is okay). She proceeded to egg on the argument and I said “if you can’t drop this argument then we don’t need to be friends. I don’t like him and that’s not gonna change, and if defending him is so important to you that you’re going to bash me as a friend, then we don’t need to be friends” she says that “I can’t with people like you anymore. I’m done with you” then she blocked me.  So aita for our friendship ending? Should I reach out to her somewhere else and apologize or should I just leave it alone? she did have a bit of red flags (anytime I would talk about how I’m changing and working on myself, like my progress, she would be very sarcastic and put me down about it)	1642820767.0	s9sjf4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sjf4/aita_for_my_friendship_ending/	AITA For My Friendship Ending?
7l4viydw	This girl is a stay at home mom while the kids dad runs his own business and does the labor intensive work to be a good provider for their family of three.   He is sick and she called to complain about how he “keeps coming upstairs” rather than staying in the basement. The toddler (two year old) is sick too and she is in close contact with him but wants her boyfriend to stay quarantined in the basement.   He has a bed down there already because she hasn’t let him sleep in their bed (she shares the bed with the baby now since the baby was born two years ago) because he snores and it keeps her up. Bitch move if you ask me! Recipe for destruction in their relationship!   I think she is a spoiled brat and treats her boyfriend badly, never shows any gratitude for the lifestyle he provides her and their son.   It made me so mad when she complained about him coming upstairs. He is sick. She should (my opinion) be trying to help him stay comfortable and get better... not picking fights and banishing him to a cold, dark moldy basement.  I suggested since the baby is already sick too and she is unlikely to dodge it (and maybe even if that weren’t the case)  she should give up the master bedroom and let him recover and sleep comfortably there. That made her mad. I don’t think I’m wrong. She needs to support her man and appreciate that he provides a warm, safe house for them and suck it up once in a while and be the strong one, but she seems to only think of herself. Like I said, I don’t like her anymore, she has become an ungrateful brat.  I did not call her and offer this advice, she called me to complain that “he keeps coming upstairs”  and I stuck up for him.   Am I the asshole for suggesting and believing she could be treating her sick boyfriend a little better?	1642820975.0	s9slnf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9slnf/aita_for_suggesting_my_acquaintance_used_to_be_a/	AITA for suggesting my acquaintance (used to be a friend but I don’t like her anymore) let her boyfriend/kids dad/provider for the household who is sick quarantine in the bedroom rather than the cold, moldy basement?
7sjk8p2o	I think the context is very important here, I was walking back to my apartment from a friend's and I had to cross over by the front entrance.   I glanced over and saw a guy standing by the front door of the complex, I glanced over at him and he saw me. He then shouted over "hey could you let me in?" and I hurried as fast as I could to my apartment.   My first instinct was to not open it and I followed through with it. I'm a young woman, it's late at night, and I have never seen this guy before (he looked around my age but I can't tell). I feel really really bad about it especially since its cold out but I've been very paranoid lately regarding situations like this after finding out about a very disturbing murder of a woman that occurred in the country I'm staying in recently. She was doing all the "right things" and still met an untimely end. I'm definitely very on edge after reading about it.  I can't stop thinking about and I keep worrying about if he'll get in ok and about being in the cold. I feel awful but I feel I acted on my intuition.   I just felt like what if I let him in and he follows me to my apartment? how can I be sure he lives here? I didn't want to take a chance that something horrible could happen.  TL;DR: saw a guy (looked like a student but was hard to tell) at the front door of my apartment complex when walking alone and when he saw me he asked me if I could let him in , I didn't and I feel awful cause it's late and cold out but I've been very on edge about situations like this after learning about a woman close to my age being brutally murdered recently while alone.	1642820992.0	s9sltl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9sltl/aita_for_not_letting_someone_in_the_front_gate_of/	AITA for not letting someone in the front gate of my apartment complex?
egzo463y	Me (F24) and my sister (F36) live about a 4 hour drive from each other but still talk most days over the phone. She moved out 7 years ago, and has settled down with her boyfriend (M47) in his house. Since then, she has worked pretty much every day to save for housing renovations and other expenses.  Last week, she asked me to drive down and housesit sometime in the spring and look after their 3 cats and their dog, so her and her partner could go on their first holiday as a couple. I agreed, but asked if I could bring my best friend of 13 years with me (who she already knows very well), so we could meet with some mutual friends we have near her hometown and have some company while I was there. She agreed, I told my friend the dates we would be travelling and got really excited for a catch up with old pals.  A few days later, my sister called me again and said she spoke with her partner, and he would only agree to me housesitting if I did so on my own, as he is not comfortable with anyone else in his house. This knocked me back a little. I am definitely no party animal, and both myself and my best friend would be working remotely all week, so it's not as if we had planned a crazy week or expected to invite anyone over at all. We have been best friends since school, both introverted gamer types, and never given anyone any cause to be concerned about our behaviour. I asked whether he would feel better if he met up with me and my friend before we stayed, to which she said 'no, his decision is final, and you have to respect that. His house, his rules.'.  What made me really mad, was my sister telling me that I also was not okay to go to lunch with my friends while I was staying there, as they expected me to 'take housesitting seriously' and only leave the house to walk their dog or buy groceries.  This prompted me to ask, 'So, you want me to drive 4 hours, stay at your house alone, clean up after your animals and drive 4 hours home, for free and with no time for my friends at all?'. My sister blew up about how tired and overworked she is, and she just wants to go on holiday. She told me this isn't a big deal and I was being selfish for asking 'so much' from them. She asked me if I would still come, but I could feel myself getting frustrated and said 'I'll think about it' before ending the call.  If I don't housesit, they will not be able to go away as they cannot afford the boarding fees for their pets for the week. My sister has held this against me since our call, and now our parents have been telling me I need to suck it up and do my sister a favour here. I feel like I am doing this as a favour, so why all these rules and lack of trust?   I don't feel like I am asking for too much here, and as me housesitting will be the difference between them having a break or not, I feel the least they could do is let have some company. So please let me know, AITA here?	1642820911.0	s9skza	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9skza/aita_for_possibly_causing_my_sister_to_cancel_her/	AITA for possibly causing my sister to cancel her first vacation in 7 years?

ibff4gk4	I, (F 24) have been very lucky throughout my life. I’ve had very hardworking parents who gave me & my siblings a life to where we would never have to worry about financial struggles. They aren’t rich by any means, but we’ve never had to worry about things like a unexpected medical bill or emergencies.  I moved back home with my mom (58 yo female, divorced) once Covid hit when I lost my job. She loves her kids to be around her so she was more than happy to welcome me back. She has helped with providing for me when it comes to food, my car insurance, and phone bill. I’ve offered to get another job but she refuses until I am done with school (I am a nursing major graduating this May). I’m very grateful, so on days that I’m not at school I cook, clean, & help out with anything she needs when she’s at work (she’s a teacher & works M-F 7:30-4:15)   The problem is I cannot be around her for very long because of the toll she takes on my mental health. She is very skinny & has never been over 120 lbs, but I have my dads genes & gain weight very easy & am about 170 lbs. She comments things like “I hope that shirt will fit” after getting me two sizes too big & “does that even fit you anymore?” But she says it with a certain tone. Another thing is I’m a very honest person & anytime I give her my opinion on something it’s always I’m so negative or I’m being ridiculous.  My dad also recently just died, & I’m having a very hard time with it. Her & my little brother (who also lives at home) have gone back & forth criticizing how I’m taking it or if I’m really that sad or just acting. She always takes my little brothers side with everything, & he is an absolute bully to be calling me lazy, pathetic, & selfish. She says she doesn’t agree, but she never stands up for me & lets him say whatever he wants to me.   I’m planning on moving out soon because I cannot take it anymore. I feel like I can’t be honest or express my feelings about anything without getting put down & called negative or dramatic. Many people who know me says I’d be better off not being around her, but I know it would absolutely crush her & she’s helped me with everything, but at the same time my mental health is so low around her.

Now recently he admits that he genuinely likes me for who I am. So I took advantage of this situation and asked if we wanted to make it official but he said he wants to take it slow, now I'm not going to lie it kinda annoyed me a little bit as I've waited for almost two years for him to like me and now he wants me to wait even longer?   Like don't get me wrong I'll wait but at the same time I don't want to wait too long. I love him so much and I want to support him no matter what 🥺  Granted he's the only man I've been with that has treated me so well and has supported me through my rough times.	1642822304.0	s9t0ly	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9t0ly/aita_for_pushingasking_for_a_relationship/	AITA For "pushing/asking" for a relationship
iw57firi	throwaway account because I don't want my parents to see this.   I 19M live in my parents house and am currently a full time youtuber. I live in my attic which i use as my studio to film my videos. Basically, I only recently started being a youtuber but have had this dream for awhile. I post mukbang videos and eat a lot of food as a result. The reason I'm making this post is because my parents don't agree with my new job and are threatening to kick me out. I'll explain this further.   The first incident was when I was filming my first mukbang video. I bought a few boxes of mcdonalds and overcharged the debit card my parents gave me. Honestly, I didn't think this was a big deal cause I'd probably make money and pay it back later. It was also not that much food and they totally overreacted. I said that I was just buying food for me and my friends to eat and I made them drop the argument. They were a bit upset but eventually got over it.   Then 2 months ago I overcharged my debit card again and bought fire noodles. Honestly, i would be lying if i said it wasn't a lot because I bought about 10 full packs of fire noodles which were about $80. Anyways, I feel as though they completely overreacted again and then sat me down and had a serious conversation with me. They pressured me to tell them why I was spending so much money on food. I told them about my youtube channel which at the time had 100 subscribers and at first they were confused. Then I showed them nikocado avocado my favorite mukbang youtuber they realized how much success I could eventually make. He gets millions of views doing what I do and they know that could be a possible career for me. All of a sudden they understood but still they gave me an ultimatum which I didn't agree with but whatever. They said I have to be making money after 2 months or they want me to get a real job and stop making mukbang videos.   Anyways, it's been 2 months and last night we had a huge fight. They told me I gained so much weight and am acting differently and I don't even make money doing this yet. I begged them to give me more time and said how unfair they were being with me. I don't think I've gained much weight at all and what's a little weight compared to the success of my youtube channel. They yelled at me for hours which was complete emotional abuse and they eventually told me to pack my bags and find somewhere to stay. Basically they're going to kick me out, their only son and it's seriously unfair. I can't believe my own parents would do that to me especially since i can tell I will be successful doing this. They even kept my expensive camera so I can't even make any more videos. I don't know how to get them to support my dream even though Im confident that I can be successful. Rome wasn't built in a day, why can't they see that?   TLDR; My parents don't support me being a mukbang youtuber and are threatening to kick me out of the house. 	1642822715.0	s9t4zy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9t4zy/aita_for_wanting_to_be_a_mukbang_youtuber/	AITA for wanting to be a mukbang youtuber?
ibff4gk4	I, (F 24) have been very lucky throughout my life. I’ve had very hardworking parents who gave me & my siblings a life to where we would never have to worry about financial struggles. They aren’t rich by any means, but we’ve never had to worry about things like a unexpected medical bill or emergencies.  I moved back home with my mom (58 yo female, divorced) once Covid hit when I lost my job. She loves her kids to be around her so she was more than happy to welcome me back. She has helped with providing for me when it comes to food, my car insurance, and phone bill. I’ve offered to get another job but she refuses until I am done with school (I am a nursing major graduating this May). I’m very grateful, so on days that I’m not at school I cook, clean, & help out with anything she needs when she’s at work (she’s a teacher & works M-F 7:30-4:15). She helps me out & expects nothing in return, & truly is a great mom. She’d do absolutely anything for us.  The problem is I cannot be around her for very long because of the toll she takes on my mental health. She is very skinny & has never been over 120 lbs, but I have my dads genes & gain weight very easy & am about 170 lbs. She comments things like “I hope that shirt will fit” after getting me two sizes too big & “does that even fit you anymore?” But she says it with a certain tone. Another thing is I’m a very honest person & anytime I give her my opinion on something it’s always I’m so negative or I’m being ridiculous.  My dad also recently just died, & I’m having a very hard time with it. Her & my little brother (who also lives at home) have gone back & forth criticizing how I’m taking it or if I’m really that sad or just acting. She always takes my little brothers side with everything, & he is an absolute bully to be calling me lazy, pathetic, & selfish. She says she doesn’t agree, but she never stands up for me & lets him say whatever he wants to me.  I’m planning on moving out soon because I cannot take it anymore. I feel like I can’t be honest or express my feelings about anything without getting put down & called negative or dramatic. Many people who know me says I’d be better off not being around her, but I know it would absolutely crush her & she’s helped me with everything, but at the same time my mental health is so low around her.  AITA for thinking like this? I know I’d feel so guilty	1642822765.0	s9t5ix	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9t5ix/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_mom_despite/	AITA for not wanting to be around my mom despite everything she’s done for me?
8i6yt	I'm a 34/F bisexual woman. I went to my PCP for some routine test and refills, when they asked me about my sexuality. It was the first time I'd ever been asked. When I answered, my doctor immediately order an HIV test ontop of my other labs.  I immediately felt uncomfortable about that; I understand that the LGBTQ+ community is high risk, but if you look at transmission rates for women on women, it's extremely low. I've also been married for 10 years, with my husband for 11 with no other partners or risky behavior (which we are asked about and it's in my chart.) He's also been my primary for a few years, and has never ordered this test before until I was asked about my sexuality.  I go see him on Wednesday, and I'm no longer sure I want him to even be my primary at this point and almost want to report him because this feels discriminatory. I don't want to go any further than a report and a PCP change.

5otiarrb	To start, my boyfriend and I have been together officially for 6 months and have been dating for about a year. He and I are in two different age groups and come from two different cultures. From the beginning we have been at odds over money because he is traditional, whereas I am more modernized. For example, our very first date I offered to go half, and he refused. I then offered to pay the tip, he refused again. After the date, he pulled me to the side and said to never do that again. He said that he is a man, and that as long as he has money in his pocket, he never wants me to even consider going in mine. Things have always been like this our entire relationship, despite my efforts. This is not to say I have never bought things for him, or paid for (inexpensive) things for the both of us.   I recently got a new job and began searching for apartments nearby. He has given me advice on where to get reasonably priced furniture, and good neighborhoods that have decent rent. A few weeks ago, we were browsing in Best Buy when we stumbled upon a 75” tv that was on sale. I expressed my interest in it, and he noted that it was a good brand that he purchased in the past. Later that week, we were talking when he brought up buying me the tv we saw. I refused, we went back and forth, he dropped it. He brought it up again about a week later, and I insisted he let it go, which he did.   Today, we’re both at work and were talking on the phone during his lunch break. The topic of my apartment search comes up, and he brings the tv up AGAIN. He says he wishes I would let him do something nice for me, and that he is a man and doesn’t feel right coming to my house to spend time with me, and not contributing something to the apartment. He told me we weren’t just sleeping together and that we’re partners. He then said if not the tv then at least the dining room furniture because it was a necessity. We argued, until finally he said he wouldn’t come over to the apartment unless I allowed him to help with something. He hung up because his lunch break was over, but promised to call me back when he gets off so we could further discuss it. It should be noted, I in no way see this as some sort of manipulation tactic that could be used for ulterior motives.   Here’s where I may be TA: I knew going into the relationship he was a gentleman who feels like it’s his duty to take care of the woman he’s with, and accepted this is not only his nature, it’s his culture. However, he knows I’m a stubborn modern young woman who yearns to be independent and seen as an equal.

iw4ai5xj	So this one has been on my mind for quite a long time now. So as for many other families in my country my GF and both her parents had to go through a 10 day quarantine in the last two weeks. During this time I offered myself to buy some small groceries and some stuff they needed since they are not at very good terms with their phisically very close close family. This happened two times and I was the one that asked them if they needed anything since I knew they may not want to "bother" me. The total amount of the groceries was something on the lines of 40.60$ or 39,60$ or something similar, anyway something with 0.60 or 0.70 as decimals. Now, to be clear, we are both students and we both live with our parents, her family is surely not poor nor rich, is what I would call exactly middle class, they dont have any 'money' problem. That s also why, when I saw that they gave me the exact amount, i was a little "disappointed". I want to be clear I wasnt thinking to keep nothing of the possible "tip", I was actually thinking how would I give them back the money if we cannot have a direct contact, but cammon, not even round it up to 41 or 40? We dont live in the same town but it was a pleasure for me to be able to help them, but i dunno, being given that cold exact amount felt so strange and I keep thinking about it. Am I The Asshole for not being able to let it go?	1642823635.0	s9tfgr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tfgr/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_gfs_family_for_being_too/	AITA for being mad at my GF's family for being too precise with money?
ebhq1zs8	To start Im 21F. And I’m Jewish. This is important as Saturday is Shabbat. So I can’t do anything like lights, ripping towels. Doing laundry, cooking. Using a fridge etc. So one of my roommates. « Phoebe » , decided we all need to clean up every Saturday. I explained I couldn’t, at least not do many things. I suggested that I can clean up after the cat, and clean the toilets (as those don’t break the laws) but she did that’s being lazy, and I need to do just as much as the other people. (We have one other roommate) I then suggested we make the clean up day another day, so I can fully participate. But Saturday is the fat that world best for everyone else. I wanna help clean the house, I just don’t wanna break laws of Shabbat. Am I the Asshole for not putting as much effort into cleaning on saturdays as my other roommates?  TLDR: roommates want to deep clean on Shabbat, I do less work because I’m Jewish	1642823834.0	s9thki	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9thki/aita_for_not_participating_in_my_roommates/	AITA for not participating in my roommates weekend cleaning
94iacnpa	So I recently told my (23f) boyfriend Alex (25m) that I needed space in the relationship after I tried breaking up but basically, he said we should take a break before I break up with him so I can be sure (Bad decision on my part, I should've stuck to my guns and said no we are over I know). I have known him for 4 years, but we started dating a year and a half ago. I had to do it over the phone because 6 months ago I moved out of state for graduate school and it would be a 10-hour drive.  I love him but I feel like breaking up is the right thing to do. My entire family and friends don't like Alex because they believe he is controlling and manipulative. He has met my family on 5 different occasions staying for an average of 5 days. But he says that they don't know him well enough for me to listen to them.  I don't think he is intentionally doing it, but I have noticed that Alex can be manipulative and controlling.  He didn't like that I would study with guy friends because "I trust you, I don't trust them" which I told him was BS reason but he wouldn't listen. Even though my friend is married with children.  I have a low sex drive naturally but also due to medications. Alex wanted me to try natural enhancers or visit doctors to see if something was wrong with me. Even when I told Alex I wasn't in the mood he would beg me to at least try to get in the mood. When we would crawl into bed he would turn away and sniffle and pout about me not showing him love.  When we lived in the same state if I tried to say I needed to stay home rather than go visit him. Alex would tell me how bad he felt and how sad he was. Then I would say he was guilting me but he would say no no I am telling you how I feel.  When I told Alex I was done he told me I was throwing him away like trash, which is how we got to the break. Alex called to tell me that "he has told his coworkers that after our break he may need some time off because he will need time to mentally recover."  Alex says that he deserves a second chance because I didn't tell him I felt like he was being manipulative. He keeps saying that if I get better about communicating then all the issues in our relationship would be solved. But I feel like this is just him twisting everything again. I have known I have communication issues, I have been working on it in therapy (which he knows about). But he threw it in my face by saying that if I can't communicate I would never be in a happy relationship.  TLDR; Long-ish term boyfriend who has controlling/ manipulative tendencies brought up the fact that my communication issues could solve our relationship problems but I feel done even though I still love him.  AITA for just wanting to end it with him and not giving him a second chance or should I work on my communication skills and work on the relationship?	1642824233.0	s9tm79	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tm79/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_him_a_second_chance/	AITA for not wanting to give him a second chance?
iw44w5k6	I (18M) am a huge Star Wars Fan. My father and I are big fans. He had many of the toys and collectables from the early 90's. We bond over the movies, shows and books. And before you start with why are you still at home, move out and blah blah, I'm still in High School. My graduation isn't until March. Anyway Star Wars is mine and my dad's thing. My sister (12) Lily isn't into it. My dad has tried to get her interested or involved but she hasn't been interested. She has the girly hobby of collecting dolls. That is her thing. For Christmas Lily got a Baby Yoda doll. I was kinda jealous as she isn't a Star Wars, couldn't tell you one thing about it if her life depended on it and got the doll. My dad said he just thought she would like it. Granted she did.  I offered to buy the doll off Lily since it is out of place among her baby dolls and porcelain dolls. She kept telling me no.  I asked several times.  Recently our parents gave her permission to have a sleep over with a couple friends. She was carrying around baby Yoda, saying things like he was helping her set up and dressing him in doll clothes. Things got worse when her little friends came over. I walked into the living room to find them putting makeup on Yoda. I took the doll to clean it up which cause Lily to have a fit. My dad heard it, made me give the doll back and sent me to my room.   I confessed that it wasn't fair she got the baby Yoda doll when she isn't even a fan! My dad said he got it for Lily to show some interest in her hobby and told me to grow up! After the sleepover, I offered again to buy the doll off Lily but she said if I bothered her again, she would tell our parents.  I just don't think its fair.

7gmsfmdd	My mom is a single mom. She moved my brother and I to a different state when we were young, all the way across the country. She never acted the same since. She would hit my brother and I, but my brother definitely got the worst of it. I would hear his screams and pleads from my bedroom and they would haunt my nightmares. CPS got involved once in middle school, but they found her not guilty, and told me a parent has the right to punish a child.   The rest of my life was filled with gaslighting and emotional/psychological abuse. She would mock the way I cry and say that I was dramatic. She was strange about the food I ate, brought multiple boyfriends around, and her mood snapped so quickly that I never knew what to expect from her (diagnosed bipolar). It was constantly walking on eggshells with a violently uncomfortable feeling. She was only nice when she was drunk.  After a conflict, my brother moved back to our home state, and my mom moved us into her friend's house. From then, she let me never come home, she texted me once a week, and left me to stay at a friend's for months due to her career. It felt like I had no parents.  My last straw was when she demanded I come back from my friend's house and live with her. She did this because I confided in the owner of my mom's current home about her behavior and how it affected me. When the owner told her everything I said, she called me a liar, manipulator, and a backstabber. She told me if I want to leave her, because she is *sooo* terrible, all I had to do was "clean out my room, leave my car, and go."  *Completely* behind her back I turned in all my school textbooks. I cleaned my room out and drove all my stuff to a friend's. I said my goodbyes, turned in my two-weeks, and waited. I lied to her every day about where I was going and what I was doing, under the advice of multiple adults helping me move. They told me she wouldn't help me move; she would only prevent it if she knew.  My mom sends us to our home state every Christmas, so I saw that free plane ticket as my window to escape. I went, waited for a good time, and told my mom I wasn't going back with her. Of course, she lost her mind. I told her on Christmas Eve. I know it ***really*** wasn't good timing, but I couldn't hold it in anymore, the guilt of not telling her was eating me alive.  She was crying, and heartbroken. I felt like a horrible person. I knew I shouldn't have gone behind her back to do everything, and being forced to explain the *extent* I went behind her, hurt her so badly. I *completely* moved out without her noticing.  I stopped feeling bad when she said, "If I knew you and (brother's name) would've turned out like this, I would've left you when you were 4," and kept saying, "fuck you bitch, shut up, fuck you..."  It's been a month since I suddenly left my mom, and I've been in therapy (currently getting diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety).

81txqwum	Last 2 days me and my girlfriend started arguing and we've been a little distant. She was mad at me and today we started taking and almost Broke up. We where talking about our relationship and out of now where she said she wanted to die, I was so confused and asked why and my reaction was not that good since In the past she has tried to manipulate me when arguing saying thinks similar to what she said today and all those times I stopped arguing and try to make her feel better. But this time it was different because in the past weeks she was fine and happy and we have talked about how we felt and everything was apparently good. If she had told this before of course my reaction would have been completely different but she said it just when we were discussing If we should break up and I started asking her why now and not before, why would she said that to me in the worst possible moment. Why when I asked before how she felt she told me she was feeling better than ever, and now that we are fighting she completely change what she said 4 days ago, also she told me this is recen and she started filling this way this week.  Because of my reaction she told she is never going to tell me her feelings again and left. I don't know if should have acted differently but I think she was just trying to make me feel bad.

I am starting to think it was because of my personality and I start to stop telling jokes or even laughing at other peoples jokes. Also every time I try and distance myself from my friends they get nicer and even though I realize I start to lighten up and go back to my old self again but this time I decided I was for real because when I think about it the friends I have been cool with since middle school are ditching me for people they met last year and my examples are times when I’m walking/talking with one of them someone they met last year(someone I also know) would slowly close me in to talk to the person next to me other than just going around and talking to both of us but the moment I just start walking faster they instantly want to talk to me I feel like that one mutant from marvel who’s super power is when you don’t see him you forget he ever exists. I’m constantly beating myself up because I wonder why nobody likes me then I realize I am a male and my feelings aren’t really valid so I just end up sucking it up and stay to myself that is best way to handle these situations because any other way would result in me harming the mass majority of the people I know    TL;DR: my brother didn’t take my dog out so now I realize I am the Batman   Also I could be acting like a little girl whining cause nobody likes me but idc I haven’t told anyone this and I don’t plan on it cus I don’t trust my mom or dad and I just want to get this off my chest	1642824823.0	s9tshh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tshh/aita_because_i_want_to_separate_myself_from_my/	AITA because I want to separate myself from my friends and family
iw3nmh5o	My partner grew up in a loud household where they freely express themselves in a loud manner. I, on the other hand, grew up in a soft spoken household where a change in tone usually implies that something is wrong.   When we discuss things, my partner usually uses this tone that I find aggressive. I know my partner means well but sometimes I still find this tone offensive and intimidating. Whenever I raise this, we fight and the issue gets unresolved until it comes up again.   Recently I expressed my worries but my partner used the tone again which for me implied that my worries are invalid and that I should just follow whatever is required. There is nothing wrong with what was said but i took it differently because of the way it was communicated. After all, the worries I expressed are related to me arranging the requirements to move together so I was asking for a more considerate response.   AITA for raising this and expecting them to adjust? I know my partner means well but I cant seem to get used to it.  Is there a way I can get used to it quickly?  Should I just always remind myself that they mean well?

iw5ogchv	I'm producing a tv show currently, which I have written, and I will be a leading actor. Without giving too much away, we're currently in the works of casting the other leading roles and finalising the script.   I based SOME of the characters on people that I personally know, like friends. The show, not gonna mention it's name or anything else, has a lot of action, and is centered around a military style team. Obviously, if we're gonna have people who are supposed to be military members, we need them to be relatively athletic and physically imposing. The studio is paying for most of the leading cast to be trained to do fight scenes and get into the right physique.   I'm english, and hold zero belief in the "actors have to be beautiful" belief. I made it clear that the casting will be based on who's best for the role, in terms of athletics, and acting, not looks. They said that I was allowed to offer some roles to people if I wanted.   My sister believes one of the main characters is based on her, and that she is definitely great for the role. The character is not at all based of her, or anyone I know. She is also very athletic and one of the leaders of the team, so she needs to be very commanding, which my sister isn't. My sister likes to think she commands a room, but really she doesn't. Also, she is highly overweight and there is no way she'd be fit for a role like this.    I told my sister this, and she began crying, saying I was fatshaming her and that I'm denying her "her own role" in my show. I don't want to even ask them to consider her because I'm young, and the producers have already made so many allowances for me, letting me be the lead, giving me the chance to choose some people for the roles, that sort of thing, and I don't want to betray their trust by asking them to cast someone so wrong for the role.   Right now, 2 others have been cast, and i'm getting along quite well with them, friends even, and I don't want to disrupt the chemistry this group will need to have by bringing someone who I already have personal connections with.

I don’t feel comfortable with him going to the July one, due to it requiring travel (500 miles one way). When I told him I didn’t feel comfortable, he immediately understood and is fine with not going. This interaction happened about an hour ago and I keep wondering if I’m coming off as pushy or if my anxiety as a first time mom is getting in the way. I know his friends are important to him and I trust him whole heartedly; I guess I just have anxiety about him being gone for 4 days with a brand new infant at home. Just looking for some insight!

ivxnmz5d	For the seemingly paradoxical reason that he’s much better than me on paper.   The ‘he’ in question is this guy I go to school with. He’s always seen me as a rival of sorts— he’s more academic while I don’t care as much, but I’d say we both recognize the other is intelligent.   We both had the same dream school, a pretty prestigious and low-acceptance-rate school. His SAT and GPA was higher, he had more extracurriculars, and he spent months on his essays as compared to me, who wrote it the day of the deadline; the expectation was, he would get in and I wouldn’t. When decisions came out, he and I both got in.  I considered this more a testament to my ability than his. To use an analogy, most people, if given two people that both got a 100 on a test, would consider the guy who didn’t study at all and got a 100 from natural talent smarter than the guy that studied for weeks because there was less hard work on the former’s part. I see it the same way— if he and I reached the same result and he worked far harder and had far better scores, my natural intelligence would have to be evident to be that much better to reach the same outcome.   He was trying to one up me at one point about bragging about his SAT score, so I pointed out what I said above. This just upset him and he called me a dick, but I don’t think I’m wrong.

4qdbw9qx	I had a bit of a traumatic birth. Basically my child was born a little early but still at full term at 37 weeks . I was induced for slow growth. He was then born with a slight breathing problem and we spent 2 or so weeks at the hospital back and forth.  He is now 2 months and doing great and growing! But between stressing, having a slight chance my next baby may also have the same breathing problem, the sleep deprivation - and just really everything that comes with being a mother has taken a toll on me.  I am finally starting to feel like myself. I come from a big family and I couldn’t imagine not having siblings…  Am I the asshole for putting my livelihood first?	1642826352.0	s9u8j5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9u8j5/aita_for_choosing_to_have_one_child/	AITA for choosing to have one child?
fiuikn1d	Writing onto phone sorry if there’s the bad formatting.  I (13F) live in Florida with my mom and sister . So a little information about my case. So before I was born my dad was having legal trouble with get his residence (He and my mom moved from Haiti to Florida before they meet) I don’t really know the full story but he moved to Canada when my mom was pregnant with me. Ever since then we go up to Canada every couple of years (before Covid ). My parents always bring up the topic about us moving to Canada to live with my dad.   The thing is none of my family live in Canada except for one of my aunt and uncle. Everyone I ever known lives in Florida and I don’t like the idea of moving to a different area and not having a large group of people to always fall back on when I need them. (I have a lot of cousin and family friends and we all live near each other). The reason why I don’t want to move is because of my family. I over heard my mom saying to a friend that my dad doesn’t want to move to Florida because they “kicked him out”. If he would just put his ego aside and think about us and everyone else then he would just move to Florida with us.   I told them about this and they just tell me it would be better for them if we lived together so my mom could go to college and so money won’t be as tight. I do want my mom to get the education she deserves but I love it here with everyone. I feel kinda selfish for this but I just want a second opinion.

5aeovuxp	Me (20f) and boyfriend (19m) let’s call him Clark have been dating for more or less a year and he never seems like he’s into me as much as he says he is.   Started talking at the start of 2021 while in quarantine, liked each other lots and finally were able to see in person mid year.  During this time, I lost all my irl friends (because of college), and was left only with him.   In these months he spent most of his time with friends and gaming and every time I wanted to spend more time with him an argument would arise. After many long conversations we were able to get to compromises. He rarely sent pics of himself and refused to FaceTime, when I saw him in person he didn’t look like them at all but I went past that because of the emotional connection and time invested.  As we started dating in person, things got a bit overwhelming for me. He started seeing his friends less, and wanted to spend time only with me (no problem), but also started saying very seriously things like that he wants to be with me forever, never leave him and so on.   Sure this is great, but because of Clark being my first serious relationship, and saying those things not lightheartedly after just a few months of dating, it was A LOT, especially because he was saying those things constantly and felt oppressing and like he didn’t leave me room to say otherwise. Had fights about this, he never understood how overwhelmed I felt so instead of helping he was just getting mad at me for not being of the same mindset.   As time went on, he tried to understand me and be better too but never really tried that hard.  I was able to accept being with him forever, which led me to wanting him to do his best. I’ve always had high expectations for relationships and openly say what I want but he rarely ever comes through 100% and most times leaves me disappointed, so he started feeling more insecure about the relationship.  This meant being mad at me for having male friends in class, and wanted me to block my male friend of 5 years (mind you, I never go out with these dudes), while he could keep all his female friends no problem which didn’t sit right with me at all;  Or also things like saying I never appreciate his efforts (which I do and say) but they’re not enough for me.   Last thing that happened was us arranging a online date (family member of his maybe has covid) and Clark ultimately deciding on going out to eat with his friends, and him getting mad at me because I said I wanted him to stay with me and would be sad otherwise but he can also go if he wants to, which he chose to do.    This made me think about all the other times where I didn’t feel heard or understood and had to put aside my wants for him, which led me to think if it’s really worth to keep trying to make this work and wanting him to do better if he’s not able to. AITA?   TLDR: My boyfriend says he wants to be with me forever but doesn’t put enough effort.	1642825256.0	s9tx1u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tx1u/aita_for_wanting_my_boyfriend_to_do_better/	AITA for wanting my boyfriend to do better?

ag993gon	Last year, I bought a new iPhone but was hanging on to my old one so I could repurpose it into a security camera or video camera or something like that. Shortly after that, my roommate mentions something was up with his phone and it sounded like it was on death's door so I offered him the use of my old one. I guess I didn't make this totally clear to him but I intended it as a loan, not a gift.  About 10 months later, he mentions he bought a new phone. I ask him for my old phone back, and he says he gave it away. I ask who the recipient was, and he clarifies he traded it in to his cell phone provider for $150. I wasn't pleased about this because I intended it as a loan, and he says he thought it was a gift. But even *if* I had given it to him, I think it's unethical to sell a hand-me-down he got for free.  Anyway, I told him I think he owes me the proceeds and he eventually (and begrudgingly) gave me the trade in value he got for the phone but says he feels like this is an Indian giver situation. Was I wrong to lay claim to the proceeds? (BTW, I donated the $150 to charity in his name.)	1642826989.0	s9uf6j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9uf6j/aita_friend_sold_my_iphone_he_was_using_i_told/	AITA - friend sold my iPhone he was using, I told him he owes me the proceeds
8oplrzei	For context:  My mom is an anti vaxxer, said if i wanted the shot i’d have to write a paper on “legitimate reasons people don’t want it,” I’m the oldest of five kids, no dad in picture.   My mom got covid from her mom, bc she was in close contact with her while knowing she had symptoms. I had to drive her to get tested, illegally mind you, bc i don’t even have my actual license yet, bc of her.   She tested positive, so now i also had to get tested, but i couldn’t get a rapid test bc the insurance she got us literally isn’t covered anywhere, and i don’t have $150 to drop on a test. So we had to set an appointment for the next day for a test that takes 72 hours for results.   I texted her this morning asking if i needed to call later to ask abt my results and she told me no, that she’d call and set a reminder to.  I remembered about an hour ago and texted her asking if she forgot, and said i would’ve just called had i known.  Apparently it’s my fault she didn’t call, and i should’ve just checked with her or called myself, which i offered to do.   I told her she was full of shit and left the house bc i felt so suffocated and i needed fresh air.   She texted me again blaming me, to which i responded “It’s not my responsibility to make sure my 38 year old mother makes a call she said she was gonna make. But i should know better.” Which is a jab to her, bc we had a lot of issues when i was growing up in regards to her not keeping her word, to the point that as a child i didn’t trust my mother.  But I’m 17, i should’ve just called myself, so it’s my fault that i’m gonna miss my friend’s birthday tomorrow and a third day of work.   I’m exhausted from her and her kids and quite frankly tired of her.

iw5l2zof	My dad's fiancee is an educator, so she gets off work right around the time me and my brother get out of school.  My brother was unlocking the door to our house when I heard someone walking up to the door behind me, and I screamed. She wears these wedges that are really loud and ugly-looking.  I asked her what the hell she was doing at our house when our dad wasn't home, and she said that our dad had sent her there to watch over us.  I told her that we were older teens and that we could be left at home alone and that we'd done so for years and she just shrugged and said our dad sent her there.  She does really annoying things, like try to hug me and ruffle my hair and ask how my day was and yelling at me to do homework and taking away my phone when I get distracted.  I guess one plus is that she makes snacks for us and buys me my favorite food and drinks sometimes, but other than that, it's all negative.  When I let slip that I had a huge Spanish test one day, she literally made me sit down and study grammar and vocabulary for hours even though I already speak Spanish fluently because I had a B+ in the class and she teaches Spanish and psychology. My grade went up to an A- after that, but I was still annoyed because no one has been that strict or authoritarian with me before.  And generally, when my brother and I do homework, she sits next to us, grades papers, and watches us like a hawk.  I asked my dad again today why he made his girlfriend babysit us and if he pays her to do it and he said that we need an adult to watch over us and that she doesn't get paid.  Literally how does she even agree to this arrangement of babysitting kids at school and then doing it for free again after work?	1642827155.0	s9uh8e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9uh8e/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_my_brother_and_i/	AITA for telling my dad that my brother and I don't need afterschool care?
5oc15rs6	I want to start of by saying, my dad doesn’t know I blame him. I know it would shatter him to know I hold him responsible. Sorry this is kinda long.   In 2019-2020 there was a neighbours cat that was very close to us. Spent almost all his time in our house. He gave me kisses and cuddles and played with me daily. The most affectionate cat I’ve ever known. Early 2020 he was hit by a car. Since he was our neighbours, I never got to say goodbye. But he was my baby. Because of my mental health at the time, with the loss of this cat, I was hospitalised.   A few months later we got our own kitten, a few month old black kitty called Voodoo. We very quickly noticed Voodoo was not smart. She would knock things over, run into things, break stuff, zoomies all the time, not great balance.  I’m 18 and my dad ‘rules’ this house. For months while Voodoo was pre-inoculations I begged my dad to let us keep Voodoo as in indoor cat. I just kept thinking about my previous cat and how dangerous our local roads are. My dad always said keeping her inside (even with supervised time in the back garden) was animal abuse.  When she was eventually allowed outside, I was terrified for a few weeks. She never went far. As she got more confident she would spend more time outside. Jumping on top of cars, walking in the road, being dangerously curious.  In mid 2021 she was spotted on top of our neighbours van (going 30 mph) down town, a few miles from home. It was a MIRACLE she was unharmed that day. I spent a few more weeks trying to convince my dad to keep her indoors. “Nah, animal abuse.” Now January 2022, Voodoo, less than 2 years old. Hit by a car. She walked to a near by alleyway, lay down in the rain and died alone in agony. I was the one who had to pick up her limp body. I was the one who had to get her blood on my hands.   Voodoo was the closest I’ve ever had to a soulmate. She was my everything. I am not coping with this loss.  I blame my dad completely for refusing to keep her indoors. After the previous cat, after voodoo was spotted on our neighbours van. Am I an asshole for blaming my dad on Voodoos death?	1642827348.0	s9uj4a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9uj4a/aita_for_blaming_my_dad_on_my_kittens_death/	AITA for blaming my dad on my kittens death?

I was at the bar one night and met a guy who had a wedding band on who was talking to a girl he just met and I asked him what would his wife think and he whispered to me that "he doesn't have a wife, chicks want what they can't have" so I decided to give it a try I bought a cheapo band and wore it to the bar. It wasn't immediately effective I've probably only picked up 3 girls since I started wearing it.  But one night I girl brought me home to her place and during the moment she asked me what my wife would think and I told her bluntly I didn't have a wife and she immediately switched personality and started shouting at me calling me a dick and what not for misleading her.	1642827767.0	s9untz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9untz/aita_for_pretending_to_be_married_to_pick_up/	AITA For pretending to be married to pick up women at the club
a12fugcm	My roommate tested positive for covid, so naturally you’re supposed to isolate. He told me his gf was coming over tonight. I was shocked, because he just tested positive yesterday. His gf just had covid a month ago, so maybe he thinks she’s immune, but I’m not sure if he knows that she can still catch covid and spread it, it just won’t affect her as badly because she has that recent immunity. Not to mention it’s just another body that droplets can get on, or her clothes, and spread to other parts of the house. I don’t want our other roommate or myself to have a higher chance of exposure, and his gf coming over means now two people in our house could potentially spread it to us.

gotw1hp5	This just happened tonight and I feel quite conflicted.  Me and two of my coworkers were staying late tonight, cleaning concessions after a long shift. We were all pooped, but goofing off and trying to stay in high spirits while we cleaned.  Our concessions area was closed, we were not giving food to anyone and the doors were locked. There were only a few people in the theater besides us.  As my coworker, who I'll call "Jay", was taking out the trash, I was going to clean a soda machine and overheard a conversation between a few girls.  One girl in particular, who I'll call "Alice", was looking at her phone, and loudly said, "oh my god, where is this bitch? She better hurry the fuck up our we're leaving without her." A few minutes later, a girl emerges from the bathroom and rushes to join up with them. The group goes for the doors, but Alice stayed behind. Jay comes back from taking out the trash, and she approaches him, and asks for his Snapchat.  This is immediate red flag to me. Asking someone out during their work shift, AFTER HOURS.  He says he doesn't have it. Phew.  "Oh, can I get your number?"  He seemed to be tripping over his words, so I answered for him.  "I'm sorry but we're trying to do our job right now."  She looked ashamed, started leaving and then he told her to wait and caught up to her, and exchanged numbers. Me and my other coworker, who just witnessed this go down, go to the back and discuss.  I told him about what she said about her friend, and that I didn't want her to treat Jay that way, and he agreed. He also felt that it was weird and inappropriate of her to ask him out during closing time.  Jay comes back and I tell him what went down, what she said to her friend and why I was trying to get her to leave, but he blew me off.  I went to the back, clocked out, and as I was leaving, I overheard him asking a female coworker for advice on the situation. He said he was going to ask her to hang out. I came back to talk to them and told her about what the girl said, and she agreed that it was a bad idea for him to get mixed up with this girl.  He looked pretty pissed and wouldn't talk to me, so I just left.  TL;DR told a girl to leave my coworker alone when she attempted to ask him out (after overhearing her being rude behind her friend's back), he didn't like that.	1642827847.0	s9uolx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9uolx/aita_for_rejecting_someone_for_my_coworker/	AITA for rejecting someone for my coworker?
iw7bjsgg	I (17M) own a discord server with some of my friends. The server is decently populated (about 400 something members) and that means we have members from all around the world.   This one guy from the UK named “Kepler” was in a VC with us and about 4 other members. We were trash talking and joking around.   Now before you tell me my roast is overused and trash, you’re right. It is very trash, but I was tired and had no other roasts. So, I made fun of the British accent by saying “Chewsday Innit” and roasting the brits’ teeth. He then got pissed and went on a rant about how America has bad healthcare, he wanted another 9/11, and that America vile racist nary and us Americans should be ashamed to exist. I waited for him to stop his rant so I could tell him that I’m not American, but Canadian. I unfortunately couldn’t as he called me a racial slur (the one used against Africans, which is weird because I’m Asian) and left the vc.  I thought we were just joking around and having fun, but it seems like he didn’t think my joke was funny. I feel like I provoked him and that I’m an asshole.

dz3kwght	I (F26) has a friend (F26) that I knew since middle school. Let’s call her Jenny. We were best friends through out middle school and high school. I went to college that was an hour away from our home town. Jenny would visit often but we slowly growth apart like childhood best friend normally would. Here’s the thing and please don’t judge me for saying this. Jenny and I grow up on extremely different path. I live the traditional life. You know the usual college, 9-5 life and now engaged at age 26. My fiancé and I bought a house and we love to stay home with our dog. Our hobby is playing board games with our friends. Jenny on the other hand love to live life. She love night club and rave events. Our life style is very different but I still hold her very dearly to my heart. Last year she introduced me to a friend. Let’s call her Fran. I like Fran at first. She’s sorta in the middle between my life style and Jenny. Fran told me her mom died when she was younger. She grew up in poverty and didn’t have much as a child. Fran told me her biggest dream is to marry a rich man who can provide her with a nice house and a family.  Fran become obsessed with my life. She would always say thing like I wish I live in your house or I wish I found a man like your fiancé. I wish I had your job, your clothes and so on. As you can predict what happened next. Fran started to seduced my fiancé when we all would be together. One time She ask him if he want to come over her house. She claims she was drunk and didn’t mean it. After awhile I just couldn’t take her anymore and kindly told her that it would be best if we just live separate lives. Jenny is also aware of the whole situation since she would often be hanging out with all of us. Jenny stopped being friend with Fran for awhile. However, out of the blue Jenny became friends with Fran again. I didn’t say anything since we are adults & I can’t tell people to not hang out for my sake. Since Jenny is always hanging out with Fran. I don’t see Jenny often anymore.  When I got engaged Jenny was quickly assumed that she’s going to be my MOH &told everyone about it. Jenny started inviting people without my consent including Fran. I was furious with her because my fiancé and I want to have a small wedding. I know I would offended Jenny if I don’t ask her to be MOH. However, I don’t really want to. We are not as close as we used to anymore and I need MOH to help me with the wedding. Most importantly my fiancé does not like Jenny because of the whole Fran situation. I don’t want to offend Jenny to the point that I consider not having any bridesmaid. FYI I know that if I don’t ask Jenny she might even stop being friend with me afterward. Not gonna lie I’m still very bitter with the whole situation with Fran and feel a bit betrayed by Jenny even though I know I shouldn’t be since we are all adults here and grudge is not a good thing but I can’t help it. Am I the asshole?	1642828266.0	s9usvo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9usvo/aita_for_not_asking_my_long_term_friend_to_be_my/	AITA for not asking my long term friend to be my MOH?
7ckjxkot	Gonna try to keep this short. My girlfriend doesn't know what a healthy sex life looks like because of the many abusers of her past who more or less forced her to do things she doesn't want. After three years of only the most cautious of suggestions our sex life has devolved into one position, usually when she's drunk, and often transactional. I've tried to tell her that I enjoy foreplay, kinks, and playful, fun sex but it falls on deaf ears because sex is none of those things to her. It's a chore that is best completed as quickly as possible.  Recently I expressed my frustration with her and she ultimately suggested we go to couples' therapy. Us going to couples therapy before we're even married seems like a red flag to me, but she believes it would be good for us, and she may be right.  The thing is, I know what a healthy sex life looks like for me, and while I know my gf has serious issues to work through, I don't want to sit through hours of therapy just to have someone tell me what I already know and what I've been trying to push my gf toward (gently) for years.  I feel like her issues, such as she's unable to discuss with them me, are her own to deal with and my presence in therapy is redundant and potentially unhelpful. I could understand sitting in for a session or two, but constant therapy feels like overkill to me and I don't want to do it.  I feel like an asshole, but some third-party feedback might help push me toward the right choice. Thanks in advance, and be kind please.	1642828904.0	s9uznu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9uznu/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_couples_therapy/	AITA for not wanting to go to couples' therapy?
cjfcx56q	I 19M 18F so this was my first ever relationship ever. Been taking my time for relationships because I felt I wanted to be my best self before getting someone else involved. Little about me, both my parents are marriage councilors, both majored in phycology in college. Dad has doctorate in phycology, mom has master. So needless to say I grew with a lot of emotional intelligence from both my parents. Back to the story my then first GF when we first started dating I was very into her, but as time went on I started noticing red flags. Cheated on her EX he never found out, had some father issues. She was very codependent always having to call her, text her etc. If I did not do these things should would start to panic, freak out, also struggled with depression. I really did try my best to help her through all of these different problems, I told her all the things that I had learned from my parents on what to say and do with some one who has depression. Things like you cant keep telling yourself that you are miserable, because that is what could be making you miserable the mind is very powerful. Or about her being to codependent saying "Hey I really need some time to be myself" she would freak out, I would say sorry and keep texting/talking on the phone. So after trying to help her through this, I thought why am I trying if she is clearly not receiving it, she keeps on going on to be on the same path. I eventually started to get angry with her that she was not doing anything that I have said to try and  help her, after I talked with my parents about this they said that is me now being codependent. People cant be helped if they dont reach out their hand to you. Now later after the relationship I am seeing how many people are in these exact kind of situation that I was in, F has a ton of emotional baggage the M being there rock and supporting them through everything so AITA for not doing more if this is the only kind of relationship that I can expect?

The relationship ended pretty roughly because I really didn’t know what I wanted in life and needed some time to be on my own. He moved on pretty quick and now has a gf. I saw him and the gf not to long ago and I got the vibe that he still felt the same way about me.

a2sgcx1n	Posting on behalf of my sister since she doesn’t use Reddit (I personally don’t think she’s the TA.)  The Halloween after I graduated HS (9 years ago) I went to a party that got crazy and needed a change of clothes. My friend lent me a dress to wear home.   I tried getting together with her to return the dress, but it never worked out. She kept saying “next time”, “no rush”, etc. I moved to another state, but visit home 1-3 times a year. I always brought the dress with me to return it, she never made time to meet up during my visits. This went on for 9 years. She would say next time I visit, we’d meet up.  Few months ago I was cleaning out my closet and decided to donate the dress. It didn’t occur to me to tell her because the last time I visited in Dec ‘21 she never replied to my message to meet up.   Last night, she started bombarding me with texts that she urgently needs the dress back. She said that her grandma gave her the dress and it’s the one year anniversary of her death and she wants the dress back.  Before anyone asks, it honestly never occurred to me to ask if she wanted the dress mailed to her because I visit so often, and she never brought up mailing the dress either. I also had no idea grandma gave her the dress.  AITA for getting rid of the dress? I feel like I am but I genuinely tried to get the dress back to her. I went to the thrift store I took it to (it was long gone) and I’ve been scouring online for a replacement.	1642831054.0	s9vlnd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vlnd/aita_for_getting_rid_of_a_friends_dress/	AITA for getting rid of a friend’s dress
15rk5c	In July of 2021, I took over running a small business. I’m the only employee, however, a woman who runs her own small business leases one of the rooms. When I was first hired, I was told my job was to run my business and that I had no obligation to help her with anything. I was also told that beside her room, she has access to the waiting area, bathroom, washer and dryer, and a small storage room but she was not to make any changes and my business had primary use.   Things started off okay but then I quickly found that she seemed to be trying to assert her dominance there (she has been there for 2 years). She went as far as to rearrange parts of my space, tell me how to do my job, take my wash out mid cycle to do hers causing me to run out of supplies, and demand I do parts of her job for her. I’m good at standing up for myself so I don’t let her bully me, and eventually some things got better, while others I’m still struggling with. Like her trying to make me take care of her clients.   I arrive at work 45 minutes before I open, and I need every bit of that time to prepare for the day. I keep the door locked to avoid distractions. Well, she has started taking her first appointment 30 minutes before I open, and has been leaving the door unlocked. This causes people to come in and ring the bell for service which interrupts me, and the clients are very demanding with asking me for things and asking questions. I’m a people pleaser so I try to help, but lately I’ve been late opening more than once which inconveniences my guests. I finally told the other woman that I can’t keep doing this and the door was going to stay locked until I open and it’s up to her to be watching for her guests or have them call when they arrive so she can let them in and relock the door. She kind of scoffed and didn’t say anything.   The next day, shortly after she arrived, I decided to check the door and sure enough, she had left it unlocked. So I locked it. A short time later, her first client approached and tried to walk in, but found the door locked. So this is where I might start to be the AH. I walked away without acknowledging the guest and finished my opening duties. I found out later that the lessor never came to the door and her client ended up leaving. That same client left a bad review for both her business and mine. It’s also worth mentioning that the client knew she was supposed to call if the door is locked and tried several times with no answer. The owners of my business are split, one thinks I should have just sucked it up and done what she wanted to avoid bad publicity, the other is firmly on my side and said she shouldn’t have expected me to work for her.  It’s also worth mentioning that I have told her clients (nicely) several times that I don’t work for the other women and while I will help if I have the time, I have no obligation to.  Her clients are generally very entitled people.	1642831251.0	s9vntk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vntk/aita_for_causing_the_business_i_run_to_get_a_bad/	AITA for causing the business I run to get a bad review?
6hk9o4my	I know the title sounds bad but bare with me. I (18f) go randomly paired with my roommate N (18f). I’m straight and she’s bi and I feel like she sexualizes me.   I’m confused because I’ve never felt like this with any of my friends who are almost all bi or lesbian, and we all feel comfy changing and in our underwear in front of each other. With N I don’t feel comfy.   Sometimes when I change I’ll look over and see she’s watching me or she’ll act weird when questions are asked - once we were playing a card game and the card was “have you ever had a sexual fantasy about someone in the room” she looked at me and didn’t give a straight answer.

ck7mbc11	My bf has a female bestie who has no filter with him, tells him almost everything and feels like I ruined their friendship.. (based on what he told her. He couldn’t set a boundary without making me the big evil bad guy. I don’t think he understood where I was coming from)  I just want to know if I’m wrong for feeling disrespected if he wants to be there for her and hang out one on one with her. Go to bars/ restaurants to talk about her problems  Yeah she doesn’t like me lol she feels as though I took her bestie away 🙁 She wanted to move out with him. They work at the same job and everything. We’ve had a lot of arguments over this girl but right when I figured I was being incredibly insecure I found a text that said “that’s what happens when you have an insecure gf” bc my bf didn’t text her back while he was on a date with me..   He said that it’s not disrespectful at all and probably just thinks I’m being controlling.

iw8l2snd	I 22F am pregnant with (my first) bf’s 60M third child. We’ve been together for four years and things have been great. He’s a surgeon and I’m in my first year of medical school, so we live very busy lives. We recently found some extra time to visit his parents. They’re excited to have another grandchild and have been hounding us to visit for dinner. For reference, I’m pescatarian and have been since I was 15. Ive suffered from two eating disorders in the past, which contributes to my “tiny” frame. This is relevant to the following.  My bf’s mom is extremely aware I don’t eat any meat. We made it clear multiple times in the past (and before we came over). She’s never actually cooked for me though, until the night we were invited over.   When we got to dinner, I noticed my dolmeh (I think that’s what it’s called) looked a bit off. Before eating, she claimed she omitted the meat. As soon as I took a bite I knew. I quickly spat it out. His mom literally, laughed at me and said “the little meat wouldn’t hurt you. You could use it.” His dad then started berating me for disrespecting their culture by spitting out the food. My boyfriend obviously stood up for me and we ended up leaving. However, I’m starting to feel like I’m TA because his sister and other family have been blowing us up about how disrespectful I am and how he should get full custody and leave after the child is born.  All of this has been increasing my stress levels. My bf tries his best to ensure me I’m not at fault, but I somehow feel I am.	1642832901.0	s9w3lh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9w3lh/aita_for_disrespecting_my_bfs_persian_culture/	AITA for disrespecting my bf’s Persian culture?
86wq3160	Recently I was in a conversation with a group of African Americans, and as a Caucasian, I noticed something was awry. There was a foul odor and I couldn't trace it's source, until I realized what was different. Usually I spend time around other Caucasians, and I've never noticed any peculiar odors. So I spoke up and said,  "Y'all smell that shit? It smells like shit in here." They looked at me funny, then I came to a terrible realization, the "aroma" was from them! They said they couldn't smell anything.  "I think it's you guys. Y'all smell like shit." But then \*they\* turned it into a race thing, they got apprehensive and asked me to leave, one of them even blocked me and told his "brothers" to cut contact with me.

71eoguxj	Me and my friend have an ongoing dispute about the above mentioned situation and looking for some 3rd party insight. At the time I was a 25m and a virgin. My dad came into some money and gave me enough to hire a lady of the evening since I was too shy/scared to get the job done in the traditional sense. It took me a month to work up the nerve to set up the "date". That is how insecure I was. Then on the night it was scheduled to happen, I get a call from my best friend that his grandpa had died that day. He was a 26m and was a virgin as well  and just as shy insecure as I was. So he knew the fortitude it took me to set up the "date". In fact he had been listening to me pro/con it for the last month. He encouraged me to sack up and do it. So when he called to cry on my shoulder both on the phone and possibly in person I told him, no can do tonight was the night and if I backed out now I might never again. So I hung up on him. Now to elaborate on my friends point of view  he was the only child of a single mother and his grandparents were as close to him as his mom and were in his life nearly 100% since he was born. His grandpa was for all intent and purposes his surrogate father. So very close. Now my "date" arrived she was not as advertised (10yr old photo type of thing) but I still cleaned the pipes. However, I was very not satisfied. So I got another advance from my dad and set up another visit from a little higher tier "date". So when my friend called the next day, my shoulder was still not available. Second time was MUCH better. Now I made it to the funeral and all that but my friend still is mad at me to this day. He says first one made me a jerk, second one makes me TA. What does subgroup say?	1642834304.0	s9wh4k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9wh4k/aita_for_choosing_a_sex_worker_over_my_grieving/	AITA for choosing a sex worker over my grieving best friend?
d8c6nmlo	AITA for thinking my adult step sister wanted me to seduce her?  At Christmas time my. Whole family gathered at my parents. The day after Christmas I heard something coming from my step sisters room. I thought she called my name. I knocked.. but no reply. I kept listening and I heard like she might be in distress having breathing problems. So I just opened the door.  Next thing I know my step sister yells “WHAT ARE YOU DOING STEP BRO!?”  She has this huge pink dildo in her hands and her legs spread, I now know the breathing was from heavy masturbating.  Second while she was panicking she accidentally turned up the volume on her speakers and I could hear she was watching step sibling porn.  At first I was very weirded out, I backed out slowly apologized and close the door.  The more I thought about what happened the more turned on I became. Later that night we went family got rubbing and my dad and step mom decided to go to bed leaving myself and my adult step sister in the hot tub alone. I couldn’t handle it anymore. I leaned in for a kiss, I knew she wanted me.  She screamed in disgust once again “WHAT ARE YOU DOING STEP BRO?!”  I told her I thought she wanted me due to the porn she was watching.  She called me a pig and said that she was only watching that because it had her favourite actor in it.  She told my step mom and dad now they won’t speak to me.  AITA or was I right to assume she might have wanted me?	1642834957.0	s9wnk6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9wnk6/aita_for_thinking_my_adult_step_sister_wanted_me/	AITA for thinking my adult step sister wanted me to seduce her?
iw9x5tgm	Ever since we (I am a 23M and he is a 24M) we’re young boys, we wrestled naked. We thought nothing sexual of it, at least I didn’t. He was always more affectionate towards me than the other boys, and he always kissed me on the cheek. I thought he was just being friendly towards me, however I now realize that I was indeed thinking wrong.  He was acting strange for the past week. It was amplified and I was feeling confused and I wanted to speak to him immediately.  I go to his home and ask him why the hell he’s been acting so strange, and he confesses his love to me. I was frozen in shock for what felt like minutes until he started to make out with me. I pushed him off of me and screamed at him. I told him that we’re just friends, to stop acting so gay, and that I’m straight.  I drove home and blocked his number after he kept calling me. But no matter how far I’m away from him I still feel so violated and disgusted. Looking back on our childhoods most certainly isn’t helping. It’s been hours, but I can’t fall asleep and all I can think about is what happened.

47k78r1m	There is a similar story right now, but My situation is a bit different - I would be happy for a judgement.   Please note, Im not an non english native speaker and Im on mobile.   A bit of background I (35 F) wfh, Mo-Fr, Weekends and Holidays off. Typical 9-5, but a bit more flexible in the times.  My BF (38 M) is a chef. He works Th-Mo. Starts between 10am-2pm. He finishes between 8pm and 11pm.   After getting home, he rewinds a bit (~30 min), eats, get a shower,… after that we watch some TV. I will leave for bed at ~11pm.   Depending on the shift/schedule we have between 0 and 2 hours together.  > Im pretty much alone @home in the evenings every day, except Tu/We   His friend B (~35 M) called yesterday. The friend B is selling grills and does some catering on the side.   This friend is planning a ‚how to grill course‘. It will be ‚grilling and drinking‘ event, with teaching before.   B invited my BF to the ‚grilling and drinking‘ as a Birthday present. BF wants to go, but has no clue what is going on regarding ‚the thing‘ by May.    Birthday of my BF > Wednesday  ‚grilling and drinking‘ > the following Saturday   I have no problems with that friend B. He is the buddy of my BF, but there is no bad blood or anything between us.   So the thing is: We (BF & me) can celebrate on his actual birthday for going out in the evening. No party, since both of us have to work the next day.  On the Saturday following the birthday, he wanted to throw a party. Same day as the ‚grill and drink’ event. Now he thinks: no party, I go to the grill and drink event.   Depending on the schedule the event will probably start around noon (there is some teaching upfront) and go til midnight or later. It will become a (birthday) party at some point in the evening. BF will sleep at Bs house after.  Now my question:  I feel hurt, that he is thinking of having the birthday party with his buddy and without me.   Im aware that I could join in the evening or something. But since we have two dogs, we need to drive back home > no drinking for me.   If we have a party at our place, at least 5 people could sleep here easily.    WIBTA if I confront him about that? It is his birthday, not mine….	1642836977.0	s9x5tj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9x5tj/wibta_if_i_confront_my_bf_regarding_his_birthday/	WIBTA If I confront my BF regarding his birthday plans?

43dyqnng	 Ok, this is ABSOLUTE fucking bullshit. I went to see Cars in the theater yesterday, and when Lightning McQueen got HOT with Sally in Radiator Springs, my boner engaged. When Lightning McQueen said 'Ka-Chow!', I couldn't help it!!! I closed my eyes, and I TORE my dick to shreds, using whip like motions and pulled with great force. That was one of the best nuts I ever had, just thinking about it now gets me riled up. Thing is, I nutted all over the kid sitting right next to me, and his mom got all pissed at me, screaming at me for jacking off on her son. I told that bitch to shut the fuck up, and that jacking off is a natural, artistic, and beautiful process. You should BE HAPPY that my semen is all over your son, maybe he can learn a lesson or two about the culture and art of jacking off. HOWEVER, the movie theater managers didn't agree with me. They KICKED ME OUT of the movie theater, and I didn't even finish watching the Cars movie. Not only THAT, but they made me clean up my semen after it already dried out and solidified on the seats. THATS TORTURE!! Do you know how hard it is to clean semen after its dried out? You CLEAN semen after its FRESH out of your cock, not an hour after you fucking nutted. This is a fucking OUTRAGE. Do you really expect me to not whip out my cock and jack off when i see a HOT sex scene in a movie? Either don't ban sex scenes in movies, or LET ME jack off in your theater, assholes.	1642837036.0	s9x6ak	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9x6ak/aita_for_enjoying_a_movie_scene/	AITA For Enjoying a movie scene?
iwbjtnoe	My roommate (18F) and I (19F) were hanging out in a secluded corner of the library and talking.  A guy we know (20M) who just feeds on starting drama and causing problems suddenly sat down by us. He started unwanted flirting with my roommate and telling her sexual jokes.  She called him gross and said he’s not her type. I’m pretty by that she meant obnoxious and vulgar. My roommate identifies as non-binary and pansexual, so then he said “I thought you’re pansexual, meaning you’re supposed to be into everyone. So I guess it’s because I’m black.”  She was like “no, you’re just the worst.” And then he said “I bet you call people the N word.” And she said no. He said “I bet you say it alone in your car when you’re listening to music, and you think that’s okay.” She denied it. And he said “Maybe I should go tell everyone you’re saying the N word when you sing rap songs in your car and see what they think.”  And I said “Go ahead. We’ll deny it and tell everyone then that you’ve been calling her queerphobic slurs since she’s nonbinary and pansexual.” He was like “how dare you? And no one would care anyway because no one cares about ‘queerphobia.’” Which isn’t true. I could definitely get some outrage going if I started talking to all the activist kids around here.	1642837384.0	s9x9im	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9x9im/aita_for_saying_ill_lie_about_someone_using_slurs/	AITA for saying I’ll lie about someone using slurs?

fovus3wm	For context my parents are separated- basically have always been separated. My mom raised me alone and my dad was in and out of jail and mostly MIA. I have two older half sisters on my father’s side. We were all raised by our mothers/ step-parents. My dad wasn’t in the picture for any of us.  My oldest sister (31F) has never really made an effort to be in my life. The other (25F) lives in Puerto Rico and we have never even met eachother. I have only heard about her from both of my parents.  I was an only child for most of my life until my brother was born when I was 10. I always wished for a relationship with my half sisters, especially the sister I had never met. I often wondered what she was like, if she looked like me, etc. A few months ago, I finally found her Facebook profile and requested her.  She accepted it very quickly so I saw that as a good sign. I messaged her and basically asked if she knew who I was, and she said No. (There was a bit of a language barrier) I told her I was her sister on her dad’s side and she told me she had never even knew about me, she only knew about our older sister. I was absolutely stunned, confused and heartbroken. The conversation was short and very awkward and I basically just told her I was so happy to speak to her, she said the same…and we’ve never talked since.   I’m furious at my father. I haven’t spoken to him in so many years, although he has tried to reach out to me via both Jail Mail and Facebook. I don’t think I will ever speak to him again, but I am wondering if I would be an asshole for cutting him off entirely for this. He has no idea that I’ve found this out, and I don’t even know how or what I would say to him.	1642837762.0	s9xcjy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xcjy/wibta_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_father_after_i/	WIBTA for refusing to talk to my father after I learned he’s kept me a secret from my half sister?
ivp22c5g	Me (M34), my siblings and cousins play in a softball league. It isn't a competitive league and the goal is to just have fun and talk shit to each other about how we all suck at softball. There are 13 of us on the team, and you need a min of 10 players to play a game or its an automatic forfeit. Before we all signed up, I told everyone that if you agree to play then you have to try your best to show up to every game. I understand that we all have different priorities but we have to try to show up. We eventually lose 1 guy due to injury, one of my cousin ended up moving to a new city because he started a new job. Which brings us down to 11 players. We play 2 games a week, and my older brother can only make 1 game a week due to his work schedule.  Our team sucks, and we were eliminated from making the playoffs. My cousin Joe (M26) decides that he is going to quit because we aren't going to make the playoffs, so it would be pointless to keep playing. I tell him you can't quit because we don't have enough players to field a team and it would result in an automatic forfeit. The problem than would be that the opposing team would not be able to play as well because we would always forfeit by not having enough players. I told him its not about making the playoff, but he has to think about players from the other teams wanting to play too and by him quitting it would affect them and not just our team.   Now me, my siblings and cousins are all very close. We talk trash to each other for fun. I would say our relationship is kind of like "Inside the NBA on TNT" where we constantly give each other a "hard" time. We are all like this except for Joe. Joe hardly ever engages in the trash talk, but when he does he always makes it super personal. Since Joe was quitting I called him selfish and that although he was the youngest he had a "boomer republican mindset" because he only ever thought about himself. My other family members tried to convince him to stay too, but they do it in a much nicer way by telling him to stay cuz we are "family" like vin diesel. Joe says he doesn't need family cuz your more likely to get killed by a person close to you. That he can only count on himself to watch his back. I tell him how can he insinuate that I would kill him. Anyways Joe goes home and tells his dad (my uncle) that I was talking too much shit. My uncle says I need to stop being an asshole to Joe. I said I talked shit but didn't say anything personal. Joe said I made it personal by bringing up his political belief.

i9cvdra7	So, I (F) have a friend(M) who is married and has a kid. I have been friends with him for 4 years. We have a friends group on whatsapp. We (along with other friends) meet like 5-6 times a year on low key days.   Recently this person started talking to me more. He was interested in my work and he wanted to implement a similar solution. So he asked me if we could catch up and help me. Something you should know about me is - I sometimes go above and beyond for people around me.  So I used to make time for him to teach. It is not because of him but more cos of how I am to everyone. I try my best.   He one day told me that had he known I was available to date he would have liked to. Since he comes off as a nice person I totally ignored that remark and moved onto a different conversation. Next time we met, he tried to hug me. I am not a hugger but some people hug. Nothing was weird with it but I hate hugging men(even lightly) unless its my boyfriend/dad/brother. So I was always cautious never to be close enough to hug when after we are exiting.  The next week, some other friends hosted potluck. The guy called me after I was back from potluck if I can catch up for coffee. I said he can come home and try my food. He was complaining and crying about his wife's attitude and feels left out. After few conversations. out of nowhere he mentioned he had wet dreams about us. I am shocked and did not know how to react. I let it slide so I could get him  out of the house and think what to do ( I was honestly not expecting this).  After 2 days of thinking what to do next, I messaged him that it was inappropriate of him to say what he said and I do not want him to ever contact me. Also blocked him everywhere.  One of my friend is making me feel bad that me being nice is like a big banner for people to violate my personal space and IATA for leading on (which is not true).  She also told me that should have kicked out the person the first time they said something stupid. So give me the verdict. I am feeling terrible.	1642841474.0	s9y8y8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9y8y8/aita_for_not_telling_my_aggressor_to_get_out_of/	AITA for not telling my aggressor to get out of my house
as43ng3a	Obligatory apology for formatting.   Back in November my(20f) fiancé(21m) got an incredible job offer with some not so incredible hours. Those being 17 days on and 13 days off. He’d be gone for 17 days going all over the place for his job each month. We figured we’d make it work- seeing as we were unwavering in our feelings for each other- the time apart wouldn’t change that.   He left a bit after Christmas for this trip, which meant he’d be gone for New Years. Part of the job. He got stuck in a city for two days due to cancelled flights with nothing to do. He called me the morning of and told me he planned to spend time with his uncle who lived in the city- not a problem. What was a problem was the fact we’d not talked in 3 days for more than 2 hours including texts, and that I didn’t get any time with him to talk during the two days he was off. In the evening of the second day, I called to talk for a little bit, to which he told me he was busy getting ready to go have dinner with his uncle. I asked him if we could talk and he said if he wasn’t too tired when he got back to the hotel then we could. I brought up the fact we’d not talked much in the past days and was hoping he could stay in, order food, and spend time talking to me. He proceeded to call me selfish for expecting that of him and wanting him to stay holed up in his hotel room- though he’d been out with his uncle for the past two days all day.   It turned into an argument that I figured we’d resolved, but it bothered him enough that it bottled up and exploded one night to where he called me clingy and told me he wasn’t sure if the relationship would work. He loves me, but he can’t deal with the clinginess.   I said I understood and we agreed we’d work it out, cause we really love each other- but lately I’ve been thinking and it doesn’t make sense. How am I selfish for wanting just a couple of hours to talk when he had two whole days?? How am I clingy when I went 4 days without speaking for more than 2 to 2-½ hours including texts with him without complaint??   I don’t know, maybe I should’ve been more patient and dealt with it. Left it be and not made the conflict.  AITA or “selfish and clingy”??	1642841789.0	s9ybk4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ybk4/aita_for_wanting_my_fiancé_to_spend_time_with_me/	AITA for wanting my fiancé to spend time with me?
iwdd1y9i	So in my house, we had a coffee maker/kettle that broke a while back. So a few months later, I decided  to rent one and needed to return it. So I sent this message to my house in our groupchat  "Hey everyone, using this to make coffee and need to return it in 2 months. Feel free to use it but just to be abundantly clear, I do not value any of your lives worth more than a bill, if you break it, we will have problems".  It was meant to be a joke but another housemate said 'hey, I get you don't want to folks to break it but you can word it without sounding like a threat or dismissing our lives, kind of makes you sound like an asshole bluntly"  So AITA or is he overreacting	1642841861.0	s9yc32	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yc32/aita_for_telling_my_housemates_their_lives_are/	AITA for telling my housemates their lives are worth less than a bill to me?
iwcae7nb	I’m the type of person who is very big on giving gifts, but especially for Christmas, and it is most definitely my love language. Now, I don’t expect gifts in return unless it is discussed between me and that friend. In fact, I’m perfectly content with my friends being open with me and telling me they’re not able to give me a gift in return, or us never having that conversation in general and I still give them a gift! I love surprising my friends and make it known I don’t expect or want anything in return!!  But here’s the current situation that makes me feel like an asshole: I have a friend with the fake name John. John and I discussed exchanging gifts all the way back in October of 2021, he originally suggested on a $100 limit on each other. Which is a great deal of money considering we are college students, but it was feasible to me considering I was working at the time and took a semester off school to focus on making money. Plus I LOVE giving my friends gifts, definitely not financially responsible of me. About a month or two later I brought up the $100 limit and suggested we knocked it down to $50, only because he was away at college at the time and I knew he wasn’t working.  Well, he finally comes home for college and we meet up a week after Christmas. I bring my gift to his house and watch him excitedly open it, it was a record player for his collection of vinyl that he has never gotten to actually listen to before. He’s just a major stan and I knew he planned on buying a record player eventually.  He apologizes and said he never had time to buy me a gift, which I understand, college is pretty time consuming. He states that he’ll send me money through an app we use. Well a couple days go by and I assumed he had either forgotten or simply didn’t have the money, which in that case was okay. If he didn’t have the money I would never even mention it to him and just drop it. But after i shared the story to my best friend, who is also a mutual friend, she told me he had been posting himself shopping and has been to multiple of the local restaurants in our area everyday since i’ve last seen him.  I then requested the price of the record player from him, and I even reminded him of the request through the app a week later. He has been avoiding me but is obviously active on social media. Money is a super touchy subject for me as a person who didn’t grow up with much and it makes me feel like an asshole to ever mention it.  I’m sorry if this is dumb I kinda just need feedback if I’m being petty.	1642842269.0	s9yfwu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yfwu/aita_for_being_upset_at_a_friend_for_not/	AITA for being upset at a friend for not receiving a gift back?
iwe35g0t	My (40f) son Matt (18m) lives with me. His father is not in his life. He left when Matt was 12. Ever since, Matt has become reckless. Failing grades, going out drinking, etc. His curfew was 12am, but now because of his behavior, I am changing it to 9pm. I know he's 18, but he still lives under MY house. Until he can get a place of his own, he needs to obey my rules.   Thing is, Matt didn't take kindly to this. He's started opposing me in almost every way, such as starting parties once I'm gone or calling my cuss words. I confronted him as to why hates his mother so much, to the point where I cried. He dried my tears and said he's a monster and probably needs therapy. I told him he's my beautiful boy and I love him. For some reason, he took me to his room to show me something.  From that point on, he slowly unzips his pants and shoes his 9 inch cock in front of me. I haven't seen his cock since he was a 10-year-old boy. I didn't realize it became that big. Then, he tied my wrists and dicked me down on his bed. He fucked my pussy until his cum was all over it. He shoved his big dick in my mouth until it was down my throat until I gagged and puked all over it. He licked my puke off and stuck his fingers in my ass.   He fucks my armpit and cums on it, licking the cum off my armpit. Then he tossed my salad and licked my leftover shit (I just pooped an hour before this and forgot to wipe) and kisses me afterwards. He fucked my eyeball until blood leaked on his cock and now I'm blind. He fucked my ear too. Stuck his cock inside it and now his manhood is full of earwax. A week later he gave me STDs and cancer.   But I still didn't lift his curfew. He got angry and drove off. AITA for giving him a stricter curfew?	1642842502.0	s9yhs1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yhs1/aita_for_giving_my_son_a_stricter_curfew/	AITA for giving my son a stricter curfew?
a8op4qvh	My mother and I recently moved into a new place and we're supposed to receive rental assistance on behalf of the government. My mom has had this assistance for 19 years and has to keep the agency updated on when/where she’s moving so they can approve the assistance and begin paying a small portion.  However, my mother forgot to send them the updated information on us moving and caused us to lose the assistance as the deadline had expired. My mother was also waiting on documents to be sent to her from the agency, which they sent in an email, but she did not see the email which prompted us to lose the assistance.  I work 40 hours a while my mom works 12. I see her on Facebook, dating apps, and Amazon every day. I feel like she could have set a reminder on her phone or contacted the rental assistance agency. On top of this, I reminded her throughout December to update the rental assistance information and she would reply with “ok.” Well, she did not update the information and now the assistance was revoked.   Today, my mother said that I should have come to her in December and asked her to “fill me in on all the details” so she would tell me what’s going on because she has a lot to remember. She claims that I should be monitoring her email too. However, I work 40+ hours a week so most of the time I’m sleeping and she could have easily texted me so I could set a reminder.   Then, she tells me that she’s depressed, has no money, and needs me to take out a loan of $30,000 for her so she can “set herself straight.” She was given $27,000 from a car accident settlement last year and spent it all somehow. So now she wants me, a college student, to take out a loan so she can pay her credit cards, use the credit cards for her rent, and pay the loan back monthly. She also goes on to say that she “eats out every day and buys random things to make herself happy.”   She believes that if I had gotten a loan for her, then she wouldn’t have been depressed and forgotten to update the rental assistance information. Last year she was trying to buy a house on my credit and now wants me to take out the biggest loan possible so she can rebuild her finances. On top of this, she needs me to review her finances and help her save and fix where she went wrong. And I don’t mind sitting down with her and strategizing her finances!   TLDR; I am against taking out loans because when I transfer to a university in the fall, I’ll need my loans to pay for school/rent expenses! But the household has hit a stagnant position on behalf of my mother and I’m not sure if I’m the asshole? Plus she doesn’t have much money left and mistakenly let the rental assistance expire.	1642843483.0	s9yqkr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yqkr/aita_for_not_reminding_my_mother_to_check_her/	AITA for not reminding my mother to check her email and giving her money?
itmg0hku	Me (16 F) and my partner who I'll call E (17 M)  My grandma (64 F) all went on a trip together and everything was going okay until just a few days in when my grandma said while I was getting ready with E, "you better be brushing your hair in there, you look homeless when you dont." I got annoyed and extremely embarrassed since E was there and I say "I'm brushing my hair right now but even so it's up to me if I want to brush my hair or not" She responds "yeah well I bet your boyfriend thinks you look horrible too" Still trying my best to keep composure but not really succeeding "don't put words in his mouth,  I don't care what others say or think about me in public either."  She responds again with a slight yell "yeah well I won't let you leave if you go out looking homeless, you'll embarrass me and yourself if you do."  I had it. E walks in the bathroom and whispers at me just to ignore her and not respond but I yell back "you know what? What if someone told you that you looked horrible"  She says "I don't really care" And I tell her "then why do you care so much to tell me that I look bad?" "I dont care how you look I don't know why you're even arguing with me" I was angry and confused at that point "If you don't care then leave me alone and stop yelling at me in front of my boyfriend" I'm at tears at this point, I dont remember what she said because then we were just screaming at eachother A few minutes goes by of my boyfriend standing in front of me and her trying to get around him and get in my face she walks to the door, opens it, tries to grab me and yells "get the hell out." She calls me a bitch and tells me how ungrateful I am for everything she does  I dont even have any shoes on or anything and I have to remind her but she doesn't care "I said get the hell out of this room I don't care what you have or don't have you need to leave." E grabs my shoes and we go, im sobbing in Es arms and he tries his best to comfort me. I pull out my phone and immediately call my dad crying, he helps calm me down and once he hears "she kicked me out of the room" he stops me with a "hold on, she did what?" And tells me he's going to call her and will call me back. I call my stepmom who's currently with my dad because at this point I'm just really upset and would like to know right away what's going on She tells me my grandma is screaming at my dad that I  told her "what if someone said--" and it was really hurtful and practically an insult to her and I hear my father say "mom are you hearing yourself? You basically just insulted her for real and are now angry she asked you how you'd feel if someone did the exact same thing to you"  He then tells her "i don't care, what you're not going to do is kick my 16 year old daughter out of a hotel room and call her a bitch"  She let's me back in and ignores me for the rest of the trip.  I dont know, this all happened on Christmas and I feel like I'm the one who ruined it for her.	1642843545.0	s9yr1b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yr1b/aita_for_ruining_my_grandmas_christmas/	AITA For ruining my grandma's Christmas
iwebggol	I've been teaching for quite a while. I had this student in my class 1-2 years ago, and she was extremely quiet and shy. Never spoke to me unless I talked to her or she had questions about the content.   However, a year after that, her friend was in my class and she started coming around all the time to talk to me. At first she'd visit her friend and not really talk to me, but later she came around to talk just to me.   She did that this year as well. Yesterday, I asked her how her family life is and if her parents are involved with her life and her homework and activities.   I was making small talk, mostly, but I was also curious to know if she saw me as a parental figure or something like that because not even the kids who talked to me most in class came around that often. Like, maybe she just wanted an adult to talk to about things?  She's never told me anything overly personal. She mostly just complains about her classes and projects and asks me how teaching is going and stuff like that, but she seemed offended when I asked her that question.	1642843694.0	s9ys84	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ys84/aita_for_asking_a_student_about_her_life/	AITA for asking a student about her life?
fk9a82lu	So, I'm mid-divorce. I left my husband four and a half years ago, took my kids and moved 1500 miles away. He was an abusive, obnoxious drunk - the environment was toxic and chaotic. So we left. He never fought for our family or even for his kids. A little back story - we went to high school together, dated, broke up, and stayed best friends until we got married. We were happy for a while, then we just weren't. I got incredibly depressed, which just added fuel to his rageful fire. I fought like hell to leave and it took everything I had. Again, no attempts to fix things from him. A little over two years after the move, he came to visit - under the guise of seeing our daughter for her birthday. His real motive was to tell us that he had met someone who he had already been seeing for about six months. Fast forward, they live together now. Our kids are adults and can think for themselves. He disgusts me - he turned into a bad husband and he was and still is a bad father. I won't speak to him - if we absolutely must communicate, it's through text. One of my children has visited him (and the girlfriend) and the other is trying to mend the relationship. There's a part of me that wants them to have a good relationship with him. There's another part of me that wishes they understood the gravity of the decisions that he has made, see him for what he truly is, and cut him off. The question becomes, is it better to have a bad parent or no parent. Am I the asshole because I believe no parent is better than a bad one????	1642844167.0	s9ywhg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ywhg/aita_because_i_dont_like_my_husbands_girlfriend/	AITA because I don't like my husband's girlfriend
if2b68hu	This might be a long one so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom  I (M26) called my friend (F28) friend for cheating on her boyfriend.  About a year ago she ended a 12 year long open relationship and jumped straight into a monogamous relationship 2 days later. It was kind of strange for our friend group seeing as she's been super against monogamy for the 8 years we've known her but we figured it was a rebound and were just glad she was happy.   She talked to us up and down about how this guy was definitely the one for her and she's never been happier but about a month into the relationship she cheated on him with her ex. It was rough but for some reason her new guy decided to work past it. This resulted in her cheating two more times in the coming weeks and they ended up breaking. He blocked her on everything.   For the past 8 months or so she's been a really bad place and I know she struggles with depression and didn't want to rag on her for her mistakes. It seemed like she FINALLY let it go until her new ex contacted her out of blue.   Here's were we get into the conflict. She was over the moon about him reaching out but as she was in the middle of a horrible depression I told her maybe she should wait a day or two before responding because no one knew what he wanted and I was worried if he was coming to vent about how she hurt him it'd only make her feel worse.   Turns out he hit her up trying to get a booty call and it's not at all what she wanted. She ended up flipping out on him for it which resulted in a huge argument between them. She came to me for the emotional support I tend to give and at this point I'd had it.  I told her that as much as it was messed up for him to objectify her like that the only reason any of this is happening is because she cheated on him. She made all these promises to him about a future together knowing she wasn't in the position to live up to any of them. I think I might be an asshole because I told her "these are the kinda dumb prizes you win when you play stupid games"  Now another member of our group is telling me I was too harsh considering that I'm the main one she comes to for support and I'm a bad friend for not consoling her.  TL;DR- Friend chested on her boyfriend then acted like she was the victim. Got mad at me when I called her out on it.	1642844218.0	s9ywv3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ywv3/aita_for_calling_out_friend_for_cheating_and_then/	AITA for calling out friend for cheating and then complaining about.
iweusopw	A red haired mother is in the PA at my daughter’s kindergarten. She obviously has a red haired daughter. Her daughter’s favourite disney princess is the Little Mermaid, and she recently found out that in the live action movie, Ariel will not have red hair, like her, but in fact, be black.   At the next PA meeting, which was the next day, this mother, whom I have spoken to a grand total of once before this, comes up to me and starts venting about diversity in films and how nobody cares about white people. She said that now her daughter doesn’t have any disney princesses that look like her, and because of it was crying for days.   For context, I’m an American. I’m of South korean descent. I kept those 2 separate because I identify as an American, and only as an American. I was irked by her because there are literally 4-5 other disney princesses who are all white, just like her daughter, and i’m not sure abt this, but isn’t there another red haired or ginger disney princess?   I told her, “OMG that’s so terrible, it’s so much worse than my daughter saying she wanted to be a disney princess and being told there aren’t any korean princesses. Not as if you guys have a few different Disney princesses and we literally have none.”   She is shocked that I’m actually back talking to her and looks around for support, but gets none, most of them nodding along with me. She says “Well, the other white princesses don’t have red hair, my daughter doesn’t have anyone who looks exactly like her, it’s fucking unfair!”   I respond “Poor you, my daughter doesn’t have anyone who looks anything like her. The one she loves the most is Rapunzel, and guess what, she has to accept that she will never look anything like her, your daughter can at least look something like another princess.”  “Your daughter has Mulan!” She shrieks. No kidding, genuinely yelled that in a super scratchy voice.   “We are of Korean descent. There are several very distinct differences in the way Mulan looks and how we look, and not just that, but Mulan fights for the Chinese army, not really a representative of all Asians, more for just the Chinese. But if you think all Asians look the same and we should be happy with Mulan, ok, but then you need to be ecstatic with your 5 white princesses, even though you guys don’t look too similar. If you want a movie starring someone who represents you or your daughter perfectly, then let me tell you something we POCs have been hearing for decades, “make your own movies then””   The mom became really flustered and walked off, and according to the husband’s facebook rant, has been silently crying at what I told her. He DMed me and said I should have just “shut your stupid \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mouth and stop complaining about things in a country you chose to move to bitch”   AITA? I don’t think I am but now I’m quite concerned.	1642844945.0	s9z2xm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z2xm/aita_for_going_off_on_a_mother_who_just_wanted_to/	AITA for going off on a mother who just wanted to vent?
dx32j9er	I (15F) am one of two black people in a friend group that's majority white, there is one other POC but he's indian.   Recently, the other black person in the group, one of my best friends said they wanted to address some of the things that the group has done in the past that have made her uncomfortable as a black person.   I've only been in the group for a little under 2 years myself, but I absolutely know what they were referring to because there have been things that were said and done that made me uncomfortable myself.   I immediately gave them my support and said I'd stand by them no matter what, I then talked to another friend of ours, they're white but also got excited that we were addressing these issues and said they wanted to support us too.   The next day during our lunch break, my friend called a sort of group meeting and explained that we wanted to set some boundaries. Long story short the discussion went horribly, two people in particular berated my friend and I and said we made the whole group uncomfortable and ruined our break (I know this isn't true because they were the only ones uncomfortable in the whole situation and our lunch break continued as normal afterwards, nothing was ruined) and since then have removed themselves from the group.   On paper, this sounds like a happy ending, but I'm genuinely curious because I don't think im in the wrong. Everyone knows that their move was to try and force an apology out of my friend and I, one I simply refuse to give them, but they've been going around saying it was rude and petty of me to bring up "past issues" in the new year   AITA?   For context: some of the issues we brought up were things like touching our hair after we specifically told them not to, the use of the n-word and demanding that we give them the "n-word pass", insensitive jokes so on and so forth.   One of them in particular was a huge issue, because in a conversation that had nothing to do with it they decided to bring up slavery because and I quote "You two weren't slaves yourselves so why does it bother you so much" and in response to us saying that racism is a huge problem because people that look like us are getting killed simply for being black they responded with "Okay but that's their problem not mine". This one person has also had issues with wanting to use the n-word in the past, claiming that because she has freckles she has melanin and that means she can use the word, even using Google translate to say it around me. Horrible person I know, I probably should have cut her out of my life sooner.   If I'm in the wrong here please put me in my place, should I have done something differently? Is there any advice you could give me, some of my friends haven't been handling the separation well and I want to help as much as I can.	1642844955.0	s9z30p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z30p/aita_for_calling_my_friends_out_for_their_racial/	AITA for calling my friends out for their racial insensitivity?

She gave me a very haughty look and was like “you think you have what it takes to pledge” and said I’m “awfully bold” and that I “wouldn’t get any trade secrets from her.” She started talking about the “divine nine” and how she’s in some sort of elite sorority and it’s the best.  I have never even heard of such a thing, and my first thought was that the “divine nine” sounds like either a fake Harry Potter spell or a cult. So I was like “girlie, I have no interest in joining your little magic club. I was just being polite.”  She was so indignant that I had no idea about her supposed top-tier sorority and have never even heard of it.	1642845189.0	s9z57l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z57l/aita_for_saying_i_dont_wanna_join_your_little/	AITA for saying “I don’t wanna join your little magic club” when a girl accused me of trying to join her sorority?
9eig6cr8	I (16nb) am still upset and a little distant with my dad because of something that happened last summer.   My dad and his fiance (we'll call her R) picked me and my 14 year old brother up for my dad's weekend last summer after months of not seeing us, saying R was sick. She was pregnant, which I understand, but nothing was stopping him from just coming to our house to see us.   Anyways, we were supposed to stay the whole weekend but only stayed a few hours because of an argument that was blown out of hand.   Basically, my brother has ADHD and gets upset when the r word is used. It's been used against him and it really upsets him to hear. I've asked my dad many times not to say it around him. But my dad's not one to listen to that kind of thing.   My dad referred to a pop star as that word and my brother asked him politely not to say it. My dad threw a fit about freedom of speech and whatnot. I'm protective of my brother so when someone screams at him, I can't help but get involved.   I kinda told my dad to back off of him and to respect the small boundary he set. It's one word, not a big deal. So naturally, my dad got in my face and started screaming. Now I have a panic disorder and I don't do well with conflict, so I excused myself and walked off.   Before I got down the driveway, R chimed in and said "if they're gonna be disrespectful, they're not welcome over anymore." Which upset me and my brother, but the fact that my dad didn't say anything to her upset us more.   Anyways my dad followed me screaming and I broke down on the porch. My dad kept screaming even when I was sobbing and hyperventilating. R went to her car and cried on the phone to her mother, my dad went to console her.   He texted my mom to 'come get her kids' and I went home. My dad refused to contact me for almost a month, but then appears. He showed up at our house, with all of our stuff (clothes, blankets, ever our toothbrushes,ect) and leaves them with a word on our porch. I felt like I had been kicked out of his life. Physically and emotionally.   I told him what he did was immature and out of line and that he basically kicked his children out for his girlfriend. He said I was being dramatic, and he didn't kick us out.   The issue has been "resolved." Meaning my dad nor his fiance have actually apologized, and it's been swept under the rug. He's better at not saying things that upset my brother though, which we both appreciate. But he still doesn't come around when he's supposed too, which I understand. He has a new baby and that's stressful but I still feel like he should acknowledge his other children.  None of our stuff has been returned to his house and every time I go over there it feels like I'm not welcome. Like I'm a guest not his kid.  So AITA for still being upset about everything or should I just let it go?	1642845373.0	s9z6n4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z6n4/aita_for_still_being_upsetdistant_with_my_dad/	AITA for still being upset/distant with my dad?
7p1lfqzk	My (F19) mum (F58) and dad (M65) have a small guest house in rural Austria and we moved here from the UK in 2015. Growing up, I was quite privileged in the sense that we would go on holidays at least once every 2 years, I was able to hang out with friends whenever I wanted etc. That changed when we moved. During the summer months, I would be at home helping serve guests and take orders. My summer holidays would usually be 2-3 months and I would only leave the house around 4 times to go to the supermarket. I would be working 7 days a week (unpaid), cleaning all the rooms every morning and serving guests. I was also harassed by local creeps when I was 14 at my own home (I told my mum and she said that we needed money and I should tolerate it). During these years I was incredibly depressed and was almost sent to the hospital for treatment by my school because I missed the UK, I missed my friends and family and everything and I was slacking at school and didn't have many friends because I couldn't communicate in german with anybody. I had nobody here in Austria, and we'd never go back to the UK because we had to stay home during the holidays because we had guests. Those years of depression have passed, but I'm older now and I've met new friends at my new English speaking school. I'm in my senior year, and in September I hope to go back home for university.   So, I have a South African friend at my school who invited me to spend a couple of weeks with her and my other friends in our friend group to Botswana where her grandparents live. I love animals and nature, so I've always wanted to travel to Africa. I wouldn't have to pay for a hotel or anything, just a flight and some pocket money, which I can pay for myself with my trust fund (I know, I'm quite spoiled). My mum thinks it's a stupid idea though, and that she doesn't know what she's going to do with the business without me, and that I need to help. Last summer I only left the house to go to a vet for work experience and around 3 times to the supermarket. Apart from that, I was either in my room or downstairs serving alcohol. My two best friends invited me to their house to celebrate their birthdays (they are twins) and my mum said I couldn't go because of the guests. All my friends from my group went on holiday together, they went to each other's home countries and I couldn't come because I had to work. I remember feeling very left out (they did invite me but I had to decline).  I know this post probably screams rich privilege but I really want to spend some quality time with my friends before we all leave for uni. My mum wants me to stay here.  She insults me all the time and says that I'll never achieve anything and that I'll be on the streets etc. I've never even had a boyfriend, let alone done anything to make her think that I'd be on the streets or something. She says that the business is my responsibility because I'm a part of the family and I have my health unlike her and my dad.	1642845553.0	s9z82q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z82q/aita_for_wanting_to_travel_with_my_friends/	AITA for wanting to travel with my friends instead of helping my family business?
8jcjlhsc	Husband and I had a great date day today. We’ve been trying to do more date days/nights because we’ve been stressing a lot lately and it’s been hard on the marriage.   Today we went to the zoo, went to an arcade, then went to two bars and had a blast! Came home, fooled around and we were SUPPOSED to end the night with cuddling and watching a movie. (Husbands idea BTW)  Husband DECIDED that he was going to have a few more drinks, went into the living room and never came back to the bedroom. Come to find out he’s in the living room hanging out and drinking with our roommate, who is currently off of work so he’s been hanging around the house more than normal. I don’t mind the roommate, but we’re not friends with him we’re just friendly and sometimes he acts overly friendly IMO. (Like tonight)  I asked my husband if he was coming to bed, to which he responded no. Me, trying my best not to be upset that he ditched me and hurt my feelings, just went to bed. A few hours later he comes in the room and wakes me up. Between getting woken up at 2AM and being upset he ditched me for our roommate I gave him attitude. That turned into a fight between us because I told him he hurt my feelings by telling me we would cuddle and watch tv and then not coming back. I feel like that was a mean thing to do.    However, I may be the asshole because maybe I should have just left it alone. We did have a great day, but now it’s ruined.	1642845654.0	s9z99q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9z99q/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_husband_when_ditched/	AITA for getting mad at my husband when ditched me after our date to hang out with our roommate?

gpcqnnyx	As the title says, I got my nipples pierced yesterday. I have been talking about doing it for a long time, and wanted them even longer. My husband is totally against them, hates them, and has already made me have thoughts of removing them. I did make mention to I would remove them if he hated it that bad. But he said "you just paid how much for that?" And I let it go. I tried to make jokes of sort like sweet-talking asking if he would help me clean them and he shuts it down quickly with a sharp harsh no. He will hardly even look at me with my shirt off now, and its made me turn my back when I care for them. It's honestly kinda made me feel uncomfortable in front of him, but yet I don't want to take them out. When I first got home I asked if he would like to see them, again it was the quick sharp no. He drove me to the place and gave me the money after I just would not let it go. A friend said his reason was he is afraid he will break his teeth on them, but 1, hardly ever shows the girls attention, 2 Iv had a tongue ring ever since we met a a long time ago. So the breaking teeth is new for me. He hasn't said this to me, just "he don't like that kind of thing"am I the asshole if I say, he can just get over it, and if it is THAT big of a deal, or he is no longer attracted to me, perhaps we split? Cause I won't take them out.	1642845812.0	s9zapg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zapg/aitah_for_mulling_over_the_thought_of_separation/	AITAH for mulling over the thought of separation over nipple piercings
584as70q	Sorry for the title I did not know how to word it. Here is the situation.  A few days ago I was out having coffee with one of my close friends chatting. Let’s call her Betty. She is working in a new project, and she mentioned Susan, a designer that both of us knew and worked in the past, will be the designer of this project. When I heard her name I made a grimace. She asked why did I do that. I told her that Susan was not a good designer and we both talked about it when we worked with her 6 years ago. At this point I need to tell you both Betty and I are not designers but in our working area we work with designers a lot. Yet we do not have the executive power over designer choice. Betty said that was only one project, and Susan was a high-scale designer, and told me that I was being prejudiced against her. I did not understand why Betty got upset, so I told her based on my own professional experience with Susan and her work in the area, I did not like her vision however I might’ve been wrong so I would see the results of her work when this project is done. I was skeptical about her work but did not want to upset Betty anymore.  Fast forward two days, I visited of a common friend of ours Janet at her office. Janet is our friend but also represents us professionally. As we are chatting up she asked me why I disliked Susan that she worked with her in the past and Like her work. I was shocked to hear this, I wouldn’t share my opinion of Susan with Janet because Janet work with designers and have power over them. I would not want to taint anyone’s professional image. I stand firm about my opinion about Susan. Not just because her vision is bad, which it is, I have witnessed her being unprofessional before.   I know Betty well enough that she did this just to validate her opinion of Susan through Janet. And this upsets me because she puts me in a bad situation just so she could be right. I want to confront her about her behavior. But I am afraid of being offended even more. WIBTA if I tell Betty it was childish of her to pass my comments to Janet without my consent.	1642846261.0	s9zele	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zele/wibta_if_i_confront_my_friend_about_passing_my/	WIBTA if I confront my friend about passing my comments about someone to our common friend who happens to work with that someone.
dlt50uyv	I had this discussion with a few friends. I go out to eat every now and then and usually don’t feel compelled to tip. Some of my friends make a big deal about it and then we have a debate about the merits of tipping. It usually goes something like this (in order):  “You should leave a tip because they’re providing you a service”  Do you leave a tip to everyone who provides you a service, like cashiers, mailmen, etc.?  “No, but still these people make less than minimum wage”  So I should be worrying about their wage when I come here to eat even though the person who owns the place should be dealing with this issue? And what if they do make minimum wage or more, am I then still obligated to tip?  “Omg you’re such an asshole - just tip!”   And then they’ll go on to scrutinizing how much I tip. It’s not my responsibility to feel pressured or obligated to support the people who serve me at a restaurant. Sometimes I do tip depending on the quality of the service. But my friends act like the waiters / waitresses are automatically entitled to additional money simply because of their status as a waiter / waitress who served us. The way I see it, the waiters / waitresses agreed to their pay and know full-well that they’re sometimes going to receive greats tips and sometimes no tips. I will tip when I feel like it. But if it’s mediocre or subpar service, I’ll let someone else tip if they want to.	1642846556.0	s9zh39	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zh39/aita_for_not_tipping_at_a_restaurant/	AITA for not tipping at a restaurant
iwf59ugw	Me and my family are stateless, except for my brother as he was born after 2020 which when Latvia changed the law. My family is ethnically Russian, my grandparents moved to Latvia to work in a factory during the Soviet Union. When the baltic countries gained indepedence, they did everything they could to derusify (not sure if that's the word), basically remove all Russian/soviet influence in the countries. They didn't grant citizenship to those who didn't have family before WW2 or didn't speak the languages. I do not have citizenship of any country, neither do my parents. We have permanent residency. We can't vote and do other basic things. My parents have been to fucking stubborn to learn to speak Latvian so that doesn't help our situation.   My parents decided they want to move to Russia. I don't. I'm getting close to getting Latvian citizenship and I don't want to fuck this up. I plan on joining the Latvian army to speed shit up and I fucking hate Russia, even though I'm ethnically Russian I see myself as Latvian. I always speak Latvian to people unless they don't know it. All my friends are Latvians not Russians, the exception being my girlfriend who is a gypsy. My parents are saying things will be better as they'll get citizenship quickly. Like what the fuck, they've been living in Latvia as stateless for 31 years, why are they now deciding to change. Fucking ridiculous.   They say I need to stop having such a shit attitude, I told them I don't care what they fucking say I'm not moving to Russia with them. My girlfriend said I can stay with her her parents are cool with it. I told my parents I'll move in with her and they called her a bunch of gypsy slurs. They said they know best and we'll have a better life in Russia.   If I move in with them I'll fuck up any chance I have of joining the Latvian army which is my goal. My dream is to join NBS Speciālo uzdevumu vienība (latvian special task force). They told me I'm being stupid and I won't do it. I talked to military recruiters and they told me that I can get my citizenship if I join the military. I will also get citizenship if i marry my girlfriend.  Once I'm done with that, I have EU citizenship, I can go anywhere in the EU whenever I want. Ireland, Cyprus, Malta, Poland Spain whatever.   Our family plans to move out to Russia in may. I've been preparing for this and I've moved a bunch of shit over to my friend's houses. A few days before the day we move out I will just take a bus to Vilnius or something and wait it out. I've told them I will not be going to Russia. . I know if i do this i will probably never be able to talk to my parents ever again which saddens me and im not sure if its worth it.	1642846685.0	s9zi3q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zi3q/wibta_if_i_run_away_from_my_parents_and_live_with/	WIBTA if I run away from my parents and live with my girlfriend?
iwf69d7r	I have an adult daughter I never managed to connect with. All of my friends told me I’d love being a mom and I never did. After she became a teen, we never saw eye to eye on anything and we stopped talking.   However, 2 years after we stopped talking, she got a stepmom. They’ve always been very close, and today I asked her how they’re that close.   Her stepmom texted back that it was challenging, but that they have a great relationship because she got to know her.   That’s BS. I gave birth to my daughter so of course I know her. It didn’t answer any of my questions and it’s clearly bad advice.	1642847637.0	s9zqtc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zqtc/aita_for_telling_someone_they_gave_me_bad_advice/	AITA for telling someone they gave me bad advice?
3n33in	So this morning I passed by my friends house who had just given birth a few days prior.  I wanted to congratulate her but as soon as I took one look at the baby I immediately realized something was wrong with him. I decided to run the R.A.G.U test on it.   First the baby was very ugly, that was a 0 from me.  Then i showed him a picture of Grimmace from McDonald's, the baby didn't cry... another 0 from me.  I then grabbed the baby out of her arms and let it fall on the ground, instead of landing on its feet that pussy just cried like a bitch.  Also for some reason my friend got upset and started screaming at me for "hurting her baby" and that "He's not even a week old how could I drop him like that" Smh not my fault you gave birth to a defective baby.   Either way, the fact that the baby had failed all the previous tests means that it was rather wierd. So for abnormality I gave it a 0.   I then grabbed the baby out of her hands and placed it inside a nearby blender. She started screaming (I dunno why its standard procedure for babies who fail) and then fell on the ground crying.   From the baby I then made some ragu sauce (which was delicious if I do say so myself)  She was however not responding to the good news. I    then realized she was upset at the fact that her baby had died. But you know what they say. "Prego today, Ragu tomorrow"  Personally I think I did her a favor but some people will always be ungrateful.

iwf54ehw	Throwaway since my partner is always on Reddit  Moved to Singapore from the US last year for a job opportunity. Partner came a few months later.   During my time here (alone) I made a new group of friends that have been welcoming.   After moving/joining me here, me and my partner have had many arguments about doing things separately, and makes me feel terrible for wanting to do anything with friends. My partner wants to share everything we do, especially being in a new country. I feel like I need time apart as we live together and around each other’s company most of the week. Due to my long work hours, we don’t get to do much together but I feel still being in the physical presence of someone is still draining.   It’s taken a toll on my emotional and mental state where I seem miserable, lacklustre when I’m in other company. People started commenting I’m quiet or look tired when I’m around them (not my usual happy upbeat self).   I encouraged my partner to make new friends (which they have). The miscommunication is they want friends to be inclusive to the both of us. It’s hard to explain that I’m different and able to relax when they are not around in social settings.

hekdcdaz	I 25 female am a mother to one (2 year old girl) and currently pregnant with my second, due in July this year. I've decided to leave my partner male 25 because he has been unsupportive and dismissive partner. I've been diagnosed with Hyperomesis Gravidarum and have a blood disorder Thalassaemia. I've been too sick to work and struggle with daily activities. I have fainted a few times for being unwell and had multi bags of fluids to help my situation. He has recently purchased a house and we had to move all our things whilst I'm sick. Because I've been too sick to help, my family and his family pitched in to help. However, he and his family haven't been supportive about my illness. He calls me lazy and an arsehole because I am no longer working. He is mad and believes I am only looking for a way out by using pregnancy as an excuse. Originally, I tried not to let it get to me because of the stress of the move, but it has been the same for a while now to the point it is unbearable around him. He believes his treatment/ behaviour to me is fair, because he doesn't lash out or yell at me. I've decided if he isn't going to be there for my worst then he doesn't get to be there for my best. I brought this to his attention a week ago. He and I chatted and he said he doesn't want to break up. Five days later he went back to the same behaviour as before. This is his frst pregnancy and I tried to support him with information and understanding as possible. But I feel like I hit a dead end. Am I the asrehole for leaving him? He thinks I am because I'm putting the children in an awful situation and that I should think about them/ bigger picture.	1642847137.0	s9zm96	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zm96/aita_for_breaking_up/	AITA For breaking up
7xs5ftcz	I know how it looks, but listen through. Me, (female, 18) have been with my boyfriend (male, 19) for the last 5 months. We have a long distance relationship, so we’ve only seen each other once (when we weren’t together yet, because we are in the same friend group) , and in a week, i’ll see him after being out of the country for a few months. The problem is, my boyfriend is obese, and i’m concerned for his safety. He is 6’ and weights 108kg, which is not a lot if he was a healthy person, but he has a weird eating schedule, he doesn’t go out and used to go to the gym, but stoped due to laziness. He games a lot, so he spends most of his days sitting in his room, playing games. I have no problem with his body type whatsoever, i’m just concerned for his heath, given that he complains a lot from pains, from being tired all the time and etc. I haven’t found a way to go about it with him yet, but i spoke with his cousin about it and he says that he(my boyfriend) i’d very lazy and doesn’t want to go exercise or change his eating habits. I admit that i think he would look cuter if he lost a bit of weight, and i would be more comfortable if we were to have sex (i’m very tiny, 4,11’ weight 52kg) but that doesn’t really affect my concern. what should i do? should i talk to him? is it none of my business?

iwgkkqb0	This summer, I’m (19F) applying to study abroad in Spain. My application is stronger with more Spanish experience on paper than my classmate/acquaintance (18F).  My classmate is extremely resentful about the fact that my senior year was fully in person. Only one school in my state ever went online, so I got to enjoy the full high school experience with prom, pep rallies, football games, and graduation as normal. She is extremely bitter since her whole school year was online and miserable, and she says she deserves to study abroad more than me since she had to suffer the past year through online school and I got to enjoy school. She sees it as her compensation for being deprived of senior year by her school district.  Frankly, my application is stronger, so if anyone is more deserving, it’s me. And I told her it’s not my problem that she went to a shitty school district in high school and missed out. That is her school’s problem, not mine, and I’m more qualified than her for study abroad.	1642848852.0	sa01lb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa01lb/aita_for_saying_its_not_my_problem_someone_went/	AITA for saying it’s not my problem someone went to a shitty school district, and I deserve to study abroad more anyway?

2wxk5b0	So, I (f24) and part of a group of friends which are (now) all couples. We have been friends for roughly 5 years and usually hang out when our schedules meet. 1 member of the group (T) started dating a girl (E) last year. E seems friendly enough but every time we meet up there is an argument, either between E and T or E and someone else. E has now decided she doesn't like one of the new girlfriends in the group  and openly flirts with their partner to wind them up. E has cornered me on many an occasion to grill me on what people think of her or to moan about T and get my opinion. We are all sick of it because it means we can't just have a chilled night out without big arguments, the last time E was out the police had to get involved in an argument between T and E. People often end up leaving early because E has caused n argument and made them uncomfortable. E can't seem to see she is the problem and will blame the other people involved.  Here's why I may be an asshole, E asked me what I would like to do for my 25th birthday. I want to do something nice as the last 2 were in l...down. I decided to invite 2 of the couples for a chilled evening as I havent caught up with them in months.  I messaged E and said 'Hey, so actually I've decided to downsize it because I want a simple night out without any drama and it seems that the past few occasions haven't been that. So thanks for asking about it but I'm just going to scrap the plans xx' and E replied 'are me and T being kicked out of the group then? Because that's how it sounds and it kinda hurts'. I don't know what to say because they're not kicked out, but, we are sick of all the arguments.	1642849502.0	sa07oq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa07oq/aita_for_being_honest/	AITA for being honest?
ik3461zn	Throwaway cause I don't want my parents to know I have reddit. This happened last late year btw.   So I (65m)have a son who is 13 he is from my first marriage and I'm currently on my third . My first two both failed because life's hard when you a stock broker  and because of that the realatiomships did not work out. My son is from my second.  So I've wanted my son to follow in my footsteps but that will never happen (I do have another child who is 27 who is) my son has become increasingly interested in the performing arts, something I have tried to support.   So my relationship with him isn't the best, and he lives with his mother and 5 siblings. He honestly doesn't like the fact I remarried but that's just life.  So my son got accepted for a main role for a performance happening which is news in the community. I congratulated him but it seems everyone is forgetting I'm his father since no one congratulated me.  So I told him to credit me when people congratulate him since I'm the one who raised him.   But he did not take this nicely and hasn't spoke to me for since early November. I had to spend Christmas with one child less( have 14 in total but love them all)  So I reached out to his mother and she said that it's my fault and I haven't supported him, which isn't true.

imyqztww	That probably sounds bad, so lemme give some context. (and also slight tw)  I've been working with my therapist for a bit over 2 years now. While I do appreciate her a lot, I've always felt there was a wall due to legality unfortunately; I'm a minor. This means that there are a lot of things I cannot tell her, or else she'd be obligated to give that information to my parents (which is not a good idea). Not only that, but she's also obligated to regularly ask me if I'm s*icidal or have thought of or engaged in s*lf harm; this is where the problem is. I have a massive history with both of those things, and I've never in the past made it so far in recovery as I have now. However, even just those types of questions heavily trigger me, and can sometimes put me in a bad mindset that can snowball into even worse sometimes; I've even considered leaving therapy due to the toll. Today in therapy, I was having a very rough day and I knew those types of questions would be enough to push me over the edge mentally. So when she began asking, I immediately cut her off with "No". I apologized, and she said she understands, but part of me feels like an asshole for that. At the same time, it did save me from being triggered, and I feel I'd be a lot more at ease and benefit more from therapy if I did that everytime.

679a0hrw	My (19F) friend (20F) has been in an on-off relationship with this guy (21F) since we were in school and he was our senior. He's quite literally the worst bf imaginable, doesn't respect her, constantly berates her, has cheated on her lord knows how many times, she caught him texting his exes and ex-FWBs (some of which he first introduced as his "just a friends")..there's a lot. Our entire group has fought with him hundreds of times and now he presents us as some villains who don't support their "love".   Nobody in our group likes him and we've tried for four years to knock some sense into this girl. Only thing that happens is she'll listen for a few days, then go running back to him and then argue with us for not being happy about them being together, or else argue with us whenever she comes to us to vent about his nonsense and we ask her why she is even considering staying with him. Only reason why we haven't cut her off is because our group really cherishes her, she's a really sweet and generous person and we've known her for more than a decade.  Anyway, it happened again. They'd had a fight and she came to us, blocked him, then went back because he swore there was nothing going on between him and a girl. Turns out, before lockdown in our country he was meeting one on one with this ex and lied. She cried to us on the call yesterday and as much as I feel bad for her, I'm just tired of this cycle. I asked her "what else did you expect when you forgave him? You really thought he'd change? It's been four years, you're not in high school, please stop being this naive".   She cut the call and told me I'm a terribly rude person.

iwhjt543	      My husband and I had to attend a work event last Friday night and our usual baby sitter just moved to a different state for college. Our maid recommended one of her nieces who has experience babysitting so we asked her to watch our 11 year old son that night. About an hour into the event I check our home cameras to make sure everything’s going well and I see two other boys and the babysitter sitting around drinking our champagne while my son was off watching tv.        I informed my husband and we decided to call the cops to get my son since we were an hour drive away from the house and needed to make sure he was safe. My son was okay in the end and we pressed charges again the teenagers. We let our maid go but I heard she was spreading rumors to my other friends she works for that I was blowing things out of proportion. I of course am going to let them know what really happened since I have literally have the footage of these people drinking in my house.

ik9w677q	Hello. This is obviously a throwaway account for privacy. Please excuse my bad english and writing skills.  Two years ago I(F26) and my then girlfriend, Jessica(F27) broke up due to us not being able to manage our life together anymore. Mostly because we worked different shifts, me in a bakery having to get up very early and her in retail, working until 8 pm in the night on some days.   Now with that little context out of the way, i'm moving on to the main topic. I had a friend whom we call Chris(M25). We knew each other since we were little and grew up together. He also was the main reason I discovered being into girls after he came out to me. All was well, sure we had some fights but they were harmles, we also told each other basically anything, i always introduced my partners to him so he got to know jessica shortly after we came together. But on the same day me and Jessica broke up, he decided to, in my opinion, stab me in the back.   So on that day I gave him a call, telling him what happened and being sad and needed a friend. He came over and left after about an hour saying he had band practice and couldn't stay any longer. At first I was fine with it, I knew how passionate he is about his music and appreciated him driving an hour to see me. But a week later I met a mutual friend, who told me after catching up for a bit, that he wasnt at band practise at all but hanging out at a bar she worked at with jessica all night long with some friends.    Of course I was disapointed and wanted to know why he felt the need to lie to me. Chris denied he was at the bar at all when i brought it up and that our friend was lying. After a quick call to his band buddy confirmed that their session was cancelled some days prior. He then started to yell at me about being controlling and that I am not in the right deciding who he's friends with. But that never stood up to debate, since i really don't care who he hangs out with, it was always about him lying to my face twice and subsequently trying to twist my words.  I just told him that i was more disappointed than angry, stating that i dont want him in my life anymore if he is going to start lying to meand left. We havent spoken in two years and recently he tried to get back into contact with me, which i promply ignored. I just went on with my life and havent thought about that in a while but his messages brought it up again.  Some people I know have told me that I overreacted and was being a bitch. But I think I was well within my rights not wanting to interact with him anymore for choosing somebody he knew for barely two years over someone whom he knew all his life.  So AITA for being disappointed in him for lying and cutting him out of my life, or did I really overreact?	1642851608.0	sa0qfu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa0qfu/aita_for_cutting_someone_out_of_my_life_for/	AITA for cutting someone out of my life for stabbing me in the back?

80chettl	My (13m) friend (13f) was hugged and touched her in the breasts by a boy (don't know age). I spoke to her afterwards and she said it made her uncomfortable I asked if she had or was going to report him she said no. I felt like I should be the good person and report him but he has special needs and I'm not sure he intended to make her uncomfortable and even know that it was wrong. It doesn't help that he is gullible and if someone tells him to hug someone he does or if someone says someone hates DanTDM he would attack them. People make the most or this and you have to run from him or say I love DanTDM every time someone does it.   As I hang around with my friend at break and lunch when he goes near her I put an arm Infront of her to stop him and not hurt him in the process.  So WIBTA for reporting him.	1642852497.0	sa0yhr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa0yhr/wibta_for_reporting_a_kid_with_special_needs_for/	WIBTA. For reporting a kid with special needs for harrassment.
ioctbyqn	Me (18F) and my boyfriend (21M) got together after a long time of talking things trough, so in the beginning of our relationship everything was going great because we knew a lot about each other and spend a lot of time together. Like the classical honeymoon phase but somehow deeper and better, I can’t really explain that.  Well, after some time he always fell asleep when we were together. At first I thought it’s kinda cute that he feels safe around me, but it happened every time we met. We talked for 30 minutes, then he fell asleep and I was in his room, watching a movie the next hours. That was hard for me, but the worst part is, that when I was next to him, crying because of some really bad stuff that happened, he fell asleep again. After that I decided to talk to him and he apologised a thousand times and then told me, that thats because of his depression. I felt bad because I never wanted to make him feel like he has to apologise for medical issues that aren’t his fault. But he was partying every weekend with his friends, being awake for days.   After that everything was fine again.  The next problem occurred in summer break, about a month later. He works, so he decided to take three weeks of, I work too, while I’m in school, and it’s a restaurant job, so I can’t have that many vacation days at once. We decided together that I will take my week off at the same time as his first week of vacation starts. We planned to just spend the time together at his house because none of us could afford travelling.  When the week started i found out that he planned to visit his family for three days that week and also made a lot of plans with his friends. When I talked to him about how that hurt me, because we wanted to spend time together, he apologised a lot and told me, that he forgot that I only have one week of vacation.  Then I had to move and we are currently long distance. That was actually better than a real relationship at first, because he wouldn’t hurt me that often. I know how bad that sounds, but he is a really good boyfriend most of the time. He is caring, he loves my family and they love him, he is just generally a good person 8 out of 10 days. And I don’t want to break up with him because of 2 bad days.  Whatever, after some weeks, I talked to him about some really serious worries about the future and he told me every morning for about a week, that he is going to answer that text in the evening. When I told him that what he did was hurting me, he apologised a thousand times and told me that it’s because of his depression and he also feels worse since I’m not there anymore.   Am I the asshole for thinking he is lying to me?	1642853609.0	sa1935	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1935/aita_or_is_my_boyfriend_manipulating_me/	AITA or is my boyfriend manipulating me?
d08ozttk	We(35F & 34M) has one 4 years old son. He’s great and we adore him. I’ve always want to have 2 kids and while my husband also want another one, he feels another child will be tiring and he’s over that diaper phase.   I’ve been married to him for 7 years. So I know him well. If I forced him To have another one, when the baby is here and If I were to ask for his help when feel exhausted, he will say “you are the one who wants the second child. You deal with it.”   I can’t live with that sentence thrown to me for the rest of my life every time there’s something wrong or happen with the second child. So before we decided to get pregnant, I asked him to decide if he wanted or did not want a child. This happened 2 years ago.  I told him if you don’t want one, we won’t have another one. Because I can’t having you blaming me every time there’s problem for the rest of my life. And if he doesn’t want one, he needs to tell his mom it’s his wish, not mine. Because his mom is the JNMIL type. And I really don’t want having her calling me everyday so we will have another child. I did cry when I asked him that because the thought of not having a second child crushed me. But I know I will get over it overtime. I would rather be sad for awhile rather than living with “you are the one who want it” rants for the rest of my life.  He said he wants one too. Then he asked how much help he will need to give when the baby is here. I told him straight answer, if you want one we do 50-50, Either all in or all out. He said okay. He’s been a great father so far. His work is flexible because of his family is loaded. He’s home 24/7 so he helps a lot.   So fast forward to today, we were not fighting and just having a discussion about the pregnancy. It’s been hard for both of us, because I has short cervix and had to do bed rest since 23 weeks and plus the covid, we have to stay home most of the time. Now that I’m at third trimester, I’m no longer need to a strict bedrest so I’m back with helping taking care of my 4 years old.   During the discussion, He suddenly said “you are the one who want the second child”   I was stunned. Where is that come from? I said didn’t we talk about this? Didn’t I ask you?  He said yes, but I only said yes because you were sad and crying.   I was so surprised. Because I really didn’t see this coming.   I thought I won’t ever hear that sentence anymore since both of us agreed to it. And since when he lets my tear get to him. He never cared even though I cried before during the fights. So where’s this coming from?   And also because of my pregnancy hormones, I’ve been non stop crying when I heard he said that. Did I make a mistake? I’m 36 weeks pregnant, not 4 weeks. And we tried so hard for the second one, he even bought the ovulation kits himself.   Then the fight started when I told him will I have to hear your “you are the one who want it” for the rest of my life now?  He was mad and said then why were you crying when you asked me about having a second child. He said something like I only cared about my feeling and not his. He said I should have not wanted one when he said he’s tired and done. He said he also will need support when the baby is here but all I care about is my feelings.   Of course I will support him. But we need to support each other, no?   He twisted all the sentences and made me the bad guy now. Then told me to just get a divorce if I don’t want to hear that sentence.  I’m confused and upset. This is a very hard pregnancy for me. I’m in pain most of the time. Couldn’t sleep and not sure what to do now.   Please be kind.	1642853664.0	sa19jc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa19jc/aita_im_upset_that_my_husband_said_he_actually/	AITA I’m upset that my husband said he actually doesn’t want the second child while I’m 36 weeks pregnant with one?
int8bijt	I bought the Oculus Quest 2 a few weeks ago and I enjoy playing beat saber, which is a VR game where you use controllers and slice through boxes, as though you’re using “light sabers“. I ask my bf to play VR with me but he always says no. He came over last night and I asked him to try the game. I wanted to share the experience with him. He said no. So I asked him “Well, when are you going to try it, because you said that you would play it before I bought it. And now you say no every time and its been weeks“.  I pressured him to play and I could tell that he didn’t want to. I put it on the easiest setting, which was practice mode. I explained to him exactly what he needed to do. He did not follow directions and just either stood still, or flapped his arms in one direction. If you don’t properly hit the boxes, then you fail the level within seconds. He kept re-trying the level and he was getting frustrated. I couldn’t see what he was doing because he’s wearing a VR headset so I kept asking him “what are you doing“, to which he said “I don’t know“. He refused to describe what he was seeing, so I couldn’t help him. Finally, he stopped playing and stormed into the bedroom. I probably shouldn’t have done this, but I pulled out a notepad and drew a picture of the game and explained how to play, which seem to piss him off even more. He yelled at me, told me how I am a “selfish person” for buying a VR headset, and I “should have use that money for our relationship not for myself“. I have a job and I spent my own money. I apologized for pressuring him into playing the game. I left the room to wash my face and when I came back, I noticed that he had rolled over in bed with his back facing me, which is usually what he does when he’s angry and it says “leave me alone. I’m going to sleep“. So I left him alone. Also, I’m not going to encourage that behavior. So I just turned on a movie on low volume and started watching it. Eventually, I started to hear him snore, But as I continued to watch the movie, he woke up at some point and started sighing loudly and tossing and turning. Then he got up and started going off on me again. Only this time, he used abusive language and called me “bitch“ and used other profanity, which he knows bothers me. He said that I forced him to play the game and that I treated him like a “retard“ when he couldn’t play properly. Again, I explained that I was merely trying to help him and I wasn’t trying to make him feel stupid. But he claimed that I continue to “invalidate his emotions“ by not taking responsibility for the “emotional hurt“ that I caused him by “forcing him“ to play Oculus.  It was almost 11 o’clock at night and he threatened to leave my apartment to drive back to his place. He kept cussing, yelling, and threatening to leave and he finally pushed me to the edge and I said “well why the F are you still here then? Leave”. And then he left in anger.

4yy4twy3	Let me preface this by saying I don’t have proof that he cheated only proof that he met a girl at a bar and didn’t come home until 4 a.m. My fiancé (30M) and I (26F) have been together for 4 years and engaged for one. It hasn’t always been the easiest relationship but I love him and believes that he loves me too. So when he came home from hanging with friends at 4 a.m. I had no reason to be suspicious. After asking him how his night went and what he did and if he has fun, I started to get a bad feeling. He then started to come on to me and we had sex (BAD sex).   After the sex I had itchy eyes and went to find some eye drops. He said they might be in his backpack. So I went in looking for eye drops when I found his computer, went through the texts on his computer and found he had met someone at the bar and gotten her number. He was also texting the friend he went out with “am I a POS lol” “don’t worry I won’t get caught” etc. I shouldn’t have confronted him but I couldn’t help it. When confronted he completely tried to gaslight me, “I caught you going through my texts it was so easy to make up a fake text thread. I can’t believe you went through my texts I’m living under a microscope you’re just looking for a reason to leave me you never loved me. ” blah blah blah. When asked what happened and if he had sex with her, did he go back to her place etc. he denies everything.   I do feel wrong for going through his texts but his gaslighting response has me thinking otherwise. Our lives are so intertwined and we are supposed to get married in 5 months. I don’t know what to do.	1642854546.0	sa1hlo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1hlo/aita_for_going_through_my_fiancés_phone_and/	AITA for going through my fiancés phone and finding that he’s cheating?(maybe?)

She was seeing someone so she declined and we ignored it and moved on with our friendship. I did tell me gf but didn't openly say that I tried to kiss her. I just said I felt like it or something. Anyway, we continued dating and cut to 5 years of our relationship we have a fight and i break up and she goes and fucks a guy the same day lol.

i11icfv2	One of my sisters is polyamorous, which absolutely doesn't bother me at all.  She recently broke up with her boyfriend of 4 years (who would have been invited to my wedding) and now she's developed feelings for a guy she's seen for a couple of months. Next to him, she also has other dates, some regular, some ONS. I've met her current guy twice. I have no idea how long it's going to last, but I don't want to invite him to my wedding. I have nothing against him or her choices, but I don't have a lot of money and I want to only invite people I know well. (for example, my other sister's boyfriend is invited - they've been together for 7 years).  My polyamorous sister is still friends with her ex (the one I would have invited) and she sleeps with him as well. She said that I should just invite him and not her new guy, but I think that's weird. After all, they're not together anymore and I haven't had anything to do with him since they broke up.   I also wouldn't be surprised if she changed her mind suddenly if things with her current guy become more serious, and that she'll be mad if he's not invited.  Frankly, I think she doesn't need a plus one at all. But I'm sure she'll get angry about that.  Does that make me an asshole?	1642855367.0	sa1pvd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1pvd/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_sisters_partner_to_my/	WIBTA for not inviting my sister's partner to my wedding?

At first I jokingly asked if he was into or something, cause I cant fathom why you would want someone to fart around you, but he said its a comfort and trust thing. I laughed it off and changed the subject. Recently hes been acting hurt that I still havent done it once.

guw43soo	Ok some back story. My boyfriend (22m) and I (22f) dated in high school then broke up during college because of long distance. (His idea if that matters) Last year we met again over summer and decided to get back together because we realized how much we still care about each other.   Now onto the issue. During our break I had this friend with benefits for a couple months. He was really into me but I was very clear about not wanting to date him and he was ok with that. During our time of hooking up he bought me a Dior bag for my birthday. (MY DREAM BAG) I tried to tell him I didn’t want it because it was too expensive and I didn’t want to be in debt to him and again I made it clear that I still didn’t want to date him regardless of these gifts. He was ok with that and just said it was a birthday present. I was still reluctant to take it but ultimately it was my dream bag so whatever. Throughout our hook ups he gave me other gifts like lingerie, stuffed animals, etc. I threw away all of that stuff as soon as the hook ups ended (at the end of 2020)   When I started dating my now boyfriend I told him about all of my romantic encounters in the past years because I wanted to be completely honest with him. I also told him more recently that the bag was given to me by my hook up. He was kind of surprised and I asked him if it was ok and he said it’s fine but he’s just surprised that I kept it. I told him it was just my favorite bag but i have absolutely no feelings for that guy anymore (he’s not part of my life at all anymore and I haven’t talked to him since we stopped hooking up.) He told me “it’s fine haha don’t worry” but he didn’t sound fine?   Maybe I’m overthinking this but when I asked my friends some said I should get rid of it because it’s disrespectful and others said it’s fine because the bag has no connection to him for me.   This bag is also crazy expensive so it’s not like I can just buy another one tomorrow and it’s so pretty. I really don’t want to get rid of it but i don’t want to disrespect my boyfriend.

iwjiug3y	Have you guys seen that viral video where someone goes to a starbucks and puts her name as "single and available" so the barista says "single and available" out loud and the woman keeps yelling "thats me single and available if anyone wants me"   Well some annoying bitch got inspiration from that I guess and tried that shit here in Quebec but except this happened in French.   I'm waiting behind her in line. So she says her name is "single and available" in French and the barista is like "really, are you really going to do this shit?" and she rudely says "that's what i want my name as so fucking write my name down and stop arguing with me" The barista then just says "i don't have time for this shit, whatever"   So later the barista says "I have a coffee for single" and the bitch says "do you mean single and available?" and the barista says "yeah single and available" and she says "You hear that guys I'm single and available, if anyone wants to stop me from walking out" as she's lingering and she just says it again. People just look annoyed. She then says "so nobody else here is also single and available?"   She's really loud, you can tell people just want to work on their shit or whatever and we're sick of this. I said "there's a reason you're single, becuase nobody wants to be with someone as obnoxious as you so shut the fuck up and get out"   She said "you are so fucking rude" and then left. I'm not sure if im on some viral video. If anyone has info tell me.

v4xq9r2	My husband has been showing symptoms of the global disease for several days. Unfortunately, he doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs or sneezes,  which is pretty gross already and I'm immune compromised.   Now the school says we need to keep our granddaughter home for a week if anyone in the house has the disease. So I  bought home test kits. You'll notice I said "kits" and  not "a kit" because he said if *he* had to take one, then so do I. Forcing me to spend an extra $10 so my asymptomatic nose can humor him is par for the course. But I digress.   Now, he says that according to his sister, who's a nurse,  the test will give a false positive. That's simply not true. My husband has had procedures since his vaccinations and his tests came up negative. My son and his gf, my friends, lots of people I know have had tests and come up negative after vaccinations.   WIBTA if I just act as though his test is positive if he refuses to take the test? I might add that if he does take the test and the results are positive he intends to treat the test as a negative result as well based on what his sister said.   So,  I  would notify the school of exposure, the marriage counselor and the lady who piicks them up for church every week that he has the virus du jour.   I might be TA because that's his personal health information, but he's being careless with others' health here.	1642858187.0	sa2jnh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2jnh/wibta_if_i_force_my_husband_to_take_a_test/	WIBTA if I force my husband to take a test
f76hy7fe	So my daughter (4.5) has tried various things, ballet, dance etc. she started cheerleading, loved it, after a break at Xmas she says she no longer wants to go, the last week weeks I have taken her - she’s enjoyed it when she’s been there but moaned about it before hand.   however today she didn’t end up going as she did her first swimming class this morning & I felt mean making her go to cheer too when she said she really didn’t want to I also didn’t have the energy for a battle.   But I have a feeling in a few weeks she’ll say she doesn’t want to do swimming too but I ’m very reluctant to allow her to keep on giving up on things. She always enjoys cheerleading when she’s there for example it’s the going beforehand. But I won’t allow her to give up swimming because well; she just needs to learn to swim.   My husband whilst encourages her isn’t really too bothered, he said we can try again in a Few months - I don’t agree.   I did tell her she will not excel at things or be good at anything if she keeps giving up on them, my husband said that was too harsh - I don’t think it is - it’s the truth.   My parents never forced me to do anything which I feel that they should have done more.   I want my daughter to be happy but I also want her to realise she can’t give up at everything esp as she enjoys when she’s there - that’s what’s the most frustrating part.   Now I’m thinking I should have made her go to swim AND cheer today, am I being unrealistic in my expectations here? AITA for thinking I should make her go to these activities even if she says no? ( she can’t give me a reason why she doesn’t want to go) or AITA becusse I didn’t stick with my conviction & take her to cheer & swimming?   We are in the UK cheer isn’t massive here unfortunately but I believe it is really good exercise.	1642858307.0	sa2lby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2lby/aita_for_taking_my_daughter_to_cheerleading/	AITA for taking my daughter to cheerleading?
iwjcpjx5	(i’m new to this reddit thing so forgive me if i don’t do everything perfectly!)   in june of 2019 i got married to my now husband R. backstory, i have 3 kids my husband has one girl from a previous marriage (full custody) i have 1 boy from a previous boyfriend (full custody) and we have a 2 year old boy together.   two days before my wedding MIL (who we will call S) called me. S is a cheapskate she definitely was not buying anything for the wedding so she did what she does best, bake burnt cookies that no one enjoys but that wasn’t my biggest problem at the time.   S calls and asked if i could come over (at 11:00 at night) to help her make cookies because of course she wasn’t prepared. i told her no! “S there’s two days before my wedding theres so much to do and i have to make sure everything is perfect! as it is gonna be the best day of my life, besides when my kids were born of course!” she cut me off saying “did you really just say that your kids being born was a more important day then you marrying my son?”   i answered with “not necessarily but my kids are-“ she hung up and cut me off with a very big grunt. i told my husband and he said not to worry. another little backstory- we had a dress code to our wedding the bride and groom wear black and the guests wear white.   early the next day my little sister in law texts me. “look at this” she sent me pictures of a facebook group of about 10 females (aunts and cousins) on my husbands side run by S saying that they were gonna wear black to my wedding when they knew they were ordered to wear white. me and SIL were furious, we told my husband. he’s a mommy’s boy so, he told us that his mother, aunts, and cousins  “would never do that to him.” i brushed it off (BIG MISTAKE)   well, wedding rolls around. and here comes S and 9 other females on my husband side dressed in black. i walked out of the hallway where i was and said “get the f*ck out S and take your minions with you.” she said “calm down you’re just in a mood because your daddy’s dead and he can’t walk you down the aisle. awhhhhhh i will give you some time to cool off now let me watch my son get married even though he’s to good for you, COW.”  that was the last straw. i kicked her out of our wedding my husband took her out of the alter. i was suprised my husband was on my side. but then we went on with the wedding. after we got home my husbands daughter said i should not have treated her “lovely” grandmother like that and that i’m not her real mom and should get out. (my husbands daughters real mom died when she was just 5 so MIL basically took that place) i just took the insults and backfire because i knew she was just mad at me because she was so close with her grandma, she did eventually forgive me but i still feel bad. so tell me, AITA?	1642858779.0	sa2qae	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2qae/aita_for_kicking_my_mil_out_of_my_wedding_because/	AITA for kicking my MIL out of my wedding because she said something about my late father?

iwju5a8i	 I 23m, met a 24f on Tinder, we talked for four months. The truth is, I was being an asshole to her, she wanted to meet up with me, but I didn't put effort into meeting up in person, she realized I was playing games, so we stopped talking.  Fast forward 3 weeks later, I'm a streamer with a Discord with over 200 members. I notice she's going Live on one of my streaming/voice channels. My friends and other people who I met online joined the voice channel and is talking to her. I felt confused lol, so I checked out her stream, and she's baking a cake.  After her stream was finished, I told her, that my Discord is for gaming and not baking. She said she wants to promote her baking streams, and since my discord is already established, it would be easier to get a following. I told her no lol, she told me " I need to promote the fucking baking" I told her I'm going to remove her from my discord if she does it again. She responded, oh yeah? and I haven't talked to her in a couple of days. Any advice? should I remove her or let her post the baking streams? I have many voice channels, so her streaming, won't interrupt my stream. I just find this situation so random. AITA for not letting her promote her baking? I also have a place for people to post food pics, she also explained since I have food on my channel, she thought it was okay.	1642859119.0	sa2u6x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2u6x/aita_for_not_letting_this_girl_promote_her_baking/	AITA for not letting this girl promote her baking streams on my Discord?
iwk48y8f	To start off I don’t think she was wrong for asking I think she was wrong for the way she asked. Basically I have a counselor but I only see her once a week so I made a private story called “deppresso espresso”. I post random things I’m upset about. Well my friend (K) attempted three times in one night so I made a post. It basically just said what I wanted to say but it wasn’t to her I didn’t want to hurt her feelings or make her any more upset. I deleted snap because I couldn’t take the texts anymore. I had to sleep in my older sisters room because I couldn’t walk without shaking a lot from how much I was crying. When I finally redownloaded snap I saw a couple messages from friends I opened a snap from my other friend (D) saying “Oop girl who?” I got pissed because I was obviously upset and all she cared about was trying to gossip. So I went off on her basically saying to stay out of it. She got upset saying “alright geez I already know who it is.” (She knew ‘cause K posted about being in the hospital) This made me more mad so I asked her “if you knew why would you asked?” A couple hours later I sent her a streak and now I’ve been on delivered for a day. I think I messed up but I don’t know am I the asshole?	1642859170.0	sa2upf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2upf/aita_for_snapping_at_my_friend_when_they_asked/	AITA for snapping at my friend when they asked about my friend trying to off themselves
41gd4qph	Ok so to elaborate I’m living in China at the moment working on myself and developing my career as a teacher, due to chinas culture a lot of women here want to date to marry.  A year ago I met someone on tinder, she is nice but has a lot of baggage, she is a divorcee with a daughter, husband is out of the picture due to his own toxic issues, her family is abusive and wants her to remarry asap, we’ve discussed this but I have stated that I do not want to do so at this time but the relationship has continued for over a year.  I have supported her, giving her an allowance, paying for food and buying her and her daughter whatever they need so recently she told me that I either marry her or she will find someone else, I’ve explained that I’m not ready, so now she has stopped texting, stopped messaging and has told me she’s seeing a doctor about her mental issues.  She’s a totally different person from when we met, she’s completely cut herself off and has become completely passive aggressive.  We talk sometimes but I think mostly she wants me around just in case she needs something.

bp7ctczg	No initials relate to the real people for anonymous reasons.  Backstory: I (19f) have been dating my boyfriend L (20) for 2 and a half years. We've lived together for 2 of those years but it's mainly been jumping from friends couches while we found a place of our own. Sadly, because of lockdown, this took a lot longer than we would have liked. We found our lovely little 2 bedroom home about 6 months ago and we've settled in nicely. We've put a lot of work into our first home and it's been hard.  Back in November we offered to take in a friend of ours P (m21) because he was staying at another friend T's (m21) house. Sadly T wasn't treating him very well (controlling who he sees, controlling money etc). L and I had fallen out with T just after we moved in because of how he was acting towards us. P however, is still friends with him, which is fine by us as long as T doesn't come to our home. We gave P the agreement that he pays us $250 a month and buys his own food, our house is quite expensive to run so it's not unreasonable and P makes good money so he was happy with that deal. However, since he's moved in, it's been hell. I barely get to spend time with L alone because P always wants to be there, he won't tidy the spare room and he constantly does washings with 2 items and it wastes a lot of electric. My siblings (f16, m15) don't come and stay anymore due to P being here which hurts because I love having them here. They dont have a problem with him, they just have anxiety and P is very outgoing and a but in your face at time. P also hasn't bought his own cutter key for the house or fob for the building so I've been letting him use mine which has led to me being locked out after work several times because he is at friends houses while L is working. Recently I've been encouraging P to look for his own place but every time I bring it up I'm "stressing him out". He's also very fixed on buying a car before finding a house which I don't want because in my opinion a house should be higher on his priority list. I don't want to take back the agreement but I'm considering asking him to move back in with his grandmother who stays close by, it would be cheaper to pay her and he would be able to get his car. I'm just sick of not having any tike or space to myself. He gave me his portion of the rent in December but he hasn't bought himself any food. So he's been eating mine and L's food, smoking our tobacco etc. He's put me in some amount of debt with friends and family because he hasn't stuck to our agreement. L and I have been struggling with money after Christmas but I made sure to buy enough for us to last time payday, P however has kinda messed everything up by eating all of our stuff.

7e3fowlc	In the deepest of my mine, I am thinking I am the chosen one even I am not together with having a terrible past.  I wanted to be the greatest woman but what is holding me back is I have schizophrenia. People laugh at me, people ridicule me because in the past I literaly became crazy and proclaim myself as a God. But I know I am not a God, it just that when I had episode that is what my mind convince me too, until it becomes uncontrolable.   I wanted to dream again but I feel like I am not worthy og any dreams of success because I am crazy, literally schizo. My classmates distance theirselves from me, they make me feel like I am a plague.  I feel like I am running out of time at the same time, just not worthy.

iwakiwrw	My wife asked me to get dinner while coming home from work tonight because she was too tired to cook. She told me to bring a medium pizza. We usually get a large so that there are leftovers but she said that she wants to lose weight and doesn't want any temptations in the refrigerator.   So I got the pizza home. When we were done eating, she said that she's still hungry and that I shouldn't have bought so less food. I told her that I got a smaller pizza because she said she wanted to lose weight and she didn't want leftovers.   She then got mad saying that She was just testing me to check if I thought she was fat. She said that I fatshamed her by indirectly telling her to eat less.   I'm confused. I never meant to call her fat. I never thought she needed to lose weight because all her blood reports etc. indicate nothing to worry about according to the doctor.

irgz5l57	So my wife just gave birth to our 3rd son and it was 2 weeks before my birthday. She keeps bugging me to tell her what I want for my birthday even though I keep telling her nothing I got my baby boy. She tells me you're such a great father and husband you deserve something special. Well we haven't had any birthday sexy time since before our first kid and each time she's been pregnant and the first year after I know she has been overwhelmed so I never push zexy time on her but always remind her how beautiful and sexy she is to me, which she said she appreciates and thanks me for but she feels guilty about too. She got mad at me the other day because I told her we'll skip my birthday and focus on her and the baby and got all emotional about how I never want her to love on me. So this morning half awake without really thinking it through I blurted out her well we can't have sexy time yet, and I'd love a bj at least so outside of that I there is really nothing I want. She didn't respond but I felt like such a selfish asshole for that, my birthday is tomorrow she hasn't said anything about it yet.

iwiby769	Ok so this was a few years ago, I used to share with a nightmare housemate, it wasn’t just one thing she did that annoyed me … more of a culmination of crappy behaviour.  She would do things like steal my food, open my mail, take money from my purse without asking, she was really heavy handed and when washing dishes she would just slam them down (often breaking them) and it was always my stuff that got broken.  Anyway after yet another ‘incident’ I lost my sh*t and I stomped to the bathroom, I knocked her toothbrush accidentally into the loo, I picked it out, but I didn’t tell her or even rinse it, I just put it safely back where I found it. I’m not gonna lie I did get a genuine sense of glee when I saw her brushing her teeth later that evening.

He wanted to play Madden against me, I beat him by multiple touchdowns. To my defense we had a lot of playful banter leading up to the game and mid game he was joking with me about beating a dying kid. I sorta feel like a dick because on one hand, I did destroy a dying kid in a video game. But on the other hand, he thought it was funny so I feel less like an ass.

iwgn7oin	Throwaway for obvious reasons. I (26,F) have recently moved to a new city for a new job. My cousin Tess (25,F) & her parents are also based in the same city. Our families used to be really close when we were younger but we had to pull back because my aunt became really toxic & jealous about the amount of money my parents earned. She also pushed Tess to copy all my hobbies & stuff. We have been only talking over the holidays for the last 9 years. Tess took up the same subjects as me in highschool & tried to get into medical schools but didn't succeed. She & her mom threw a big fit & harrassed my grandmother for money to see if they could get into some medical schools that way. Obviously it didn't happen & they never returned the money to my grandma.   Tess is a counselor now & i have just started my psychiatric residency. Everytime i have been to their house they have referred to her as a doctor which i found odd but brushed it off. I have heard her parents telling people that shes a health care worker which is also misleading but not totally wrong.  Tess was over my place 2 months ago when she met Jack who was visiting his brother who lives a few doors down from me. Jack is based in another city & he visits his brother here like once every weekend or so. I found out that Tess & Jack have started dating around the same time they met.  Sometimes Jack will say somethings about Tess that will not make sense like he once said something about a story about a medical college professors that Tess had told him but it was something that had happened to me.  I have heard Tess telling about how long her shifts at the hospital were, now she doesn't work at a hospital & with her current credentials she wouldn't be hired in a hospital. i also heard her mom tell Jack about how tough the 5.5 years in medschool were for Tess but i assumed i misheard them.  Jack's brother brought up some inconsistencies in Tess story to me which lead me to realise that Tess is passing off my credentials as her own to Jack (& other people probably). I think i know why she's doing it, she's mentioned several times how Jack's parents are loaded & Jack is their favourite son ( his brother is estranged from his family), shes also mentioned a few times how its Jack's first actual relationship & how shes got him wrapped around her finger. So im assuming she's gonna try to dupe him till he proposes?      I talked to Jack's brother & we have both decided we are gonna confront her when they come over to dinner at his house tomorrow. i want to do this in front of Jack as she has a history of playing the victim card everytime shes blamed for anything & this wont give her time to come up with an excuse.    I told my roommate about this & she thinks we should do this privately but i feel like this would only give Tess more time to spin up some lie to tell Jack.	1642862496.0	sa3wva	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa3wva/wibta_if_i_confront_my_cousin_about_passing_off/	WIBTA if i confront my cousin about passing off my degrees as her own in front of her new boyfriend?

iwjkmv98	English is not my first language. So yeah my grammar is bad.    I have a identical twin brother that we will call Scott.   Now despite what you hear about identical twins being very similar in many aspects. And having some unspoken bond for most our lifes mine and Scott's similarities stopped at our physical appearance.  Now as adults people don't even realize were identical twins as me and my brother have two very different styles.   Now my brother is for the lack of better word a douche who treated me pretty badly growing up.   He very full of himself and a bit narcissistic he has what I call former popular guy syndrome.  He was very popular in high school well I was not.  And he desperately held on to that same personality.   Scott also has a huge issue with me being gay.  And it mostly has to do with the fact he think that if people know I'm gay everyone will think he is too. Because were twin. Stupid right?    He has made offensive remark on multiple occasions in which he tries to play off as jokes. But I just don't find them funny and have told him this. Yet he keeps doing it.   Now where my problems starts is last week Scott and his wife came to me and revealed they planning on starting a family.   The issue is that Scott was in a motorcycle accident when he was a teenager that left him unable to have kids of his own.   So they wanted me to donated sperm as Scott and I share the same DNA they came to the conclusions this was a way for them have a baby with both there DNA    To be honest I made it clear I'm not comfortable with this. And personal creep out   They think I being selfish and my brother say I own it to him. Because as I qoute "brothers help each other out"   My personal feeling about it aside some else has been on my mind when share this with a friend at work she suggest they might be trying to trap me.   She showed me a story where a women manages to sue both twins brothsr for child support because DNA couldn't prove who the father was.so both ending up having to pay.  As well as mutiple cases where the sperm donor was sue and ended up having to pay child support.   And before you say I'm crazy. My brother also has always had issue with the fact I have a good job with very good pay well he work for minimum wage at the local mechanics shop   So as crazy as it sound this is a possiblity    AITA for not donating my sperm so my twin brother can have a child with "his" DNA	1642862581.0	sa3xur	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa3xur/aita_for_not_donating_my_sperm_so_my_twin_brother/	AITA for not donating my sperm so my Twin brother can have a child with "his" DNA
476hbbt	Ok. So.   Me (32F), SO(32M) plus two small children. I’m pregnant.  I work from home, I have house slides that i wear as slippers.  SO is a plumber, he goes to apartment builders and peoples homes and public stores to fix their plumbing problems.  He’s in the trades, so if any of you know what that’s like, you also know about the ridiculously large work boots they gotta wear. And those babies strap UP.   Anyway, sometimes he wears them in through the mud room, ok fine, through the back door and the dining room, it’s a small house not a huge deal. But what I absolutely CANNOT STAND is when he wears them upstairs. I tell him every time DO NOT. And explain why, and he’s like it’s fine! I just walk around in snow it’s aok.  In the past I’ve been real reasonable about it, calm etc, rational as I know that’s how you’re supposed to communicate. But, today. Oh my sweet baby Jesus TODAY, this beautiful beast of a human marches his tight bubble butt up the stairs and almost into our room IN HIS BOOTS and I just. Kind of. Lost it. 🤷🏻‍♀️   Told him to go downstairs in his boots, he was like it’s fine, and then I barked at him a few times, then just started yelling. Used my voice as a physical force to get him to back down the stairs and chased him to the door.   Am I wrong for being so adamant about work boots upstairs, where our bedrooms are? Like it’s just so gross.  Anyway. Maybe I shouldn’t have yelled but I’m quite small and he’s quite large and it was the only way to get him into action. I’m also pregnant so like, maybe I’m over reacting about the boots thing.  We’re not fighting by any means, when he left I told him about my big poop and we had a laugh, I just wanna know if I’m losing my mind about this.	1642862857.0	sa4117	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4117/aita_for_telling_my_so_to_not_wear_boots_in_the/	AITA for telling my SO to not wear boots in the house?

We all have some fucked up humour, or so I thought. I don’t really have a filter, but maybe I should develop one. I had made a comment saying “I feel like if guys could suck their own dicks, they probably would.” I mean.. I would if I was a guy but maybe I’m just a freak. Anyway, everyone was laughing about it and joking around but my boyfriend got PISSED. He did NOT think it was funny, which took me off guard and he ran away from the group. I thought that was funny too but anyway eventually he completely left the party. I texted him asking what’s wrong and he lost it on me and basically said he’s not going to talk to me anymore.  I guess we are broken up now.. note to self, he ain’t the suck his own dick type. Anyway.. am I the asshole? It was honestly just a joke and we’ve even together for 8 months he should know I’m a dumb ass by now.

4sdlzunq	AITA for dumping my boyfriend on news years Eve when he was drunk ?  Me (21 ) and my now ex-boyfriend (28) met in early 2021 and everything was pretty perfect till about Christmas time.  I have four brothers older brothers and I also have 5 nieces and a nephew , every year we all spend  Christmas all at my parents house, normally when my older nieces stay at my parents they normally sleep on a sofa bed in our living room but since Santa Claus was coming to town, I offered my bed to my nieces and I would sleep on the sofa bed as it made everything easier.  On Christmas called I my boyfriend as he hadn’t been been able to talk  for a couple days, I made a small comment about me sleeping on the sofa bed and he snapped telling me that I was a slave to my family, I didn’t have dignity because I accepted sleeping on the sofa bed, and how my family treated was something out of horror movie. As you can imagine I was hurt and angry so I told to f himself and blocked him On everything.  This isn’t the only time he has made comments about my family, I will admit I spend a lot of my time with my family and will do anything to make my nieces happy as my family was suffered a lot, my brother who is the father of my two oldest nieces died two years ago, and my other brother who is the father of my two nieces and nephew lost his arm in a work accident this year. My mum absolutely hates Christmas as my oldest brother died in a car accident ten years ago on Christmas Eve. On my same day my dad was seriously injured while in the military which left him with one arm and lost most of his hearing. So at this time of year me and my brothers put all our energy into making it a magical time for my nieces and the whole family.

iwmfhqb6	I have a stepdaughter "Mary" who has never warmed up to me. Honestly her parents aren't the greatest and I feel for her. The divorce was absolutely nasty and my husband moved on before his ex "Kate". Kate was not accepting of the divorce and wanted him back, so she obviously hated me. I do believe Kate poisoned Mary against me.  One thing Kate did, which I find absolutely ridiculous, is tell my husband that he needed to break up with me because him exclusively dating beautiful women is going to hurt Mary's self esteem. First of all that is just dumb, second of all he does exclusively date beautiful women so that includes Kate. Kate is stunning, so was she going to remove herself from her daughter's life to protect her self esteem?  Kate is now totally over her ex and we don't have these issues anymore, but Mary is with us at the moment because they got into a huge fight. Kate is getting married and was pressuring Mary to wear a MOH dress that Mary found too sexy and was uncomfortable in.   Mary was confiding in me that her mom is "vapid" and a "whore" and she feels like she wanted a daughter who was less conventional and more like her. Mary asked me if I thought her parents thought she was pretty, so I gave an honest answer that her dad says she's beautiful but her mom worried about her self esteem in relation to her dad dating. Mary called Kate a bitch but thanked me for being honest with her and has been a bit warmer.   Kate called me and was furious. She said I hurt her daughter to get back at her and I made it sound bad when any mom would be worried. i feel like nah, most moms wouldn't be super aware that they and their ex's partner are more beautiful than their daughter. That's just Kate and she's always worried that Mary was "plain".  My husband is mad at me and says I caused more drama.	1642865050.0	sa4rwp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4rwp/aita_for_telling_my_stepdaughter_what_her_mom/	AITA for telling my stepdaughter what her mom said about her?
inz6nodq	I am F 21 and my boyfriend is 21 M . Little back story my boyfriend and I have been together for about 4 years or some. We broke up at our 2 year mark and eventually got back together. When we got back together he had a lot of friends that liked to drink. He did not have them before so I became really close to them. Recently one of them is having a party, however my boyfriend will not be there. He invited me, I asked my boyfriend out of respect if I could go but he changed the subject. After partying and being a little tipsy , I told my boyfriend I was going to go whether he liked it or not. I am not the type of girl that you can tell what to do , because when you do I feel like your are taking away my freedom. He told me that I wasn't and he told me he did not want me to go. I don't see anything wrong with me going since when I first asked him I told him I would not drink and I would be with girls ( the guys sisters or some of the guys girlfriend) however he continuously told me I could not go which I did not like. Since we got into a big arguments, he ended up telling my parents and although I was do what I want because I am 21, my sister previously moved out so I do not want to disappoint my parents. I feel like he is taking a sense of me away. He always does this also with tattoos , I love tattoos and he tells me if I get more he will break up with me, and when I do get more he doesn't do it. I don't want to lose myself , I have always been dealing with trauma and my freedom is what I want to always have. I have been mad at him for the longest and he has been really kind trying to surprise me to be his valentines however it failed and since the argument I am not sure if I want to be. So am I the asshole for being mad and not forgiving him so easily ?	1642865128.0	sa4sum	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4sum/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_boyfriend/	AITA for being mad at my boyfriend

daswe3x9	I (27F) got married a few weeks ago. My husband (28M) and I had a very conventional wedding except my dad (53M) didn't walk me down the aisle. I was very uncomfortable at the idea of being "transferred" from my family to my husband's family like I'm something to be owned.  My dad is a veteran and pretty traditional with marriage. He has a lot of childhood trauma and has overcompensated by being extremely involved with my life even when he was on duty. When I told him how I didn't want to walk him down the aisle, he told me he respected my wishes but I could tell he was very sad about it.  My mom (53F) supported my decision but told me how my dad has been talking about walking his only daughter down the aisle for years. I don't really understand why he has put so much weight on one tradition.  My two older brothers (30M and 33M) are both in the military and married; they, along with other members of my extended family, have been telling me that I'm a huge AH for not doing one nice thing for my dad. They didn't understand why I didn't just do it because it would be a nice moment rather than thinking about the origins of the tradition.  Neither my husband nor his family cared that much, and I also still don't think it's a big deal. I love my dad to death, and not doing one tradition doesn't change that in my eyes. I don't know if I'm being stubborn or if I did the right thing by holding my ground.

8i2s61i5	I (*F22*) spend New Years at my friend's (*F22*) place, with about 5 other girls - one of them my friends, and the rest of them hers - So I didn't know everyone attending.  It was overall a fun night, we ate sushi, played games my friend and I had prepared, and drank delicious cocktails. I enjoyed meeting the other girls, and got along very well with everyone.  But - I noticed a lot of the girls were spending so much time on their phone. Many of them were taking pictures, which I usually don't mind - I like having nice pictures taken too - but it became quite excessive. After these photoshoots had taken place, the girls sat with their phone for at least 20 minutes, editing and posting their pictures - followed by conversations of how fat and ugly they all felt like they looked. This saddened me. They were all beautiful, which I also told them.  Then as the night proceeded, the conversation at the table started to revolve heavily around talking bad/gossiping about other girls. I didn't know the girls they talked about, so I stayed mostly quiet. Then it started to get kind of mean. There was this one girl, whom they referred to as "the forehead", since they thought she had a "big ugly forehead" (mind you, this girl was stunning). Then they (including my friend) moved on to some other girls instagram, where they laughed at a picture she had taken with her friends, cause "they look so pretty, and she is so ugly" (again, this girl was beautiful".   This went on for quite a bit, and at one point I said something about them all being beautiful, and that there was absolutely no need for speaking this ugly about other women. When they said that some of these women were terrible, I said that they were probably just insecure - and that we should only pity that, and then pay it no mind. It wasn't a big thing, and they agreed a bit, but continued the trash talking. I stood my ground, and (in a nice way) reminded them that these "ugly" girls were insecure, and that we shouldn't talk so bad about them.  When the night ended I felt bad, even a bit sad. I refuse to speak negatively about other peoples appearance, ESPECIALLY other women, who very likely struggle with body- and selfimage, since unfortunately most of us do.   So - today I spoke with my friend about how I felt, and she disagreed with me heavily. She told me, that she had actually been wanting to talk to me about this night, because she was disappointed in me. She said, that I had been acting better than everyone, and had been putting her down, embarrassing her (she refers to when I told them, that they shouldn't speak so bad about these other girls on instagram). She said that I took it way too seriously, and shouldn't act holy, since I used to participate in this kind of talk/gossip. I told her that I don't like it, and that I think we're getting too old for this.   Although I do stand my ground, and refuse to speak this way about other girls, she did made me doubt a bit; Am I taking stuff like this too seriously?	1642866131.0	sa559w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa559w/aita_for_being_annoyed_by_gossip/	AITA for being annoyed by gossip?
iwnxo4tb	I'm 17f and lately people have been really making me feel guilty over this so I need to ask. I'm black and I grew up in NY. Both my mom and dad worked in the streets and I dont remember them being around much when I was growing up, aside from them like sleeping on the couch. Just passed out or nodding off. I wont say my life was terrible because I had most of what I needed aside from skipping meals every once in a while but not often. Well CPS came in and took me away when I was 10 I think over a domestic dispute. One of my moms "clients" came to the house and some stuff broke out and I had to hide in the closet. Cops were called and CPS took me.   I was placed in a home with two people that I consider my parents at this point. A white Christian couple in their early 50s who treated me like I was their own flash and blood from the moment I walked through their door. I never needed or wanted anything because it was always provided for me. They had a clean house. I had an actual bed off the floor and my mom even went to classes to learn how to do my hair for me and keep it maintained. Something my bio mom never did for me. My bio parents came to a few visits through the agency for reunification but not very many. By age 15 I was still with my foster parents and I was in a really good school with little crime, I was in cheering, I had a bunch of good friends and my mom would have plumber parties for us all the time. But this is also the year my bio mom tried getting custody back. She went to rehab and got herself a nice apartment and had a stable job. She left my bio dad, who apparently went to prison after being caught in the streets. My bio mom set up visits and even then I just didnt want to go but I did because I felt like I had to.   After probably 6 months of weekly visits with my bio mom she asked me to move back in with her and she heavily guilted me about it. Said she couldnt live life without me anymore and that she did all this for me. My foster mom cried. Told me she would love me no matter what and that I would always have a place in her home. And eventually the guilt made me go with my bio mom. Things were okay. She tried showering me with love but it just didnt feel right. I missed my mom, my home, my friends. So 4 months later I contacted my school social worker and I got my mom back and left my bio moms.   My cousins from my real mom have found me on FB and have said a bunch of stuff. That I'm white washed, I'm only here because the white family has more money, that I'm scum for turning my back on my mom and that I will get what's coming to me. AITA for choosing my foster mom?

iwnbmloo	I recently turned 15 and my mother promised me that my room would be done for my birthday. (My birthday was on the 19th of Jan.) This promise has been fed to me since October when she ripped my carpet out.   This promise kept on being told to me near enough everyday, and in December I broke up from school for Christmas break. I have a pretty long school day so we get more holidays, I had like a whole month off. Reasonably I thought this would've been the perfect time to finally get my room renovated (keeping in mind all the paint, the new floor was all bought and was being stored in the house).   I usually go out on Saturday as it's the only day I can have to myself, every time I asked if I can go out during my Christmas break I've been told "No op, we have to do your room", surprise surprise it's nearly February and my room still hasn't been done. I feel like so much time has been wasted.  Just yesterday I got in a fight with my mother about this situation saying that all she does is go on her computer all day (She works for like 3 hours on it I know because she has told me, and then the rest of the day she's on some irrelevant radio chats with her online friends). I called her out for my room still not being done. Before I went to bed she told me to set an alarm for 10 am, she said that we're FINALLY going to do my room and she called me stubborn for not 'waiting'.   This morning (It's a Saturday) I woke her up at 10 am, she got up made us breakfast however I didn't eat, she called me stubborn once again. She told me that we're going to do it today. Hours passed, I cleaned my room out so that it's ready. I go downstairs to tell my mum that everything is ready and she says "We'll do it tomorrow". Once again she was on some radio chat on her computer it was like 2pm. Still early enough to start the renovation!  I was pissed because she has pushed the date again, I figured if she wasn't going to do it I can try myself. She saw me taping up the light switch and the other things that needed to be taped but she said nothing. I grabbed a paint bucket and everything else I needed and started painting one of my walls and it actually looked good, everything looked pretty even and nothing was patchy .  Few hours later my mum busts into my room and she starts yelling at me saying I'm an asshole for not waiting for her and for getting a chair dirty. It wasn't even a lot and the paint peeled right off from the chair (The chair is kind of plastic I guess) My dad and nan laughed at the situation saying I 'Girl bossed' a little too hard. They agreed that the wall looked pretty good too however wondered how I got the paint to the top of the wall since I'm pretty short for my age. 5 foot to be exact. I told them that I used one of the chairs and they burst out laughing again saying I should plan my funeral because mum might not speak to me again for 'endangering' the life of her poor chair.   Her chair is fine, however am I the asshole?	1642866982.0	sa5g12	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5g12/aita_for_painting_my_room/	AITA for painting my room?

She had to greatly reduce her guest list.   My invitation was for a +1 and also our long time friend was invited and had a +1. I am actually closer to this friend than my sister and she thought since (at the time) we were both single we could just be eachothers dates and then boom, 2 extra spots she didn't have to cut.  This was around 6 months ago. Well, 3 months ago I started dating a woman and things have been going great, however... she wants to be my date to the wedding, not this friend.

br7gloh1	A bit of backstory before I explain the issue. My boyfriend's sister and I are close. We all lived together during the covid lockdowns but no anymore and now, myself and her work together. She is actually my manager. We work really well together, never had a problem. Another thing is that she is anti-vax and I am pro-vax. We have always been respectful about each others choices and never really had an issue.  So the other day, as we were getting ready to leave work, she saw that her on her jacket, one of the seams had come undone and was upset because it's a new jacket. I told her she should contact the store and ask what they can do. She then asked me if I can go and take her jacket in for her as she is unvaccinated. (Side Note: where we live in Germany, all stores besides grocery stores and pharmacies are 2G/2G+ meaning you can't go in unless you have proof of vaccination or recovery and or an antigen test.) I then said no because I don't  want to become an errand girl for her because she has choosen not to get vaccinated and I feel like she should live with the consequences of that choice. It isn't also the first time she's asked me to do her a "favour" because she is unvaccinated and all the other "favours" I have done without question even though they were stuff she could have easily done if she was vaccinated.   Now, I love her a lot, I have nothing against her personally or professionally. I feel like this is simply a covid related matter. Because if the rules weren't in place or she was vaccinated, she wouldn't have ask me to do her these "favours". But now, she took huge offence to me say no, the whole next day, she barely talked to me at work and we had an argument over text that evening, where I explained my side and how I didn't appreciate how it's affecting our work relationship. She didn't want to come to any resolution and told me that if the roles were reversed, it wouldn't even be a question that she would help me and that it's clear as daylight that I don't see her as family as she does to me. Which is completely untrue.   Now, she is being more professional at work but outside of that, she completely ignores me and is sulking hugely. She is also 34 years old and I'm 24 years old. So I'm finding this extremely immature.

We are coming up to an almost 45 degree turn in the road surrounded by hedges. On the outer side of the curve there is a lay-by entrance to two fields.   On approaching the turn he indicated to go round, but then he pulled off the road proper and went on the rough ground at the field entrances.   As he was off the road I went to overtake, well not actually overtake as he was off the road, more continue on past. I thought he was pulling off at the blind corner to be safe. He continued to cycle round the periphery of the lay-by area then back onto the road surface just as I was going past - then hurled abuse at me for continuing on.

26fudjr7	My GF(34) and I(34) have been together for four years, but the beginning of the relationship was rough. I was with someone, and she was still married. During this time, I blamed many of my actions on drinking (me missing events or just not showing up). Honestly, I didn't think our relationship would last that long. The big issue is that lying and cheating gave her PTSD. After therapy and rehab, things were starting to get better, but the trust still wasn't there. After a while things started to get bad again, and her faith in me started to deteriorate. So after a full year of sobriety, I started back my old ways and didn't show up I told her that it was because I went drinking. She told me that I needed to go back to rehab or its over. I told her no recovery, and that was the breaking point...I still haven't had a drink in over a year.	1642868136.0	sa5usp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5usp/aita_for_letting_for_forcing_my_gf_to_break_up/	AITA for letting for forcing my GF to break up with me
iuh9i9h3	I (26 F) have been with my boyfriend “Jason” (25 M) for about 2 years. I have known my friend “Stacey” (25 F) for about 8 years.   For as long as I’ve been dating Jason, Stacey has made rude comments about how unattractive she finds him. She always says things like “I would never date Jason because his nose is SO big, it’s like a clown nose” (that’s literally something she said last week). She doesn’t say it to Jason’s face, just to me.  I always ask her to stop, and she does for a bit. But then after a day or two, she’ll do it again. It really irritates me.  The other day, she made the clown nose comment and she also made fun of Jason’s laugh, and I snapped. I told her that she should stop wasting her time on hating Jason because if Jason was single, there’s no way he’d date her. I also asked if she would like me to make fun of her to her back the way she does to Jason, and I threatened to do it. As a disclaimer, I would never actually do that. I just said it to prove a point.  Stacey started crying and she left my house. She told some of our other friends about the incident, and they said I was an asshole for saying Jason wouldn’t date her. They said it really hurt her feelings, and since she’s single and I’m not, I should have had some tact. Stacey also said my comments implied that she was undateable, even though I never said that. I just said that Jason wouldn’t date her.  Anyway, it’s been a mess of a situation. I wanted to ask this sub if I’m the asshole, so am I?	1642868475.0	sa5yuk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5yuk/aita_for_telling_my_friend_my_boyfriend_would/	AITA for telling my friend my boyfriend would never date her?
ga90urb5	I (21M) have grown a lot in the year since I got dumped. My ex is a year younger than me, we dated for 2-2.5 years and until the end it was a nice relationship where we both looked out for one another and things were great until the past 3ish months. I spiralled deep into depression and stopped putting in the time and energy and she was unhappy. When I was too apathetic to even vote because I felt like things would be shitty no matter what happened, she left me because she was hurt that I'd care so little about her and other people that I'd not even try to ensure a better future. And my response was to be a baby and cry and get sad, and I even told her I wished we hadn't dated so I wouldn't have to feel heartbreak. She was very hurt, and I didn't even want to stay friends because all I could think about is how hurt I would feel if she moved on way faster than me. So I cut her off and was miserable for a few months until I came back, friend about still liking her, and it was just very cringe. The last thing I said was sorry that I caused her pain she never deserved to deal with and blocked her.  I was a TWAT. I know this. I literally feel ashamed writing this post. But I really want to tell her that she was right, and that I appreciate everything she ever taught me and for making me who I am today. Because if she hadn't left me, I probably never would've realized how bad my depression was and gotten better. Now I'm employed, on meds, have friends, and I'm happy. And all I feel towards my ex is a mix of gratitude and regret. She's a GOOD person. I learned so much from her, about life and perspectives and relationships and friendships. Part of me would love to thank her for that and ultimately being what pushed me to get better, just as she always wanted for me. And the rest is regret that I didn't learn soon enough. I don't have romantic feelings for her, and don't want to make things weird or open old wounds by messaging her randomly. I just want to know if I'd be an AH for coming back to say thank you for everything after how hurtful I was, and that I appreciate everything she did for me. Because I really have changed and I wouldn't have if not for her.	1642868892.0	sa63xm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa63xm/wibta_if_i_tried_to_talk_to_my_ldr_ex_girlfriend/	WIBTA if I tried to talk to my LDR ex girlfriend
iwp6m959	I'm 16M and I have been with my foster mom since I was 11. This is kind of hard to explain so please give me time. So my real dad was in some sort of accident when I was younger and he gets a disability check. Since I'm his kid, I get some of the disability check sent to my foster mom ($600 or so a month), plus she also gets money from the state to have me here and some allowance money for my clothes and hygiene products. Collectively she is getting around $1000 a month to have me here. I'm not going to say that she fails me because she doesnt, it's just hard being here for other reasons. Like I've always had to share a room with 1 to 2 other kids because she is a foster parent and a lot of the time she takes in other kids for emergency placement issues. Usually there are around 5 kids in the home at all times not including me. And she gets money for all of them too.   I work part time at McDonalds and I make $11 an hour and she doesnt charge me rent because she gets a bunch of money for me anyways so I've been able to save most of my paychecks and I have a little over $2000 saved. Well my real mom just died and even though she didnt have anything to do with me, she still made a will and included me in it so she left me a good amount of money ($23000). It was put in a bank account for me and I'm not sure what the legalities are on it but I know that since technically my foster mom is my guardian she has access to it but it needs to go through my social worker or something and she can only take money if I give permission. It was explained to me but I dont fully understand it.   My foster mom fell a week ago and she really hurt herself. Her hip shattered and something on her shoulder also messed up, on her right side and she needs surgery but she doesnt have insurance so she needs to pay upfront to have the surgery done. The surgery is minor from what I'm told but the upfront cost is $12,000. She asked me for the money and I really just dont want to give it to her and I've been told I am selfish for thinking this way because my reasoning is that she collects $1000 for me a month and given that she always has at least 5 more kids here that she collects on, she should have some sort of savings to pay for this on her own without taking money from me that could safe guard my future.

iwpnewvf	I left my long term partner earlier this month and he moved out last week.  Honestly though I have been really lonely already.  I was at leaving drinks for a teammate a week ago and I happened to meet a friend of the teammate and after a drunken fun night out we immediately decided to start dating.  I am honestly happier than I have been in a long time and am really excited and I think this guy is the one.  So I had him round already and introduced him to my boys.  My sons are 6, 8, and 10 and I'm 26 if it matters.  But my ex is saying that I am an asshole for introducing a stranger to them so fast that I barely know.  I don't know if he's right or if he's just jealous that I moved on already.	1642870030.0	sa6ibs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6ibs/aita_for_introducing_my_sons_to_my_new_bf_early/	AITA for introducing my sons to my new bf early?
4sdlzunq	 Me (21 ) and my now ex-boyfriend (28) met in early 2021 and everything was pretty perfect till about Christmas time.  I have four brothers older brothers and I also have 5 nieces and a nephew , every year we all spend  Christmas all at my parents house, normally when my older nieces stay at my parents they normally sleep on a sofa bed in our living room but since Santa Claus was coming to town, I offered my bed to my nieces and I would sleep on the sofa bed as it made everything easier.  On Christmas called I my boyfriend as he hadn’t been been able to talk  for a couple days, I made a small comment about me sleeping on the sofa bed and he snapped telling me that I was a slave to my family, I didn’t have dignity because I accepted sleeping on the sofa bed, and how my family treated was something out of horror movie. As you can imagine I was hurt and angry so I told to f himself and blocked him on everything.  This isn’t the only time he has made comments about my family, I will admit I spend a lot of my time with my family and will do anything to make my nieces happy as my family was suffered a lot, my brother who is the father of my two oldest nieces died two years ago, and my other brother who is the father of my two nieces and nephew lost his arm in a work accident this year. My mum absolutely hates Christmas as my oldest brother died in a car accident ten years ago on Christmas Eve. On my same day my dad was seriously injured while in the military which left him with one arm and lost most of his hearing. So at this time of year me and my brothers put all our energy into making it a magical time for my nieces and the whole family.  But as I look back at our relationship he has always tried to get me to spend less time with my friends and always acted like he is feelings and opinions are more important than mine.  Since then his friends have got involved calling me an asshole for dumping him on Christmas eve over the phone when he was drunk .Many  were my friends which has left me completely isolated from many people in my hometown also his mother has tried to call me multiple times since the then.  I like to say we having spoken since and honestly never want to speak about our fight but everyone is saying that I have to give me a explanation and give him a second chance.  So I am the asshole ?	1642870768.0	sa6rrq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6rrq/aita_for_blocking_my_bf_after_he_made_rude/	AITA for blocking my bf after he made rude comments about my family ?
frypnfsd	I (25f) am 38 weeks pregnant and my birthday is on Monday. I am being induced next week, so this is my last weekend before being home with a newborn and toddler.  My husband(29m) has not planned anything despite me telling him multiple times how important this weekend is. It's sunny and I have a 4 day weekend before my last week of work. I made many suggestions weeks ago, but he's shot everything down(I really wanted to do some winter camping, but he even said no to that despite being a huge outdoors guy). I've told him multiple times that planning in advance is important to me, because it makes me feel important and means less stress for me. Suddenly he is trying to make last minute plans, and I expressed to him that I am disappointed. He thinks I need to just buck up and help him plan something.   So here's where I think I might be TA. I really want to go see the new Spiderman movie. I've been thinking about going alone for weeks. My husband can't go because he isn't allowed to for "v reasons"... I would have been perfectly content if he planned a movie and dinner, but he's also not allowed to enter restaurants without a pass in our country. I would go after my toddler is in bed, so he wouldn't even have to watch him alone. So WIBTA if I went tonight by myself even though he can't come and also wants to see it? I just don't want to sit around hoping he'll find some way to make this weekend special and who knows how long it will be before I can go out again...	1642871242.0	sa6ybz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6ybz/wibta_if_i_went_to_the_movies_alone/	WIBTA if I went to the movies alone?
iwmnakn7	For some background, I’m a second generation muslim immigrant. I have an older sibling, mom and dad. I grew up raised by babysitters, then moved onto public school education. I was a very sheltered little girl, my male sibling was not. He ended up dropping out of college, and getting help from my mom to find a decent job. He got married and moved out.   I graduated HS and couldn’t attend my dream school (which was cheaper) because my parents felt anxious about me leaving my hometown. I settled with a school I live 10 minutes away from. Art major. Depression and isolation hit me hard. Even though I was doing everything asked of me, I was expected to cook and clean for them on top of going to college and working.  2nd year, I met my SO and COVID hit. A lot of childhood trauma resurfaced after being in lockdown with my parents. My SO provided me a safe space to be myself. My parents reluctantly allowed me to be with him. I would lie and say I was going to work but really just hung out with him. However, school started back up again and my mental health hit rock bottom.   I decided to take a semester off. I kept pretending to go to school when I was just actually going to work, hanging out with friends and my SO. Lying to my parents came easily to me because I would rather do that than face constant criticism and judgement. During this time, I found out that my mom AND brother were simultaneously cheating on their SO’s which shocked me and showed me their true colors when it came to how they could mistreat family so easily. This is a secret I still keep to myself. I ended up dropping out due to stress and depression. I didn’t tell them… until a year later.  They reacted by emotionally “disowning” me and degrading my character, which is still continuing to this day. They say nasty and hate filled things to me 24/7. I honestly really regret lying and holding onto my secrets for so long. My lies directly fucked up my own life and I owned up to them no matter what. Knowing their secrets, their lies could fuck up so much more and subconsciously already do by creating tension within their own relationships. I still depend on living here until I can save up enough to move out. They forbid me to talk to anyone but I still secretly talk to my SO and friends, and even got a therapist to help me navigate through these tough waters. They’re forcing me to attend a community college to obtain just an associates now which is a complete waste of time. Home is in constant turmoil and I want out for the sake of my emotional well-being, though I know leaving isn’t going to bode well with them at all. I’m going crazy and second guessing myself so much when it comes to this but… am I the asshole for being so resentful and considering shutting my family out of my life?	1642871816.0	sa765p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa765p/aita_for_holding_onto_deep_resentment_towards_my/	AITA for holding onto deep resentment towards my family and wanting to cut them off?
iwm126hv	 I (28F) and my fiancé (28M), will be getting married in April 2022. Very small nothing crazy but i will be having one maid of honor and one bridesmaid. I have two best friends BF1 (known 8 years) and BF2 (known 5 years). Over the last 3 years I’ve been dealing with my parents health. I’m an only child it’s been hard. BF1 i love her so much but she hates BF2 (she just doesn’t like her). BF1 She’s married, has 1 child and one on the way. She has not been around much during my mental struggles for the past 3 years. I get it, she’s a mom now. BF2 has been in constant contact during my struggles, during the pandemic she would come over with a mask just to cheer me up. I was almost hospitalized because my mental health got so bad but it was during the start of Covid so they sent me home to be supervised. I’m healthy now, therapy and natural medicine have been a saving grace for me. Sorry for the off track rant, i had to explain background. I decided with my fiancé that BF2 would be my maid of honor. She’s been a constant support to me and I feel so ever grateful to have her in my life. I MENTION, the possibility of me choosing BF2 as my maid of honor. BF1 overheard and got extremely mad, i had to pretend i was kidding to de-escalate the situation. BF1 reminded me that she had ME as her maid of honor when she got married, she expects the same. I have avoided the conversation ever since. My fiancé and I actually secretly eloped in 2021. The elopement was not planned, we did it in the moment and it was the best decision we ever made. Only like 6 people know and our parents don’t know either. BF1 was not told because she was mad that the trip had been with BF2 and other friends. She finally got over it but by that time i was afraid of how she would take it knowing BF2 had been present. Now with April ( time for church ceremony and reception) legit around the corner. I don’t know what to do.  I am open to suggestions too. I haven’t officially picked a MOH yet but i have to announce it soon. *very untraditional wedding, we are doing it mainly for our families.	1642872054.0	sa798r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa798r/aita_for_not_telling_bf1_she_will_not_be_the_maid/	AITA for not telling BF1 she will not be the maid of honor?

he11qhtd	First off I want to get two things clear.  One I’m not the person who wouldn’t let my half brother eat what he wants for his birthday.  And two my brother has an allergy to eggs (specifically egg whites) and he cannot eat them because he get mild diarrhea for a day and a half and there isn’t any other problems than that. Let’s get into the story,   So it’s my half brother’s birthday today and he wants to go to a burger place after three days of begging we finally get to go there for his birthday. When we arrive to the place we meet with one extra family member for the occasion and we sit down and order my mother asks everyone and he says the brunch burger it had fried egg bacon and two meat patties my mom was pissed at him for trying to “get out of school on monday” even though he repeatedly tried to say that he just wants to eat what he wants for his birthday. But no he can’t have what he wants. I even stood up for him but she then said I was in on the plan to get out of school. Even my step dad says he should be able to but she wouldn’t let him and he’s super bummed out about it. So is she the asshole or not   Personally I think she is.

13tntxgf	My wife and I've been at an AirBnB that is obviously someone's regular living space (not just a dedicated rental) since Thursday night, and this morning my temporary neighbors, three women in their twenties (I'm guessing) knocked on my door when my wife was in the restroom to ask if I'd seen or *picked up* their Amazon packages. I hadn't, and told them so. They said that they'd been told a neighbor had accepted them and mentioned a name I didn't know.  "Sorry, we didn't see anything, and we rented this place for a couple days from <AirBnB host's name>."    "Oh, we thought you were someone else," said the spokesperson. "We'll try the other neighbor," she said, then somewhat reluctantly left.  The AirBnB is itty bitty. They could've searched the space in a couple minutes. Should I have offered "You're welcome to take a look"? I find myself thinking if they *never* find the package they may forever suspect that we were thieves. But I'm also a guest in someone else's space, and inviting in strangers to search it might be a violation of *that* trust.

I told him about my friend Tanya (19f) who was looking into dating. My boyfriend then said “Well, that isn’t a single, that’s double.” Which I’m sure was a clear indication towards her being slightly overweight. So naturally, I called him out for it. He apologised and said he regretted saying it but also hinted at me being overdramatic.

Then one day, they came to the city where my university is and asked me and almost pressured me to go out with them. They live abroad and didn't warn me that they were coming. I was taken aback and told them I couldn't because I was busy moving. My uncle took it very personally and blocked me, as did my aunt. I was very upset because I was trying to call them and apologise but with no effect. A month or so later, I tried calling them again but with no effect. I was later informed that he blocked my number and that my aunt blocked me on Facebook. At this point I had no interest in apologising to them for something that seems so minor.

iwrdlw9z	My husband's best friend Ella called him asking him if he could meet her immediately while we were going to get groceries. My husband, Roger said that she sounded like she was crying and asked me if we could just stop by for a while to check in on Ella. I agreed.   When she opened the door, she looked like a train wreck honestly. Her eyes were swollen and red, she was sniffing, and she hugged Roger at the doorstep. I was about to ask her to take off her hands from my husband when to my shock he hugged her back and started comforting her.   When we were all seated in her living room, she said that her fiancé called off their wedding a week before their marriage. He said that he wasn't ready for the marriage anymore although they had been dating since high school(14 year old relationship).   Apparently she was in a very poor state of mind and that's why she called my husband immediately so that she'd have someone with her.   Roger asked her if she'd like to have dinner with us. She accepted saying that she could do with some company.   I was really mad at Roger for inviting her over to dinner because I'd been looking forward to having dinner with him after nearly 2 weeks of hectic work schedules.   After dinner, Ella said she'd be sleeping over at her mom's place for the night and left. I blew up at Roger calling him selfish for not asking me before inviting Ella over for dinner.   He said that I'd never mentioned anything regarding a date night today and he thought it would be nice to help Ella deal with her pain even if it was for a short while.   I feel bad for shouting at him. On second thought, he really didn't know that I'd planned a date night for the two of us.

When I was thirteen, their dad touched me and I havent told my parents until two years later. My aunt found out right after their break up. I regularly talk to ny cousins about what they do at Daddy's house and what games they play, and from what I heard, he aint doing a good job (letting his 6 year old throw his glasses out of the window for fun, for example). Anyway, I'm moving countries in a week and I have a chance to come see my cousins one last time. I want to tell them, especially the girl, to be careful around daddy because of what happened to me under his care, but I'm not sure whether I should, since he was high at the time and probably doesnt even remember touching me (he did get unnecesseraly close on other occasions, but I thought it was in an Uncle-Niece kind of way).

4a70cttv	So my mom suffers from really bad fibromyalgia and is in constant pain. At the start of 2021 she really wanted a puppy, and got a really small one and named her DG.  DG just kept growing and getting even more energetic, and my mom cried a lot of tears, but finally decided to get rid of her. She posted her everywhere she could think of. A bit of a side note, but at least three families met her and decided not to get her. Back to the main story, we live out in the country and this one woman messaged my mom asking her to bring DG out to meet her and her other dogs. She lived about half an hour away, and my mom was getting desperate by now. She was about halfway there when she got a message that the woman got another dog from someone else. My mom had set a time for her to meet DG and the woman went and got a dog from someone else. My mom was really upset about it, and I got really angry and my mom told me to not be an asshole about it.

Honestly, that upset me a lot just because I couldn't understand why he would randomly associate himself like this with them.

kpm5s	Ok so, I'm gonna start off this post by describing my actual situation: I'm in a steady relationship for a bit more than a year. I'm a 30 year old bisexual male with 3 past relationships, one lasted for 6 years and the other two lasted for 2 years each.  Recently i've been experiencing something I never did before: I'm way hornier than my girlfriend. I know that we all go through different sexual drive "moments" throughout our lives and I just wanna respect her time and needs to do whatever she wanna do.  The thing is: in my experience I've always been the "less-horny" one, my past girlfriends and boyfriend were way way more willing to have sex than I was, but, whenever they wanted to and tried to start something off by teasing me and touching me I would end up getting aroused and we would have sex.  I honestly feel a little frustrated with my girlfriend at the moment because a lot of times I try to tease her and she gets a "not in the mood" attitude that completely breaks my "vibe" so to speak. I think I may also get frustrated because masturbating to aliviate this feeling often does not work, I quit porn a long time ago and now it doesnt work for me (I tried) and I feel bad when I have to masturbate thinking about fucking the person who is right next-door and often in the middle of masturbating I get a lot of mixed feelings about it and it kills the possibility of coming.   Me and my girlfriend already talked about this, and she is also in a tough spot where she is satisfied by the regularity in which we have sex (about once one day and none in the other and than once again). I understand that for some people that might be enough and it even seems like it was enough for me for a long period of time but for the last 3 months I'm getting aroused so often it just started to bother me. I feel like I'm in that sexual rush of the beginning of relationships when you just wanna fuck all the time, but we are already one year in and I feel she just isn't in the same place.   Again I dont wanna push this on her, I dont think being in a relationship means she would have to fulfill all my needs and I understand her point of view. My question is: Am i the asshole for considering alternatives to the current situation so I feel less frustrated? I have been in open relationships before and I deal fairly well with them, and I started considering it again.   My girlfriend is the one I wanna spend my days with and work beside and deal with life together and such but I feel like I'm starting to be a worst person because of this frustration. Often i'll get frustrated and just get in a state where my mood is terrible and I dont laugh, dont wanna talk or do anything together so I just work nonstop to distract myself.   (Yeah I already talked to my girlfriend about all of this several tomes but at this point talking about it again is just a bit pointless since we already know where we stand. So I came here to maybe listen to some different points of view to help me deal with the situation.)	1642874191.0	sa81gb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa81gb/aita_for_wanting_seggs/	AITA for wanting seggs?

gj9cijvq	We both have MH issues so we are a bit odd in that work load is usually split more on who's coping best with their mental health.   He keeps calling out from work with no notice and saying it's all fine (luckily has been, but they just need 1 other person dumb enough to work his job) and borrowing money so we are £200 in debt right now. We need to pay it by wednesday, we cant. I kept telling him not to borrow for fucking chocolate and weed but nah he does anyway and brings it home all fucking proud of himself. And uses things like me being a bit disappointed theres only custard left in the house or something as a reason for him doing it.   I have cleaned many rooms from tips over the time we have been together as we cant stick to routine small tasks as we may go a week without feeling able to cope with something as simple as washing clothes.   My allergies seem to be getting worse and I'm having breathing difficulty so I try do the more easy jobs (washing clothes, picking up rubbish, and attempt litter trays and bathroom cleaning when my breathing is feeling good.  Recently I've asked my boyfriend to do the kitchen and sitting room, he hasnt done it properly and it's getting on my nerves. Like I ask him to clean the kitchen and he cooks a roast dinner washing what he needs then immediately making it dirty again. It got really bad. Like mold bad. He still would go and wash up enough to make another meal then leave it. The floor is covered in stuff and it honestly makes me feel sick eating food from there or being in there.  I dont want a lovely roast dinner in a gross house, I'd rather not eat but sit in a clean house. I'm just so upset. Hes not cleaned the fridge out and I've asked for 3 fucking months.   And every time I bring up my feelings its tears, and asking if I even like his cooking ect.  I love him, hes going through a really tough time with his mental health but he wont even let me hire a cleaner. Now hes on about us moving to a major city and getting jobs. I just want a clean fucking house.   Every time I get angry I feel bad coz he cant cope and he just sits and cries but I'm honestly sick to death of all these problems. My whole house stinks of garlic coz he cooked chicken last night and left the lid off the pre chopped garlic.  TLDR: Bf does things like make a roast dinner instead of cleaning, borrowing money for food when I asked him not to and avoiding things that need done, then making huge plans for a better life when he cant even help keep an okay one.	1642874542.0	sa867s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa867s/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_stuff_for/	AITA: for being mad at my boyfriend for stuff for me I dont ask for instead of the things I specifically ask of him?
2gaxigt0	For reference i am a 17 bisexual male, very new to the LGBT community (i only realized I am bi a couple years ago), and i was watching a video on TikTok from a 31 queer female, and she was talking about respecting elder queers. I wholeheartedly agree that elder queers deserve all the respect in the world, but what confounded me was how she was using the inclusive tense. "we" "us". As if she was an elder queer.    So i simply asked, "why do you refer to yourself as an elder queer when you're only 31?" And she got really defensive and said "child, for a queer black woman 31 is elder, and since you have no respect you can leave."   I clarified, "i meant no disrespect, i was asking because my understanding is you are an elder if you are 60 or over." Afterward she replied and blocked me, i couldn't see what she had said in the reply tho.   Am i the asshole?	1642874790.0	sa89gy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa89gy/aita_for_asking_someone_why_they_referred_to/	AITA for asking someone why they referred to themselves as an Elder Queer?
huymlojo	  Short Summary of what happened before this event: A few weeks ago my cousin (15) came over and took my ADHD meds and passed them on to his friends. This caused a huge fight between my aunt and my family and they were banned from our house.  Now onto the story: on my birthday when nearly everyone was asleep and only my friends were up in the basement we heard a few weird noises coming from upstairs. At first we didn't think anything of it but after 10 minutes we decided to check it out. I thought that it could be my cat or another animal since I live next to a forest but to my shock it was my cousin trying to find a way into our house. He was clearly high on some drugs and seemed Super aggressive. I yelled at him but it only caused him to get more angry. After like 5 minutes my dad came downstairs and that's when my cousin got scared and ran off. We tried to call my aunt immediately but she didn't pick up the phone since it was like 4 in the morning.  On the next day when all my friends were gone we decided to call my aunt again and told her what my cousin has done but she didn't believe us just like when we told her that my cousin stole my meds. She called us "dirty liars" and "disgusting assholes" for lying about her son. We told her that if it would happen again, we'd call the cops on him and hung up.  A few days after it happend again. I felt really threatened by him since he seemed even more aggressive and I was home alone. I didn't know what to do so I called the cops. Like 15 minutes later they showed up and arrested him and took him to the Station since he didn't have an ID with him. He had to stay there over night. My aunt didn't like that at all and showed up to our house throwing a fit. We told her that we warned her and my cousin but she got aggressive as well and tried to hit my father.  Now my dad thinks that we should get a restraining order against my cousin and my aunt but I still feel bad for calling the cops even though I felt like I was in danger. Some of my friends say that my reaction was right and the others say that I should have waited. The possibility is high that I kind of destroyed his future since he now has a few charges on his record.  I still don't know if I am the asshole since there definetly were other ways to solve this but idk. Also I feel bad that he actually had to stay at the Station over night.

iwtujl2h	Teacher wouldn't let me use the bathroom. I told her it was an emergency. She didn't believe me. I told her I really had to go and she told me if I talk again I'm going to the principals office. I couldn't hold it any longer and we had 45 minutes left.   I intentionally pissed myself. I wasn't going to last anyways so what's the point. I ended up getting suspended. Teacher made the whole class leave.

2qdck2gj	So the thing you need to know before I go further, is that I (23f) hit my narcissistic ex-boyfriend (27m) once on the arm because we were in a heated argument about something I don't remember and he slathered peanut butter all over my childhood blanket, which is one of the few sentimental things I have because I lost most of my belongings due to years of homelessness.  So present day, I'm at a bar with my friends, I was quite tipsy and having a good time and my friend showed me a text from a person that my ex boyfriend and I were friends with. The text mentioned the person never liking me because of a few small reasons, (talking too much, uninteresting, etc) and the fact that I used to frequently hit my ex. This shocked me and my friends because we all knew that is very unlike me and I've never hit any of my exes in my life, and they will tell you so. I ended up in tears and I left the bar because I was feeling the vibe anymore.  The final days of our relationship came flooding back to me and I sat at home fuming and riled up, possibly affected by alcohol, and I called my ex boyfriend to get clarification. He told me he hadn't spread any rumours, and I asked him "Well how did that sort of thing start going around?". Then he mentioned he told people close to him about the time with the blanket. I exploded and started yelling at him about how angry I was that thanks to that, people were labelling me as a physical abuser. I wanted to know how a one time hit on the arm converted me into a domestic abuser, and he still insisted he didn't spread any rumours and that it's not his fault that people think that about me.  Here's where I think I could be the the A hole, I know I shouldn't have called him while I was furious and should have done it when I was calm or even ignored the situation entirely, but I wasn't thinking straight and I was so angry at being labelled a physical abuser. Of course there's no excuse there, but that's the truth.

2x0lfogp	So me (27) and my now ex husband (28)  broke up last year due to the endless cheating, him neglecting our child, along with a lot of other trauma.    He started dating someone two months after we separated. Me still not mentally over the loss of my family, decided to get on tiktok and find a healthy coping mechanism, and vent about all the issues I’ve been through with him.   I did not give him any notifications that I was doing this. Because I wasn’t leaking out any personal information about him. Not even his name. So I didn’t feet it would be an issue.  Plus the fact that I never gave him my username or linked him to where he could find it.    2 weeks pass, and he comes to me angry, telling me he wants me to delete my videos because his girlfriend found them and was extremely upset.   I told him straight up no.  Because why is someone I don’t know in my business? He told me that she was curious and decided to look me up.  Which was creepy, because I chose to know nothing about this woman.    I explained to him that it’s my way to express myself.He did not take this answer to well.      I keep posting as usual. And his relationship fell because of “me”. Turns out he was the one who found my tiktok and chose to show his girlfriend everything, making her feel insecure about their own relationship.  He blames me for “ruining his happiness” AITA?	1642875596.0	sa8jw7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa8jw7/aita_for_not_deleting_my_tiktok_after_my_exs_new/	AITA for not deleting my tiktok after my ex’s new gf expressed she didn’t like my content?
in8so8hb	I may sound cruel but I have my reasons. One of my friends is in an abusive relationship, his husband and I never got along. Our relationship was civil but he gave me bad vibes since they were dating because he always acted like an arrogant prick. My friend over the past few months has been venting to me about his marriage. He doesn’t acknowledge the things he has experienced as abusive because it isn’t physical and it’s harder to recognise abuse in a same sex relationship imo. I have sent him resources and have offered him many times a place to stay, selected a few divorce lawyers for him etc. He’s in deep denial. We’re still good friends but it’s exhausting hearing him vent one day and then praise the guy. We still meet up often as friends however, I haven’t distanced myself.  On Friday night I held a dinner, something still with my boyfriend, a few other friends and invited him over. At first he told me he’s coming alone because his husband has other arrangements. Last minute he tells me his husband is coming along and that’s when I told him to not come over and we could meet up a different day. Today he messaged me that he felt very hurt by this and has been distant.  Aside from not liking the guy for how he treats my friend, the last time we all went out together he started an altercation with my boyfriend after he called him out for being rude to a restaurant employee. There were other instances he was unkind to me as well.

2zds535t	I currently do online programming/coaching as a side business of mine as it’s what I went to school for and have dedicated much of my adult life to learning about, and I will be working in a related professional field in the near future.   I never ask or charge my friends for programs, protocols for specific things, etc. I have a close friend doing a professional physique photoshoot, he asked me for some advice and what I would recommend for his approach to diet, training, and supplementation leading up to the shoot.   The protocol is ~10 days long, including diet, exercise regiment, supplement protocol, and I’ll also be doing about 1-6 photo updates *per day* depending on the day to ensure it goes as planned for him. I didn’t ask for anything or imply wanting it, but he sent me $100 for it.   It’s information I’ve spent years learning, took a couple hours to write out, and the time for update pictures etc…. But for some reason I feel wrong accepting that money for it. If I were to do this for a client, I would charge that or more, but I’ve never charged a friend before. Do I sent half back? Leave it how it is and say I appreciate it?   As I’m now moving into making this a serious part of my career, as I would pay friends for their services, I would hope to be valued enough to be paid for mine. I guess I’d just like some input from others on this if I’m in the wrong for not sending the full or a partial amount back.   Thanks all.	1642876166.0	sa8rbf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa8rbf/aita_for_accepting_this_payment_from_a_friend/	AITA for accepting this payment from a friend?
iwtujl2m	I f42 has 2 kids who are 16 and 11 with my ex-boyfriend who is 40. My and my ex broke up when the girls were 8 and 3 and he soon started dating Celeste who is now 35 when they were 10 and 5. My oldest daughter only sees me on weekends while my youngest comes with me everywhere week since she's only 11. When the breakup was fresh my kids stayed with their father for about 2 years because I was mentally unstable to care for them. After all, the breakup hurt me so badly.   I'm now okay and I see my girls a lot and I think we have a good relationship. Anyways, about a month ago we all went out to do some fun activities with the girls and he decided to bring his wife along. I was quite upset because this was supposed to be family time but I was calm. Well, I was calm until I heard the pet name she calls them. She calls them "her love". Like when my youngest asked to get on a ride she would say, of course, my love same with my oldest. I was really uncomfortable and I always call my daughters by their first names so while my Ex was in line with my kids I asked if I could talk with Celeste. I told her how I felt and she understood and I thought that was the end of it.   About a few days ago my daughters came from their dad's house looking upset and though I didn't care because teenagers normally have attitudes I asked. My oldest asked me why I told Celeste to stop calling them those names and that they liked it. I simply told her it made me uncomfortable and she needs to stay in her place and when she has kids she can call them whatever she likes. My oldest started screaming at me that when I wasn't around Celeste was and that she considered Celeste her real mom because I was so busy being a "drug addict and a whore" that I couldn't be bothered with them. She then told me she wanted to live with her father fully and I won't allow it because I deserve a right to my kids.

hslbkry6	Back in December I got my driving license, however I don't have my own car, my dad is the only one in the family that has one, and he's... complicated. He's very strict with his things and it's not easy to convince him to do something for me, especially giving me his car. Plus, I tend to avoid conflict, so when I can avoid having an argument with him, I do.  My GF asked me if I wanted to come to her place this evening (it's far so you need a car). Then, she started complaining, raising her voice, about the fact that I didn't ask my dad about the car this evening, saying that her dad always has to come pick her up, and stuff like that. I remained in silence because her raising her voice where everyone could hear us made me uncomfortable, so when we arrived we sat at a bench and tried to discuss things. She continued to say what she thought I was doing wrong (which, I agree with - that's not the problem) and I told her that I didn't like her tone, which was coming off as aggressive (initially I also argued with her a bit, until realizing she was overall right about the car thing) She kept speaking and I started slightly crying, however she just continued speaking, trying to get a response from me, and then silence.  After a while we try again. I try to tell her that she's right, but I try to explain what the problem is with my dad, and I still feel attacked by her. Her tone came off as aggressive, not comforting and welcoming, and when I tried to speak about the situation she interrupted me saying stuff like "so that makes it okay?", even though I made clear that I wasn't trying to justify myself, only explaining.  I sit in silence again and we try one more time. We sit and this time I start to cry a lot, and I still don't see any sign of compassion from her, just her denying that her tone was aggressive, that if I thought that that was aggressive I didn't know what aggressive meant/what she's like when she's really angry, etc. This time I was getting frustrated, I felt like she didn't understand me, like she wasn't listening to me, like she was distant from me. I started using a fairly aggressive/provocative tone too, while crying, but I also told her that I didn't feel comfortable in that situation because of her way of handling this.  Anyway, eventually I reach a point where I can't take it, I can't take her attitude anymore. I just say "whatever" and run off crying. I usually don't act impulsively, I'm not that kind of person, but this time I did. I didn't look back, I just walked off crying. After a while I stopped. She followed me (I didn't go that far) and said that I was an asshole, that she should slap me, that I did one of the shittiest thing I could do to her, and so on. We went back home. We talked a bit but not much. I said sorry many times, but she said that I shouldn't have done it, I shouldn't have ran away during an argument, because it was just an argument, and she "won't forget it".

4py3xkj	I (20M) have been living with my girlfriend (21F), and a mutual friend of ours (22F) for about 7 months now. Let's call our friend "April". Ever since my girlfriend and I moved in with April, unfortunately our friendship with her has somewhat struggled, partially because of all of the common things that come when living with someone, but also because of her girlfriend (we'll call her Lana), whom she started dating a little after we all decided to move in together. Her girlfriend is not a necessarily bad person, however my girlfriend and I just don't really enjoy her company, and we find the both of them to be somewhat inconsiderate at times.  About 3 or 4 days prior to the situation at hand; April came into our room and said she wasn't feeling well, and asked if she could have an at-home ***** test from us. So we supplied her with a test and some Dayquil and we didn't really see her the rest of the night. The next day, April informs me that she does indeed have [a specific illness that cannot be named]. I had suggested that she should quarantine in her room for a little while until she comes back negative, but I didn't really dwell on it too long or emphasize it too much, because I had figured she was smart enough to know that, and didn't really need me to tell her what to do. The day after that, we learn that April was going to hang out at Lana's apartment (Lana lives with like 4 other people I think). This was somewhat alarming to us but we didn't really feel it was our place to say anything.  This brings us to our dilemma. My gf and I went out with a couple of our friends to a place that serves drinks and has board games to play. These were also friends of April's, however, I didn't even really consider inviting her, mostly because she is infected. At some point in the middle of a game, April calls my girlfriend asking where we were, and we didn't really feel like there was anything to hide, so she told her, and the call pretty much ended after that. During the call, April had sounded like she was in good spirits. But then not even within a minute of the phone call ending, April texts my gf and me in a group chat saying "Sucks that I'm not invited to stuff anymore". We left it without response because we weren't to let it ruin our night, and also we felt that it was kinda petty and cowardly to send some pity party text like that just after she had the opportunity to say something over the phone. When we got back we were ready to have a talk with her and explain to her that she wasn't invited because she has COVID, but when we got back home she was hanging out with Lana.  As of writing this we haven't really spoken to her or even seen much of her in 3 days. I want to talk to her at some point, but at the same time my gf and I both agree that we don't really feel sorry for not inviting her. So, AWTA?  TL;DR: My gf and I's roommate got sick and is upset that she wasn't invited to hang out with us and our friends.	1642876791.0	sa8ze2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa8ze2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_roommate_out/	AITA for not inviting my roommate out?
e3birpxb	I'm a third year dentistry student and we have to separate hospitals where we do our practicals. This year we have to divide ourselves up into two groups. One group at Hospital A and the second group at hospital B. There are 13 people per group.  Hospital A is really close, so everyone wants to be there, while Hospital B is far away and also in an unsafe area.   We were supposed to make a list with all our names in a WhatsApp group chat. But when the list for Hospital A came through, there were already 9 names on the list. So the 15 people left, had to fight for getting those last 4 spots. It was a first come-first serve basis. So whoever could type the quickest and add their name to the list, secured their spot at hospital A. The rest automatically falls into the hospital B group.   What happened was that some people messaged the person sending out the list, personally. So they basically "reserved" their spots on the list. Their argument was that they were in "ride-together clubs" and being at separate hospital will be inconvinient for them.   Am I right for saying that this was unfair and not really a first come first serve, or am I being unreasonable towards the people in the "lift clubs"?  Please provide a solid or lenghty argument about your opinion.   Thank you!	1642877442.0	sa97sn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa97sn/aita_for_getting_upset_about_this/	AITA for getting upset about this?
g596u	A few years ago I was on a train and sat next to a large woman who then started to breath noisily, whistling through her nose.  I sent my family a WhatsApp message saying something like "just my luck, I got sat next to a fat nose-whistler!"  Obviously this was meant to be private.  A little while later, the woman took a phone call and said something like, "Yeah I'm okay - apart from this woman yesterday called me -" and then turned to me, "- what did you call me? A fat nose whistler?"  I was absolutely mortified, because I would never ever say anything like that to anyone's face, and obviously I know it was a horrible comment. However, I think I just said "you shouldn't have been looking at my phone", and it made me really angry that she had. I wasn't in any way holding my phone in a way that I thought anyone could see, nor was I trying for her to see it, clearly. I think it's incredibly rude for someone to look at a stranger's phone - what if I was doing online banking and they could get my details?!  So am I the arsehole full stop for what I said, which was only meant to be private and I would never say that to someone or want them to see that as I can imagine how hurtful that is... or is she the arsehole for snooping on my phone, and it's irrelevant what I put because she shouldn't have been looking?  As a side note, I am working on my fatphobia. I am never impolite to large people and don't believe this was solely due to size (I think I have that condition where I really can't stand certain noises, and any audible breathing makes me irrationally uncomfortable) but I accept I have work to do on that front.	1642878104.0	sa9glj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9glj/aita_for_a_stranger_nosying_at_my_phone_on_a/	AITA for a stranger nosying at my phone on a train and seeing a nasty comment?
9ww4u116	My parents had a trip scheduled for May of 2020 that, for obvious reasons, didn't happen. This was a Christmas gift from my brother. They are no longer interested in it and neither is my brother. My husband and I are and the deadline is fast approaching.  To get the trip transferred, my parents had to call since it was in their name. They came to my house to transfer it today. It was taking quite a while and we kept getting put on hold over and over. My mom was getting pretty mad and, in my opinion, a bit rude with the guy on the phone.   My parents needed to email these people so that they had the approval to transfer it "on paper." The guy on the phone misspelled the email to us twice. This is not helping my mom's mood especially since she was blaming me since I was sending the email. The guy was spelling it phonetically. I know I didn't mess up. He spelled it incorrectly. I even read it back to him every time. Not important I suppose.   The important part. My mom starting going off about how "you effing owe me for this" as she's getting more irritated. Eventually this leads to us yelling at each other. Now I will admit that I do believe I was the first to raise my voice. She was blaming me for screwing it (the email) up and I had just had enough. She then screamed that she was leaving and snatched my dad's phone out of my hand (we were using his phone to call and mine to email).   I took it back. She's welcome to leave. My dad and I can finish this. Queue more yelling. I apologized to the guy on the phone and told him we would apparently not be taking this trip. I then told my parents to get out. Told. Yelled. Semantics.   My dad is arguing that my mom did nothing wrong. He always says that regardless of what happened. She once slapped me hard enough to send my glasses flying off of my face when I was a teen because I "backtalked." Guess who's side my dad took? Go on, guess.   Anyway, I brought up her cussing at me happened well before I raised my voice. He claimed that didn't happen. I repeated what she said verbatim. He claimed she was joking. I shut the door in their faces.   My dad (or mom - she often uses his phone and texts us as if she is him) text me saying how disappointed he was in me. That I started all of that. It was uncalled for and my mother did nothing wrong.   Idk. Maybe he's right. Maybe I started all of it. Maybe my mom did nothing wrong and I'm just insane. My mom treated us kids like crap growing up and I harbor a lot of resentment. She's incapable of taking responsibility for anything. She claims things didn't happen the way we say they did. Or that it was just a joke and we need to "lighten up." Or she will apologize but it's not sincere. In fact, it's usually self degrading and more of guilt trip about how she tried her best and we're all ungrateful. By then end of it, you're apologizing to her.  I'm incredibly biased and incapable of seeing things clearly when it comes to my mother.

67rn1rpx	So for background purposes I am a white female, I just turned 18. I like to cosplay characters from the undertale fandom. Basically just a bunch of skeleton characters. I have fun doing it and it’s been a big outlet for me on tik tok. Although recently I wanted to cosplay a specific character, Nightmare sans, he’s an all black skeleton that has four tentacles on his back. I worked for days to make a whole strap system and everything. I decided to go live as I did the makeup and to actually represent the character I used black makeup and used white makeup to shade it so it was more of a dark grey. Some people started to say it was black face because I was white and I was horrified. I fully support the black community and I didn’t consider it was black face because well, I was dressing up as a skeleton not mocking a person! The comments were divided on if it was blackface or not. If it is I take full responsibility and will apologize to those I offended. I didn’t mean to be racist and if I was I am so sorry. I just wanted to have fun as a comfort character of mine. So please, AITA? If you need a reference for the character look up nightmare sans, I’d rather not post a picture of my face for privacy.	1642878207.0	sa9hz7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9hz7/aita_for_wearing_black_makeup/	AITA for wearing black makeup?
iw1373hz	About 5 years ago, my dad had a massive heart attack.   The medical bills are through the roof.  My parents didn’t want to lose their home, so my fiancée at the time bought the house out because she had the money.   She got the legal documents saying my parents could live there for the rest of their lives, and after their death, the house reverts to her.  We moved across the country for work, letting my dad and mom stay in the house rent-free, and they pay the utilities.  We pay the taxes and whatever repairs they need.   My sister moved back to my parents with her new husband.  They have been trying to get my parents to rewrite the will.    My dad said we don’t own the house anymore, and my sister flipped.  She said it’s now her house and she’s been helping my parents for two years.  Her husband has been helping around the house mowing, and he fixed a broken sink.    My sister called my wife, saying she was robbed of our inheritance.  My wife said she’d sell my sister the house at current market value.  My sister is telling everyone that my wife is a bitch and trying to profit off the family.     My parents are now wanting  to get a mortgage to repurchase the house. They then want to split the house cost with the family after they die.  This is being fed into my parents every day.  The problem is that they want to get a mortgage and then would have to pay that monthly when they have no bills now.   My sister is feeding lies to my parents, who are elderly, and I want them out of the house.  So I started the eviction process on my sister and her husband.   My parents think I am an absolute asshole, but this was never an issue until my sister and her husband moved in.	1642878649.0	sa9nng	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9nng/aita_for_wanting_to_evict_my_sister/	AITA for wanting to evict my sister?
emtd50lx	My brother and SIL and I used to be friends. Things changed after my bf broke up with me unexpectedly when I was pregnant and I decided to move back to my parent’s house. My parents, brother and SIL were super nice and encouraging, and reassured me they'd be there for me and the baby.   My SIL had a baby before me, and left a bag of baby clothes at my house when I was pregnant. She never said anything, my mom was just like, she left these here for you. I had a bunch of other baby clothes from friends, so I put them in with those clothes.    I decided to move back with my bf when my baby was 7 months. I was nervous to be alone with the baby all day, and was still upset about the breakup. I texted my brother and SIL and told them when I was moving, and that I was scared. Neither said much. A week later, my brother sent me an accusatory series of texts, saying that I sucked because I hadn’t given back their baby clothes once they were outgrown, so they could give them to a friend. I was shocked, because most people don’t expect you to return baby clothes, especially without saying something, but my brother made it seem like everyone returned baby clothes, and I was an uncouth loser for not knowing. My SIL insisted on digging through ALL his outgrown clothes to find the ones she’d given me. I found this invasive, but my mom wouldn’t let me say no. I was upset and never would have accepted the clothes if I had to give them back, but I wasn’t given that choice as they were left at the house. My brother and SIL dismissed my feelings about the clothes by calling it a misunderstanding and saying I was overreacting by being upset.  Two weeks after I moved, my SIL texted me for my address. I didn’t answer, but she got my address from my mom and sent a housewarming gift. It felt fake and forced. I was put off that they could just treat me badly, then mail a bunch of stuff against my will and think everything was ok. A few months later she mailed me a gift for my baby’s birthday, but her gifts injured him, plus he almost choked on one gift. The gifts had bad juju, and I didn’t know what I was potentially agreeing to by accepting them, like with the clothes. But I was gracious and kept the peace.  A few weeks later, I read something saying when faced with guilt or resentment, you must always choose guilt. I took a deep breath and texted my SIL. I told her I didn’t want her to mail me any more gifts, that I never gave her my address or wanted my mom to give her my address. I told her I was upset at how she and my brother treated me about the clothes, and that it felt like I was being put into the same situation again, against my will, which is why I didn’t want any more things mailed to me.  Well, my brother and SIL told me they’re basically done with me, and my mom is on their side and says I’m just so mean. My SIL says I’m not allowed in their house or life unless I apologize to her.

49g3acet	AITA? A few years ago I worked for a company that was run by my (ex) friend's family. There were about 6 of us that worked there in total, 3 from this family and 3 of us who weren't family but meant to be close friends.  I worked for this company for 5 years, started out just serving in the coffee shop and shop areas but slowly started making the products that were sold pretty much by myself while the family did office work mostly. I was expected to serve in the shop and coffee shop and make, bottle and label  all of the stuff we sold. Another worker there made chocolates to sell in the store and a third was a gardener.  After working for the company for a few years, my partner and I decided to buy a house. The owners (my ex-friend's parents) were not supportive of this because they thought it put too much pressure on them for the business to do well. At the same time they were building themselves a new house.  A couple of years after we bought the house, I was still working for them, they went to do this trade show and left me and another worker (not part of the family but was a friend of the owners) to run the store for a week. During this time away we got to talking and realised that both of us were extremely unhappy working there and were looking for new jobs. While we were chatting about this she asked me if I could print her pay slips for her as she hadn't got them, so I logged into the store computer and printed them for her. We realised at this point that we were on differing incomes, mine being considerably lower considering the time I'd worked for them and the amount I did. We also saw that the owners other children (who didn't do any work for the company) had pay slips on there too, so we looked at those and saw they were both being paid more than we were.  This was a few years ago, but a lot of my anxiety stems from my time spent around this family and I need to know, AITA?	1642879092.0	sa9tar	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9tar/aita_for_looking_at_company_pay_slips/	AITA for looking at company pay slips
iwvy08gd	My (40f) son Matt (18m) lives with me. His father is not in his life. He left when Matt was 12. Ever since, Matt has become reckless. Failing grades, going out drinking, etc. His curfew was 12am, but now because of his behavior, I am changing it to 9pm. I know he's 18, but he still lives under MY house. Until he can get a place of his own, he needs to obey my rules.   Thing is, Matt didn't take kindly to this. He's started opposing me in almost every way, such as starting parties once I'm gone or calling my cuss words. I confronted him as to why hates his mother so much, to the point where I cried. He dried my tears and said he's a monster and probably needs therapy. I told him he's my beautiful boy and I love him. For some reason, he took me to his room to show me something.  From that point on, he slowly unzips his pants and shoes his 9 inch cock in front of me. I haven't seen his cock since he was a 10-year-old boy. I didn't realize it became that big. Then, he tied my wrists and dicked me down on his bed. He fucked my pussy until his cum was all over it. He shoved his big dick in my mouth until it was down my throat until I gagged and puked all over it. He licked my puke off and stuck his fingers in my ass.   He fucks my armpit and cums on it, licking the cum off my armpit. Then he tossed my salad and licked my leftover shit (I just pooped an hour before this and forgot to wipe) and kisses me afterwards. He fucked my eyeball until blood leaked on his cock and now I'm blind. He fucked my ear too. Stuck his cock inside it and now his manhood is full of earwax. A week later he gave me STDs and cancer.   But I still didn't lift his curfew. He got angry and drove off. AITA for giving him a stricter curfew?	1642879372.0	sa9wxi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9wxi/aita_for_giving_my_son_a_curfew_despite_being_18/	AITA for giving my son a curfew despite being 18?
ivuhkce1	First I want to appologize for any mistakes in this post. English is not my first language.   My (f21) two friends (they21)(they24) have announced via group chat during their vacations to Europe that they’re now engaged. And everyone it’s thrilled but I’m a little bit concerned.  The things is that where I live, marrying that young is not common, but that is not my principal concern. What I’m worried about is that they’ve known eachother for just three months. Now, I personally thing that an engagement is something you have to think through and you have to know eachother really well. I think I might be the Asshole because I’m concerned more than happy for them, all my friends are congratulating them but I didn’t and I don’t know how to feel about this nor adress it, i feel it’s kinda lacking of common sense, but I really need advice because this couple is really draining me.  They have also talked about going to live together but just one of them has a job and it’s working in a fast food chain (not much income). I’ve talked with myself trying to understand if it’s me projecting fear of commitment to them but I realized it’s not as that wouldn’t be fair either. Also one of them (they24) has just got out of a 4 year toxic relationship and I feel this is too rushed. They’re also in a polyamorous relationship that they don’t know how to manage really well either. (All this things just for context).  I need help because I want to support them but I am really concerned for them. I have also tried talking to them but it’s no use. All this is lacking of common sense and I feel they need to take things so much slower. Any advice?	1642879177.0	sa9ues	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa9ues/wibta_if_i_dont_agree_with_my_friends_marriage/	WIBTA if I don’t agree with my friends’ marriage?
iwnffdaf	I(15) and my boyfriend at the time(14) went to homecoming as freshman. We got our pictures taken before the dance and my mom gave me money to get pictures at the dance as well. Fast forward about a month later, I lost feelings and broke up with him. When the pictures came in I took them and didn't give them to my mom. She asked me if they had came yet or if I had them and threw them away or burned them. I told her they haven't came yet and if they did I didn't want her to have them because I don't want them. She said that she still wants them but I personally don't feel comfortable with her having a picture of me and my ex boyfriend. She said if they don't come then she will call and complain about not getting pictures. I'm hoping she will forget but I don't know what to do.

iwuuv8f3	So my bf (20, male) and i (19, female) met almost 2 years ago and have been living together for a little over half a year. he wants to go back home (Sacramento, ca) to visit his best friend for his best friend’s bday (valentines day weekend). his best friend and him have known each other since kindergarten, so he calls him his “brother”. they are very very close, and before we were together, he’d spend the night ALL the time at his house. now that we’ve been living together for a while now i’m way too used to sleeping with him every night. so much to the point where the few times i HAVE slept without him, i have so much anxiety and can’t get any sleep. so then he’d come home after long arguments on the phone because i’d be freaking out.  so when my bf told me he’d be going up there to visit as well as spend the night, he assumed i would want to stay home so i’m a little more comfortable and not as anxious without him. the thing is, i DO want to go. i lived there with him and his family for about 3 months, so i’ve missed them and want to visit as well. but when i let him know i also wanted to go, he said no matter what that he would spend the night at his friends’.  the only thing i asked of him was to come home to sleep w me. i said he could literally spend all day at his friends and they could do whatever they wanted! he could even  have some spending money to have a good time. the only thing i said was to come home after, even if it was late.  no matter how many times i tried to tell him this, he said REGARDLESS he would be spending the night even if i get bad anxiety. he wouldn’t be coming home that night.  he said he feels like i’m being clingy and controlling because i won’t let him have his ONE night.

9vrjwd3u	This is a long one but I'll keep it as short as I can.  So 18 months ago my partner (Neil) moved in with friends (Frieda and Kyle).  First time I met them, the first thing Kyle said was something along the lines of "I like to get a rise out of people, don't tell me anything you're sensitive about, I will use it to tease you."  Time goes on and everything is okay for the most part. But more than once I called him on him making awful jokes and he's stormed off like "people cant take a joke".  Most notably, he made a r*pe joke knowing people in the room had SA trauma. Another time, I was pregnant and he made a point of saying he was going to pop balloons around me after I said I don't like the noise. (I have PTSD and anxiety) My partner got mad and told Kyle he would hit him if he did. Frieda got mad saying friends dont threaten each other  Sadly, I lost the baby. Nothing to do with his antics, it was just one of those things.  I was at their house while Neil was at work, we talk for a bit then he makes a miscarriage joke.  There was one time when I was at their house, there was back and forth between me and Kyle where I gave as good as I got and Frieda got upset (not at me, she complained to a mutual friend) saying she doesnt like the way i talk to Kyle. Whatever, i keep my distance.  Neil and Myself finally got our own place in September. We were having a party, but had to take Kyle aside and say they're invited but if he pulls his sh*t he's out, especially after having been openly transphobic not long before. They didn't come.  Everything came to a head just before Christmas. Frieda deleted both me and Neil off of social media. Telling our mutual friend that Neil is mean and I don't like her fiance. (I don't.) Her reasoning for Neil being mean is that he has a very dry/sarcastic sense of humour. Something happened where Frieda thought Neil was deliberately making fun of her online (he wasn't, and didn't even have a chance to apologise before she removed us).   Anyway, after about a week, Frieda messaged Neil saying she missed us. Went on about how we were all such great friends, and she missed having me around etc. Added him back on socials etc. But never messaged me or added me back. So i blocked her. She went from saying Neil was mean and made her anxious to suddenly interacting with every single thing he posted, and I was honestly fed up of seeing her face.  She asked Neil why i blocked her and he told her that. She said it was down to me to message her if I wanted to be her friend again.  I went to text her but she'd blocked my number  Here is where i may have been TA.  I unblocked her on Messenger and told her while I didn't originally have a problem with her, I did have a problem with her fiancé and the fact she sat back and said nothing while he visibly upset people. I said to her it's not my fault that he's so used to being the only as*hole in the room, and that he shouldn't give it out if he cant take it	1642880089.0	saa623	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saa623/aita_for_unblocking_someone_to_call_them_an_ah/	AITA for unblocking someone to call them an AH?
iwwnm9un	About a month ago my wife tells me that my son had been feeling depressed. This all came as a shock to me, but after some thinking, I have noticed several mood changes. For one, he's skipped meals numerous times, hasn't been talkative, etc. All the classic signs of depression. My wife wanted me to pay for therapy classes for my son. But, to be honest I didn't think he was depressed enough for therapy. And when I was raised, I was always taught that if you're depressed, you should work harder to feel less depressed. Plus, therapy is too expensive and kind of ruins my fiscal restraint. So, I tell all my wife this and she gets mad. Well, the next day, I told my son he should apply for a job at our local grocery store. He's old enough for it, and I think it would help him socialize more, work harder, and lower his depression. So, a few days later he gets the job. But, then my wife comes to me and tells me that him getting the job has made him more stressed out, and overall more depressed. I didn't buy it, because I didn't notice a difference in his behaviour. in fact, I thought he seemed better and on a full road to recovery. Yesterday, my wife was cleaning his room (while he was in school) and found a notebook under his bed. She picked it up and looked through it, thinking it was something he left behind for school. When she read it, she cried heavily because of the content of it. I don't want to delve on what it said, but it was full of stuff about his self-esteem and his self-confidience. It talked about his struggles with schools and socializing. And, how the job at a grocery store made him more "anxious." My wife tells me that all of this could've been avoided through therapy but I can't help but disagree. I think even with therapy, my money being lost, he still would've been the same.

fzzb54bt	My daughter J (25f) started dating her girlfriend H (23f) about 2 years ago. I’ve always been my daughter’s biggest supporter but I feel like this girl just isn’t right for her, and doesn’t fit into our family. Her older brother C (28m) agrees with me.   Her girlfriend is white, and I feel has a different lifestyle than us. She obviously doesn’t work out and eats unhealthily and it shows. When J’s grandmother passed away right before Christmas H left to spend it in another state with her family instead of going to the funeral with J, which I think was unforgivable. Our family is all about sticking together and she wasn’t here for J when she needed her.   About 6 months into their relationship, J seemed to completely change. She came out as “nonbinary” and insists on using different pronouns and then a few months later is trying to change her name.   She has since moved in with her girlfriend across town from us and I think is choosing her girlfriend over her family who has been supportive of her through her entire life. She is currently going through medical issues and we had a conversation where she said her girlfriend would go to her upcoming appointments with her if she “wasn’t too busy.”	1642880443.0	saaaq8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saaaq8/aita_for_refusing_to_have_a_relationship_with_my/	AITA for refusing to have a relationship with my daughter’s girlfriend?
a57icf12	I (21 f) have two roommates “nick” (m25) and “rachel” (21f). Since I moved into the house about a year and a half ago I have notice Nick drive home drunk or tipsy multiple times, often making jokes about how wasted he is when he comes in. I didn’t believe it was my place to say anything and the one time I said I thought it was irresponsible I was quickly brushed off and ignored.  Then on NYE, Nick comes home wasted and leaves our front door not just unlocked, but wide open. We do not live in a safe neighborhood and this left me and Rachel obviously distressed. I sent him a text saying it was unacceptable and he said he agreed. Less than a week later he left the door open all night, again. At this point me and Rachel decided to look for our own place and try to ignore Nick the best we can until we move out.  Well that didn’t work out. On Tuesday Nick texts us that he got a concussion at work and is in the hospital. He drives home on Thursday and is bumping into doorways, telling us he was in a coma, and that it was really serious. The next day, he posts a snapchat of him drinking at a bar. He proceeds to drive home after, telling me he was ignoring his doctor and making jokes about it.   At this point I lost it. I told him he is either lying about his concussion or he is homicidal. I told him it was disgusting that he drinks and drives and acts like it’s a joke when he could’ve killed somebody. That he already put me and my roommate in danger by leaving the door open all night. I told him we are not friends and asked him to leave me alone until I move out in a month.  He called me an asshole saying I don’t know how much he drinks or how far he has to drive. And while Rachel agrees with me she thinks I shouldn’t have said anything and just waited until we moved out.  I think I might be the asshole for causing tension. But drinking and driving is something I feel strongly about and it is directly affecting my safety.

2a6hh6ti	Back in June a friend of mine was getting divorced and needed a place to stay. I offered one of my guest rooms to her rent free so she could have time to get on her feet. The same week we found out that a mutual connection had fallen on hard times due to enexpected medical bills. He was being kicked out of his house because he couldn't pay rent. I didn't know him nearly as well as my other house guest, but I decided to offer him my other guest room as well. Neither of them were paying rent at first, which was fine, but I asked if they were staying past August to start paying $200/room. They said that was fine. My first house guest was amazing to live with. She was neat and tidy and is just an all around amazing person. I even said she could stay long term as I really enjoyed living with her. Second house guest was the complete opposite. First red flag was that he moved in with a ridiculous amount of stuff that he didn't warn me about. He left some of it in the front yard for weeks, which eventually I cleaned up. He then left the rest in an giant pile in the dining room. I asked him multiple times to either move it to the attic or garage. It took me 6-8 weeks of asking before he finally did. Second red flag was after 2 months of living with me, he never paid for the rent we agreed upon. He said he didn't have the money and wasn't planning to stay much longer, but every day he had DoorDash delivered to the house. Both house guests had been talking about moving out together. My first house guest started to pick up on the fact that he wasn't financially stable and wouldn't be a reliable roommate, so she moved out by herself at the end of August. Second house guest was pissed, which I get, but he has dragged his ass figuring out what to do. I repeatedly told him he could stay, but he has to pay rent. He always has an excuse for why he can't. It is now almost February and I can't get him out. He claims he is getting ready to move to his mom's house 1.5 hours away, but he won't move out until he finds a new job. He works retail, and given the current hiring situation, I would assume it wouldn't take so long to find a job. The last and final red flag is that he snuck his cat into the house and has been keeping it in his room for 3 weeks. He never asked if this was OK. I told him when he moved in that he needed to find a place to temporarily rehome his cat because of my dog. I love cats, but I honestly fear my dog will kill them. She has a high prey drive. I only found out because my friend saw the cat in the window and asked about it. When I confronted him about it, he told me all his other options fell through and had no choice. The problem is he hid it from me. My dog has started banging her head on his door because she knows the cat is there. I finally told him he has 30 days to move out because this situation is no longer working for me. I'm tired of being treated like I'm unreasonable for asking him to be responsible. So, AITA for kicking him out?	1642880874.0	saagad	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saagad/aita_for_evicting_my_roommate/	AITA for evicting my roommate?

8bekuc4u	My girlfriend works as a CNA. Recently, she was hired at a facility near us. She worked there two weeks before quitting. She can and has worked agency, where she can request shifts at various facilities around the metroplex. However, there is no guarantee that the shifts will be approved…also, there are no benefits through agency. The job she quit had benefits and hours were guaranteed. However, several times she was the only CNA scheduled for her respective shift…catering to approximately 57 patients in total. Although being the only CNA, there was an available RN to help her if she needed it, but she never asked. My girlfriend has some minor health issues she is going through, but working towards getting them resolved.  So, she is sore and exhausted after a shift. I’m upset because the same day I bought her color specific scrubs for the position is the same day she quit. I pointed out to her that just because she is back on the agency bandwagon doesn’t mean she won’t get scheduled for a shift in which she is the only CNA on the premises. I understand it’s hard on her physically…I do. Am I wrong to be upset? I told her I’d support her, but with agency work, there isn’t a guarantee of a forty hour work week. So, AITA for being upset?	1642881261.0	saal86	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saal86/aita_for_being_upset_my_girlfriend_quit_her_job/	AITA for being upset my girlfriend quit her job?
5c7mu3fu	  I (23F don’t cook for my boyfriend (24M) of almost 5 years regularly.   Backstory: I grew up with a very emotionally and physically absent mother. She would never cook for me and raised me with fast foods. So naturally I only know how to cook about five things or so. I learned alone and using YouTube/google and maybe some advice. However, I’m a full time student since 2016-present and very much mentally ill. So when I moved out to live on campus I would rarely cook for myself and my eating disorder. Having a mother with an ED who would literally have one meal a day and rely on coffee, so naturally, I developed one too and only have about two meals a day which are very spaced out throughout the day. When I met my current boyfriend which was in 2016 we never really cooked for each other and now that we live together I don’t cook consistently. My body hurts every day and so does my back, I study at campus and it’s a 30-40 minute drive and between driving and sitting at a chair all day my back kills me and mentally I’m exhausted by the end of the day. My boyfriend works a full time job, 9-6 and does not know how to cook. He probably only knows how to fry already seasoned things and rice maybe. However, I’m expected from him and his mother and father to cook for him because I spend most of the time of the day at home. I understand I could cook for him because he’s tired but so am I. I told him consistently while he lived with his father, who is a CHEF, to write recipes or learn how to cook from him, we only started living together a year ago and he never learned anything. I hope I’m not sounding like I’m giving excuses, all I want to know if I’m wrong here, if I should stop making excuses and cook for him. If it were for me I wouldn’t cook at all, I don’t eat. I’m not saying I don’t cook AT ALL, but I don’t consistently cook for him. I’ll make some meals sometimes but it’s not an everyday thing. We are both two adults and if we didn’t live together but he lived alive what would he do then? Please I need advice I don’t want this to be a burden in our relationship.	1642881225.0	saakr1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saakr1/aita_for_not_cooking_for_my_boyfriend_who_works/	AITA for not cooking for my boyfriend who works full time?

6wc4fnj9	I spent 4 hours cleaning the whole house, while my husband gamed from the time he woke up to lunch. When he finally came out of his gaming room he was really impressed with how fast I had clean the house. (I had let it go for a few weeks because I'm 7 months pregnant and I've been tired). When he asked if I needed help I told him it would be a really big help if he finished cleaning the kitchen, clean the stove, finish putting the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and wash the ones that didn't go in the dishwasher. Nothing else needed done! When I went to make dinner a few hours later I realized he didn't actually do anything other then move the dirty pots and pans to the oven, put the dirty bowls (that still had dried food on them) and cups in the dishwasher. That was it. That was all he did. I spent 4 hours cleaning the house and he spent 10 minutes moving things around. When I asked him what he did to help he said he put the dishes away and reloaded the dishwasher. And acted like he deserved the freaking world! He put dirty dishes away (because I had already started loading the dirty ones into into dishwasher) and moves some pots....I started yelling at that point because I asked him for help in one room! I never bitch about how much he games, I never bitch when he leaves his cloths all over the house. But I asked for help in one room and he half assed it! I told him he needs to either start helping with the upkeep of the house or he needs to hire someone to do it because once this baby gets here I'm not going to be able to take care of a grown man child, a new born and a house all on my own! That was when he told me I needed to calm down that he needed to unwind from a hard week at work. That he would get to finishing the kitchen tomorrow.

i4vuxr5a	My wife no longer sleeps in the same room as me because I snore. This has cause conflict but it's not the worst part. She will not allow me to sleep or nap at all even if she's fully awake and it's, say, a mid day nap. Am I the asshole for thinking I should be allowed to take a nap in the daytime while she's awake?	1642882601.0	sab2s0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab2s0/aita_for_snoring_in_the_daytime/	AITA for snoring in the daytime?
4w7suul5	Apologies for the long post.  I (35F) was near best friends with S (32F) for a solid 5 years. We confided in each other on the difficulties of marriage life among other things. (Nothing crazy- small things like- they leave clothes everywhere aside from the hamper- type of stuff). We used to work at the same company (in different departments) but close enough that I knew her teammates and boss and she knew mine. Ive since left thr company a few years ago but maintained my friendship with S.  Here is where things get sticky: I received a msg from my previous boss stating-  She is no longer at our previous company and is married to a former coworker of mine- M. She said, the reason why she's telling me is because S keeps contacting her husband- first inappropriately, and when the 2 asked her to stop, she kept trying to reach him through different channels of communication. She said, since she knew S and I were good friends, if I can work with S to stop her behaviour or else she has to speak to S's husband about it.  I was shocked- I called up S to ask whats happening.  She cried and told me everything- she was lonely in her marriage during a period when her husband and her worked opposite shifts and she used to work in the same department as M. She and M got really close and one thing led to another, they had sex. More than once. She said M wasnt married at the time. She admitted to contacting him a few times but not anymore and cried asking me to fix this somehow because her husband cant find out. It was so long ago and she now has 2 kids with her husband.  I told her to msg my boss and apologize for intruding in their lives and let them know she wont do it again.  She doesnt take my advice and instead chooses to CALL M AND AND TELL HIM HERSELF INSTEAD. Boss had M's phone and was pissed so she proceeds to call S's husband.   S's husband was livid and rightfully so. S calls me right away from her bathroom saying she told her spouse it wasnt sex (since she was afraid of him ending their marriage with 2 young kids) and that he was going to call me and ask if that were true. I was furious for a) being involved and b) being asked to lie to husband. I really liked him. and c) for her not telling the truth to him.  Her answer- Ill tell him the truth, just not right now.  Low and behold he calls me and asks if the adultry was true. With my heart in my throat I lied to him and said she didnt. He said he believes it because I told him.  I then msgd my friend and told her our friendship is over. Ive never lied before and she made me out to be a liar.  A part of me feels I have no right to destroy a marriage and be the one to say what happened.  The other part of me thinks I should have told him- he had the right to know.  TL;DR my friend cheated on her husband with a former coworker of mine. Coworkers spouse tells friends spouse who then asks me if she did cheat or not. I lied for her and say no she did not, but then promptly ended the friendship.	1642882577.0	sab2hk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab2hk/aita_for_lying_for_my_adultrous_friend/	AITA for lying for my adultrous friend?

ivmh4dau	I have this friend who is slightly autistic but is not diagnosed and he doesnt want to tbh. He didnt have a girlfriend he loved and connected with until 28. At the brink of her leaving him I told him to do Molly or Acid with her and he did. The molly didnt do anything but the Acid was great. He said he never felt this emotionally connected to a person and the had the best sex ever. they didnt even have to do it again with acid. is was a jump start that lasted years later. he became a much more sensitive person and way better to be around too. mentioning this to others usually gets this: you are not his friend. no friend gives advise like this, and in that category. but i read up on it beforehand and have a education in that area. for me it was a calculated risk because i knew the person and that he was very grounded and wouldnt have any illusions that he wouldnt know where illusions. he knew perfectly well during his trip what was real.	1642882998.0	sab7mr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab7mr/aita_for_advising_to_self_administer_an_illegal/	AITA for advising to self administer an illegal drug to a person and it helped?
eaghm9kq	Posted a question in another reddit subject about something pretty unrelated but somehow got into an argument with someone in the comments and then through chat haha. My boyfriend has a 1 year old daughter with his ex. He left his ex because she had sex with another man during the pregnancy, but he stayed because of the baby. He left when he got sent sexts his ex sent to another guy after the baby was born. She was emotionally abusive throughout the entire relationship even before she was pregnant. Ive seen proof before everyone tells me i only got his side. He let her keep the house and all the possessions and he came home with nothing. He was single for 6 months and then met me and we have been together for 5.   The argument started becauae this reddit mother told me we are disgusting people for being together and leaving his ex on her own. I explained continuously that his ex has a lot of help and support, my bf made sure of it for his daughters sake, and he shouldnt have to stick around in a toxic relationship even if she got pregnant (which he is pretty sure she stopped taking birth control to force but has no proof so thats just a side note). Im not involved with any of that side of his life, its not my business. All i wanted to do was reassure him that he wont lose access to his child just because his ex gets offended he moved on and decides she doesnt want him to (she has threatened to stop him having access just because he didnt want to buy her a new curtain set. And many more times).  The argument basically went round in circles with many points but the main points are i think he should be able to leave his ex if she is toxic and should be allowed to move on with someone else, he shouldnt have to be single forever just to keep his ex happy. I think if his ex left him because he was the toxic one she would be called a strong independent woman etc. Whereas he js branded as a shitty person because he left a new mother. I also said its a lot worse for a child to be raised in a household where parents hate each other than a split one.   Whereas this reddit mother thinks he should have "waded the storm" (her words) and stayed with her. Basically let her get away with anything she wants because pregnancy js hard. She thinks he should definitely not get into any new relationship because jt will be damaging for the child. But its ok that his ex has had loads of random guys over because shes the one who went through the pregnancy for 9 months and gave birth. That he owes her the new curtain sets etc because shes the mother and it doesnt matter if she is draining all his money because hes terrified of what shell do if he doesnt, he should be able to manage because hes the one who got her into that situation.   To me it sounds insane but is that how people actually feel??

iw1lh8fw	okay, I know the title sounds really bad but please listen to me. my (15 years) mother (49 years) and I have had some ups and downs when it comes to our relationship. I'm pretty sure that most of it was due to the toxic exposure I had growing up living on and off with my other family (they were physically and emotionally awful to my mom and i). all of their arguments, along with the toxicity from my mom and problems at school, it lodged me into a dark place and it caused me to have low self esteem. my mom and i moved out and we currently have a place of our own, however all of the problems haven't subsided. my mom heavily criticizes me over various things, and that's a huge reason that i don't open up to her, however shes always trying to use me as her outlet and it's unfair that I, a teenager, have never had any form of emotional support from my family my whole life. as usual, she was going on a rant about how bad her job is. don't get me wrong, I'm always willing to listen and i told her to tell me about her day. she was telling me about everything. due to the exhaustion working, school, and the fact that i hadnt taken my supplements to help with my deficiency, i was doing my best to stay awake but accidentally fell asleep. i woke up less than a minute later and my mom was leaving my room. i hadn't realized that i had totally collapsed and i went back to her room to apologize, give her a hug and find those supplements. she bursts into tears and tells me to leave her alone and that she didn't wanna talk about it anymore. i feel like the biggest asshole but I'll let you guys judge.

2vekrmcv	Me in the past (10) was put into a highly competitive boarding school. The only contact I had with my family or the outside world was monitored and lasted for 7 minutes weekly. Letters were only sent out after being approved by the dorm mistress. I tried leaving but was obviously shut down and physically restrained by the staff and made to watch my mother leave the building while my peers watched me bawl. I even had my only photograph of my family taken from me and torn since I broke a petty rule accidently. I was able to convince my mom to let me come home eventually but during this period she truly despised me so to I found myself itching for her warmth yet again. I eventually caved and told her I'd go back to make her happy which did bring her joy and did seem to mend our relationship or so it seemed. I went back but this time I grew sick and the school had us doing early morning practice, after school classes, all of which took place coincidentally during exam season. It got to a point where I would crap my pants during morning practice and not have enough time between that and my exams to clean up properly. I tried visiting the school clinic on multiple occasions but was only provided with some glucose each time. Luckily enough autumn break had almost started so I got to go home and my mom was unable to ship me off due to my temperamental health. We spent loads on tests but to no avail till finally we visited a psychiatrist who told my mother to get me out of that place. All of my symptoms and fever vanished the next day after hearing that news. It's been years since then and I've shared my side of the story with my mom. She still stands by her decision and thinks its immature and petty of me to hold onto this grudge. I make it a point to not bring it up in arguments but I still let her know i haven't forgiven her since she never apologized.

6wljesgc	I often have to deal with my brother's outbursts - most of them are angry where he will scream and storm around, but tonight, he just began to cry when we were all having dinner. I got up and left because I was very uncomfortable. I was then called back down so I came back down. In the adjacent room, he entered and began to freak out and cry again. Then my mother suggested he punch his punching bag. He went back outside and began to attack it and scream. I felt very nervous and almost claustrophobic because of it. After about the second angry scream, I bolted away. My mother said I was not supportive and was being incredibly selfish.  For a bit of history, my brother has outbursts like this maybe once to twice a month, and I really don't like to get involved. I often feel that his behavior goes unpunished which leads to an unhealthy spiral of it going worse, and I try to talk to my parents about it but they say he needs help. Yet no therapist or anything like that to help him get through his emotions healthy has been set up in any capacity (btw, I have not asked for a therapist).  I really want to help him but I also am afraid of confrontation and feel the current way we are dealing with this is bad. I, as a person, do not like to seek confrontation in familiar matters because I often am too scared of the repercussions. Is my lack of support for him and inaction selfish and obnoxious?  BTW - my brother is relatively young (11) so it's hard to diagnose anything, and maybe it's too young to judge, but he has always had anger issues and issues with containing emotions.	1642883933.0	sabjof	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sabjof/aita_for_not_wanting_to_deal_with_my_brothers/	AITA for not wanting to deal with my brother's frequent outbursts?

iwyk2g4s	This kid and I are in high school and in the same grade level. My brother is a year older and goes to the same school. Ever since he's been coming to school he's been walking around flexing his muscles in the middle of class like he is some kind of stud. He does it in class, he does it in gym class and he does it in the locker room. And people are constantly laughing at him telling him that he has no muscles. According to the bmi scale he's 5'5 and weighs 270lbs. I'd like to also add that he sucks his stomach in to make himself look more fit than he actually is.  Yesterday at gym class he took his shirt off in the locker room to go change and everyone including my brother started laughing at him. My brother tells him  Brother: You need to lose weight bro  Kid: Why? Are you just jealous of my physique?  Brother: Jealous of what? You don't have a physique!  Me: He's right, you need to stop living in denial and lose weight.  Kid: Why should I? I'm not as fat as other people!  Brother: You're still fat dumbass!  Me: Nobody's jealous of you man  Kid: I ain't fat like you dipshit!  Brother: I'm fat? You're so fat you can barely fit into your pants. So get your fatass on a treadmill and lose some weight your fat tub of lard ass! I feel sorry for your parents! Where do you work out? Burger King?(laughing)  Kid: Fuck you!  Brother: Fuck you too you fatass! You're gonna die of a heart attack before you have any children!  The kid then snapped and yelled so loudly that the gym teacher heard it and yelled at everyone in the locker room. I told my brother to calm down because he was really mad at this kid. Luckily the gym teacher deescalted the situation but then shortly after that the kid started crying.  I wasn't trying to hurt the kid's feelings I was just trying to get him to wake up. I don't think I said anything that bad to him I just told him to stop living in denial.

280gtigt	Hi! First time posting, wanted some advice!  Me (f31) and my husband (m32) work full time jobs. We live 20 mins away from his parents, and almost 5 hours away from mine. My parents and I visit over weekends every few months, and over the summer months we try to spend a full week together as a family (with my brother and SIL) on vacation. Obviously we see his parents more frequently, having regular dinners together etc.  Due to covid, my family haven't had the annual trip for the last 2 years, however this year we've been discussing spending a week away in June in the country, rather than abroad. My husband isn't big on family gatherings (even with his own) as he and his family can be quite full on. My family isn't as confrontational as his, and I think somehow this makes him feel awkward that we all genuinely get along. But, it is what it is, I'm used to it.  As always, I extended the invitation of this years trip to him. He acknowledged with a sideways glance, said "no I don't want to take time off in the week to do that", and then said that I need to make sure to keep 15+ days annual leave to go on trips with him.   I'm used to him not joining in on our trips, so that didn't make me mad, his attitude and what he said after did. I have a good job and work hard (got a promotion a few months back, yay!) and look forward to having a whole week off with family every year, and he knows how much I miss them.   I was hurt for a few reasons -  1. He could have responded to the invitation in a more graceful way, rather than act like I invited him to shovel shit (probably my bad for wishful thinking he'd say yes). 2. For him trying dictate how much time of my annual leave should be saved for our trips, and I can do whatever I want with what's left over. (I'd understand if my family trip was longer, but 5 days annual leave is nothing) 3. He also said "but you spent Christmas break with them, you saw them for a decent amount of time then"  For reference, we always take a week trip just the two of us, and a few long weekend breaks too, which I always arrange. All this is included in my "plan" for annual leave this year, and the trip with my family isn't replacing any of our plans. It just seemed as soon as I told him my family trip plans he decided to get sassy.  Another point, he runs his own business, he doesnt have a set number of days off work like I do, he can be more flexible with his time off.  Trivial, I know, but thank you for listening!

iwxk5kt5	I F33, have been married to my husband M31 for soon a year. I'm not going to sugarcoat anything and I know the title makes me sound like a giant asshole but please hear me out, ever since me and my husband got married things changed. We were married for 6 weeks before the verbal abuse began, small comments like telling me how fat I am which (i'm in recovery for an eating disorder) really hurt me. And the only person I felt like I could turn to was my BIL. He actually treats me like a person, and I love him more than anything but I'm aware it's too late to go back now that I'm married to his brother so I tried to do small stuff to get my husband to abuse me more. I would do anything to get on his nerves, from forgetting to pack his lunch in the morning for work to making some slight remarks about his mood in the staircase and that's when he put his hands on me for the first time and pushed me down the staircase. Fortunately, the edge of the table near our front door caught me but I broke a rib and that's when I realized he wasn't divorcing me anytime soon. So, I slept with his BIL. I don't regret it and I say it so openly because I'm not about to sugarcoat the truth, I hate my husband. But I'm unable to divorce him because he is the bread winner and he owns the house we live in. I can not imagine a life without him, I want to love him but I can't. But yet I can never bring myself to leave, he found out about me and my BIL's affair 3 months into it. We weren't really that discreet about it, we casually flirted with each other at my dad's birthday party with all of our family members there because he just has an outgoing flirty personality and from what I've heard he is single. So, my husband confronted me about it while we were having dinner. I denied everything but he knows and he wants a divorce. Everyone knows. I'm ashamed and embarrassed. I deserve to be reprimanded but not as much as everyones blaming me, my brother in law has no interest in dating me and I have 3 weeks to leave. So, I just wanna know. AITA?

iwyswr3p	Okay hear me out. I F(22) have been dating my boyfriend (24) since about 2 months and we've had our issues but for the most part it's been good. So he has a pretty ... how do i put it? f-ck boyish past and he wanted to keep it all a secret from me but due to him lying to me on certain occasions ( lied to my face when I asked him about his ex) i went through his phone when he was asleep and found out about it. He was dating 3 girls at once at one point and i also found a lot of chats that were disrespectful. But get this, some were about me and i didn't even know the guy very well when he had those conversations about me.  Now he's been swearing up and down that he is a changed person now but i'm very skeptical about it and I also feel terribly guilty about going through his phone. I feel like he got with me just to get into my pants and will be continuing with his ways once we're done. I voiced this to him and he had nothing to say other than that he's genuinely changed and I need to give him a chance and "stop overthinking". His opinion is that i should let bygones be bygones and focus on the relationship at hand but I find that hard to do because I have been in a really bad, abusive 4 year long relationship before.

iids9b31	Okay hear me out there’s a lot to unpack here and I’ll try sum it up the best I can!  So I 24F and my boyfriend 24M decided to move in together July 2020, before moving in we had the agreement that first of all he’d be paying rent and all bills until I moved into a better job which shouldn’t take long, and then I would take over the little bills, he would always pay rent as he earns about 4X as much as me a month, but I did invest £3000 of my savings into getting us pretty much all our furniture and other essentials. He only paid both bills for one month before I got into a better job and then I took on all utilities straight away so council tax, water, gas, electric, insurance. I also do all household chores, bar I ask him to wash up the pots, so I cook, clean, do clothes washing, put it away, food shop etc.  He’s a contracter, won’t say trade, by the way, so his big earning jobs are for 6-9 months a year then he does steady work over winter to tick over and have some rest. You’d think he’d have lots of savings, nope he’s blew most of his money this year on a hobby, but that’s not my fault he hasn’t budgeted ready for winter.  So fast forward to now roughly 7 months down the line, he’s now wanting to go 50/50 on everything, which will leave me with very little until I again find a job utilising my masters by rona has made that difficult but I’m trying my best and pick up as much as I can at my current job. He’s also wanting to move house and demanding I pay half of that and don’t forget sharing the costs of another vehicle, which is a lot of hits to my slow increasing savings. One of the problems is how he speaks to me about, he speaks to me like shit, putting me down for not having a job in the industry I’ve studied for yet, when he knows I’m trying my best to find something. But then he’s also saying, when he’s back in big work, anything I need he’ll pay for, stuff for my hobby, clothes activities, instead of saying we’ll stick to how it is now so I have a bit of money to do it myself, it just feels controlling. Especially since countless times recently he’s held it against me and brought it up in an argument whenever he’s paid for something recently, even though I also pay for meals out etc too.  Alongside these issues obviously being treated as I currently am, doesn’t exactly put you in the ‘mood’ so our seggs life is none existent cos I’m just not interested, he brings this up and makes digs often also. I feel like I have a roommate not a boyfriend, he never gets me flowers, brings me my favourite snacks home or treats me without bringing it back up two weeks later to use against me.

iwz3hc2h	My wife, while pregnant, was murdered.  Only one of her babies survived.  He’s disabled because of the attraction of his mother.   He tries to be strong and an independent little man, and it's hard for him to keep up with kids his age. He tries to act tough, but he isn't.   For all of the preschool, I have homeschooled him and made sure he’s safe.  My son now wants to enter public school with kids, but I’m very hesitant about the idea of it.   He thinks I’m a mean dad by just protecting him, and he calls me a clown.	1642885001.0	sabx3z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sabx3z/aita_for_being_overprotective_of_my_son/	AITA for being overprotective of my son?
drf272ip	tw: // sex work  synopsis: // "jenna" has been fucking a dude for a year & everytime they do, he breaks her off. "jenna" likes this arrangement of having sex with him for money. "lena" thinks being paid for sex is bad. "lena" says she could never accept money after having sex. "lena" doesn't understand that paying for dinner in hopes of getting some cewchie is STILL paying for sex. only difference is the restaurant got paid to serve you and you didnt get shit but a wet ass and a dry purse.  hi im veronica and this was my response:  " not trying to be malicious but my grandma used to say dont leave with a wet ass and a dry purse. how do you feel about being fucked 10 different ways till sunday and then leaving with nothing? especially if the sex was bad... i would feel like damn that fucking sucked & i have nothing to show for it except cum dripping down my leg. "  now, im genuinely sorry if i overstepped, because i truly didnt mean to come off as a cunt. i just know alot of women share this train of thought. whether it be because morally theyre against it or they just think they're better than women who want to be compensated for that gawk gawk 3000. nevertheless i always wondered why are you bitches being so foolish? like cmon get paid lil mama, get paid! sooo AITA?	1642885124.0	sabyt9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sabyt9/aita_wet_bum_dry_purse_i_think_youre_a_fool/	AITA wet bum, dry purse. i think you're a fool.
i3jqa08x	I got my husband some really nice slippers for his birthday last year because his feet always get cold inside. He'll wear them out to the store, outside to do some yardwork, etc sometimes and I told him may times that it would be better if he just kept them for inside shoes so they would stay nice, and he could wear any of his other 15 pairs of other shoes outside to do the other things. He always brushed this off and said that he could just throw them in the wash, which I feel like isn't the point but whatever. A couple weeks ago we got a new car (that is technically mine, though I consider it to be ours) that he bought. One of the huge selling points was the huge trunk space for cargo, and since buying it he has refused to let me/us put anything "dirty" in the trunk because he wants it to stay nice.   Today he power-washed our entire driveway and patio in the slippers I gave him, and they're completely ruined. Mud inside and out, absolutely disgusting. When he came inside for lunch, I threw them away. He threw a fit when he realized and went out to the trash to get them. Did I mess up? I'll admit that I was super mad, given that his blatant disrespect for my wishes was met with an expectation that I'll respect his regarding the car (which btw is literally meant to haul things, vs slippers which are not designed for yardwork). I get that if I gave him the slippers, they're his to use as he wants. But then isn't the car the same for me? Am I inventing this hypocrisy? Please let me know if I'm the a-hole here.	1642885750.0	sac7f4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sac7f4/aita_for_throwing_out_my_husbands_slippers/	AITA for throwing out my husband's slippers?

We had a very active holiday season and hosted some family the week prior, then traveled to see more family before our friends came to visit. We did not have any time to just be alone and we had to go back to work the following week. Our friends asked if they could stay one more night and I politely told them NO after discussing it with my partner (who is always very supportive).

It would be one thing if he were playing such a character as a part of some educational piece / PSA about these types of behaviors and all the participants were aware of it, but this clip is certainly not that.

e9ld2qtn	There is a lot of information so I will omit some of it for length and clarity. For background, my dad (48M) and I (19F) never got along. We used to be close when I was younger but as I grew up, he disappeared for long stretches at a time. As many kids do, I googled my dad's name. I found his mugshot and he was arrested and charged with assault on a female, misdemeanor child abuse, communicating threats, and misdemeanor assault with a deadly weapon (which could explain why he was gone for some time during my childhood). I wish I could say I was surprised when I saw this, but my dad is not a very good person.  For starters, I am all too familiar with his behavior. He was physically abusive towards my mom. He introduced me to his girlfriend in middle school (I later found out he was abusive towards her and she filed a restraining order). My parents divorced when I was 10. I am the only child of my mom and dad, but my dad has other children.   However, my mom let my dad live with us when I was in middle school. They do not get along at all. I did not know why my mom not only let him live with us (without paying rent, utilities, groceries, etc.), but she also paid his car and motorcycle bills. She also paid his bail for him to get out of prison. Despite my mom's generosity, my dad was continually abusive and he would always complain when she asked him to cut the grass, wash her car, wash the dishes, etc. (Note: my mom and I have moved out from my dad and we are safe).  My mom and dad fought often. I felt obligated to listen to their fights to make sure he didn't hurt her. He would sometimes slap her, threaten her, would throw things at her. When he gets mad, he is uncontrollably violent and I would always worry for my mom's safety. Some examples are as follows: 1) threw a hot pizza in the oven at my mom and she severely burned her arm (she still has a scar), 2) threatened to burn my mom's car and phone after she washed the sheets after he had already done it (she is very particular about washing laundry), 3) threatening to kill our pet chickens when they were in a fight. The list goes on.  For the past few years, my dad has been listening to hardcore conservative podcasts and it seems these have made him even angrier (I only say this not to make this a political debate but just to show why the following fight had occurred). While my mom and I do not agree with his views at all, he has continually tried to push his beliefs on the both of us and lashes out when we refuse to. He uses every opportunity to try to sell his beliefs to me, but I have told him that I disagree with him but he just tries to have a conversation with me about it and I just feel really uncomfortable about it.  When I was 18 years old, he and my mom had been fighting everyday for the past week (about the previous paragraph). My dad was very angry/violent and would always instigate these fights. He woke up everyday of the week, go downstairs, and start yelling at my mom. One morning's fight was particularly nasty. I was fast asleep in the morning, and I heard my mom screaming downstairs. My heart was beating and I rushed to listen. My mom continued screaming and I couldn't take it anymore so I called 911. I told the dispatcher that my dad was abusive and he always hit my mom. The cops came and questioned us, but they said since I wasn't a minor then it wasn't technically illegal. My mom chose not to press charges. My dad was still mad when he was questioned by police, and he asked me why I wouldn't defend him. I was so scared of him and wouldn't look him in the eye. When the cops left, he told me that he would be disowning me and I should change my last name. When my dad and I were alone, he called his "friend" on the phone and told him what he'd done. He was laughing as he said "I almost killed that b\*tch" and that I had called the cops.  It's been a year and a half since the incident and I have had to maintain contact with my dad. I am cordial because I have to be, but I have continually told my mom I do not want him in my life anymore. She tells me I have to talk to him as he is still my dad and it makes him happy to hear from me. My dad makes me sick and the fact that he has abused not only my mom, but other women disgusts me. When he found out that I knew he abuses my mom, he told me that I should just tell him to stop and he will honor it. In my opinion, he is a full grown adult and should already have the common sense to not lay his hands on another person. My mom is my best friend and the fact that he did this to her for years really angers me. I keep in contact with him because my mom asked me to and I do not want to make my dad angry, but I just cannot talk to him anymore. I absolutely hate my dad and I never want to talk to him again.   The only dilemma I have is that while my dad has been abusive to my mom, he has never laid a finger on me. I love my mom and I will do anything for her, but I feel like she knows the extent of my dad's rage and shouldn't pressure me into something I don't want to do. I either ignore my dad's texts/calls or just give dry answers, but when I don't talk to him for a while (which can go from weeks to months at a time), then he gets mad at me. When this happens, he either goes on a rant about why my mom and I don't care about him, refuses to talk to me, threatens to not talk to me forever, or threatens to not be there for my future wedding/children (he even told me once that I should never marry a man like him). In the times I wouldn't give him attention when I was younger, he used to do things like call up his other children/grandchildren on the phone and tell them he loves them. I used to cry when he said these things to me when I was younger, but I don't give him the satisfaction of feeling like he has all the power. To be honest, I don't even feel like crying when he says things anymore because I don't care about him.  I feel bad for being distant towards me dad because he has always told me he loves me and is proud of me, but I just cannot keep tolerating his behavior.

66tb6cy6	 To start off I'll admit I've never done something so impulsive and even recalling events now I feel like a huge dickhead because of my actions.   I 22F made out with one of my sisters friends 19M after I got drunk and he came onto me. A few hours prior I had made plans to go out and celebrate with some friends from work. All was going well but I quickly realised I overdid it with beer and shots which my friends we're generously supplying me. We left the bar late and I ran into a group I usually hang out with but I would consider more my sisters(18F) friends. Reddit I wish I could tell you play by play what happened but everything is either a blur or I can't remember...   Me and my sisters friend talked, he started flirting and putting his arm around my waist. I drunkenly remember saying that we really shouldn't be doing this and that I don't want to cross a line by doing something with a sisters friend. He kissed me and I kissed back. A comment was made about how we're both consenting adults and I think I agreeded to it before we started fooling around. We made out for a bit then he walked me home. We both agreeded to take that sceret to our graves since I was very drunk and he was sober ( Or so he said ). It was a bad judgement on my part and I'm not sure how he properly feels about the whole situation.   After sleeping off my massive hangover I wake up to my sister tearing into her partner (19M) about how she knew what happened and how it was not ok because it was her best friend. I agree, I feel like shit and apologised. I told her I would like to talk but I need to process what happened and calm my panicked mind down. My older sister knows everything and my mother knows the just of it. Both agree it was a drunk mistake and I shouldn't feel bad about it because it was just a kiss and since we're both adults it's fine. I've overheard my younger sister berating me and ultimately I believe she's putting all the blame on me which I've accepted. We've yet to talk while I write this but I'm not doing so good right now and really need to feguire this out...  So reddit am I the asshole?

eslc5li8	i’m a first year student in college and i have a randomly assigned roommate. anyone who knows us could tell you that we are extremely opposite people. he’s loud, extroverted, surface level and very happy. i’m more introverted, not really quiet but definitely not loud, and diagnosed depressed and a few other things. i don’t mind being around people, but i also value my alone time a lot, as well as having a space i can call my own. i like to keep my room neat, where i can have quiet time to myself to read or game. he has made this very hard for me. he’s super messy, never picks up his stuff. (for example most days i wake up with his shoes at the foot of my bed or his jeans in the middle of the floor. makes me twitch.) he’s always trying to talk to me, especially when he comes home late drunk or high. i myself also drink and smoke but i never burden other people with it, so when i’m clearly doing something like reading, watching a video, or trying to sleep, and he won’t stop talking to me no matter how many hints i give, it’s infuriating. he chews with his mouth open, doesn’t smell exactly the best, and just gets on my nerves. sometimes he’ll ask me how he can be a better roommate. i’ve told him how most of these things bug me, and he apologized but did nothing to fix it. we’ve had the talk about 3 times and nothing new happened. i’ve given up on telling him that, and now i am just annoyed by everything he does. i truly despise him and how inconsiderate he is, and i find myself fuming at him daily about little things, like when he listens to tik toks with no headphones while i’m in an online class. i judge him so harshly on everything and usually try to avoid talking to him because it always is unpleasant for me.

ix1xp5l4	My fiancé had a short term relationship 3 years ago with a woman and it lasted for 3 months. We got together 2 months after his break up with her. The first month of us dating the girl informed my fiancé that she's 2 months pregnant . He told her he didn't want the baby and that if she wanted an abortion he could help her out with the cost but she insisted she didn't want an abortion and wanted to keep the child. My fiancé told her that he doesn't want to be involved. Throughout her pregnancy she kept texting and calling my fiancé trying to guilt him into being a part of the baby's life and how he's gonna be known as a deadbeat otherwise.  My fiancé ended up deciding to be part of the baby's life and was willing to find ways to healthily Co parent.  Once the baby was born my fiancé adored her since the very first minute. He wanted to have shared custody but his baby mama insisted she'll only accept shared custody as long as I am never around the baby. Since we hadn't even been together for a year and our relationship was still fresh and not as serious he accepted. But throughout this time our relationship got more serious and he proposed and we are now planning our wedding. Since I'm also a big part of his life he wanted me to meet his daughter finally. For that to happen he had to discuss the contract with the lawyer to change the rules. He was able to do so but his baby mama wouldn't sign. She kept going off at him making crazy demands about how he should spend every single holiday with her and the kid instead of me and how he's being a terrible father if he does otherwise.  My fiancé still tries to meet the kid as much as possible, he takes her on walks and spends as much time with her as possible but he's not allowed to bring her over to sleep at his house because it's also my house and I live in there too and his baby mama doesn't agree with that.  His baby mama started blaming me after the Xmas holidays about how my fiancé didn't spend every single holiday with his kid because of me and how I'm in the way of him bonding with the kid. I honestly never stopped him. I always encourage him to see the kid as often as possible but his baby mama makes all these rules about excluding me from everything and forces my fiancé to choose every single time.

dtre4n04	I (29F) am dating a great guy (33M). He has 2 kids from a previous relationship. While I’m sure the kids are great, I am not interested in being a “bonus mom”. His children’s mother is alive and well. They primarily live with her so they are not in need of a maternal figure. I do not have nor do I want any children of my own so I do not care to develop a relationship with his. I do not discourage him spending time with his children, I do not complain over him having to cancel plans to be there for his children and I have no issues at all with his relationship with his children because I know children are a huge commitment. That’s a big part of why I do not want them  In the year that we have been seeing each other, I have always required that his time with his children and his time with me be separate. Again, I do not want children so I have no desire to see him as a father. I only want to experience him as a romantic partner. Now that we are exclusive, he is expecting me to meet and have a relationship with his children. I refused, stating that I do not wish to be a part of their lives. He is very upset even though I have always been clear about being “invisible” to his children.

hx62ts6r	My wife (26f) and I (28m) got married last year in the midst of Covid and didn't have a wedding. Her family lives about 18hours away by car, and a flight costs about $450 round trip per person if you plan it right. Two months after the wedding, we found out we were expecting!  Flash forward to now. Our beautiful daughter was born right after Christmas, and we're happier than we ever thought we could be.  In-laws decide to come down and stay a few weeks to help us out while we transition into going back to work and find a babysitter as well. I'd never met them before this because of the distance and then the pandemic. We were both so excited to see them! Until they were finally here. From day 1, we've had problems with them. (mom, dad, two sisters)  Things that have happened since they got here 6 days ago:  -MIL threw out half of baby's brand new clothes because they "weren't her style"  -FIL dug a hole in our garden and took a shit because the bathrooms were occupied. Twice.  -Sister 1 ruined my wife's Christmas gift (I got her 6 liquid lipsticks she's been wanting for a while) by breaking all of the wand applicators and then trying to put the makeup on the baby.  -Sister 2 ran away from our house 2 days in and we couldn't find her for almost 48 hours. Turns out she met someone online before coming and was staying at his house. (She's 19) there was a whole police investigation and everything.  -MIL took $150 out of my wallet yesterday to "buy groceries" then left for 3 hours and came back with no groceries but her nails & hair are done  -my wife found some dirty roaches in the bag of Sister 1 while doing laundry this morning.  I've talked to the family after each incident and they laugh and blow it off as if it's something normal or to be expected.  I mean no disrespect to anyone out there who lives in trailers. But this family is straight up trailer trash.  I had the last straw when we found the dirty roaches because I cannot and will not have those in my house. So I asked them to find a cheap motel to stay in. Even offered to help pay for half of it.   Now my wife is mad because I hurt their feelings and thinks I should give them another chance. I've given them multiple. She even told me that they weren't helping with the baby at all.

5sfkny72	I want to start by saying that this post not about something I did, but something I wanted to do, and I'm not sure if this is something I can do on this sub...  10 month ago I (17m) come out to my incredibly non confrontational religious grandparents. They never said anything bad about it, but I can tell that they don't really like it.   About 2 months ago they hosted a dinner at their house. My great aunt (grandma's brother's wife) was staying there for a few days. I've only met her once before and nobody told her that I'm trans.  When I realized I was gonna have to come out to her, I told my grandfather I want to wear a kippah/yarmulke (a head covering for boys). I was thinking about it for a while and I also realized that if I come out to her and then she sees that I'm the only guy not wearing one it might send the wrong message. He told me he wants me to wait till next week with it because he doesn't want to upset her. I said that I was planning on coming out to her next time she misgendered me anyway because I felt very uncomfortable with the entire situation. He tried to convince me not to and even said "you know that the whole world doesn't revolve around you right"? Which is the most confrontational thing I've ever heard him say.  I should probably note that ever since the first time I came out, I came out to every person I know the next time I saw them, so not correcting someone who thinks I'm a girl is something I haven't done in months, and don't plan on ever doing again.  I've talked with my grandma about it and she said that my great aunt was preaching to them about religion the entire time she stayed there, and they even had to drive to get her food because they didn't have anything that was kosher enough for her standards.   Eventually after hearing her misgender me a few more times I ended up just going home in the middle of dinner because I didn't want to cause any drama.  I've been thinking about what I should have done since, and I think that if I had to do it again I would have came out to her, but there is a chance that she wouldn't have taken it well and then my grandparents would have had to deal with the backlash,  So reddit, would that have made me the asshole?	1642890860.0	sae1oa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sae1oa/wibta_if_i_came_out_to_my_aunt/	WIBTA if I came out to my aunt?
38dfp0v1	My grandparents had an ugly divorce before I was born. My grandmother never had a regular job, loved gambling and drinking, and cheated on my grandfather regularly while he was working. It was confirmed that she brought home STDs, had sex with multiple FBI agents (crazy story), and took several priceless family heirlooms to sell after their divorce. He regretted ever meeting her, but they both eventually remarried and lived separate lives.   As long as I can remember, my mother has refused to keep a full time job to support herself, my brother, and me. My father supported the family, and when she left him to marry his best friend, my new step dad supported us. He worked long days but still made us dinner every night because she rarely contributed to making dinner. There was a 5-year period where she kept a job as a delivery driver. My step dad had to constantly encourage her to not quit when things would not go her way. That was the longest continual period of time in her *entire life* that she has been employed.  After a decade, they divorced in 2004 and she was also laid off. Since then, she has only had odd jobs–nothing lasting more than a few months. She was very secretive about where her money was coming from when anybody would ask. The only goal she ever mentioned was to get a Jeep and live on the Oregon coast.   At one point, she also moved in with my brother. She began asking for money in addition to free rent so he cut her off and asked her to leave. That relationship has been rocky ever since.   Her main source of income must be my enabler grandmother. I hear stories about how they often drink at local casinos before stumbling back to the car to drive home. They have a very unusual mother/daughter relationship and have even allegedly gone to bars to pick up men together.  Whenever my mother needed additional money, she would call to ask my grandfather to write her a check. She would constantly make up stories about how her Jeep needed new tires and asked my grandpa for up to thousands of dollars at a time. It became clear to everyone that she was making up stories about what she needed just to get money. This happened for 14 years until one day when she called him to ask for money but he stopped her to say how ashamed he was. He told her to not contact him again until she could demonstrate that she was financially supporting herself. She never called him again.  Before his death two years ago, my grandpa’s last wish was that we not tell his daughter that he had passed. He feared that she would contest his will and fight for “what she was owed,” a very likely outcome. He signed a document expressing his final wishes, and we have respected those wishes.  My question is: AITA for not telling my mother that her father died nearly two years ago? Is it a fundamental right to know that your father has died?	1642890532.0	sadxco	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sadxco/aita_for_not_telling_my_mother_that_her_father/	AITA for not telling my mother that her father died?
7nhrqsqr	Long story short this woman and my husband had previous sexual relations and we all tried being friends but she tried to start drama so we ended up cutting her off.   We had a lot in common so I really wanted to try to be friends again so I let her back into our life on the terms that she not try to private message him.   Well, of course she did, then I called her out for it online  because she posted a pointed and vague post I assumed was about me, and in order to defend herself she said “Facts, we were friends before they met so there’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to remain friends”.  And someone came to her comment and defended her and I replied that they weren’t friends that they were *Passionate Hugging* Buddies and that her husband chose my husband for her to swing with.  This was on TikTok so I didn’t know that second commenter was her 15 year old daughter.   Well now her, her husband, and a mutual friend are all mad at me for exposing that to the daughter.   I immediately took the post down when I was told that was her daughter.  I could care less that the woman and her husband are mad but I’m really broken up about losing the mutual friend.	1642891266.0	sae761	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sae761/aita_for_disclosing_someones_private_sex_life_to/	AITA for disclosing someone’s private sex life to their daughter?
gxq5owm2	(This happened like a week ago)  I saw that he had posts with captions that I thought were disrespectful, and I wasn’t comfortable with them so I asked him to take them down. One post was (edit: joking) about not kissing a girl he’s having sex with, because he has a girlfriend. So it’s implying he would have sex with someone if he has a gf, just not kiss then and it seemed gross and disrespectful to me. The other post was saying his addiction is girls of a certain ethnicity (I’m half), saying he can’t help it and put hot emojis. Previously he said something weird but assured me he didn’t have a fetish for that ethnicity, and then I saw this. I felt lied to, disrespected, and fetishized. It felt gross and I wanted him to remove it.    He said I was being controlling and it caused a fight between us. He seemed more understanding when I said I don’t want my family to see stuff like that, but he was mean to me when I said I thought it was disrespectful to me. It seems like he cares what my family thinks of him, but doesn’t care about how I feel.

iwgkqy9e	My (17F) mom is from Spain, so I get to mark Hispanic down on my college applications.  My other friend (17F) recently got official membership in a Native American tribe. Her parents have always had her check the Native American box as well to make sure it wouldn’t look weird to colleges if she switched her racial identification right before college admissions. She got a DNA test recently to see if she meets the 1/16 genetic cutoff for a tribe, and she did, so now she’s able to select the indigenous box for her college apps.   Our guy friend (17M) is super bitter that we’re all going to apply to the same colleges, and he’s the only one at a demographic disadvantage since he’s Asian. He’s extra pissed lately because he’s been reading all these studies about how Asian kids have to score over a hundred points higher on the SAT than people from backgrounds considered racially disadvantaged to have an equal chance at getting accepted to good colleges.   I told him to take a DNA test then and see if there’s anything he can claim along with Asian. He got really snippy and basically snarled “I immigrated here from Vietnam when I was 6. Of course there’s not going to be any non-Asian genetic markers.”  He’s been quite rude to us since realizing he’s the only one in our friend group without any racial/ethnic advantage. I was like “You’ve known since freshman year that Asian students have to have much higher test scores than groups considered marginalized to compete with them in college admissions. You failed to get an SAT score that’s enough points higher than us to have an equal chance, so that sounds like a personal failure to me.”  He said he can’t “believe the audacity of us.”	1642891323.0	sae7wf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sae7wf/aita_because_my_friend_is_jealous_he_wont_get_an/	AITA because my friend is jealous he won’t get an advantage in college apps when we’re all applying to the same place?
ix1orghl	Recently, I was in an argument with an ex friend, and it got incredibly heated. Here's how it happened:  &#x200B;  This ex friend is transgender. They would constantly try to push their views onto other people. I would always hear them say "Oh you're not straight" to people including myself. This always made me and others feel uncomfortable. Eventually, I managed to cut contact with this person. They weren't too pleased about this though.  &#x200B;  They would constantly try to contact me through any way possible. They would ask me why I cut contact and why we can't go back to being friends like we were in the past. I felt increasingly uncomfortable with this and decided to confront the problem. At first I was polite: I asked them to stop trying to talk to me and that I felt uncomfortable around them. They were demanding to know why.  &#x200B;  Eventually, I told them that it was because they kept pestering me and trying to make me believe their views. We got into this whole argument about how it's wrong to force your opinions onto others but they refused to acknowledge what they did was wrong. They told me they did nothing of the sort while still openly saying to people "No-one is straight" or "No-one at all conforms to binary gender". I tried to tell them that they were wrong, that they shouldn't be doing that as it could possibly seriously affect others. They told me that they didn't want, and I quote, "my crappy opinions of them". Now they refuse to acknowledge the issue and try to preach to my friends about what a bad person I am, and all their friends hate me.  &#x200B;  AITA?	1642891900.0	saef5e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saef5e/aita_for_starting_an_argument_because_i_felt/	AITA for starting an argument because I felt uncomfortable?
9ag4p2r9	Okay, let me start by saying I do intense research on disorders and disabilities before even talking about them in depth. i have General Anxiety Disorder and mild autism, so i empathize with anyone who has it bad, and or, worse than me.   For years i've been giving my characters disorders and disabilities that people have to make them feel less alone, and if i know nothing about said disability/disorder i don't give it to my characters at ALL because i don't want to do anything wrong or mess up what the disorder actually is. I'm a very kind person and i try my best to show representation in all communities the best i can. so here's the story..  i posted some character art to my instagram and i put that this character has DID(Dissociative Identity Disorder) on the doodle sheet. i did that so people can see it in plain sight, along with the art so it stays in their memory. its also something i do with information all the time as my brain recognizes it better that way.  And At the time i had tellonym(a horrible decision)where people could anonymously send me questions and such.   not long after i posted the art, someone said something like "you cant give a character a disorder you don't have! you're making it look preformative!" and i explained to them that i actually talked to someone with DID before even making the character have DID(this system is really nice and helped comfort me while this went down). I told them how i felt and i asked if they would like to have a professional discussion in dms because bickering at me anonymously isn't gonna help. and they barked back at me that i should just apologize. apologize for what?? trying to spread positivity for the DID community because their disorder is being used for roleplay on tiktok? they were talking as if i was a bad guy, even when i explained i did intense research and talked to a system?   while that was unfolding, i started to have an anxiety attack. i started to cry to my girlfriend(we were on call at the time)about how i didnt wanna be a bad person and that i was just trying to be nice and share rep and all that. (now that i'm mentally sober from the incident, i see how being nice is something i desperately try to do, but if i had been public about my breakdown people would have said i was faking, which would have worsened it.) i made an apology on my story to the person and in general because the person made me feel like i needed to.   at the end, i decided to not let the person make me feel that way(it was baad)and made a public post about how making a character with a disorder/disability is fine AS LONG as you do research. the person never tried talking to me to actually reason with me, and my girlfriend thinks they were just trying to make me feel bad. but honestly their words are still stuck in my mind and i still feel physically sick thinking about how i might be a bad person..  So..am I the asshole?

fnsvq0za	My little cousin (9F) has been staying with me for two weeks. She asked me if her friend could come over (9M) and I said sure. His mom drops him off and the two of them do their own thing and I’m watching tv in my room.   A couple hours later they both walk into my room, her looking sheepish and him walking behind her wearing her clothes from head to toe and (my) lipstick. I didn't know how to react and didn’t want to traumatize him so I just said “guys, please don’t touch my makeup!” and left them to it.   Anyway his mother picks him up shortly after and when she sees him she goes MENTAL, screaming at him to get his stuff and wash his face. Then proceeds to yell at me for encouraging it, basically saying that I’m trying to be “woke” and project it on to her kid.  Anyway, AITA here? Surely it’s none of my business? Should I have told him not to wear her clothes? She’s going to tell her mom and I’m going to get hell for it.   TL;DR: Kid friend of my cousin wore her clothes and my makeup and his mom is angry at me for encouraging him.	1642892699.0	saepuk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saepuk/aita_for_letting_my_little_cousins_male_friend/	AITA for letting my little cousin’s male friend dress like a girl in my house?
glpgjlbw	My wife (34) and I (33) moved to her home country to become closer to her family to to have a new start with our kids (1, 2, 3). We have been living here for about two years and kept in contact with my family and friends back at home, including my younger brother (31). Recently, my little brother have become unresponsive to my wife’s texts and messages. He didn’t even send a Happy birthday to her or my child’s first birthday (which is a huge deal in my culture). The final straw came when he texted me a Happy New Years’ but did not say anything to my wife. This has been stressing my wife out because she doesn’t know why he’s being cold to her and what she could have done to upset him. When I called my little brother out on this situation, he started ignoring my and my calls as well.

iuth9i5n	1 (14M) am a freshman at high school. the first couple of months i made some good friends  and also some bad friends. i met my bestfriend (14F) me and her became really close. So i met a girl in my class (15F). when i met her i was so desperate to be friends because she was seen as "popular" she would ask me to buy her snacks and stuff before school. like 3 dollars stuff i didn't think much of it. until it became an everyday thing, so i cut that out i told her i'm not gonna kiss your ass anymore. she got a lil angry but got over it. and after that it seems like i was a target to her. i am not average height for a high schooler i'm short i can admit it. this girl would call me Smurf and mind you me and her are the same height if she isn't an inch or 2 taller then me.   After christmas break i cut her off i ignored her and eventually she left me alone. one of the days last week or so she came in to class telling the class a story. she told us how she beat up this junior saying i asked her did she have an video she made up multiple excuses why she didn't have it. by the end of the day one of my friends (15M) came up to me last period and showed me the video and she didn't win she lied. when i went home i sent it to both of my best friends (14M) (14F). we came up with a plan to send it to the whole school.

ix3yzi76	My dad's fiancee pays rent on her own place while she stays with us at least 5 nights of the week.   I literally have no idea why, as it's a waste of money and my brother and I are always around, so I'm sure her own apartment and having her own space is preferable to living with 2 teenagers who aren't even her kids.   What makes matters worse is that she babysits us afterschool, takes my phone away, and makes me study without distractions. I once was earning an 89.9% in Spanish and she made me drill vocabulary and grammar for a week leading up to the exam despite me already being fluent in the language.   Granted, my grade went up to a 91.2% after that, but I was still annoyed that she treated me like she was a drill sergeant.   She also does really annoying things like hug me and ruffle my hair and ask how my day is going.  I asked her why she stays with us while still paying rent on her own place, especially as she always complains about being broke, and she and my dad got mad at me.	1642892981.0	saetm8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saetm8/aita_for_asking_someone_why_they_stay_with_us/	AITA for asking someone why they stay with us when they still pay rent on their own place?
5qk0wciw	I want to apologize for formatting, I am on a mobile phone and I am little anxious. I, (30F) have been considering calling my Mothers Ex husband for several days now. I can locate him though Facebook and my Uncles still talk to him from time to time. Its not particularly important, but I have been reflecting on my childhood/trying to reflect on it and realize that I honestly have very few memories. I have some "rehearsed bits" that where memories at one point but dont have any visual media with them. The things I remember vividly, are not so pleasant, though I know I have happy memories. I want to chat with someone who was there and get an idea of what I was like/ what it was like. He was my stepfather from when I was around 3 until I was around 9, when we moved states. He would also come to visit sometimes throughout my early teen years. The last time I spoke to him was my high school graduation, I think my Uncle brought him but I am not really sure. I know my mum was not pleased.  The reason I am concerned is that she has since remarried and I am happy for her and I care for her and her new husband, he is family. I dont want it to seem like I am trying to cause drama or start trouble within the family. I just want some perspective from the only other person who knew me as a child besides my mother.  Is reaching out to him an asshole move? I am a grown ass woman, should I just let sleeping dogs lie and move on with my life?   Also biological father died last year and I never knew him, I am concerned she will accuse me of looking for an emotional connection in her ex husband, I am just seeking information.   Also also I have some questions about his family background as I found out over the past decade that his father may have murdered a number of people, and whilst that isn't necessarily my business I guess I am curious about the full story?   The reason I think it could be an asshole move is that I am concerned this will cause unnecessary drama or negative emotions, I know if it gets out it will greatly bother my mother or cause issues.   TlDR: Thinking of calling my Mothers ex husband, he was my stepfather for several years and I would like to ask him some perspective questions. Concerned this is a shitty thing to do to my mother/ unnecessary  or strange as I am an adult.	1642892116.0	saehzn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saehzn/wibta_if_i_reached_out_to_my_mothers_ex_husband/	WIBTA If I reached out to my Mothers ex husband?
ix1z3gg7	There's a girl I know that I used to sext with and flirt with sometimes. Overtime, it seemed like she was losing interest but I could never tell for sure since I never got a definitive 'no' or clear 'no' signals. Her replies could've been that she was just going through a rough spot or that she just wasn't in the mood.  A lot of the time, she'd reply with a meme because that was her sense of humor and I'd back off if she kept doing that. We'd sext less overtime but it'd still happen occasionally.  Around a few months ago was the last time we sexted and from there, I tried to initiate a couple more times over the months with the same hard-to-read responses.   Just recently, I find nudes she posted on a shared discord server and I message her again to tell her I like them, try to flirt, get the same responses, and back off after a couple texts. Then, I see an anonymous message in that shared discord server (clearly from her) saying, essentially, "Im disgusted when you text me about my body, it makes me think worse of you <3".  I ask her about it and she tells me that it makes her feel off to get texted like that. I apologize immediately because I had no idea she felt that strongly against it and I feel disgusted with myself for objectifying her so much.  She says "it's fine", then, I see another anonymous message posted in the server that basically says "I wanna stab you in the balls, won't say who but you need to chill"  I ask her about it and, after explicitly asking if it's about me, she says that she told her BOYFRIEND about me texting her the night before. I had no idea she was dating someone and she never brought it up before then.  I started to get frustrated but i want to avoid drama so I left the server.  Im not sure how to feel about this. On the one hand, I know how hard it'd be to reject someone, especially with social anxiety. On the other hand, I had no clue that she felt the way she did and my first concrete "no" was an anonymous message saying she was disgusted in me and another of her boyfriend (who, again, I wasn't told about) being pissed off at me.  I really don't want to be a guy that can't take no for an answer so I wanna know if this is something I should work on, backing off and staying backed off if someone doesn't seem totally interested	1642893100.0	saev9w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saev9w/aita_for_not_picking_up_on_no_vibes/	AITA for not picking up on 'no' vibes
h9eoeeit	Throwaway because people in this facebook resell group have already sent me hate mail and death threats (including one saying "i hope your mother dies") to me on every platform they have so far found me on.   I (17f) am -- now was -- in a merch resell group. It's mostly used for trading merch -- we send pictures and videos of us packaging and go to the post office at the same time. I've done a handful of trades and they've all gone perfectly fine, until this one.   So, I exchanged an exclusive vinyl for an autograph. We both sent pictures of our items first ensuring we had our items before we continued on to the other steps of trading. I went and got the autograph certified and everything and I sent him tons of pictures of the gatefold and the vinyl. I got this vinyl for Christmas 2021 because I always wanted it, but once I got it I've never had so much anxiety about owning an item and was terrified of it getting ruined - thus why I wanted to exchange it.   We sent out the package at the same time. Mine got to my on a Tuesday and he got his on Friday. Once he gets the vinyl, he messages me saying "I didn't realize this but the gatefold doesn't have the correct QR code." (I did send him pictures of every inch of the gatefold, so he saw the QR code prior to agreeing to trade). I was confused what he meant and he said "it's supposed to be this number, but it is this one, so this is the authentic and original gatefold." I didn't know this and I didn't even knew it mattered. I profusely apologized and said I would send him money for how much it devalued it -- which I don't think would be that much. He said, "no, I want my autograph back." I then said (the group has price limits on how much you can sell things for) that I would pay him the entire amount that (250) the autograph is worth so he doesn't feel like he is being scammed. He continued to say that wasn't fair and wanted the autograph back.   I eventually ended up deactivating my Facebook as a lot of other stressful things were going on in my life around that and couldn't deal with a grown man telling me I need to do all this stuff to make it right. Within an hour I got multiple hate messages via my depop, other reddit account, and twitter from several people in the resell group.   AITA? and what should I do to make things fair?	1642893239.0	saex1c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saex1c/aita_for_scamming_someone/	AITA for "scamming" someone
hl4br9ts	My boyfriend ‘Tom’ and I have been together almost 5 years. He came home last night and told me he was had been shoved at a bar.   He said earlier that night he met a woman who said it was her birthday and that she’d turned 27. He said something like how can you be 27 with the acne of a 19 year old.   The girl told her friends and one of the guys came over and told my boyfriend to apologise ‘or else’. Tom said he would apologise if the request was reworded without the ‘or else’ threat.   Neither of them stood down and Tom ended up getting pushed by the guy. The guy went to grab a chair to hit Tom with but he was stopped and kicked out of the bar. Tom and his friends got to stay.   So when he told me this story he kept saying he didn’t deserve it and that he wanted to press charges.   I have to be honest but I had zero sympathy for him. I told him sure he shouldn’t have been shoved but he was also so rude to a complete stranger on her birthday for no reason. He said it was a joke.   I told him it was not funny and that he was super lucky all he got was shoved. That people have been stabbed for less and that he should have deescalated things.   He said he wanted to go to the police and I said see how you feel in the morning but remember you aren’t hurt so not a lot will happen with the police.   I told him everybody sucked in that whole situation (except the birthday girl). Then I said I hope he’s learnt not to run his mouth with strangers while drinking.   He said I’m blaming him for the incident and am acting like he deserved it.  After that he stopped talking to me and spent the night on the couch which he has never done in our 5 years together.   So AITA? Am I a terrible girlfriend, should I have been more supportive and soft?

ix396p5o	I (47F) have been married to my husband (58M) for 22 years; our relationship has been rocky from the start and has deteriorated to nothing ever since. Recently, in 2020, I have identified my husband to be a covert, malignant narcissist (this came to me through educating myself with videos). He pretty much ticks all the boxes - he abuses me verbally through insults, consistently gaslights me, hates my friends, and talks about me badly in front of his family, including his mother and siblings, particularly his younger brother (this is important for later).   Ever since, I have followed the experts’ advice and tried to have little to no contact with him as possible - I’ve moved into a separate room, I eat my meals separately (but still cook for all), and occasionally talk to him, only on financial/ house matters. Any time I have talked, it ends up in a screaming match.   He was just about to leave the house before Christmas but had some health checks so it got delayed. During the New Years, we found out that he was diagnosed with cancer; however, it’s easily treatable with no major side effects.   I decided to help him through this, just as I would with any person who is in need. Since then, I’ve supported him through any doubts he had about treatment, researched about his cancer, and I’ve put aside the abuse because I just want to focus on him getting better - I was planning to help him post surgery as well as he’ll be bedridden for at least a week.   Even after learning about his condition, he has not changed his behaviour towards me and has continued to use the same hurtful insults and threats as before. It got worse when I decided to call his brother and received more insults and threats from both of them.   I really need to leave; I can’t handle it anymore. At the same time, I feel like I’m a horrible person for abandoning someone who is in need. I’m extremely confused about this situation, and this has left me sad and emotionally fatigued.   TLDR: Narcissist husband of 22 years got diagnosed with cancer. Decided to help him through it but still receiving constant verbal abuse.

Granted, she wasn't wearing makeup, but her features are just plain. Not ugly, but not gorgeous either.  She was insulted by this and said that other men had rated her anywhere from a 7-9. I explained that other men may have been nicer to her and not wanted to harm her self-esteem or that she was just more their type. I'm rating her compared to supermodels, who represent the standards of American beauty.  I told her a 6 is not ugly. It's above average, just not incredibly hot, and that she could wear makeup and be an 8 at best, and that I still liked her for her personality.  She told me she wasn't interested in me and never was and that my opinion on her looks counted for nothing because I'm in my late 20's and have only worked dishwashing and retail jobs and haven't been to college.  I wasn't trying to be rude. I was just being honest. Heck, my last girlfriend was a 4 and she was fine with me telling her she was a 4 and we still loved each other.	1642894103.0	saf87h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saf87h/aita_for_telling_a_girl_that_shes_not_as/	AITA for telling a girl that she's not as beautiful as a supermodel?
4xjw5bxm	I F(19) am disabled and require the assistance of service dog. We've been a team for 3+ years now and have never had an issue before when it comes to public spaces and my right for him to accompany me.   We had a light snow in my state and everyone flipped and flooded the stores yesterday, I went as well to just top up on basics. Ham, bread, etc. I've been going to this store for the past 3 years with my SD and everyone knows us and have never had an issue. Yesterday while shopping however, we ran into a family that had brought their reactive Maltese into the store which was not pet friendly.  It happens all the time unfortunately, so we did everything in our power to avoid this family but they had caught wind of me and my SD being there and proceeded to follow us around the entire store while we shopped. Purposefully pointing out my SD to their reactive purse pup. I asked the family kindly to please stop following us, as it was pretty obv. That what they were doing since they never grabbed any items in the 10 minutes they kept fido locking eyesight with us. I thought they understood because they backed away but less than 5 min later, here we go again - but this time they kept getting closer and closer to me while their dog was barking and lunging at my SD. He ignored it since that's what SD are trained to do, but it really stressed me out and caused my POTS to act up. I once again asked them to please back up and take their pet somewhere else. To in which the mother of the family proceeded to UNBUCKLE the reactive dog from it's stroller and let it leap from the cart and come extremely close to us.  I panicked reasonably, this dog was reactive and while it was small I did not need him to interfere with my SD and bite him / cause him to miss an alert. I put myself in-between the reactive pup and my SD and finally just lost all of my patience - "Please get your dog, this is a federal offense. Stop harassing us.". The family didn't like that at all, and mom stormed up to fido clutching him in her arms before coming and shoving me "Did he bite you? Did he bite your dog? No. So - SHUT UP." - yeah she put her hands on me which is a huge trigger. I stumbled backwards and spiraled into a medical episode, my SD kept alerting and trying to get me on the ground while this lady continued to hurl things in Spanish at me. I walked a bit down the aisle before collapsing and fainting due to the stress (POTS) - I was out for a good 4 min and during the time security had been called and so had the police. My best friend who was with us at the time said the family stood there watching and laughed at me fainting.  The cops arrived, and security footage was pulled. They asked if I wanted to press charges when I came to, I wasn't wasting my time I wanted to get out of there. The family was escorted out and told to leave me alone. The son came back and asked what I gained from this then he was escorted out once again and they were trespassed.

8911i93p	Idk if my bil uses Reddit but here goes. I (16f) have mixed feelings on my bil (27m) and I generally dislike him because he makes me uncomfortable. A bit on insight why he does, he was interested in my sister (24f atm) and they were together while he was an adult and she was still a minor (she was 14, he was 18) I don't feel comfortable around him because he was a huge asshole to my sister and still is, and I don't know why she's still with him when he's done a lot of bad shit.  This year he's been trying to get us to get along better but I don't really want to get along with him. He teases my other sister terribly and messed with her relationship, he flaunts his "wealth" to my oldest brother and is extremely materialistic. I don't know if I'm overreacting but he's complimented me on my looks and asked what clothes I like so he could give them to me, I was trying on something my sister gave me during my birthday and he looked at me in an uncomfortable way that made me feel gross. I don't know if this is in my head but his presence makes me want to cover up as much as possible. Because he fell for my sister around my age I feel really awkward around him, and he knows I don't like him.  Now, he tries to win me over with presents. He gives us a lot of them and they're usually very expensive and the fact that he spends money on getting things for us makes me feel bad that I dislike him. The issue that made me write here is the fact that he gave me an overdue present for my birthday a couple months ago. He said it took a long time to arrive and I opened it and to my surprise he got me an 100+ year old historical fashion relic and bashfully apologized for giving me the present so late. I was surprised (but pleased, I love historical pieces like these) but I also felt torn as the gift feels wrong and too much to accept.   There was a card inside which he told me to read after, it was very heartfelt and he said he wanted to get to know me better and I would always be his family. I feel uncomfortable with the gift and the letter from him and I don't know if I'm the asshole for still not liking him. I know I can't forgive him for everything but he's the only person I really dislike but I feel ungrateful for the gift.  TL;DR: the BIL I dislike gave me a meaningful gift and I still dislike him.	1642894724.0	safg26	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safg26/aita_for_disliking_my_brother_in_law/	AITA for disliking my brother in law?
ix598ue3	Am I the AH for not letting my mother in law babysit anymore? I 21F have a 6 month old and am currently pregnant. My mother in law usually babysits one Saturday night every few weeks so she can take my daughter to church with her the next morning. When I announced my new pregnancy she told me she will only babysit one at a time and wants to watch one of them every other weekend once my baby is 2 months old like she did with my daughter. I do not feel comfortable separating them at such a young age especially considering my daughter will not understand why her sibling can go but she can’t. Plus, the point of babysitting aside from church is to get a small break which I feel still having one at home would defeat the purpose. So, am I the AH for believing she can only keep both or neither overnight?	1642894726.0	safg31	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safg31/aitah_for_not_letting_my_mother_in_law_babysit/	AITAH for not letting my mother in law babysit anymore?
ix3uzuwm	disclaimer: title is kinda clickbait  so i (27f) am in the third trimester of my pregnancy. i am very happy because i previously had a miscarriage and i am somewhat tearful because nothing has happened to my baby. because of this, my grandma planned a baby shower for me. we invited all of our friends. i was hesitant on inviting my infertile sister Summer (29f) because it might trigger her, but she was happy to go.   during the baby shower, i received gifts, been asked how the baby was doing, all that jazz. Summer wanted to talk to me in private. she announced that she has adopted a child from China and asked for my permission to announce it. i was so angry. im usually fine with this type of stuff but you don't announce it over someone's baby shower. i asked her if she was jealous of my pregnancy. she got confused.   we went back and forth, i made the point that she's been acting weird ever since i got pregnant, and because she's infertile it makes sense to be jealous. she said no, the baby shower is just the only gathering she's had time to been to so it was perfect to announce. i asked her to make her own event for it. she said she didn't have time. i finally snapped telling her that just because she can't have kids doesn't mean she needs to ruin my day.   she left. a lot of people asked why she left but i didn't explain until after the shower was over. her husband called me angry, telling me that ive been nothing but a self-absorbed bitch about my pregnancy. my husband is also against me.

ix4szzko	I m43 have 3 children f19, f18, and m15 with my ex-wife. Me and my ex got a divorce 10 years ago and I started dating my now fiance who is 32, 8 years ago. During the time of my divorce, my main focus was my kid's mental health. I've always thought mental health was a big priority and since my ex didn't this responsibility was all on me. Me and my ex got custody arrangements for our kids straight meaning I got my kids every other week. My kids were, of course, sad that their parents didn't live together but overall their attitude was fine until about 3 years into dating my now fiance they found out and they started acting out. I thought their mother was making them act this way so I set up rules if they wanted to stay because I wasn't gonna let this behavior in my house. Eventually, my kids met my fiance with the request their mother was there. I was fine with that and so was my fiance. When my ex saw my fiance she had an attitude and started making slick racist comments ( my fiance is African American) I could tell my fiance was really uncomfortable and since it was the time my ex had the kids we paid and then left.   Fast-forward to now my son loves my fiance and he stopped following what his sisters did and he started living with me full time when he was 12. He considers her his mother since he doesn't have a good relationship with my ex and she also considers him her son. My Daughter refuses to be at my house and I won't let them since they have started making racist comments to my wife about her and her appearance. I feel they are both adults and they show know what's right and wrong so for right now im going LC. My wedding is in March and my son is heavily involved along. My ex and my daughters found out about my wedding I guess through my parents and they are pissed. I simply told them if they really want to be there they will have to apologize and they have 2 months to prove that they have changed. They sent me a rude text calling my wife more rude racial comments but I blocked all of them. My wife and my son believe what I did was right but my parents are saying I did the wrong think.

fiqzd7h3	She said I was horrible to say such a thing yet she chooses to overlook everything bad about him because straight from her mouth, in the past, has said she always loved him and never got over him n blah blah. Like fantastic and so glad knowing he never came back to offer a dollar or time to me but the super dad he was turned around, had 4 more sons with another woman after and was apparently king of dads to them.    Yeah I’m feeling peachy especially considering I went to public school in the cheapest clothes and knockoff shoes and was terrorized for 8 yrs for being poor.  No other reason(sarcasm) and what did u say ….oh ya you didn’t want to put him thru that (child support) he’s got enough to pay for as is with his family “we don’t need his money…”  Huh!? We (I) came first, Ya we fucking do NEED it!! what are u, delusional?  Oh wait that’s right ur wardrobe was set so scraping by worked for ya.  We ate the cheapest freer were e food and for those that remember 80s poor food was horrible, I’ll leave it at that. Then I’m 16 still never a word from this dipshit and I’m pulling up to house after Rep practice and mom on veranda with some guy never seen before.  Well doesn’t the lovely lady hustle over and informs me on down low”that’s ur father he called I was telling him about u and ur baseball and he really wanted to come see u “ I said jokes eh ur joking right she say no and at that moment I realized this woman expected I’d be happy or some shit like that.  Who the fuck does that put me on the spot after all I dealt with bc of his stupid callus ass(there’s a ton of bullshit fallout from  him not being around, affected so much negatively but no point listing it) needless to say, I was TNT on inside and I had horrid temper at 16 from dealing with all the shit growing up.  But I could see how much it meant to HER. So fuck it eat one more turd for team mom whatever.  So this pile of shit with vocal cords feeds me this 30min sob story so sorry I want to come see u play and start over yada yada yada so……obviously I’m not happy to say yes but in the end what kid wouldn’t want dad back, as idiotic of a pipe dream it is.

7d8zrn1z	alright so very short back story, i came into a rather large amount of money in 2019 and decided to further invest a large sum of it into crypto. this turned the mid 7 figure amount into a high 8 figure amount. my wife and i had always talked about buying a sail boat and making it our home. about 6 months after making this incredible come up we decided to pull the trigger on an 80 foot Catamaran. the boat has sleeping quarters for a total of 16 people. we typically hire a crew of 5-6 people when we head out to sea for longer than a couple of weeks; paying them $4,000 a month + all expenses paid on the ship. they work 36 hours a week each mostly doing maid/chef/maintenance work. however i have found a guy i really like who we also hire to help actually run the ship out at sea so my wife and i do not have to stay on the bridge whenever the boat is in motion.     after everyone was vaccinated we decided to jump on the boat with a full crew and passengers with our closest friends and just disappear for awhile, sailing through the carribean islands and even stopping in Cozumel before returning home. the trip was fantastic until the second to last night of our journey.     i as the captain was sitting with my "XO" who is the guy i've started hiring to look after navigations for us half the time. we were kicking back a few beers and trolling a couple of lines, smoking a little devils lettuce; you know just an all around good time. my wife's best friend approached us and immediately demanded that i tell "the help" to either get back to work or go to their quarters (meaning the XO) as she's sick of seeing them acting like this vacation is for them. i immediately apologized to XO and told wife's bff that this was a vacation for all on board, just some of us are on a working vacation including myself and wife as we are also what you could consider "the help" as we spend just as much time doing chores on the boat as any of the hired staff.     wife's bff screamed at me she didn't f'ing care and that it was disgusting we let these freeloaders act like they own the boat, she then turned to XO and told him to not expect to ever get on to my boat again. right in that moment i told her that 1. XO will always be welcome on my boat whether he is working onboard or not and 2. she should enjoy these last nights on the ship as she will NEVER step foot on my boat again. she tried to respond but i just raised my voice now telling her to remand herself to her quarters.     we're supposed to go back out on the same trip at the end of feb and my wife say's i should give her another chance, AITA for not letting this miserable c\*nt back on my boat? (btw she words in middle management and is by no means rich, not sure why she thinks she's better than XO as in reality he makes almost twice what she does yearly.)

2s0t78q6	Before I start, sorry for the bad grammar, english is not my first language and I am still drunk because this happened very recently. Anyways, to start at the beginning, me (18f) and my group of friends went to drink at one of our local pubs. It all went fine till we got pretty drunk and got into a conversation that I can't even remember, and I told one of the boys that his girlfriend might be using a dating app and cheating on him.. He stormed out and we went after him where I told him that I am not 100% sure since I have never used a dating app myself, but it seemed like one to me. He still decided to go home, even after we talked to him about it.  I feel pretty bad now because I didn't want to ruin their relationship, and I don't even know why it came up, but I feel like he had the right to know about this. Although it bothers me that I might have made the bad assumption and it might be nothing like what I said.. Most of my friends are on my side but I really don't feel like I'm in the right here so.. reddit, am I the asshole for telling him what I knew?	1642895462.0	safp92	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safp92/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_his_girlfriend/	AITA for telling my friend that his girlfriend might be cheating?

Well about a month ago I asked one of the girls (f18) out. It was super subtle and it happened in front of a couple of people. After that we started dating and we’re a couple now. Well yesterday somebody said that me and my gf are making everyone else uncomfortable. I told them it’s not like we’re not touching each other or overtly flirting. They also complained that it made things awkward that I asked her out in front of everyone else in our group.  To me I thought this was complete Bs because the way I asked her out was telling her that I could go with her to a movie she wanted to see.   Keep in mind me and her aren’t talking while we are busy or working. We are talking while there is downtime or we are on break.   So AITA?

ix5ve1k0	So I own a small-to-medium business that's done pretty well, but not incredible the last couple of years. Think about 90 employees. I know pretty much all of them to various degrees and I try to maintain that "we're family" atmosphere in the non-toxic meaning. Everyone has set hours they're encouraged to stay in, nobody is called at home unless it's a real emergency, and then they get compensation, etc. I try really hard to be a good boss. Most of my employees have been with me for over ten years so I like to think I do alright at that.  Now I have two employees, Dave and John, in basically the same position. About two-thirds the way up the org chart, they are both VPs for the same division and they share the work well and both do great work. They make exactly the same right now, $90k + benefits, and have worked for me for almost the same amount of time, within a matter of weeks.   Here is the dilemma, at the end of every January is when everyone gets their raises/reviews/etc. Now these two have basically gotten the same raises for the last five years. This year, I have $20k/year for their department available for raises, normally I'd just give them each half. However, I happen to know (remember, actually close to employees) that Dave is having a much harder time, he has a newborn that he just finished paternity leave with, and his wife is ill from a very hard childbirth. She's not able to return to her work, and that's hurt their income, plus they have some large medical bills. John on the other hand is newly married, and his wife makes significantly more than him, and as far as I know, they have no real hardships going on. To me, it seems like they wouldn't miss the money, whereas every dollar helps Dave. So I wanted to split the raise and give Dave $15k, and John $5k, or maybe $12.5k/$7.5k, but the reality is, I know they both have the same jobs, and the same responsibilities, and they're both equally capable at the job, so I feel bad giving them different raises. I'm just trying to be a good guy and help someone out with a bad hand they've been dealt.  I discussed it back and forth with my wife and she says my intentions are noble, but it's an asshole move to pay one more than the other based on anything other than job performance. I can certainly see her point, but I feel bad not helping Dave when I know I could. My intention would be to try to bias it the other way next year to make up for it, but I can't predict how much of a raise I could give then or how the business would be so that's just hopeful thinking.  So WIBTA if I gave Dave the bigger part of the raise to help his struggles?	1642896132.0	safxv9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safxv9/wibta_if_i_gave_different_raises_to_two_equally/	WIBTA if I gave different raises to two equally deserving employees because I know one needs it more?
ix39zink	I posted this about an hour ago but didn't respond to the anti bot message in time and I have to post again.     My older brother (43M) is disabled due to a back injury, and severely diabetic. He's self diagnosed autistic and tends to use it as a crutch when something isn't going his way. I know he does have mental health problems and I've thought for years that he has some form of schizophrenia, but he won't get a real diagnosis because he thinks he knows more than any dr. He doesn't take care of himself and actually experienced ketoacidosis a couple years ago and nearly died. He's burned every bridge he's ever built (always because someone else screwed him over with whatever business idea he's working on at the time). A few years ago, he talked my best friend (single mom of 3 working for not much more than minimum wage) to let him stay with her. He contributed nothing except his "entrepreneurial skills" which ended up costing her lots of money. She finally kicked him out and he went to live with our dad. After a couple months, Dad kicked him out. So I bought a camper with the intention of letting him stay for a few months while he waited for section 8 to go through and then use the camper for myself. I never got to use the camper because he destroyed it and it's pretty much useless right now.  This was 2 years ago. He got into housing and is getting SSDI and food stamps. He still has to pay like $100 a month for rent, plus whatever he wants that food stamps don't cover. But every penny he has goes into his most recent business venture, and now he's begging for help because he got an email that if he doesn't pay back rent and late fees he will get an eviction notice, and his phone (eg his only link to the business world) is about to be shut off. Our dad is not doing well financially and can't help. Our aunt is one who even I've burned bridges with may be able to help, but she's volatile and help would come with unreasonable strings attached (they are the only people in the family besides me that still talk to him).  I am able to help, but I'm conflicted. I've done so much for him much of our adult lives, and the thing with the camper was the cherry on top. I've gotten to where I don't even tell him when I'm in town because I don't want to go by and see him. Otoh though, if no one helps and he does get evicted (which legally they can't do until 30 days after notice), he will either go back to living on the streets which would literally kill him, or he would end up killing himself. So I'm turning to the wisdom of Reddit for help.	1642896105.0	safxi6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safxi6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_disabled_brother/	AITA for not wanting to help my disabled brother?

itz3mx44	So I (29f) live with my sisters. We have the most adorable dog - mixed collie female named Indie.  She is a rescue and had a terrible habit of sitting staring when we ate our dinner when we first got her. She also had a tendency to sit under our dinner table but after training her she now takes herself away to one of our rooms to lie down while me and my sisters eat dinner.   The other day we were eating dinner, I get so uncomfortable on our kitchen chairs that I tend to get up a few times and rearrange the way I sit. This day I had no idea the doggo was under the kitchen table and accidentally kicked her. It wasn’t hard or anything but my dog yelped. I got a bit mad and for some reason thinking dog would understand told her she knows not to come into kitchen when we are eating dinner, dog ran outta kitchen into one of our rooms. I immediately gelt awful and got up to check on her and my sisters asked what just happened as they to be fair were not paying attention.   My Indie seemed fine and her tail wagged while giving her a much deserved belly rub. She is too pure and is there a better feeling than when your dog wags there tail with happiness to see you?  But one of my sister said I was an AH for not checking under the table and being more aware of having Indie and It got me wondering the same. So AITA? maybe I should have been paying more attention.	1642896183.0	safyid	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safyid/aita_for_kicking_my_dog/	AITA for kicking my dog?

She immediately demanded I buy her the MacBook Pro 16 inch and I looked that up and it’s like $2,500 and is way too powerful for what she needs. I told her she needs to save up money to get the computer.  So, the religious part doesn’t come into play until now. I’m Roman Catholic and my daughter is an atheist. She has rebelled against me way too much and never spends time with me, so I told her that she can give me her current saved money (around $1,000) and every time she leaves the house to go to church or any church events, I will cover $25 off of her computer. She instantly disagreed with me and just told me to buy it. I said she had to agree with me or I’m not buying the computer. My wife agrees with her and says that I should just buy the computer for her, even though she says that my son needs to save for his computer which is way cheaper. AITA?  TLDR; my daughter needs a new computer and I will cover the costs only if she comes to church with me.	1642896245.0	safzci	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safzci/aita_for_forcing_my_daughter_to_go_to_church_with/	AITA for forcing my daughter to go to church with me or I wouldn’t get her a new computer?
aycc04zp	I(M) was friends with J(F) . T(M) was into her. J was into T T was an asshole to me ever since he found out I was actually friends with J (watched a movie every now and then) He remembered he wanted to get to know me and his 3rd question was whether I was into her. I told him I'd think about if she asked. I wasn't gonna ask and I wasn't her type (she on her own was pointing out who her type is) He was questiong me about plans had with her He was trying to make me jealous (oh I can't talk to you, I'm out with J, even though J was across the country....) He told me I'm too stupid for her and to leave her alone On her side, J was madly into him. So much so that him not asking her out led to her blaming another friend (M) for "scaring T away" amd cutting him out for months  Where I think I'm the asshole: I kinda snapped after J told me that "if we are out (the friend group) and don't tell you anything, don't missunderstand it.  And I, stressed as I was, thought T had told her that I was into her or sth and made it uncomfortable. She had been growing more distant within the past weeks which I chalked up to her getting T's attention  I called her and said that I don't mind them doing their whatever, but to not cut me out (I don't even know what I was gonna achieve with this) She told me I'm imagining things and pretended that we arw good, when we weren't. She then accused me of blocking T  The kicker; T had slept with his ex while knowing J was into him. He got feelings for his ex but kept stringing J along. He was proud since "if you wanna fuck you gotta make them wait"  So reddit, Am I the Asshole? Can I fix this?

4duzpl3o	So I (24M) was forced to move back into my parents house for some financial reason. I’ve been on my own since I was 18 and I’m not thrilled about it but I’m staying here as opposed to renting because the amount I save each month is crazy. I work as a Firefighter and nurse so I’m hardly ever home because at minimum I do ten 24hr shifts at the station each month.   So as a kid my parents made me and my brother do all of the chores, my dad used to say “I pay the mortgage so I don’t have to do chores”. Well I’m not a kid anymore and I told my parents straight up that I’m not doing all the chores alone. My mom one day starts on me about the kitchen being filthy, this really irritated me because I hadn’t been home for over 72hrs, so I said screw it I’ll clean the whole house. So over a weekend I cleaned the whole house, dishes, kitchen, bathroom, laundry, the house looked ready for a magazine. Anyways this came at a cost there were so many dishes that I had to place them on the bar to dry and I told my parents I’m not cleaning a single thing more until someone puts away the dishes. I then left for a hospital shift and 2 fire shifts so basically another 72hrs gone. I come home and nothing is done.   It’s now been a week since I cleaned everything and still nobody has touched the dishes to put them away. I refuse to do it and best yet is my parents are now arguing about who has to do what.

d8oo4idc	So to make this as vague as possible so she doesn't know if its me or not we went out for lunch after years of barely talking or exchanging words we didn't leave each other on a bad note and I had return home for good. We have lunch and its ok and she mentions later after the next day we can go out and run errands together. Next day appears and it went great we went shopping for stuff for her and me I mention after lunch we should see a movie she agrees and in the movie theater I offer my hand out before previews ended and she seemed happy and held it as well all is well and when we are leaving she teasingly says it was good to see me again and we had a awkward stare and hug I decide to lean in for a kiss. I get rejected embarrassed thinking oh fuck I just did that way to fast I asked why (maybe moving to fast) she says flat out she had a Boyfriend (keep in mind on drive back she playfully poked my thigh and allowed my hand on her thigh as well) I was shocked and felt like I had just fucked all the good day we just had and said oh maybe we shouldnt hang out together since well thats kinda awkward since she has a boyfriend and I did that so yea....she thought I knew and had 0 clue and I said I was sorry and felt like I just misread everything and now I feel like I shouldnt talk to her again and before I left I (sarcastically said) "you should not have held my hand then" (trying to break the awk with more awk) and she said well no cause we are secured and trust each other and idk if she took that as I thought she would cheat I think maybe she did but she had a upset and disgust look on her face AITA for what I did ? and did I potentially kill a relationship ?   &#x200B;  TLDR: Had day out, Held Hands, Got close tried to kiss got rejected, she had a bf I didnt know and said she shouldnt hold my hand she got mad.	1642896727.0	sag5bn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sag5bn/aita_for_misreading_a_day_with_my_ex/	AITA For misreading a day with my ex
hor2xay7	I (f17) live in France as a foreign exchange student. I have been here for a total of 4 months, so my french speaking skills aren’t perfect.  I came here with no problems and adjusted pretty well. About 2 weeks later my hbrother(23) moves in because he is joining the military soon and doesn’t know when he’ll be placed, so he doesn’t want to have to pay rent.  Eventually, we all started getting really busy, except for hbrother. My hbrother is home all day except when he leaves at 7pm sometimes when he goes to the gym.  More to add is my hbrother doesn’t have a job and is usually playing video games in the basement. With us all being busy, the house is kind of a mess.   Now here’s where the beginning of the problems start for me.  He doesn’t clean up after himself. Most days, it’s just him at the house around lunch time. He’ll make himself something and then eat it. But when we come home, the pans he used to cook with are just sitting in the sink and his dish is still just sitting there on the table. Making it so my sister, my mom, or I, have to clean it up.  Adding onto he doesn’t clean up after himself is he lives in the living room in the basement. The entire place is a mess and it smells so bad. He doesn’t wash his clothes unless his mom washes them when it started to stink up the whole basement. He just never cleans.  Now my biggest issue. We got a kitten 1 week after I came to France and his name is Larry. He’s a very wild and crazy kitten and is a hassle to take care of.  So recently, my hsister and I booked an appointment for Larry to get his vaccines and to get him neutered. When my hbrother found out after we got his vaccines that soon in a few weeks, he was going to be neutered, he got pissed. He claimed that we weren’t even consulting him on what we were doing to ‘his cat’  I yelled at him saying that Larry is not his cat because he does nothing for him. He doesn’t feed him, bathe him, give him water, etc.. I also addressed that he never cleans up after himself even though he’s a 23-year-old man.  After this he complained to my hparents and called me and asshole saying that I don’t have the right to say things like this to him because this isn’t my household and I’m a guest. Hmom agrees with me, hdad agrees with him.  Now my brothers and dad blame me for there being a rift in their family right now as my hbrother who isn’t at home, is on my other hborthers side, while hsister is on my side. So I just wanted to know if I really am the asshole because I yelled at him when it really isn’t my place to.	1642897644.0	saggo0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saggo0/aita_for_yelling_at_my_host_brother_when_im_not_a/	AITA for yelling at my host brother when I’m not a member of the family?
i5t1hz1b	Ok so i have worked with this guy for a bit over a year now. Found out pretty early he doesn't drink much. Also found out his father is an alcoholic and a real problem with his family. Now if i made a joke purely about it, i would be an asshole but this situation is not as simple as that.  In the year and a bit i have known him he has said he only drinks on Fridays after work and i have only seen him drunk twice but he never actually gave a reason for why he does this. I just assumed he was a young guy, didn't like alcohol too much but would drink it on occasion. Turns out that was wrong.   So last Friday, we knocked off early. I offered him a beer but he said no. Yesterday, Saturday for me, we worked again and knocked off early and again i offered him a beer (might seem a bit off doing that, but in our line of work, the work is hard and a drink is looked forward to by most and offering somebody a beer is common practise), he said no, so i said "man i wish i had your resilience against alcohol" to which he responded "well if you had someone like my father, it would be easier", i said "oh, shit" and complete silence afterwards.   Up until that point i had never gotten a proper reason for why he doesn't drink as much and well i feel like an asshat for making a joke about the lack of booze he drinks.   I knew about his dad, but i never connected the dots until it was basically hitting me in the face. So i am unsure whether what i said was an asshole thing or not.	1642897646.0	saggoo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saggoo/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_coworkers/	AITA for making a joke about my co-workers sobriety knowing he has an alcoholic and possibly abusive father?

ix657mlu	Hello I’m bi 19M. My whole family and I have been celebrating my uncle’s birthday at a restaurant. Prior to this incident, there’s been some gossip in my family that my cousin’s wife thinks she’s hot as shit and has been using my cousin for his money all throughout the relationship. I don’t know if this is true, but my cousin has been saying he’s been in so much debt ever since his relationship started. This evening, my cousin’s wife sat near me and my younger siblings at this dinner party. My sister discussed her dating preferences and said if she doesn’t find a man physically attractive at all, his personality wouldn’t matter either. During the conversation, my cousin’s wife felt the need to tell us she doesn’t find my cousin physically attractive at all and only likes him after getting to know his personality better and likes how he treats her like a princess. I said, “you’re not so attractive yourself either.” She changed her seat and didn’t talk to me or my siblings for the rest of the evening.

a444rd5e	So i (18) have a boyfriend (19). In a very happy relationship.   Tonight I went to a party. I got drunk. Very. A guy i have liked in the past kept making sexual remarks, and kept trying to grab my ass.   I told him to back off. That i wasn’t comfortable, that I was in a happy relationship, that he has a girlfriend(who by the way, was also at the party).   He touched my ass a couple of times and I completely froze. I didn’t want it I really didn’t. He kept doing it and calling me hot and complimenting me.   I feel like such an asshole because he grabbed my ass a few times. He kept trying to kiss me, and I kept saying ‘no, please don’t’. Every time he tried to I leant away. I kept completely freezing and I didn’t know what to do.   I don’t know what to feel.

f0xqzcrk	I’ve (26) been taking care of my nana (81) primarily alone (my husband (31) does help) since my dad (52) passed away. It’s been 495 days of 24/7 care. Before that, I helped dad care for her and my papaw, who passed six months before dad did, for about five years. My uncle never calls and only came around with his hand out after everyone died. Though he got a lawyer to try to fight me all he ended up with was a charge for trespassing (1 of his daughters also caught the charge). Couldn’t get him for stealing papaws truck that dad died in because of legal technicalities. But he is now on meth and was just arrested and charged with meth with intent to sell and a firearm with intent to use. My sister and cousins rarely call or see her aside from a small occasional effort around major holidays because “this could be her last”. That’s really only ever a phone call though and a promise to call her in a few days that they never hold up to because they know she won’t remember (dementia). And that’s all she really has (her ex-husband and her brother passed last year, no other close family to speak of). To say I’m bitter might be an understatement. All she gave to them and this is what she gets from them now. I don’t think they deserve to mourn her. And I know I won’t have the mental capacity to deal with them while mourning her and having my life uprooted all over again. But would I be an unforgivable asshole if I just let them find out whenever they find out and do what I need to do with no regard for any of them?	1642898258.0	sagoel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sagoel/wibta_for_not_telling_anyone_when_my_nana/	WIBTA for not telling anyone when my Nana inevitably passes away?
ihnv6owh	I have 3 children Ab (30m) Ad (28f) and Ay (27f)   Now Ay has a child (5f), that I have with me most of the time.  I also handle all of her medical needs with the exception of surgeries (because I don't drive). Since birth granddaughter has spent 90% of her time with me. For goodness sake she even sleeps with me since she was an infant.   I have scheduled my life around granddaughter. I make sure my appointments are early in the morning so that I won't be gone from home too long.   I don't have much financially but I make sure that when I shop granddaughter's needs are met first.  Healthy snacks, pure juice, water ect. Every time I do this Ad kindly helps herself to granddaughter's things. I've had to put a mini fridge in my room just for granddaughter. Or else Ad will eat and drink her stuff. It's frustrating.   Why is it this way? Because Ay was working. First she worked from home. Then she did medical transport.  These jobs took whole days and weekends.  So I told Ay I would take care of granddaughter so she wouldn't have to worry that granddaughter was being taken care of.   Right now though,  Ay is out of work. And yet granddaughter is still with me. I don't mind,  she's a joy and the light of my life.   It's the fact that Ad is trying to insert herself in how I care for granddaughter. And suddenly Ay is having problems with it too. Mainly because of whatever Ad is telling Ay.   I'm getting to the point where I want to tell Ay to start keeping granddaughter and Ad at her house and then tell me how easy it is.   Everything thing I say or do is suddenly second guessed. And I think as a parent I have more than proved myself capable already.   And if I'm just the babysitter then maybe I should back up on the things I do.

3z12s1dl	I started an IT position 2 years ago. It’s a small team of about 3 employees in my department and we all have to chip in to get everything done. After being there a couple months I noticed people started bypassing the director and coming straight to me for questions. Those people would thank me profusely for helping them solve simple problems that have been issues for years. Later, my fellow team mates did as well. As I’ve got more comfortable, I started asking more questions. Turns out, the employees have been receiving poor support for years. They’ve been dealing with problems that goon forever without being addressed, BS answers to questions, and no follow through on projects, and many broken promises.  I’ve also found major problems with our cyber security, a serious lack of policies and procedures, very little documentation. I figured out pretty quick the guy needs to go.   2 years later, it has got to a point where management has started to take notice. I was approached and asked about my interest in the job. They sought me out, I didn’t initiate this. Nevertheless, I am interested.   The thing is, they want to fire him for cause so they don’t have to pay him severance/unemployment. They want me to help with documentation and evidence to support their cause.  The director… he is a nice guy, just a bad employee that is in over his head. He gave me a job, has always been nothing but nice to me. My problems with him only stems from our professional relationship.

dex9dx4r	I teach my children good manners and to be respectful of adults in all areas. I get compliments all of the time about how well behaved they are and how respectful and obedient they are. They almost never make problems when they visit their friends houses for sleepovers and I am very proud of them.  I was with a group of ladies from my church and we were talking about our kiddos. Specifically the younger mothers were lamenting about their children misbehaving at dinner time. And truth be told, a couple of them do not discipline their children enough and now they are little brats. I would never tell them this, I’m just trying to paint the picture here. Anyways, one of my friends who has teenagers was sharing one of the things that worked for her boys and then I spoke up and shared an example of what works for my kids. Whenever I make dinner, I have a rule that my kids must finish their plates. What they get is what they eat, and if they refuse to eat, I set the timer for 30 minutes. If they haven’t finished when 30 minutes is up, I take them up to their room and tell them that I love them but what they did was wrong and that they knew the consequences, and then I spank them with my husbands belt. Then I take them back downstairs, sit them down, and set the timer for another 30 minutes and tell them the same thing. They usually eat all of their food by the time the second timer is done.   I told the ladies that my oldest child was especially difficult because of her pickiness with tomatoes. Whenever I make my special lasagna dish, she would always cry because I wouldn’t let her pick out her tomatoes and she knew if she didn’t eat everything on her plate that she would get a spanking. Eventually she learned to eat them and now has no problem whenever I make foods with tomatoes in it. I looked around the table of my friends and a couple of them nodded but then two of the younger moms got quiet and were making faces at each other, which I found rude. They have since distanced themself and I asked why and they refuse to give me a straightforward answer. They just tell me that they think it is better if we stick to our kids parents’ age groups so that we can share with people we have things in common with. I don’t even know what that is supposed to mean.   I would like to hear the input from objective people who do not know me.

ix760n7s	I ran away from an abusive family when I was 17. My boyfriend and his parents took me in. I felt like I genuinely might have something akin to a family but I now know I'm wrong.   We all moved house recently. I'm currently 19 by the way. As a result, both my bf and I quit our jobs a few weeks before the move so we could find new jobs close to here. My boyfriend and I have spent the past few days setting things up in our room. All we've bothered with is questions about money.   In the past we've paid £300 rent to them. Both my bf and I always suspected the amount was too high. My boyfriend's dad is disabled and the family is low income so the government pays a lot of their rent. You'd think to settle this my boyfriend and I could simply see the bills right? Wrong! My boyfriend's parents are extremely secretive about the bills. They demand rent but still treat us as though we're children under their roof rather than tenants.   It turns out the rent is £430 pretty much, for this house and the old one. Am I wrong for thinking it's fucked up for tenants of one room to be paying two thirds the rent of the whole three bedroom house? They try to excuse it with "bills" such as water and gas. They won't let us see them and I'm not stupid, it still doesn't add up or seem justifiable whatsoever.   I prefer to work at home doing gig jobs (editing and ghost writing). His parents are older and dont really understand this and see me as being a layabout. But I dont understand. If I'm renting this room, why should I have to live how they want me to? Am I being a brat here?  They've also recently invented a new rule that everything has to be eaten at the kitchen table. Why am I renting a room to be told what I can and can't do in it? I can't bring any of this up though because they took me in and I feel like they know that. I thought I finally had people who loved me and I feel so let down.

aftibjky	Throwaway because my main has too many identifying details.   My job has been remote for a while now. I work in a team of 6, with one direct supervisor. Since we haven't seen each other in almost 2 years, our supervisor invited us over for dinner last night. I wasn't too excited, because I'm not close friends with anyone, but I figured coming out of my dark cave couldn't hurt.   I end up seated next to a coworker that I'm not super fond of. He's kind of an over-sharer. During dinner, the everyone-involved table conversation devolves into everyone having a mini conversation with the person to their right or left. I already know things are going south when my coworker says "let's not talk about work anymore....all we do is work". That's fair but I don't particularly like to share deets of my personal life with my non-friend coworkers (also, I've done absolutely nothing but gain weight in the last two years....whatevs). So, I basically let my coworker do all the talking.   He starts telling me about his new BF, who he's been dating less than two months. They've been spending a ton of time together and sleeping over each other's places yada yada yada. Then he randomly says "well I'm trying to figure out how much he makes right now". I kinda said "well, it's early on......". And he goes "yeah, it's early. but I like to travel and eat out, and I want to still do all those things without making him feel awkward". Fair enough. Then he starts explaining how much sleuthing he's already done on the issue. This dude already found out his BF's rent and thinks its "cheap" (why is that a bad thing?). And he looked up the average salary of people in the dude's field. He even looked up the average salary of graduates from this guy's school.  Then, because I was keeping the convo so one-sided, it kinda died down. We started looking at our phones awkwardly. So I just randomly blurt out to him "well if you know where he works or what he does, you can go on Indeed and try to find out how much he makes or you could try looking at openings in his company". The guy was like "yeah I guess" but starts reiterating that he doesn't really care how much his BF makes, it's really just about traveling and being able to split expenses.   So, I guess Coworker 1 told Coworker 2 what I said at the dinner. Because Coworker two messaged me on slack this morning and said that I shouldn't be concerned about what Coworker 1's BF makes. I said that I didn't care and he brought it up first. Apparently, I made Coworker 1 uncomfortable. I feel like I didn't do anything wrong and that Coworker 1 is just embarrassed about how materialistic he made himself look. My brother says that *maybe* this is one of those "I can say it, but you can't say it" scenarios. Like, I call myself fat all the time, but if someone else did it, I'd be pissed. Ya know?

gwc1wtq5	My friend R(30m) and I(25f) have been friends for 5 years. Met in college. We became close friends, but I grew to realize he had feelings for me. I don’t feel the same way, and I’ve told him and set boundaries. He’s very affectionate and VERY social. He likes to text throughout the whole day and shares Instagram posts on the regular.  He likes hugs and flirts and teases and jokes. I NEEDED to set boundaries. Lately he’s gotten upset that I don’t text back immediately. Not only am I trying to keep boundaries, but that’s not the way I am. I text friends once or twice a day, share a meme or a Snapchat. But he wants to talk all day every day, says good morning, how am I, what I’m up to today. He wants day long conversations. He insists on a Snapchat streak, sends reminders. I’ll respond to the texts within an hour or two, and send a quick snap. But he’s upset when I don’t respond often enough, and I feel guilty. Am I being a shit friend (TA) who needs to be more responsive? Or is there something else I’m missing?	1642899396.0	sah2g0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sah2g0/aita_or_am_i_being_emotionally_manipulated/	AITA, or am I being emotionally manipulated?
8xv84n45	When I was 15 my uncles wife was making suggestive remarks towards me. And my mom keeps asking me why I avoid her but I’m too afraid to tell anyone out fear of causing drama and possibly being harassed. Last time I “caused” family drama (I was physically assaulted and kicked out) I went to my school counselor reported it every family member I knew called or texted harassing me for speaking up about it. Making me feel like shit. Sorry for being  vague. Just wanted to know if I was justified feeling this way.

mo7tw	TL;DR: A gas station in my town is owned by Asian immigrants. Many people that live here, including me, call it "the Asian Station." My friend from out of town heard me call it that and said it is a racist nickname, but I don't agree. AITA?  I grew up in a pretty small town that has one gas station. The gas station was and continues to be owned by 1st generation immigrants from east or south-east Asia (I'm not sure exactly what country they emigrated from)  The gas station itself is **full** of generic Americanized Asian knickknacks. Things like Poky sticks, various Asian sodas, Buddha statues, Anime/Manga, those golden cat statues with moving paws. It is impossible to miss the Asian theme; it is obvious from the second you walk in the building. It also isn't modeled for a specific country; there aren't any flags and the merchandise comes from a number of different countries.  Lots of people I know from my town, including me and my family, call it the "Asian station," for obvious reasons - Its owned by Asian immigrants and it is filled with Asian-themed merchandise. Plus the name rhymes and is a lot catchier than the official name, "The Conoco station on X road."   I was giving my friend a tour of my hometown the other week - both of us are white and in our 20s. We got around to the gas station and I introduced it as "The Asian Station" and she got offended that I called it that. She started telling me it was racist to use that term to describe the building, because I'm needlessly bringing race into it, and probably making the owners feel different and less than. She told me I should stop calling it that. I refused and she called me a racist and an AH.  I don't think I'm being racist; "Asian" isn't a derogatory term, and in this case I'd argue its accurate because the owners are pretty obviously leaning into the whole Asian theme for the store. I guess I could call it "the gas station," but most gas stations aren't filled with pan-Asian merchandise and food, so "the gas station" seems to be leaving out a key component of what makes *this* gas station unique and fun.  AITA for continuing to call it the Asian station?	1642899701.0	sah678	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sah678/aita_for_calling_a_gas_station_owned_by_asian/	AITA for calling a gas station owned by Asian people "the Asian Station"
f7xhpxlf	So me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 years now. Let’s call him I8.   One and a half years in, I found out I8 cheated on me and has been treating our relationship like an open relationship behind my back. (Also had a fling with one of my best friends )  Not only did he cheat but he was unbelievably insecure and jealous of my friendships. He looked through my phone and would constantly ask me to not go out with my friends unless he’s there.   I broke it off with him not long after but we got back together a little while after because I still loved him.   It stayed pretty good for a while besides a few slip ups but I still can’t bring myself to completely forgive and trust him after that whole thing went down.  He begs me to try and see that he’s changed but I still can’t look at him like I used to before.   I genuinely love him and that’s why I’m staying but am I the asshole for not trusting him after what happened?	1642899323.0	sah1ks	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sah1ks/aita_for_not_trusting_my_boyfriend_despite_him/	AITA for not trusting my boyfriend despite him saying he’s changed?

i33lzrjb	I rarely see my grandparents since I live on the other side of the ocean to them. However when I was young I saw them every year for months at a time. During this time she would often strike me across the face, scream at me while pushing me against the wall, chase me around, and just generally mistreat me by today’s standards. So today I saw them for the first time in five years, the conversation went to politics and eventually to that and they went crazy, kicked me out, and said I ruined the family dinner.	1642900083.0	sahasy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahasy/aita_for_talking_about_how_my_grandparents_beat/	AITA for talking about how my grandparents beat me as a child at the family dinner?
ix7h2phw	I suggested to my husband that we try this new restaurant in our city I saw on Instagram. The concept is, it's a bunch of food vendors, and you can order from any of them.  We arrive at 3pm on a Saturday, and though the place is jumping (but PLENTY of empty tables), and we walk up to the hostess stand. We say, "It's our first time here. Do we just go up and order?" The hostess isn't very communicative. She says, "No. I seat you. You only walk up for to-go orders." So, we said, "Cool. Table for two."  She went to look for a table, and came back and said, "I'm not sure where to seat you. So, let me take your number and I will text you when a table is available. It should be about half hour..." She saw us look at the pretty empty restaurant, and said, "Oh, it won't be that long. I'm just giving you that as an outside number..." I said, "There are a lot of empty tables..." and she says, "It won't be that long." I was really making the comment to my husband, but she heard me.  I see several people walk in... and the ALL get seated right away. So, I say, "I wonder why those people are getting seated. He snapped at me, "They probably have reservations."  So, I just left him alone, thinking, "Super fun meal."  Eventually, after the 5th party in a row goes up and immediately gets sat, I go up to another hostess, and I ask, "Could I check where we are on the list?" I wasn't short or rude at all. She says, "I have three parties ahead of you." (I will add here, I had been watching, and they didn't pick up the phone to text that I ever saw). So, I say, "Oh, okay. I just wanted to make sure because I saw a lot of people getting sat who came behind us." Again, not rudely, I was friendly. She was friendly back, and said, "Oh yeah, well, they were reservations. In the future, I'd go on OpenTable if I were you." So, I said, "Okay. Thanks."  I sit back down, my husband still isn't  to me. Not a word. He finally says, "It's been about 30 minutes. I'm giving her ten more minutes. You can stay if you want." I said, "Why are you being sh\*tty?" and he starts telling me that I am always complaining (I am not). I said, "Let's just go." And so we do.

Well. he invited the family his friends and the people he wanted me to invite from my company which was everyone and their families. the one person he invited from my company who he really wanted to come was Tony and his husband I guess to talk about him coming out. my son made his announcement around 5 to tell everyone to thank you for coming and then to tell everyone that he has found himself and has found out he is gay and that he hopes that everyone will still love and accept him. I thought my wife's family was gonna go crazy nope they all clapped and cheered it went super well. it did up until it was time for another drink run to load the colors and load them up get in the side by side my dad, tony, and her cousin all came to help me this round.. it was me, tony, and her cousin packing the colors. after the first trip, her cousin started on his 21 question bull shit asking why I don't go to church why this why that but I can play nice so I answer his shit with a smile because keep the peace. well, he then asks am I proud of my son I told him, of course, that's my son and he's gonna be who is his, he made a comment saying my son is going to hell, and ill be right alongside him for our life of sin. i can ignore that but then he gets real homophobic and starts calling my son all sorts of stuff then starts talking shit about my wife and well I ended up cussing him out for that one it was in the shop though so no one saw minus tony. it kind of ended there no more talking I thought it was settled. it was not after the last trip he get out side by side and goes be with his wife I go sit down welp they come him and his wife and they start yelling at me for hitting him my wife hears them yelling then she comes yelling at them and it turns into a whole pick aside and watch the fight happen. everyone is looking at us now yelling and it's just a damn mess and then he starts on his rant about my son being gay again and goes on and on about bullshit and I just got tired of it and cuss him again. after that my wife told everyone whos with him to fucking leave because her son does not need shitty family in his life. well, my son had a good front-row seat and got to basically hear everything ass hole said and I feel like it's my fault for running his birthday I feel like a bad parent honestly for not protecting him from that side of the family. my wife, tony, and his husband took my son an hour ago to go shopping so I haven't been able to talk to my son alone and explain everything. my wife told me I was trying to do right and my family even said they don't blame me but i don't know AITA	1642900297.0	sahddi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahddi/aita_for_possibly_running_my_sons_birthday/	AITA for possibly running my sons birthday

I told him i just wasn’t. I asked him to leave and he said “I can just look up your number on the receipt”. I told him that he’s a “fucking creep” and slammed the door.  Later my mom called me.

ix7tm7uh	Hello. Sorry for my bad English, it's not my first language haha.  I'm (18f) and have an internet friend (26m) that vents to me all the time and every SINGLE day, and I am slowly getting exhausted.   So me and him have been friends for about 2 months only, we talk almost daily, or at least try to. The time zone difference is 7 hours.   Here's the thing. He ALWAYS vents to me about his problems, his friends' problems, family situations, friend situations and **always** turn anything positive into negative and honestly it's just so draining. As soon as I log in on Discord, he messages. Not even a hello or anything, just 50 messages about his problems. I try to help him as much as I can but it's too hard. I can barely help myself so how can I help another person too? And whenever I try to talk about my own problems, he changes it to his so I have to comfort him again.   He also gets really sad when I don't reply to him fast. I am busy, the time zone difference is big and I am struggling with my own problems and he knows that. But he still gets sad when I don't reply to him within 2 minutes, because apparently I'm one of his close friends already.  I really wanna help him but I'm so tired. I don't know how to help him. I spend hours of my day and night just trying to comfort him. I even try to comfort him when I'm with my friends. What should I do? Should I cut off contacts with him? He has depression so I don't wanna make it worse for him.

5f0gmdt0	back in September i had to go out of town for some family issues. When i came back my husband and i went to a party where he and this other girl, that we both work with, were spending a lot of time together. After several hours i realized they were both missing and she is the type of girl who would take any opportunity to sleep with anyone. So i start searching and finally find them coming out of where the bathroom is. I look at both of them and walk away. He chases me swearing nothing happened. I know when he is lying most of the time. Anyway after we get home he's so drunk that he passes out immediately. His phone starts going off like crazy, so i check it (I feel shitty for going through his phone, but i had to know) so i check his snapchat and find that she has sent multiple messages about " how much fun they've been having and they should've had a quickie in the bathroom and she cant wait to see him again" The next day i confront him about it and he admits they did sleep together one time. Fast forward 4 months and I have to see her everyday and i cant stand the sight of her. I went back through his phone, and found theyv''e been sending dirty tiktoks and messages back and forth through tiktok. I found out she has an onlyfans page and went through it and turned her into our work hoping she gets fired, AITA?	1642901167.0	sahnet	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahnet/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_husbands_mistress_fired/	AITA for trying to get my husbands mistress fired?
4j6y5h4y	My girlfriend was recently flying from Perú to Italy, going back home after visiting her mum for a month. During these flights she met a guy who sat next to her, and they started talking because they’re only a year apart in age and were both flying to Italy.   During the flight/while in the airport several things happened, it started when she said that she fell asleep with her head resting on his arm because her neck hurts when she tries sleeping without it supported, which I said was fine. She then told me that he started playing with her fingers and they held hands while he rubbed her hands with his thumb while holding, I started to get mad but let it pass. Then she told me that while sleeping she wrapped her arms around his arm so effectively cuddling, and a little while later she told me that he touched her downstairs private area and one of her breasts under her top and both times he was told to stop and she moved his hand away. While on the plane the two other people next to them remarked that they thought they were together because of how they were acting.  The worst thing for me was when she said that he kissed her as she was turning her head and she pushed him away, but then said she kissed him with their face masks on and with masks on “it doesn’t count”, apparently. That’s the part I took issue with, the fact that she willingly kissed him but with a mask on so she thinks it’s okay, a small quick peck is what I’m told. This is a girl that got mad at me for asking another girl what the COVID vaccine was like because I’m a pussy when it comes to needles, that was in May and she’s still jealous about it but acts like I’m insane for getting angry about what happened with her and this guy.  Lastly, she says that because he’s moving to a new city to stay with his dad he “has no one” and she’s going to go see him next month in Bologna, she lives in Milan. I don’t feel comfortable with my girlfriend going to see a guy that she meets on a plane and he’s inappropriately touching her and attempting to kiss her, I don’t know how I’m supposed to accept that she wants to go to his house/see him where he currently lives. They also exchanged numbers and are now texting. I let her talk to guys but this feels a step too far. Oh and yes he knew she had a boyfriend the whole time.

h74mnwb3	Throwaway just in case.  For a little bit of context, for Christmas I didn’t really want anything for Christmas. I had already gotten everything I truly desired. But my parents demanded that I tell them what I want or at least think of something. So I told them the ONLY thing I wanted were the Nintendo e-shop cards. I only got 1 and it was from my boyfriend.   Onto the issue. My parents got me two autoharps, a ukelele, a tongue steel drum, and a kalimba. I didn’t ask for any of these things. I’m am really thankful that I got them and I plan on keeping the kalimba because I find them really pretty sounding. Well, my mom was really excited to get me those autoharps and I was too at first. I thought they were super super neat till my mom told me the reason she got them for me. She said I wouldn’t stop bringing them up ever since I first saw one at an antique store. Which isn’t true at all. I actually wouldn’t shut up about a clarinet, and I also told everybody that but nobody believed me.   So I decided that I will keep the instruments and keep them safe and make sure that they are top quality till I move out. After I move in with my bf, I will sell them for a bit of cash since I don’t have a job at the moment and I need to save up the money to pay off my soon to be student debt. My bf thinks that it will be okay, but I can’t help but feel like I’ll get my ass chewed out when my family finds out.  So wibta if sold those instruments after I move out?

a4x80iuw	I (35f) have been dating my bf (m45) for a few months. I model and post my photos on IG. He knew this when we started dating. I toned down a lot of my shoots after we became official, because I realized that he was less than enthused about my images.  One day he was on a zoom meeting and I was doing an ab workout next to him on the floor. When I stood up, I noticed that he was looking at sexy ig posts of some girl. I just ignored it and kept working out. Later on I glanced over at him and he was still clicking through photos of some half naked chick, while I was right there.  I told him that I felt like it was disrespectful that he was ogling women for like an hour with me right there. He watches porn for like an hour + daily and we had to have a conversation previously about it because he was taking care of himself and not me when he did it. We came to the conclusion that as long as he keeps his porn to himself and it doesn’t affect our sex life he can do what he wants. That being said, he knows that I would not like him looking at half naked women with me right there. He claimed that it was just photos and not a big deal. He said that he is sorry that he made me upset, but I shouldn’t be, because it’s just social media and not porn.   I said ok fine if sexy pictures on social media don’t matter, I’ll post what I want, and I posted something similar to what he was looking at.   He got upset that I posted the photo and asked me to take it down. I refused. He unfollowed all of the ig models he used to follow and asked me to take it down again. I said no, he can’t undo what he did, it was already done. So I’m not taking down my photo, especially since, according to him, social media pics don’t mean anything.   AITA for not taking down my photo after he asked and unfollowed all other ig models?

6mjsblly	My(f41) son(25) died of a heroin overdose. I was forced to give him up for adoption as a teen because I was a ward of the state. He was adopted as an infant to a much older couple that I knew before and even while pregnant with him. I found out who adopted him a few years later and relaxed because I thought he would be raised right. I was wrong. When I connected with him when he was 21 I learned he had a horrible childhood. The mom(82) let her daughter try to train him to be a preacher. Even making him practice for years in front of stuffed animals. They gave him no world experience or access to it as the only TV allowed was Christian. The daughter spent $1000's on different Christian programs bought off TV to make him into her perfect preacher. Then she gave up completely and the whole family left him alone. He became stifled and angry as a teen and that's when he started using meth. He was using when I met him I just didn't know at first. When he asked them about me, they denied I existed. When I came to meet him, we stayed with them for a couple of weeks before I saw mom's bio son come and push my son screaming in his face. He then did the same to me and we left. I still don't know what that man said it sounded like drunk jibberish. We left after that. So now my son went from meth to heroin and has passed away.

ct48iql0	So that we are on the same page currently I am a senior in high school as are most of my friends in my friend group which is just at the scene. A few days ago one of my “friends” Pointed out my acne and then a couple hours later I tried telling him it’s not OK to talk about something you can’t change quickly and he replied by it’s who I am so I don’t care. After that discussion me and my group of friends were playing with a ball he kept accidentally not catching it or just being very rude to me l, by bullying me about work and how I was throwing and dropping things also about thinks I’m just self conscious about. After a while I got fed up. Which brought me to telling him that after we graduate this is why no one will want to stay friends with him. One of my friends backed him up and said I was in the wrong for saying it and I feel like it was justified but I understand if it’s not. So am I the asshole for being honest to this guy for being rude to me.	1642901922.0	sahwf0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahwf0/aita_for_being_a_jerk_friend_is_rude_to_me_so_i/	AITA for being a jerk?

e2x8dg9y	Me (17M) and my friend (16F) have been bests friends for about a year. Like extremely extremely close. Lately tho she has been getting on my nerves and pissing me off. I told her this by saying “hey I have been meaning to tell you this, I feel like you have changed over the last couple months and our friend ship has gotten toxic”. She said she did not feel this way so I gave her examples like when she randomly yelled at me for something out of my controll or when she told me that she used to think I was fat. I normally wouldn’t have said anything but my mental health and feelings have been super bad because of her and the relationship was not good for me. Their is a lot of other examples of her treating me bad that I don’t wanna get into.

12xjj5	 Hi All,  So I am a non traditional student in college right now going back for a second degree. During my first in person quarter, I made several friends that I used to study with and play league of legends with. However, over the last month or so we got into several heated conflicts and I told them I didn't want to be friends and they were like "likewise". The conflict made me feel bad because I feel like we just couldn't see eye to eye on the issue and we separated because of irreconcilable differences. They also made me feel like I was in the wrong. These people are in their younger 20s and I am 27.  The issue was that most of my ex friends were pretty far left leaning when it comes to their political views but I am not. I am a fairly moderate liberal. Before our conflict, I usually just put up with it and didn't really engage too much because I knew it would cause problems. I felt uncomfortable disagreeing because I knew it wouldn't end well.  However, several weeks ago, while I was on my University's discord channel, I joined the LGBT club discord channel because I am gay. I got frustrated that most of the people there were identifying as non-binary and there were no other gay guys (no lesbians either?...). I asked them how someone could be non-binary and they were like "people who are neurodivergent or autistic can feel many different ways about their gender identity and can often identify with textures, sound, or emotions". I basically was like wtf? and said that doesn't make sense. Then a bunch of them started raging at me in the chat and I got banned.  Later on, I found out that my ex friend started becoming friends with these people (he's straight). He joined their club and when I became frustrated he expressed to me that I shouldn't be able to join the university pride club because of my views and that I should just make my own club if I want to make LGBT friends. I told him that it pissed me off that he wanted to associate with and be friends with those people considering how they treated me and he said he didn't care. More specifically, he said "you should have known how they would react to what you were saying. you should have known they wouldn't like that. you are socially incompetent." Then I was like wtf? and then I said I didn't want to be friends with him and that he was a cunt. He literally said that even though he thinks the non-binary people are pretty crazy and don't make sense he still wants to be friends with them and a part of their group.  Anyways, I guess my issue is like how to deal with people who just fundamentally disagree with you on certain controversial issues that are important to you? Like it made me kind of pissed that I felt enough frustration over this person  to cut off all ties. I feel like I can't fix people and make them acknowledge how fucked up they are? Especially with regards to certain controversial topics like politics or religion, some people become EXTREMELY heated over it. They usually get even angrier when you expose how terrible their beliefs are.

ix7h2phw	I suggested to my husband that we try this new restaurant in our city I saw on Instagram. The concept is, it's a bunch of food vendors, and you can order from any of them.  We arrive at 3pm on a Saturday, and though the place is jumping (but PLENTY of empty tables), and we walk up to the hostess stand. We say, "It's our first time here. Do we just go up and order?" The hostess isn't very communicative. She says, "No. I seat you. You only walk up for to-go orders." So, we said, "Cool. Table for two."  She went to look for a table, and came back and said, "I'm not sure where to seat you. So, let me take your number and I will text you when a table is available. It should be about half hour..." She saw us look at the pretty empty restaurant, and said, "Oh, it won't be that long. I'm just giving you that as an outside number..." I said, "There are a lot of empty tables..." and she says, "It won't be that long." I was really making the comment to my husband, but she heard me.  I see several people walk in... and the ALL get seated right away. So, I say, "I wonder why those people are getting seated. He snapped at me, "They probably have reservations."  So, I just left him alone, thinking, "Super fun meal."  Eventually, after the 5th party in a row goes up and immediately gets sat, I go up to another hostess, and I ask, "Could I check where we are on the list?" I wasn't short or rude at all. She says, "I have three parties ahead of you." (I will add here, I had been watching, and they didn't pick up the phone to text that I ever saw). So, I say, "Oh, okay. I just wanted to make sure because I saw a lot of people getting sat who came behind us." Again, not rudely, I was friendly. She was friendly back, and said, "Oh yeah, well, they were reservations. In the future, I'd go on OpenTable if I were you." So, I said, "Okay. Thanks."  I sit back down, my husband still isn't to me. Not a word. He finally says, "It's been about 30 minutes. I'm giving her ten more minutes. You can stay if you want." I said, "Why are you being sh\*tty?" and he starts telling me that I am always complaining (I am not). I said, "Let's just go." And so we do.

ix9gy75h	I bought my girl when I was 16. She was my first ever pet that I bought myself. At the time I had an older dog who over the years grew to hate other dogs. At first when I bought my girl Charlie home Bubba liked her. They got on well and it was all fine but slowly Bubba started attacking Charlie.   Although Charlie was mine on paper I lived with my mum and sister so Charlie was a family dog. She slept in my sisters room, my mum bought her food etc. So she ended up "belonging" to all of us.   One day I got home and Bubba had broken Charlies leg. Despite my efforts to keep them separate my mother let them out at the same time saying they were pining for each other through the door and a fight broke out. My mum ended up having to go to hospital with a broken finger when she tried to separate them and Charlie ended up with a broken let and lacerations to her neck.   I made the decision then and there to rehome Charlie. I found her a new family and home within a few days and she was gone in a week. I made sure her new home was a single dog home, active with a loving family and I paid for all her vet care. She recovered well and last time I checked in she is living her best life and has even been trying out some cool dog sports. My mother and sister never really said anything though both cried for days after.  Its been 4 years since this happened. I have a new dog and I have moved on but my family hasn't. There are pictures of Charlie everywhere in their house and they still cry if we talk about her. Yesterday my sister said she never forgave me for rehoming Charlie without asking anyone how they felt about it and it was the most horrible thing I have ever done to the family.

iwv4nkbq	My brother and his first wife met in college and had been together for about 10 years, 6 years married. They have one kid together. Everyone loved her and she was very close with my family. I thought my brother was happy, but seemingly out of nowhere he announces that he is filing for a divorce.  &#x200B;  It turns out he had been having an affair for two years with one of their family friends, and was planning to leave his first wife for her. They're currently married. I was shocked by this and disgusted with him. He brought his new wife with him to a family event and introduced her to everyone. The first time I met her I thought she was nice enough but didn't say much to her. The more I met her and saw the two of them together the more I hated them.  &#x200B;  They almost constantly taunt his ex-wife behind her back, I remember his wife even remarked that my brother's son was so cute that there was no way he was related to his "ugly" ex, and my brother laughed. Another time my brother said something about how his ex-wife "wasted 10 years of his life". You get the point. It's even worse because my brother was one of the sweetest and kindest people I know, it's like someone else took over his body.  &#x200B;  Eventually my family and I got fed up and told him he's a disgusting person and we have no interest in speaking to him anymore. Neither me or anyone in my family have spoken to him in almost a year until a week ago when he and his wife showed up to my door and told me she had a miscarriage. He said they needed someone to talk to. I don't remember exactly what I said but something to the extent of laughing and saying "I guess that's gods way of telling you guys you aren't worthy of being parents".  &#x200B;  Me and my two sisters are still friends with our brother's ex-wife and visit her often, and my brother is aware of this. My brother apparently contacted his ex-wife after I said that yelling at her saying she told me to say that (which doesn't even make sense because she didn't know what happened until I told her). His ex thinks I crossed a line.  &#x200B;  I know I was mean but I think that what I did is nothing compared to what my brother and his new wife did.

ix7chv27	Sorry for bad formatting, first time poster and also on mobile. For context we dated in the seventh grade for about four months and broke up at the start of eighth grade. I know this sounds petty and dumb but please read the whole post before judging.  I (14f) dated “Daniel” (13m) two years ago, for about four months (I was 13 he was 12). We had been extremely close friends for nearly a year before this and he had asked me out multiple times in that year. Things moved very quick and I wasn’t comfortable in the relationship but I didn’t say anything because I cared about him too much. After 2 months he was grabbing my ass and running his hand all the way up the inside of my thigh. Then we went on school holidays and I didn’t see him for 6 weeks. When we came back I tried to set boundaries with the way he touched me. On the first day of seeing me again he tried kissing me and when I said no and turned away he put his arms around me and tried to pull me back. He broke up with me 4 days later. Less then a fortnight after we broke up he dated 2 girls. Two months after we broke up I met someone and started talking, he then called me a slut and a whore.  He had also said he never loved me and that I’m ugly so he doesn’t even know why he dated me. None of these things were ever said to my face because anytime I try to talk to him about what his problem with me is he runs away…literally. He has destroyed my mental health and made me feel like I’m worth nothing. Sorry for such a long story I just want a fair judgement. This is where I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for resenting him. One of my closest friends has told me I should get over it and that he only says things about me so I shouldn’t have an issue with him. But even when we were dating he made me fell worthless.

ivxyelih	My mom (49F) has always naturally been really skinny her whole life. I’m 16F and I’m not as skinny as my mom. I’m 103 pounds, but I’m much shorter than her and I don’t have a flat stomach no matter what I weigh. My mom is 5’6 and weighs around 105.  I hardly ever see her eat and when she does, she eats like a bird. She eats exactly the same way as my very underweight grandma who has dementia. She criticizes my grandma’s eating habits but my mom doesn’t understand that she’s the exact same way.   I am very hesitant to say something to my mom, because I don’t want her to think that I’m body shaming. However, she literally looks like a skeleton and I’m scared that she’ll break when I hug her. Today she tried on a sleeveless, low cut dress, and her collarbone was sticking out so much that I couldn’t look at it. Her hands have divots around all of the little bones. She rubs in my face how she’s going to eat very small portions of food so that she looks good in a bikini. She does this when I’m taking a noticeably larger amount of food than her.  On Christmas Eve, my grandma pulled me aside and said to me: “you’re mother is way too thin. She looks sickly, like a cancer patient or drug addict.” I told my grandma that my mom is fine. But honestly, I’m concerned for her health. Should I bring this up with her in a way that shows that I’m not judging her?	1642902963.0	sai8l0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sai8l0/wibta_if_i_said_something_to_my_mom_about_her/	WIBTA if I said something to my mom about her weight?
2nu7z480	So my(23) Significant Other(25) of nearly 2 years is pissed at me because I said I'm having to back out of trip plans we were still making together.  (We hadn't purchased anything yet).  I had to cancel as I just got my first job out of school a few months ago, and now my boss is leaving the company in 2 weeks~ saddling me with a huge project to do by myself (as opposed to the two person team) until we can backfill her role.    Given that I'm fresh to this job I love, I don't think it's a good idea for me to take time off when we are short staffed, as it will look bad AND holding the fort down will give me leverage to move up.  More importantly though, I think it will look really bad to try to leave a ship completely unmanned, and possibly get me fired.   My S/O feels I'm "deciding to hurt [them]".   I feel I would understand their position if I cancelled to travel with someone else or do something else, but I'm disappointed too.  I understand it's important to keep my word, and I always make my best effort.  I just feel life can get in the way and we need to understand that.

864onusm	I [27F] went to the grocery store today to pick up a couple of things for the week. When I got to the register, the cashier in the lane next to us was asking the manager (who was my cashier) for help. She stated that the woman who she was checking out kept stating that the prices were ringing up wrong than what was on the aisles. I could hear the woman stating the prices were wrong in broken English, but she was trying as hard as she could to explain the discrepancies.   The manager who was ringing up my items became visibly frustrated and looks at me and says   “She doesn’t even speak English, how does she know the prices are wrong, that’s what I would like to know. Ya know?”  I just glare at her and ask, “What is that supposed to mean?” And she falls silent. The other cashier helps the woman out, my cashier finishes ringing me up and gives me my receipt in absolute silence and I leave the store. I haven’t been able to forgot about that remark, as someone with immigrant parents who struggle with English, I couldn’t imagine someone saying that about them while they’re trying.   I have the cashiers name, but she was a manager so I can’t really call in a complaint, and I was thinking about calling corporate but I feel like that is taking it too far.

1ec05gsu	I was at work with a coworker I've known for approximately over a month. He's really cool. He's the janitor and I'm the case manager. We were talking financials and somehow he told me he's been saving his money and whatnot.   He said if I seen his account I'd think he's a drug dealer. So, he takes his plastic gloves off and shows me $25K in Chase. I proceeded to show him mine with $140K. For reference I'm 29 and he's roughly in his mid 40s.   I thought about it afterwards and I hope I didn't mean to come off as an asshole in any way if I did trying to overshadow him. I was lending him advise on how to diversity his money and that both him and I are guilty of being too cash heavy.  I hope I didn't come off as an asshole trying to flex. I'm cringing at the moment. Perhaps I shouldn't have shown in anything. I like him and he's cool. Unfortunately, today was my last day at the job because I landed a higher paying opportunity. We still keep in contact.  This isn't a post to ask if he or I is the an asshole but whether I am for responding and showing him back mine.

9leefp7o	Let me give a back story, my roommates and I previously lived together 2 years ago. We went through a traumatizing experience with other roommates. During that time she bought a puppy and she believes in the pee pad system in the house. Because of how horrible our former roommates were at the end of that lease we move into a new apartment. She keeps the dog confined too her room, but when he’s out he pretty much Pees on everything. And I am constantly having to carpet clean (that I bought) and we recently just renewed our lease. So fast forwards I recently asked to hide something in her room away from my partner. Well when I walked in it was horrid. I cannot describe the smell/odor that came from this. I immediately got sick. She was gone for a week and I carpet cleaned her room because I noticed the pee all over her room. Her pee pad was completely soiled like beyond.  Her room isn’t messy but just extremely unsanitary. I paid for the deposit and she paid for the pet deposit. I’m with her for another year and I truly value our friendship. But every time she opens her door I get sick and have leave the house or go to another room because it’s so terrible. So, AITAH if I confront her about the smell.	1642903441.0	saieeb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saieeb/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_roommate_about_the_odor/	WIBTA IF I CONFRONTED MY ROOMMATE ABOUT THE ODOR OF HER ROOM
ix92gyi9	Throwaway i think my sister is on reddit   My moms has always been a spiritual person. She’s all for natural remedies, meditating etc. I love spirituality myself but not to the extent of her. Recently she’s been having these spells where she doesn’t talk to anybody for a week. It first started a couple months ago when my older sister and her got into a big argument. After the argument she put herself in her room and told us not to interrupt her meditating. The thing is she wouldn’t make dinner for anyone, she wouldn’t take us anywhere or anything. And she wasn’t even meditating after a couple hours, she was just in there watching movies and on the phone with somebody. My dad was doing all the work. I asked my dad about it and he said this was normal before we were born and she’ll stop soon.   Well flash forward to now, she’s doing it again. This time it was because her and my dad got into a fight about something, i don’t know what i wasn’t home. This time she wasn’t talking to anyone for 3 days then left for 5. Don’t know where she went.   When she got back she tried to talk to me like nothing happened. I yelled at her and told her that she’s been a neglectant mother lately and to not talk to me. My sad heard me yelling at told me that i was being insensitive to her beliefs and to apologize because she’s going through a tough time.	1642903621.0	saiggf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saiggf/aita_for_calling_my_mom_out_on_her_spirituality_bs/	AITA for calling my mom out on her spirituality BS

itz3mx44	So I (29f) live with my sisters. We have the most adorable dog - mixed collie female named Indie.  She is a rescue and had a terrible habit of sitting staring when we ate our dinner when we first got her. She also had a tendency to sit under our dinner table but after training her she now takes herself away to one of our rooms to lie down while me and my sisters eat dinner.   The other day we were eating dinner, I get so uncomfortable on our kitchen chairs that I tend to get up a few times and rearrange the way I sit. This day I had no idea the doggo was under the kitchen table and accidentally kicked her. It wasn’t hard or anything but my dog yelped. I got a bit mad and for some reason thinking dog would understand told her she knows not to come into kitchen when we are eating dinner, dog ran outta kitchen into one of our rooms. I immediately gelt awful and got up to check on her and my sisters asked what just happened as they to be fair were not paying attention.   My Indie seemed fine and her tail wagged while giving her a much deserved belly rub. She is too pure and is there a better feeling than when your dog wags there tail with happiness to see you?  But one of my sisters said I was a bit of an AH for not being aware off my dog and checking under the table.

hvson6nh	One of my neighbours baked cookies a few days ago and offered them to a few people on our street. I had them and offered to return the container. My neighbour said she was going for a walk that afternoon and could swing by and collect it.  She arrived at my doorstep and when I opened the door she was standing there with her two german shepherds. Like wtf. Why would you bring them with you.   They were on leashes but were still wandering around and sniffing the floor outside my doorstep.   I tried to quickly give the container so she would leave, but she asked me about how I was going etc and tried to make small talk. During the conversation one of the dogs took a couple of steps into the doorway and inside my house and then walked back out.   I was worried the entire time that the dogS could have peed or pooped and the owner seemed completely oblivious.  I told my neighbour over messages that she was inconsiderate and rude. She defended herself, and said that the dogs did nothing wrong and also that, if I had told her, she could have tied the dogs to the fence so they didn’t go near me.   I feel like she’s just an AH for the way that she was so inconsiderate, and for her response. However she makes it out as if I’m the asshole.

8u2kbiwo	I dated my ex-girlfriend for about eight months before we had sex. We lived an hour apart so we went from just casual dates to staying together for entire weekends. It was her first time and it seemed to be really painful for her, but it just wasn’t any good and I didn’t contact her after and was really short when she contacted me and then I broke up with her a couple of weeks later. She went nuts on me for taking her virginity and basically not talking to her again, but sex with her wasn’t what I thought it was going to be. She wanted an explanation, but I wasn’t about to tell her it was because the sex was bad so I just made something up about her not being right for me. Now she thinks I’m a dick.

ixaiqd79	I have a kid and parenting has been hard for me as I have a very emotional child who argues and gets mad with me all the time. I feel like I don't see eye to eye with her on many things and that we don't understand each other.  She got a stepmother a few years ago and their relationship is completely different. Her stepmom seems happy to parent her; whenever I drop my kid off at their house, her stepmom always comes out to get her and squeezes her and says that she missed her.   Moreover, I've seen her stepmom buy her expensive food and clothes and other things she's wanted. I also struggle to give my child affection as I don't feel warmly for her, but I once saw my stepmom and kid watching movies at a family holiday and that her stepmom would periodically snuggle with each other and kiss each other's cheeks.  Recently, I've noticed that when my kid is at my house, she texts her stepmom and calls and FaceTimes her about everything and never is present with me. I asked her to stop and she refused.	1642904157.0	saimol	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saimol/aita_for_asking_my_child_to_stop_texting_and_be/	AITA for asking my child to stop texting and be more present with me?
dd4h5lqi	I (25F) have been dating my bf (40M) who I'll call Rob, for a few months. We had dated a few years ago but broke up because we were in different places in life but decided to try again. He used to be a really great person and super nice, but it's like I'm with a complete stranger. He's extremely condescending to me as well as other people (both people I know and strangers).   Recently one of my best friends (24M) that I'll call Damien, lost their dad to cancer and reached out since I had lost my grandfather to the same thing and he needed someone to talk to. A bit of background, Damien has had an extremely hard life. Within the first few months I knew him his house burned to the ground due to an electrical problem and he and his family almost died, he's been bullied his whole life, someone he called his friend stole his credit cards and has put him in massive debt, just a whole hellish life...Rob knows all of this. I'm pretty open with Rob about who I talk to as I don't believe in keeping secrets or anything like that especially when it comes to friends of the opposite gender, mostly thanks to past relationship trauma.   When I told him what happened and why I talked to Damien he completely lost it  and started saying that Damien was nothing but a loser, pulling up his social media profiles and saying that he was ugly etc. I let it go on for a good five minutes because I was too surprised to even respond to any of it but when he stopped talking I pretty much tore into him. I told Rob that despite what he and his ego believe he isn't exactly the cream of the crop and is nothing but an arrogant jerk who only gets confidence from putting other people down and I won't be dealing with it anymore especially when it comes to my friends.  He then tried to accuse me of having feelings for Damien and said I was only defending him so I could get with him. I have never shown interest in Damien before or even now and see him as a brother. There has never been any flirting between us and any conversations I've had with him have always been made known to Rob if he asked. I told Rob that until he can get off his high horse and stop doing what he's doing I'm not going to be around him or come over. (This is just one issue among many we've had in the few months of dating, mostly him talking to me like a child.) After I said that he put a blanket over his head and refused to talk so I packed up the stuff I had at his house and left. He called a few hours later asking if I was done being melodramatic and was ready to come back. I told him I was sticking to what I said and that if he wasn't going to change then we are done.  Several of his friends have messaged me saying I'm being dramatic over another guy and that I should just let it go and stop being friends with Damien to keep the peace and saying I really hurt Rob's feelings...So, AITAH for telling him to get off his high horse?	1642904387.0	saip8r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saip8r/aitah_for_telling_my_bf_that_he_needs_to_get_off/	AITAH for telling my BF that he needs to get off his high horse?
89utt580	This is going to be long but please read through it because I need some perspective.   So me and my partner had agreed with my friend (who we will call john) to go to comic con togther, this would be the first time John would be meeting my significant other and so I was hoping they would get along, so I though.   So comic con was a day away and we (my partner and i) had to get up at 6 am to catch a 4 hour train to my area where I live to go to another one of my friends parties because we were both invited, we went and had fun and spent the night at my place for the first time where my significant other couldn't sleep and had a small break down because she was so far from family which caused us to end up going to bed at around 3 am, the morning of which we were going to comic con.   We had already made arrangements to meet John at the train station and go to the city togther at 8:30 but me and my partner slept through our alarms till 9:30 Where we woke and realised we were late, after contacting John we told him we would meet him in the city and within half an hour we were on a bus not far behind him, let me tell you me and my partner wouldn't stop apologizing to him about this because we felt so bad about sleeping in and explained why hoping he would understand, he would not and constantly talked about how we stood him up and wouldn't let it go after we had already apologized for the massive inconvenience.   So we manage to get into the con and me and my partner are trying to have a good time, since it was their first con I wanted to show her a good time, but I was also worried about trying to get John to interact with my partner aswell since at that time I considered him to be my best friend, but no matter how much we tried to engage him inconverssation, get him to at least walk besides us and not behind us, and tried to ask him if he was ok and if he wanted to look at specific stalls we would stop and look with him but he continuously ignored us.   A few days before my partner and I were togther and John called me and talked to me about one of my other friends (let's call her jess, she's important later so don't forget her) and tried to discuss her virginity and weather she had lost it or not and how he considers her to have lost it but she doesn't think she has and me and my partner both thought tgis was very insensitive and after telling him we don't like that he was trying to talk about Jess's private sex life he threw a fit and hung up, he tried calling again but we didn't answer.	1642904652.0	saisd6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saisd6/aita_for_calling_out_my_friend_the_way_i_did_for/	AITA for calling out my friend the way I did for his behaviour and how I handled the situation?
ix58m256	I work as a cashier in retail and having items either not ring up correctly or at all is common. Usually when something doesn’t ring up, I will by default put it in as 1.00$. I figure if this happens enough times, the store will learn to price things correctly. This woman shows up with her two, little girls who wanted to spend their gift-cards. The youngest was buying headphones that wouldn’t ring up so I marked them for 1$. For reasons I will never understand, the mother started ranting about the headphones being 50$ and proceeded to do so after I said the were on sale. Dumbfounded since customers usually argue about items costing less, I asked her if she wanted them to be 50$. At this point, both daughters were screaming at her to shut up whilst the mother insisted she didn’t want to rip off the store. Annoyed with her at this point, I change the price to 50$ and ask her if she’s happy. She then demands I cancel the order, tells me my actions aren’t okay and that she will call corporate. The oldest daughter apologizes profusely after she storms off, insisting her mother isn’t usually like that. What went wrong here?

3l1qt32y	The title may sound a bit confusing so let me explain. Also on mobile. My boyfriend and I have been living in this apartment complex for about 6 months and never had any issues with the laundry facilities until today. I also always time my clothes so I can be back there in a proper time frame.   So, after the washing cycle, bf and I transferred our clothes to the dryers and placed out money in (this is two loads, there were 4 other empty dryers) and we left to go cook dinner and come back. We left them there for an hour and a half maybe, which is pretty normal for our complex. One time i forgot them for longer and freaked but everything was fine.  However, this time as I entered the laundry room, someone had taken my wet clothes out of the dryer and placed them on the counter and put their laundry in. Keep in mind my clothes are SOAKED but theirs were not. I feel as if it’s safe to assume that they took my clothes out right after I left and replaced theirs so they could use the money I paid for the cycle. I was pissed. There was even a puddle of water outside of the dryer where i assume they either took mine out or placed theirs in. My boyfriends clothes were in the dryer beside it and his were dry. This was also not a large load, they should have dried fine if they went the entire cycle. Keep in mind there were 4 other empty driers this person could have used.  So, my boyfriend was pissed and removed their clothes and placed it in the empty trash bag in the room. They weren’t all the way dry but they weren’t soaked. I mentioned it may not be a good idea but he was mad and eventually I was angry. We also left a note on the dryer to let them know where their clothes were and to thank them for removing my wet clothes (passive aggressively), but now i’m wondering if we would get in trouble for it. I assume they stole my money, but it may have been wrong to place them in a trash bag. Was it safe to assume they took my money? Could i get in trouble?

ixaltv3d	My dad's fiancee is an educator, so she gets off work right around the time me and my brother get out of school.  My brother was unlocking the door to our house when I heard someone walking up to the door behind me, and I screamed.  I asked her what the hell she was doing at our house when our dad wasn't home, and she said that our dad had sent her there to watch over us.  I told her that we were older teens and that we could be left at home alone and that we'd done so for years and she just shrugged and said our dad sent her there.  She does really annoying things, like try to hug me and ruffle my hair and ask how my day was and yelling at me to do homework and taking away my phone when I get distracted.  I guess one plus is that she makes snacks for us, but other than that, it's all negative.  When I let slip that I had an important test tomorrow, she literally sat next to me and watched me study like a hawk.  I asked my dad again today why he made his girlfriend babysit us and if he pays her to do it and he said that we need an adult to watch over us and that she doesn't get paid.

8oelfsac	I (30F) was asked to be a bridesmaids for my old college friend (30F), we’ll call Amy. About 6 months before the wedding I had my first baby. I never let this impact my involvement in wedding activities. Her MOH planned a COVID friendly bachelorette weekend at an Air BnB, with a limo, private activities, etc. Amy was felt this was “lame”. The first weekend she came to visit new baby she talked about this & other wedding complaints nonstop. During the same visit, I was supplementing with formula and she asked me several times if this would negatively impact my bond with baby. I told her absolutely not, hoping she’d  get the hint this was an insensitive question. A few weeks later, custom shirts are being ordered for the bachelorette. Amy was paying for the shirts as a gift but her sister was ordering. Amy’s sister contacts the bridesmaids to say the shirts were more expensive than planned and suggests we split the extra cost. This sparked a nasty argument in the group. I contacted the sister privately and offered to pay the extra cost myself, and suggested we just not involve Amy in an effort to spare her from silly drama. The sister told anyway and my friend called me and thanked me. During this call she moved on to talking about her disappointment in the bachelorette again. For 2 hours. Then she mentioned one of the bridesmaids feels women who don’t breast feed are “terrible mothers” and she feared she would bring it up at the bachelorette. I told her i thought that was ridiculous and if it happened I would be offended. I was hurt and confused that breast feeding kept coming up with her. Later, when the shirts arrived in the mail the sister brought them to the MOH.  Amy felt since she bought them they should have been brought to her and she was very angry. I told Amy she was being unnecessarily hard on her friends and was starting to be really ungrateful. She exploded on me, and told me that I was a terrible friend and had “gone behind her back” by paying the extra fee for the shirts without telling her. She said I was not prioritizing our friendship, and was upset that she texts first more often and calls more often lately. She said she didn’t even want to go to her bachelorette bc everyone was being so inconsiderate of her as the bride. I got angry at her, and said I was adjusting to life with a newborn and doing my best.  I told her that I didnt see a reason to travel 6 hours way from my family for a bachelorette weekend she doesn’t want. She told me I had crossed a line, and I told her I was done and hung up. She mailed me an envelope of $200 to reimburse me for bachelorette expenses that I prepaid (I never asked for this). I told her this was petty. The day after getting this in the mail, my dad whom I was very close to died unexpectedly. When she heard the news, she only sent a text that said “my condolences”. After this, I had no further contact and I did not attend the bridal shower or wedding.

9tnchy8z	My husband is a very compassionate person, meaning he will do anything for the dogs as long as they ask him. We have a corgi and a keeshond, both around one year old, and those that know corgis know they know exactly how to get what they want. It's currently -30C in Canada (-22F) most days, and because the corgi loves going out in the snow, she demands for us to go out with them constantly. We have a fenced 1 acre land in the front of the house with a doggie door they can go in and out of at all times, meaning they get exercise that way already when they run and chase each other. My issue is, my husband or I take them on 1 hr walks outside in a long trail and THEN he takes them out again for sometimes 5 more times during the day for 15-20 minutes. Then when its "my turn" and I say its not necessary and that he needs to lean how to say no to the dogs he makes me feel like a bad dog mom because Im not bringing them when they ask. Am I crazy or is it not necessary to bring them out that often, especially when its that cold out and they already have that much land to play in whenever they want?

ixbczlef	A guy I was randomly chatting with told me this and I laughed.   He said that he didn't want to be with a woman who dates him for his job and income, even though he doesn't currently have one and lives at home, as he wants their love to be genuine.  I feel like it's just a fancy excuse for not putting in effort into making yourself decent partner material.  When I probed further, he said, "I'm not ashamed to say I am unemployed and make nothing right now. If anyone thinks less of me for that, I'll just avoid them. Life and finding a job is difficult."  He also said that if his partner were to make 100k and he were to make 20k, that she should pay for everything to bridge the income gap and to make him happy by sharing the burden.  Like, personally, if I were to to wear hoodies and sweatpants (as a girl) to future dates and use a similar argument of "I want to know you like me even when I'm not dressed up," how would that argument make sense?

f36wl48x	I use a throw away, because this situation is apparently embarrassing for me, so I would prefer not to be traced to my real account.  This started when I (24M) overheard some friends M (24M) and G (25M) talking about economics. I decided to join in, because one of them said the phrase “African immigrants,” which I thought was quite humorous, because it is an oxymoron.  I pointed this out, and they both just looked at me. G asked me do I know what an oxymoron is? And I answered yes, I think it is a contradictory phrase. G then asked me what was the contradiction? to which I responded that “immigrant” implies to leave ones country, and one doesn’t leave ones country when he or she goes from Africa to the other states. Then M asked me what had I meant by “other states”? I responded that I had been fairly certain that Africa was a state, and that if it was not then it would not make sense to say common terms like “African-American,” as then being African would not make you automatically American.  Indubitably the conversation devolved to M and G mocking me for having thought that Africa would be apart of the United States. It became particularly bad when M said that what I had said was stupid, which obviously angered me, so I told him to shut up, cursed him out, and then remarked that him being a knowitall was the reason why no one liked him. M and G became really defensive after I said that, therefore I have seen neither of them since the argument. Since then, all of our mutual friends have been phoning me and saying I was rude.  On one hand, I feel that I may have been a bit harsh on them. On another hand, I have always considered myself a considerably intelligent person, so I think it rude and dishonest for M to insinuate that I am stupid.

If you are unaware in my religion you are not permitted to do anything that harms you. This especially includes drugs and narcotics. Just today when my brother was out of his friends i went to check up on my lego set which is on our dresser. I pick it up to sadly see it broken. When i was looking at it i saw Cash’s apple watch box. In it i thought was his broken apple watch which every now and then i liked to inspect. When i opened the box i stood there in horror holding  pack of nicotine. I was frozen. I did t know what to think. When i we t to pray it was all i could think of.  During dinner i felt distant with him and vowed to stop it. For context i am very anti smoking to the point where i convinced to adults to quit and so far they have both been sober. But I’ve never done anything about underage smokers. Usually i just annoyingly tell them to stop in public while also telling them horror facts. But i knew it wouldn’t work on cash. I decided to investigate. After all maybe it was his friends. I checked around the room and found over 21 used packs of nicotine. He was an addict. Now im thinking of confronting him but i feel like a Butthole. So reddit, will i be the butthole if i confront him of vaping. More stuff i guessed of him vaping is one day he came back from school smelling like vapes and asking me if i think vapes are cool.

ixava3ma	So I (F 22) recently broke up with my s/o (M 23) and after voicing my concerns he said he had been wanting to break things up for a while as well. You can say it was a mutual thing and we are not just on talking terms but we are great friends. Mistakes were made on both sides. My issues are : He neglected me, stopped being romantic after a while, isn’t passionate about anything (inc me), can’t hold deep conversations or even intellectual ones and still isn’t open to me after 1 yr 5 mths of being together because he thinks being vulnerable is weak. Like I have received flowers only 4 times in 17 months. While I made him playlists and videos of us and texted him long paras about why I love him and appreciate him, he surprised me on my birthday last year. His issues are: I keep bringing up things that hurt me from the past, didn’t put myself before him and keep bringing up the fact he’s intellectually inferior.   While I have repeatedly told him my issues so that we can get over them, this was the first time he told me about my issues.  After the breakup, I was expecting him to make a grand gesture to win me back but he didn’t and instead asked for space. So I gave him space but he still wanted to FT every night. I said if you want to be friends, then we need to get acquainted with each other’s absence first.   So now finally, I have cut him off and We both decided not to talk to each other.   One day into not talking, he texts me that he wants me back and misses me.   I feel sooo bad for not texting back because I just want to take him back in a heartbeat but the thing is he has survived on doing the bare minimum for me and in the past 3-4 months had fallen below bare minimum. I understand cv and all but like you can have a relationship online as well.  Physical touch is the love language for both of us. But I adapted so why can’t he.  I feel like I deserve to be love and appreciated without having to beg and cry to every time.   Maybe I’m biased because I also have hurt him. I’m just realising it now.

386mg225	To be clear, I don't think they're an asshole - I just don't know how much of one I am.  I recently (two days ago) blocked all forms of communication between me and an abusive boyfriend. That night, this person contacted my parents on Facebook and told them a lot of extremely personal information that sent me into a mental breakdown. This happened at 11pm. My parents were calling me, making sure I was okay, questioning me about these things, etc. This ex also told them I would be attacked in my home that night.  Now, this person is on an ankle monitor, but it still freaked me the fuck out. Logic went out the window. I told my friend I was coming over and they told me not to, they were about to sleep. I should have stopped then, but I didn't. I hit my neighbor's car backing out (took care of it, no worries there. Goodbye $400.) and drove to my friend's place. Nearly wrecked on the way due to some black ice. I got there and they were asleep. Understandably. I don't fault them for any of this.  I spent the next hour panicking on their porch. Threw up a bit. Texted them 'sorry' a bunch of times, overall was just pretty pathetic. Left at 1am after calming down and feeling comfortable enough to drive. Yeah, it was stupid late too - both of our schedules are very irregular though, if that means anything. I've gone over there to hang out at 12am before, not an insane time for us.  Today they won't respond to my texts or calls. I actually haven't heard from them past when they said they would call me in a bit, right before I left for their place. They never called. They aren't hanging up on me - the calls time out. I can't tell if they're looking at my messages. It's entirely possible they're busy, or asleep. They are asleep a lot of the time. They also don't check their phone much, really. So I don't know, but I'm worried they're angry. They're my only friend. It's just a lot going on right now.  TLDR: Panic-drove over to my friend's house at 12am even though they said not to, they were asleep. Left after an hour and now I haven't been able to get in touch with them at all.	1642906783.0	sajgef	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajgef/aita_for_driving_to_my_friends_house_without/	AITA for driving to my friend's house without permission?
exlrp40i	I am a 45 year old Christian woman who is a mother to 7 children. I have a 16 year old daughter who is an absolute sweetheart. My family and I love and praise God in our household. Especially my 16 year old. Unfortunately, she started dating a boy who doesn’t go to church. Since I care about her happiness, I decided to tolerate this.   She has been with this boy for a year now and things were going well until I received a call from the boy’s mother. This woman was not speaking like a Christian. She was cursing me out because my daughter was pregnant and the baby would be coming in about 2 weeks. I was shocked because I did not know she was pregnant. My daughter is very thin, you would never suspect that she is pregnant. I did not even know she was having sex. She promised me that she would never have sex before marriage.   I confronted my daughter about this. I expressed how hurt I was because she hid this from me for this long. I wasn’t angry because of her sin, God forgives all sins. He will love her no matter what. I was not angry about the pregnancy either. Children are blessings. I was angry that she hid this from me. I felt hurt. My daughter was furious with me for feeling hurt. She told me that her pregnancy wasn’t anyone’s business and she was not obligated to tell me. Her boyfriend agreed with me and told me that his mom and I were awful for being angry about this being hidden. My other children (they also didn’t know) agreed with them and think I’m being horrible. As her mother, I think that I deserved to know about this. Am I the a-hole for how I responded to my daughter hiding her pregnancy from me?	1642907426.0	sajnsp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajnsp/aita_for_how_i_reacted_to_my_daughter_hiding_her/	AITA for how I reacted to my daughter hiding her pregnancy from everyone?
ixbwrlat	This is my first time doing one of these so I don't really know the functions. I am a normal person with some interest in gaming and the usual stuff for my age range. That's not important right now, I wanna discuss something to get off my chest for a while: my gf. Our relationship is good and she has made me feel happy while I can't say I've been the perfect boyfriend I tried my best to at least make up my flaws. Sometimes I feel she doesn't care about me at times, once we got in a fight because I believed that both genders should be equal while she wanted me to accept that "women should rule the world". This is not her first time as she also at times of rage blamed me for all her suffering and stated "I should just die". Before you think anything else, she came from a bad home with people who didn't give any care for her and was always bullied. She's jealous of my life and blames me for just existing and expects me to apologize because of it. At times when I did something wrong I always wanted to make up for my mistakes but she acts like I'm the evil one by manipulating her. When I want to talk about my problems she claims "in one ear and out the other", at times I cry and when I explain she refers to me as a woman because "I'm not masculine". She has suffered a lot in her years up to a point where gunshots and screams barely phase her. Thanks to this she is suicidal and refuses to get help as nobody there cares. However she treats me like a pawn and tells me how it's all my fault that she's suffering that I'm a "spoiled brat" because of my parents(I got really pissed when she said that) then I got fed up and called her out. She didn't care the least and used it as an excuse to cut because I made her feel terrible and should apologize for being an annoying brat. At times I feel she just uses me as a punching bag while thinking I'm the evil one and always made mistakes. It does feel like that but at the same time a part of me wants her to apologize for her wrongs aswell but she brushes my issues off. She's a good person, I know she's better but treating me like sh*t and blaming me because of my life isn't something I brush off. Am I the a**hole for being like this?	1642907622.0	sajq15	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajq15/aita_for_being_like_this/	AITA for being like this?
a6lan71m	 I 18f, have had issues with my father my whole life. I am not going to discuss every issue we’ve had because we could be here forever but i will talk about the more recent points. He was absent while growing up and due to lack of outside help, I helped raise all three of my siblings. 5 years ago, he retired from work and stayed home. But it has been awful ever since. My family fully believes he is a narcissist. When we were broke, and couldn’t afford food, flea treatments for my dog, and we even had no hot water, he stashed money behind our backs to buy guns because he basically views them as toys.   Me and him have had issues for years because of things like this. Me raising his kids alongside my mom while going through high school with all AP classes, work, and other commitments. He has screamed at me many times because he doesn’t like that his kids listen to me more than they do him.  Recently, a month ago, I finally had enough. Me, my mom, and my sisters all contracted COVID and while we were still upkeeping the home and making 7 course meals for christmas eve he refused to talk to us or even help. He never even asked anyone how they were doing. He didn’t even say Merry Christmas on eve or the actual day to ANYONE, keep in mind the youngest is 10. he literally napped all day and only came out for food. On christmas eve he threw a closed container of dip on my mom and it went everywhere. they started screaming and kids were crying and i was stuck trying to get them out and settle everything.  Then on New year’s eve, we found out that he was talking to his family and friends about how awful we treat him and how we don’t deserve the money he makes, which he gets through social security for being on disability. He completely dragged us through the dirt and has been for years, so now i know why my family never called me or even bothered getting to know me. He completely ruined any chance at having a relationship with my grandmother and uncle, who are literally the only family we have left. he has talked so badly about us for years and it has resulted in them literally hating us. I’ve watched my sisters cry for weeks about feeling like they no longer have a father anymore and although i do my best to fill that gap, i know it’s not the same.  my mom is planning on divorcing him and I haven’t spoken to him for over a month. the last time we spoke he called me a “disrespectful little bitch” and threatened me. But just for full transparency , i did fully cussed him out that night and said some pretty nasty things because i couldn’t take it anymore. I went as far to take him off social media and haven’t spoken to him since the fight on new year’s eve. I recognize that he is my father but i fully intend on cutting him out of my life. Am i going too far? Should i apologize? I honestly don’t know what to do. Am i being disrespectful? am i poking him too much? Am i the asshole?	1642908041.0	sajugx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajugx/aita_for_not_speaking_to_my_father_for_a_month/	AITA for not speaking to my father for a month?
9gku16q7	My (29F) husband (30M) and I met in college so we have a lot of mutual friends. One girl who was in my sorority, let’s call her Cassie, has been friends with my husband, who we’ll call Will, for about 10 years. I’ve been with my husband a total of 6 years.   When he and I first started dating, we took a trip with some friends and Cassie. I knew that Cassie liked Will at the beginning of college, but he had zero feelings for her. One night on this trip Cassie got really drunk and started yelling at Will in front of everyone because he wouldn’t date her. I was standing right next to her and I didn’t even know how to respond and I don’t think he knew what to say either. Ever since that night that has always stuck in the back of my head. I don’t care that she was drunk, it was uncalled for and disrespectful.   Fast forward to present day and Cassie moved back to the city we live in due to work. She has some friends in the area but I noticed that she asks Will to do literally everything together. I’m talking 2 tickets to a movie, 2 tickets to a play, going to sporting events, going to the bar and more. Some of that sounds like a date, right? He even said someone they met while at a game assumed she was his wife. He shut that down. I know that he goes because they’re friends and that’s what friends do. I’m 110% cool with him hanging out with other female friends and I encourage him to go out with his friends all the time, but this specific person is starting to bother me.   One thing I should add is that she has a really hard time with dating. She’ll talk to guys but they don’t want to date her, they ghost her, etc. She’s a very loud personality with crazy partying habits and my husband’s friends have made comments on how they’re turned off being around her. I talked to my best friend about this and she said that Cassie might be projecting her desire to be in a relationship onto her guy friends, which at the moment seems to be my husband.   He keeps asking me to come along when they do stuff even when it involves other people. I keep saying no to doing stuff with her around and I say it’s because I’m busy with work, errands, prior commitments and more. These things are mostly true except for times when I’m actually not doing anything and I’m saying no just to say no. My husband has been asking me why I am not going out and doing stuff with them and I really don’t want to be rude and say it’s because she’s around. That moment a few years ago when she had a drunken outburst at him for not dating her will not leave my mind. I know it has been years since the “incident” so I’m questioning if I’m still valid in feeling this way.   So WIBTA if I told my husband the real reason I don’t want to hang out with Cassie around and request that he not do a lot of the “date” type stuff with her?	1642908689.0	sak1n3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sak1n3/wibta_if_i_told_my_husband_the_real_reason_i_dont/	WIBTA if I told my husband the real reason I don’t want to hang out with his friend?
gffh8ber	Okay so, Im a 27 year old female and I have had this male follower on Instagram for around a year, maybe more.   He had a insta name on Instagram that was something along the lines of “Native American Indian blank blank” and he and I ended up saying hello and a small introduction on PM shortly after he began following me.   After He began following me and I him, we liked each other’s memes and other funny/political posts. Normal stuff. This goes on for most of the first year.  All is well.    He hits me up a few months later on PM and says some compliments about my looks. I thank him and end the conversation.   I notice he has never posted a pic of himself and I don’t think much of it, maybe he wants to keep his face offline, understandable.   after I liked some of his posts and began following him, he would occasionally like a lot of my pics and videos and leave nice comments. I thought he was flirting, so I decided to keep it simple and platonic and just kinda laugh it off.  Well one thing led to another and everything I would post he would like it all as soon as I would post it.  I thought he may have a crush on me but, I don’t really feel anything for him at all, mainly because I don’t know what he looks like, know him really well or anything like that and you never know on the internet, ya know?  🤷🏻‍♀️   Some more time goes by and he tells me he is Native American Indian (like me) and we open up a bit to each other, nothing intimate or sexual whatsoever. Just basic information about one another. He tells me a bit about his family and I him. Nothing serious.  Well recently he had been PM messaging me every day and always asking about me and how I was doing.   We got to talking and he told me he had to confess to me that he wasn’t Native American at all but Indian and living in India 🇮🇳.   Now this made me feel super uncomfortable, because he lied to me and I just laughed it off and said something like oh that’s okay 👍 cool or whatever.   Well now he is asking me to FaceTime and do some sort of Instagram live together to get to know one another better and I don’t feel comfortable doing that. Like…not at all. Because he lied to me and I feel also super uncomfortable talking to him now.    He is nice and all and I truly don’t want anything other than a friendly interaction like I have had with him in the past. I don’t want to FaceTime and I don’t feel comfortable really talking to him very much anymore. I have kept the conversations as short as humanly possible and he’s asked me now 4-5 times to FaceTime and I keep saying I’ll think about it and that I’m not comfortable.  Am I the asshole because i don’t want to and feel uncomfortable?	1642909656.0	sakcih	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakcih/aita_i_dont_want_to_facetime_or_anything_like/	AITA I don’t want to FaceTime or anything like that with a guy that kinda lied to me?
ixdc0a78	My boyfriend recently moved into an apartment with one of his close girl friends and her boyfriend. I have issue with this whatsoever because I trust all of them. One week her boyfriend wasn’t there and it was just my boyfriend and her in the apartment and my boyfriend and I were playing Valorant and I heard her in the back. I asked him is she on your bed and he got quiet and didn’t reply… so I asked again and he said yes and he didn’t say anything else because she was there and I’m guessing he didn’t want to make it awkward for her??? He started texting me and I said how it basically wasn’t cool that both him and her did that and he stated how he didn’t see a problem with what was going on and that’s simply how she is. I tried speaking to him multiple times about her behavior and how it personally makes me feel uncomfortable and that he needs to set boundaries with her. Whenever I bring up this conversation I feel as if he genuinely doesn’t listen to me and immediately gets defensive with me and tries to defend her because he said he doesn’t want to make things weird. I’m not asking him to have a big dramatic sit down with her I’m just asking whenever she does something out of pocket to tell her to relax and to make sure to set boundaries because at the end of the day “she won’t know if it isn’t said”. There’s been other things that have been done but this was the tipping point for me. We also had a birthday dinner for him and I and she would not stop asking to be by him or telling everyone that’s her friend to the point where everyone at the dinner mentioned it to me one by one. I’m overall embarrassed but I don’t know if I’m the right or not. I’m not asking him to cut her off by any means but just to set boundaries.	1642909774.0	sakdoj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakdoj/aita_for_feeling_this_way/	AITA for feeling this way?
ixc251lp	I have a coworker named Jon.  He would help out all of the college age new girls or interns for years.  Buy them coffee or lunch and seem like a nice guy.  He did this with all the girls.   Everyone said he was just nice.  He was in his 30’s while most of these girls was in there 20’s.    Jon hit the jackpot with an intern Jamie a few years ago and they started dating. Then engages she left the company last year.  I saw her come in as a client and she stopped by to say hi to Jon.  They are still together and engaged.  I told Jamie she wasn’t that special and Jon still talks to all the girls in the office.   Jamie accused me of being jealous of Jon because he’s a nice guy and I trying to be a “nice guy”   She complained about me to hr because she’s a client now she thinks she can just be that bitch.     I got called into my manager’s office and said Jon is like that to everyone and often goes out with the guys from work to grab beers.  I said I’m sorry I’m not in Jon’s circle but I still feel like it’s gross how he buys the interns coffee and he’s still a player.	1642909550.0	sakbcw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakbcw/aita_for_calling_jon_a_player/	AITA for calling Jon a player?
b7yh5g4g	Myself [35f] and my friend "M" [35f] have been sister-friends since middle school. I moved away, got married, and we grew apart. I moved back to the area during my divorce and tried to rekindle our friendship. It was tough because we worked different schedules.   Turns out M developed a mild drinking problem. She was arrested for DUI in 2016. Early 2019, her SO left then she became a full alcoholic. She lost her job for showing up to work still drunk. She could not get an apartment because she was out of work, behind on payments, and broke. I let her stay as my guest so she could get back on her feet. However, she was still drinking behind my back and I had to boot her out before my landlord became privy. She moved into her aunt's house as a last resort. Her drinking got far worse at her aunt's house. I teamed up her immediate family to convince her to check into a in-patient rehab. She has always refused, saying she can just go to AA because "it's not that bad." From Jul 2020 to Jan 2021, she was hospitalized on and off for late-stage liver+kidney failure, jaundice, and a descended abdomen. Her family arranged a free in-patient rehab program. It took many hours but she eventually agreed to go since we were not taking "no" for an answer. Her immediate family and myself agreed on outside consequences to her drinking since her health was not enough. Everyone wrote her letters begging her to get help and outlining new consequences if she refused. **The consequence from me was she would not be a part of my life when she chooses to drink.** I was not sure what else to do at the time since all my begging for her to get help fell on deaf ears. She was at the rehab program only a few days before she had to go back to the hospital. The rehab program said they are not equipped to deal with patients that sick and she could come back when her health improved. She went to a couple AA meetings then started drinking again within a month. Her aunt found out and kicked her out for breaking her sobriety stipulation + same story with other friends. I have kept her removed from my life but have kept up with her immediate family about her status. M's mom told me recently that she has not had a drink in about eight months, was approved for a liver transplant, and misses me. I do not feel ready to have her back in my life since:  A) I am not sure how long her sobriety will last, and  B) I am currently working on fixing myself.  I feel completely selfish for focusing on myself — like I have abandoned my friend. AITA for cutting her out of my life even though she's allegedly sober now?  Tldr; my best friend of 24+ years has been an alcoholic for years and I removed her from my life as a consequence for her drinking and to focus on my own issues.

isyebnu5	I (17M) live in a very liberal town in the United States thus you get to see a lot of LGBTQ+ people around here. I have no problems against them and I respect their preferences but I am completely straight and would never date any of them just because I'm only interested in girls. Anyways I just got back from winter break last week and I started talking to this girl (17 MTF) that was new to my school, and I could tell she was being flirty with me so I follow through. I had been talking with her for about a week until she told me she used to be a boy and she came out in middle school and since then she has always refered to herself with she/her pronouns. I'm not gonna lie, when I heard that I immediately lost any bit of interest in having a romantic relationship with her and I stopped flirting with her or showing any interest. I still talk to her respectfully and friendly but I've tried to show I was not interested on her. She continued flirting with me though so I decided to avoid her and be cold because I felt kinda awkward just thinking that I was flirting with someone that used to be a guy. Later on I got a text from her calling me a transphobic because I was avoiding her just because she is trans and I've been wondering, AITA for losing interest in a girl after she said she is trans?

92ziiouy	please keep in my mind this post is a little on the longer side and it might be very heavy content wise.   to start off i (15f) have had a relatively okay relationship with my parents until moving to a new city. during the 6th grade we moved to a new city and everything did a 180, or at least i thought. in reality i was blind to the abuse my father put me through. my father has been gaslighting me and i feel so conflicted as to how to feel about him. sometimes he’s so nice to me and other times he’s terrible.   one example occurred just last weak. my parents had gone out for something and left me and my twin (15f) at home. 10 min after they left somebody knocked on our door and, obviously, we didn’t open it. well when looked through the peep-hole, it was one of my parents friend (we have met before) but i still didn’t open the door purely because i felt uncomfortable being alone with them. i wouldn’t know how to talk to them.   i called my dad (this was before i knew it was family friends) and told him somebody was knocking. after finding out it was family friends, i told him so and he got mad at me for not opening the door. i quote he said “i’m not mad i’m just shocked at how dumb you are”  things like this his have happened for years. he’s repeatedly denied saying these kind of things. he’ll yell scream and throw tantrums when he’s upset with me and then when he comes back he’ll act like nothing happened.   part of me thinks i might be the butt because i’m ungrateful or overreacting. so reddit AITA?	1642909907.0	sakf5s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakf5s/aita_for_hating_my_parents/	AITA for hating my parents

47f3xvkm	During a snow storm I parked in the garage at work. When I got back to my car it had been t-boned. There was no note on the car but the garage has 24/7 surveillance. I filed a claim with my insurance company and they processed it as a hit and run. I called the parking office and they said they'd review the security footage. The insurance appraiser said the damage will be several thousand dollars to repair.  Three days later the parking office called and said they found the surveillance footage of the accident and have the name of the person that hit my car. They said the person that hit my car showed the parking office a picture of a note on my windshield but there was no note on my windshield. They also said the person that hit my car wanted to pay me out of pocket, not file an accident report, and not go through insurance. I said that I contacted my insurance company as soon as I saw my t-boned car and already filed an accident report. The parking office said I have to make the decision of how to proceed because the person that hit me is a nice person. I said the person that hit my car did several thousand dollars worth of damage and should have left the note at the parking office if they actually wanted to get in touch with me before I filed a hit and run insurance claim.

7i3rte4x	I have a history of eating disorders, so this is a topic close to my heart. On Friday my heath teacher gave us an assignment to do over the weekend, we’re supposed to use MyFitnessPal and track our calories and fitness, show pictures of everything we ate that week and fill out a form that includes what we weigh. Now, I don’t think there’s anything inherently wrong with these things and can be helpful to some people, what I have an issue with it’s is that she never talked about how to avoid an ED and how to be safe about all this before she assigned this homework. Most of the kids in my school (especially girls) likely have insecurities about their weight and what they eat, this assignment could be the start of something dangerous. I talked to my teacher during class and asked her to hold off of the assignment until she could talk about this issue, and she refused and said there’s nothing to worry about. I got really upset and yelled that she was fucking stupid and left the class. It’s the weekend now so I haven’t heard anything from the school but I’m sure they’ll want to talk on Monday, my friends think I was out of line, was I?	1642910811.0	sakp98	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakp98/aita_for_yelling_at_my_teacher_over_an_assignment/	AITA for yelling at my teacher over an assignment I think is risky?
dqeyrttv	So my friend, let’s call her B has always been kind of toxic in my opinion. She gets really frustrated when people don’t want to do things her way. I’ve wanted to cut her off for a while but can’t find a way to do it because we have so many classes together and our family’s are friends. We were playing video games earlier and she asked if I wanted to do some homework with her. I said, “Yeah maybe later” (I procrastinate a lot and have a hard time focusing). B then went on a rant about how I never do work and she doesn’t get why I “don’t just do it.” I got kind of annoyed and tried to explain to her how I have a really hard time focusing and it’s very difficult to stay on task or even start the work for that matter. She then said, “It’s not that hard, you just open up your laptop and do it. You don’t even try.” I got really hurt by this because I’ve been struggling with this issue for a while. I quickly said I was going to go and then hung up, and haven’t talked to her since. Am I overreacting?  TLDR:  I procrastinate a lot and struggle with it.

ixdbr2i8	I (34f) live with my husband (35m). Our bed is medium sized enough for both me and my husband to sleep together on it, but not enough for both of us to sprawl out on it.   So a week ago my husband left on a work trip, he said he would be back in a week, so for a week I got to spread out in the bed, on the sixth night my husband got back home it was around 1-2am when he got back.   When I woke up the next day I found him sleeping on the couch, I didn’t wake him up immediately, when he woke up I asked why he was sleeping on the couch. He said when he came home he found me sleeping sprawled out on our bed, he said he didn’t want to wake me up so he slept on the couch. Our couch isn’t that large just big enough for him to sleep on it and have his body on it.   I told him I felt like I kicked him off the bed and how it made me feel. He said don’t worry about it and it’s okay. But I still feel really bad about it.

ixe9xoys	Basically the title. Ex and I split back in Oct when our son was 6 weeks d because I had extreme cramping and bleeding to the point where I would pass out. I went to hospital and was told I had an std. My at the time husband tried to convince me I must've got it from my midwife not cleaning herself properly (rediculous). I point blank said he wasn't welcome in my home until he told the truth. (The house is in my name and I have paid for 100% of it).   He finally admitted that he'd started having an affair with on of his students at the University while I was pregnant(my pregnancy was high risk due to my age -41 - so my Dr recommended no sex after 34 weeks). He justified it by saying that it was unreasonable for me to expect him to go without sex for "months".   I ended up kicking him out and we ate now going through court to settle custody of our son. Over New years I visited my ex in laws so they could see our son and my ex mil took me aside and asked how I wasn't ashamed for giving her son an std. I quickly set the story straight and showed her evidence proving what had actually happened.   My ex is now having a meltdown because his parents have kicked him out over him lying to them. He is blaming me for "running my mouth" aita for settle the record straight with his mum?	1642911611.0	saky51	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saky51/aita_for_telling_my_ex_mil_that_my_ex_cheated_on/	AITA for telling my ex mil that my ex cheated on me and gave me an std 5 weeks after I gave birth to our son?
fqs32m5h	I (24F) have a new roommate (23F) who I don’t talk to very often. She’s out of the house 90% of the day as she’s a law student, and I stay in my room 91% of the day as I study and work from home.   The few times we do talk however, usually talks devolve into unpleasantry and before I know it, she’s either calling me crazy or insulting my mother, who she’s never met or spoken to. It steadily built up to the mother insult, though. First, she began by insulting just me.   I’ve asked her multiple times to stop, all to fall on deaf ears. We only talk for household related issues. I don’t really want to stoop to the title, but I feel like I have to stand up for myself. I also have a lot of trauma from my abusive family so to move out and also have to deal with it in the “real world” is also really depressing/infuriating.

ixbq9wu0	When I was 10 years old I went to spend the summer with my grandmother. On my last weekend in town I asked her if I could have a party for my friends. She said, "yes" but I need to clean the basement before the party.   The next day my aunt (who lived in my grandmother's basement) told my Grandmother that there was water everywhere and that someone had unplugged the freezer. My grandmother made me clean up the mess. I spent most of the day cleaning and throwing away food and when I finally got to the bottom of the freezer I found a cardboard box. I opened it up expecting to find some kind of old food and instead I found money...and there was a ton of it.   I looked at the box and noticed a set of initials on the box which were my grandmother initials. Confused I took the box to my Aunt and she told me to ask my grandmother who was equally as confused and took the box from me and told me.   The next day my Uncle (who has the same initials as my grandmother) came over and pulled me to the side. He told me that the money was for my cousin (his son) and I was to never tell him about it.  My Uncle and my cousin always had a strained relationship and I never knew why. One day while I was visiting my cousin other grandmother we were talking and she told me that people always thought she was the reason for the division between them but it was because he promised him $25 000 when he graduated from high school.  After talking to my Uncle about not telling my cousin about the money my Uncle placed the money back in the freezer thinking it was going to be safe not knowing that the first person i told about the money was my Aunt. My family had always told the story of my Aunt taking money from my Uncle and using it to buy crack fueling her drug addiction but I never associated the story with the money I had found in the freezer until years later.  My Uncle passed away a few years ago and no one ever knew until recently how my Aunt discovered the money. It took my uncle years to forgive my aunt from stealing from him and he never told his son about why he didnt deliver the $25 000 he had promised him. I'm not planning on telling my cousin about the stolen money because it may bring up old feeling he has about my Uncle.	1642911602.0	sakxzw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakxzw/aita_for_not_telling_my_cousin_why_his_father/	AITA for not telling my cousin why his father didnt give him $25,000 for his graduation?
7we44uo4	I'm really gonna cut to the chase because I'm just going crazy and I need help as soon as possible.  So I had this friend for like a long time and he was one of my closest friends, he's Bi and I'm straight.  So one day this friend uploads an Insta story about his favorite people in the world and I wasn't in it and I jokingly answered him "Damn, you did me wrong fam" and I don't remember but then he said something along the lines "That's because you haven't let me suck you off".  We start this whole ordeal of exchanges about what is pretty much like 2 boys organizing a day to recieve a blowjob. We reached to a point where I was thinking this all in my head and started getting paranoic if he really wanted to give me a blowjob (Thing I thought was a joke and didn't actually want)  So I just simply said (\*Insert friend name\* is this still a joke, I'm not really sure if we are joking anymore and I gotta know) and he said he was serious, then I went on about why I don't want a blowjob from him and he went on about how it's not any different to a girl giving me a blowjob and that I could like it and that it's something he wanted, etc, etc.  I cut off his relationship and we didn't talk for like a good month and a half.  He has texted me today asking me to meet him in person so he could apologize, and when I was starting to embrace the idea of a good talk I said "I feel it's too awkward" and just before I was about to send a "But it's fair, so let's meet for at least one last time to talk" he started plainly texting messages that felt were pretty much gaslighting. "It was just a joke jeez, can't you take a joke?" or "Are you seriously going to ruin our year lasting relationship over a damn prank?" and I had it, we exchanged some pretty heavy text messages which ended with me asking him for some minutes to get my ideas in order.  I don't know what to do I honestly don't know and I feel trapped in this, so I've came to the last place I ever thought would recur, this subreddit.  What do you think? please I need some answers because I feel I can't think of something.	1642911931.0	sal1tn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sal1tn/aita_for_cutting_off_someone_from_my_life_for_a/	AITA for cutting off someone from my life for "a prank"
3acyssol	Yeah, the title basically says it all. This post flips the usual script found on this sub, in that I feel like I’m being a major asshole but none of my family or immediate peers agree with that assessment.   I’m a fifteen-year-old transgender girl.   Back in 2019, my Dad and Step-mom won a 14 day vacation to an island in the Caribbean, scheduled for June 2020. Due to pandemic shenanigans, it was rescheduled several times (first to June ‘21, then to June ‘22).   I was initially roped into going with them, which was all well and good until I came out as trans and decided to do a bit of research into the laws on the island we were going to. Turns out, being queer is illegal on that island, and it isn’t uncommon for people like me to be killed by locals. As you can probably imagine, this prospect is mildly terrifying (as I would prefer not to spend time in some Caribbean jail cell and/or be killed for something that is totally out of my control).   Of course, on an intellectual level, I understand that nobody there has to know who and what I am, therefore I would be in very little danger. The issue is that “lizard brain” part of me that will constantly have me looking over my shoulder, expecting that each breath will be my last. That kind of stress does not make for a fun vacation.   I put my foot down and told my parents that I wouldn’t be going, and that I wanted them to go without me. They were a bit confused and angry with me until I explained my reasoning, but they quickly saw and agreed with my logic and feel that I shouldn’t go if the trip is going to be that bad. I’ve talked to some other family members, friends, and my therapist, and they all agreed that I made the right call. I just can’t shake the feeling that I’m acting like a spoiled, ungrateful brat. So, AITA?  Apologies for any spelling and/or grammatical errors, it’s late and I’m tired. Generally I’m far more eloquent in my writing.	1642912388.0	sal6ti	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sal6ti/aita_for_refusing_to_go_on_a_family_vacation/	AITA for refusing to go on a family vacation?
4rtqw5vq	I (20F) and my ex (20M) broke up back in September. We dated for 4 months, and I will admit that it was rushed.  I will give my ex credit for telling me that he is extremely detached in relationships, which I thought wasn't too big of a deal. I'm a very expressive person, so being with someone who is so opposite of me made me insecure. I didn't want to feel like I was overwhelming him, so I kept my distance regardless of how many times he told me it was okay. It got to the point where he even told me that he'll, "never understand how much you [I] care about others," Furthermore, he would constantly criticize my behaviors and actions, telling me that I needed to be better and that he was frustrated with me. I have severe ADHD, have been unmedicated my entire life and never received CBT or alternatives, so I was constantly forgetting things, making rash decisions, and always had horrible timing.   Fast forward to September. Right before we broke up, he told me about his list of concerns about me and why he thinks we won’t last much longer. However, he was unsure if he wanted to breakup. I asked how I could help, and he said he didn’t know. I ended up giving him a few days. No contact. Two days later, I was with friends and happened to check my phone. There was a text from him. He knew he wouldn’t have enough time for a relationship with his schedule, and that there would be resentment between us because of that if the relationship continued.  In the moment, I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I just didn’t reply, I reacted. My initial reaction was to laugh, then cry. With that, I decided to give myself some time before revisiting the text. I didn’t know how to respond. How does someone respond to that without being "toxic," or "overly emotional?" Every time I revisited the text after that day, I still had no appropriate way to respond. I had no words.  5 months later, I still have no words. All I do know is that his reasons for not wanting a relationship, and ending it, have left me scarred. Hence why I never responded.  It’s not like I can— a few weeks ago I FINALLY deleted the texts from and contact associated with him. Why'd it take me so long? Part of me wants to believe it’s because I wanted to respond appropriately. Most of me, however, knows it’s because I never had the courage to. And honestly, I have no intention of responding. At least to him. (Even though one could say this post is my response, a reaction rather.)  I can see why I’d be the asshole: the silent treatment is never a good response. People need closure. I'm also a recovering people-pleaser who always feels the need to explain myself or provide a response.

a1uedn8w	So, for context, my family jokes inappropriately on a consistent basis, so what I said would not have hurt anyones feelings in my house…  My wife (f49) is having her friend over (f48-50?) and they don’t see each other often (especially this last couple of years)  They had arranged to spend the weekend together, but her friend’s husband was not able to keep their son (m17), so he came with her. No problem there, he is friends with our kids as well.  We were sitting at the table playing dominos while the kids were playing ForkKnife or the one with blocks.  My son and her son come out and want one of us to spin the wheel so they can play Twister, and I respond with “F  off, we are having adult time” in an obviously semi-joking manor. They went back to playing video games and we resumed our game of Dominos.  Later, my wife tells me that I really upset her friend by talking to her kid that way. I reminded her that I have joked around with him in the past and it has never offended him, plus I was just trying to make sure they could talk without kids around.

ixelovaa	I never thought I'd make a post like this about such a thing but here I am! I feel like I've been literally gaslit into thinking I did something wrong but now I'm actually wondering if I actually did.  In short, I've recently started a habit where I just block people's numbers (or social media if that's how they contact me) if they say something I don't know how to respond to. At first I was just doing it with my mom because she gets on my nerves a lot, but I realized that doing so made me a lot less anxious (self-diagnosed) about trying to figure out what to respond to ppl, so I started doing it with other people. Now I don't have to see a person's unopened message/message I leave on read, and I unblock them once we get the chance to talk irl or if it's been a few days. It has been super helpful to my mental health because I'm not too outspoken and don't want to accidentally say something too hypercritical and end up in drama with someone just because I said something wrong.  But alas my life sucks! I am now having "drama" or "beef" (idkwf word y'all use for it anymore) with my roommate because of my coping mechanism. I tried doing this on my roommate because she said she had some heavy stuff she needed to let out, and we'd just be able to talk once she got back to our apartment a few hours later. When she came back to our apartment, she was super pissed that I left her on read and she apparently sent multiple messages after while I was blocking her (I couldn't see them ofc). I explained how I was trying it as a coping mechanism, and she said that I was being selfish and that I "can't block people out in the real world." I was still unapologetic but I told her I wouldn't do it again... but then LITERALLY the next day she sends the same sort of message so I block her again. She KNEW that she couldn't talk to me about that stuff over text because of my anxiety. She came back to our apartment crying because her professor had said some not-very-kind things to her and it was just a breaking point for her and she felt low af. I told her I understood but that she needed to regard MY feelings as well. She told me I'm a !horrible friend and roommate! in the most embarrassing, middle school cliche way and then stormed out. We aren't on speaking terms (this happened just yesterday). I know she has struggles but she can't use me as the president of the feelings forum when I didn't ask to be elected.

a0sadfay	So my gf and I were talking about how she doesn’t like how the way her hair was done and that the lady who did it didn’t do what she asked for. She started to talk fast and rant about it and then goes “why can’t I ever get what I ask for? I don’t get the hair I wanted, I don’t get the boyfriend I wanted” this really threw me off guard and I pushed away and said that “are you serious? if that’s what you think of me I’m just gonna go home then” and then she was like ok and went on her phone. I sat there for a little bit before bringing up what just happened and stood by what she said cause it was a joke. Am I overreacting?

wefxaz0	 A recent friend(within the past couple months) asked me to go to coffee. We talk at least every week, and we share a lot of interests. My friends said he was asking me on a date, but it seems platonic to me. I'm a lesbian, so I'm definitely not interested. He said, "this might be out of the blue, but you seem really cool, do you want to go get coffee or something sometime," My friends say it's clearly a date, and if I accept I'd be leading him on, and taking advantage of his feelings for free coffee.

ixf8cj59	Hi, I am a gay guy that just turned 18. I recently broke up with my boyfriend (lets call him H) and I am feeling so bad.   What happened is that our relationship was a secret since we were still in the closet. We were planning to come out the same day to our parents. He was going to come out to his, and I to mine and then we were going to meet up at a cafeteria.   The day arrived and his parents were very supportive. I am incredibly happy to know that he can now me himself. However, mine weren’t like that. They got very mad at me and told me that if I continued dating H, they would kick me out and won‘t pay for my college. I was very devastated because I really love H, but I can’t give up on my education. I want to be a doctor and I would never be able to pay for it myself, let alone find a place to live in.    It was so hard for me but they were demanding for an answer so I just said yes. At that moment I thought maybe we could continue dating in secret but they said that they were going to have people see if I try to do that. They said that if they found out I was seeing H they would proceed with what they initially stated.   I left the house to have some fresh air and meet with H at the cafeteria. When I told him what happened we both cried. I could see he was affected a lot but he told me to  think of myself and my future only. He said he wasn’t going to resent me so I decided I was going to listen to them. We had one last date and it ended.   Of course I was sad so I called one of our mutual friends to have some company. I told her what happened and I just wanted someone to tell me things were going to be okay. But she was very mad at me. Told me I was a massive asshole for choosing my parents over my boyfriend. I told her I wasn’t choosing my parents, I was choosing my future but she wouldn’t listen. She left shortly after so now I can’t help but wonder if what I did was really that bad. My heart aches and I can’t think properly right now so I have no idea.	1642913826.0	salm5s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salm5s/aita_for_choosing_to_break_up_with_my_boyfriend/	AITA for choosing to break up with my boyfriend because my parents don’t approve of us?
92h36aot	So there is this guy (Owen) who I’ve known for a couple of years and he’s always been an asshole to me and my friends, ( making rumours about me and telling my friends rumours about me, he has basically ruined my reputation to my school and he has done worse) and he’s gotten me reported for sending a meme in a group that me and my friends had. And I wanted to do it to him too, so I reported him a couple times for some messed up things he said. I couldn’t let his friend (Josh) know about it because josh would get all of his friends to spam report me to get my account terminated. About two days later me and my friends are in a ps party with josh (josh has me blocked because of some drama that happened) and one of my friends bring it up (Brayden) and I got mad a him for bringing it up in the party, he acted like nothing happened. Then my other friend (Cody) brings it up too and I told him not to say it while pretty upset. But then Brayden tells me that Josh wasn’t there and then josh unmutes his mic and my friends ask him if he heard what they said. They told me he said no, ( I was afraid josh was lying)and I ask them if they can just tell him that they were joking anyway. They said to stop saying that because I was being a dick ( I said it a few times because I was scared) and then they started talking about it while josh was there and I got mad at them for saying it while josh was there and they started yelling at me and saying they don’t care because they don’t want to get involved with my problems and I’m being a dick. ( and I’m worried they are right) i just dont want my account to get terminated and lose everything I have, I’ve spent well over 1500 dollars on my account.

bjhurhej	I (M18) told my girlfriend (F18) my opinion on a question she asked me. We haven’t been dating for long, just a little more than 2 months but we have known each other and been friends for a while. I really like her and I wanna see where this ends up before it gets too serious ya know. She has a nose ring already, and has stick n poke tattoos and a tattoo around her bicep. She plans on getting more in the future, and I find it all to be attractive, I personally do not want tattoos or piercings but I find them attractive on other people. Well anyways she asked me one night if she would look good with a bridge piercing (for context a bridge piercing is a small bar piercing in between your eyes). I told her that I honestly do not know, and she was confused. I knew I may have fucked up but I explained to her that I think it’s an odd place for a piercing and I don’t think I’ve seen anyone look really good with a bridge piercing, but it’s your body and if you want one, get it. I suggested if she wanted more piercings that a septum or double nose piercing would look better since it’s more of a body part rather than a random place on your face. She has been upset about it ever since and it really is bothering me. I didn’t mean to hurt her feelings at all but I need to know if what I did was really bad. She says that I told her that I think she is ugly and she wouldn’t have done the same to me if I really wanted something and I apologized but my opinion hasn’t changed. If I wanted a really bad haircut and asked for her opinion I would hope she would be honest tell me me the truth before I made that decision. I just need to know if I was an asshole and if this whole situation is a huge red flag.	1642913890.0	salmsa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salmsa/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_wouldnt_look/	AITA for telling my girlfriend she wouldn’t look good with bridge piercing?
5wwblpe9	I (28M) recently moved into a new apartment 3-4 months ago with my girlfriend (26F)and it’s been really great. The only issue is that some college age looking girls moved in next door about the same time that we moved in. At first we got along and we’re cordial in the hallways and all that.   But about a month in they had a big party on a Saturday. It was the weekend so we let it slide, but they were REALLY loud until around 11 or midnight.  Then about 2 weeks after they had people over and loud music, their friends this time buzzed our apartment a few times thinking it was the neighbor. Really annoying but we were trying to be cool.  Then New Year’s Eve comes around, they are very loud and it’s again the weekend and they weren’t loud until the wee hours or anything, but loud enough to hear over our TV for several hours. We at this point put a note on their door saying “happy new year! It has been really loud a few times now and this isn’t a college apartment complex, it’s an adult living community. Please keep the noise down especially in the common areas.  They later stuck the note back on our door, whatever.   This happens a few other times, so we start notifying the leasing office. They didn’t seem to do much as we sent them videos of the noise coming through to which they responded “we can’t really hear the noise in the video”. (They don’t have a noise complaint line to come out and check for noise).   So that brings us to tonight, their music was so loud it was vibrating our walls, granted at like 6pm on a Saturday. But super annoying, it goes on for awhile so we bang on the joining wall, it stops for a bit, then comes back on LOUDER, I bang on the wall again, and then the neighbor comes over and knocks on our door.   I open the door to a small young college age girl who from the beginning goes “is there a problem?!” To which I respond “yes youre being too loud and we have tried to notify you several times of this and nothings changed” she then argued with me and said “it’s 6pm on a Saturday I can be as loud as I want.” I told her city ordinance says 10pm but the lease just says to allow your neighbors a calm, quiet and comfortable living space without excessive noise without anytime sort of time limitation.  She then said “well we were just getting ready to go out and it’s not even late” to which I replied “I don’t give a fuck, shut the fuck up”   We notified the leasing office again and let them know this time the neighbors confronted us about it.   Am I the asshole for reporting their noise on multiple occasions on weekends not that late into the night? Or are they for being loud and confrontational despite our best efforts to try to be civil?	1642914317.0	salrsd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salrsd/aita_for_filing_noise_complaints_against_my/	AITA for filing noise complaints against my neighbor.
6m2z5e28	A few days ago, the Governor of my state said that public libraries were to start giving out free flu tests. However, my library didn’t get the memo about it until someone from the health department showed up with a box of flu tests and said to hand them out. Before we (the head librarian and me) knew it, several people started coming into the library to ask for flu test, some patrons were even sick with the flu and still came inside the building to ask for them. Seeing as how we knew nothing about getting the tests in the first place, you can imagine that we were severely underprepared to have our library swarmed with sick people. Because of this, we had to completely shut down our library and all of our programs in order to accommodate those looking to get a Flu test.

iw49fhxl	I (14 year old male) recently moved in with my cousin and his family. Long story, but not relevant.  The thing is, I don’t really like my cousin and I find him to be really scary.  To start with he’s 18 in 12th grade. He’s about 6 ft 3, white, has an extremely hairy mustache and beard, face and arm tattoos, a nose ring, and just looks like a rebel alone.  Now this would be fine if his actions also weren’t fucking scary.  He wears his shoes on inside the house, he spits on the ground, he doesn’t have his shirt on all the time, he stands on furniture,  he drinks sodas right out of the bottle making him look like a drunk maniac, he randomly puts his hand on my shoulders. He’s asked me if I wanted to squeeze his dick. He has no respect for boundaries and just jumped right over the couch and partially landed on me.   And there are many more examples of what he does that’s just scary, and uncomforting.  The thing is, he still offers to take me out and I feel terrified to go out with him alone.   Like even if it’s innocent like dinner, I just don’t want to, because I feel it’ll be more than just dinner. Like what if he starts flirting, or putting me in uncomfortable situations.  But he’s still my cousin.

ztb9y	So for context this is a guy who I kind of dated when I lived in another city.  I made a tweet that said "I just saved your little nft to my camera roll and now I own it too 😂" My friend thought it was funny and shared it to his story, and I then shared it to my story. Clearly, my tweet was a joke. And even if it wasn't who cares right.  He responds to my story saying "That....that isn't how it works." I said "It's a joke." and unfollowed him after. He then messages me saying I'm overly sensitive and immature for unfollowing him (I don't even know how he found out so fast?)   I know it may seem like a rushed reaction but this isn't the first time he did something like that. One time I posted a very non-political story and he weirdly tried picking a political fight with me out of nowhere. It was very bizarre and combative. So this was my final straw I suppose. It felt like he was trying to embarrass me or something.

1eqm38nk	My sister told me that she wanted to talk, she said she wanted to come out about something. She is pansexual but everyones known that for a couple years at that point so i was windering what it was. She said she wanted to be called by her new name. Im thinking why not, and asked what her name was. She said with a straight face that she wanted me to call her "moth" like the bug. I just stared at her, and i ask whats wrong with her current name. She said she just didnt like it and would rather be called moth. I told her i wasnt gonna call her moth cause its kinda stupid, just because shes really in to moths right now should not mean you want to be called a moth. She was upset at me and told me this is why i dont talk to you. Mind you that we are both 17 years old, she isnt a little kid shes almost an adult, and im uasally pretty open im fine with lgbtq and everything like that but im not gonna call my sister "moth" so AITA.	1642915085.0	salzjb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salzjb/aita_for_refusing_to_call_my_twin_sister_by_her/	AITA for refusing to call my twin sister by her "new name"
e35es5aq	I (Teen M) live far from my grandparents (in their 60's and 80's). They're on the far right of the political spectrum. My cousin (Teen M Gay) is often picked on by my grandfather for the way he presents himself. He's been called a "fruitcake" and other names I'd rather not say here.  More recently, I was walking in a public place and on my tippy toes (I'm extremely short) and my grandfather gripped the back of my neck because I was "acting like a fruit". It hurt badly and he's done other things to pick on the fact I act rather feminine.

ixfkoy74	A guy I was randomly chatting with told me this and I laughed.  He said that he didn't want to be with a woman who dates him for his job and income, even though he doesn't currently have one and lives at home, as he wants their love to be genuine.  I feel like it's just a fancy excuse for not putting in effort into making yourself decent partner material.  When I probed further, he said, "I'm not ashamed to say I am unemployed and make nothing right now. If anyone thinks less of me for that, I'll just avoid them. Life and finding a job is difficult."  He also said that if his partner were to make 100k and he were to make 20k, that she should pay for everything to bridge the income gap and to make him happy by sharing the burden.  Like, personally, if I were to to wear hoodies and sweatpants (as a girl) to future dates and use a similar argument of "I want to know you like me even when I'm not dressed up," how would that argument make sense?  Was it rude of me to laugh at him?	1642915255.0	sam16w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sam16w/aita_for_laughing_at_someone_who_said_that_they/	AITA for laughing at someone who said that they want to offer as little as possible to a partner so they know it's genuine?
d8j54jq3	AITA for making my mom cry by pointing out the truth?   When my nephew was born my mom would watch him for 3-4 days at a time even though my sister didn’t work. She just wanted a break and mom loves her grandbabies.   I have severe anxiety from infant loss so I don’t let mine go very far very often. I’ve been wanting to go watch Scream but didn’t want there to be a crowd so I asked her if she’d watch him for a few hours and when she agreed I bought tickets for a time no one else bought tickets for and got excited.   Later on that day she was complaining that her plans got messed up and said “it’s always something” making me feel like she didn’t really want to watch my son. Which is fair, I don’t expect her to. Both times she’s watched him this month she’s said she’s had other plans as well AFTER agreeing to watch my son and either rushed me through my friend’s funeral, or made me feel like a burden when I asked her to watch him today.   I asked her why she only takes my son from maybe 6pm-7am and when my nephew was born she would take him for days at a time. I was pointing this out because she never rushes my sister to get back home or makes her feel guilty for watching my nephew.   I made her cry and I feel bad about it but she called my sister and told her I was saying she loves my kid less than she does my nephew and that wasn’t my issue. My issue is that she’s always treated me different than my sister and I feel like that is leaking into her relationship with my son.  I’d rather not ask her to watch him if she’s going to rush me or make me feel guilty, but if I don’t offer her to watch him on occasion she gets upset too.   My sister says I’m trying to pit the kids against one another. They’re literally 14 months and 5 months. What I felt like mom was doing was treating me different than she treats my sister and in turn, pitted us against one another. After my sister called me I just sort of sat there and felt like 💩because now she thinks I don’t like my nephew or something. And that’s not the case at all.   So was I TA for telling her it feels like she treats us different and making my mom cry?	1642915720.0	sam5sz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sam5sz/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry/	AITA for making my mom cry?
i5ao2gg8	When I was first dating my now-husband, we stayed at his parents house for a holiday get-together.  Preface:  his folks lived in an expensive home and are in a completely different tax bracket from my family. He and I were cleaning up together in the kitchen.  I was carefully emptying plates while running the garbage disposal.  My then-bf told me to put more stuff in the disposal.  I was being cautious, not having had a lot of prior experience with garbage disposals and not wanting to mess it up.  But, I did as he said, thinking he probably knows more about it and his parents likely had a more powerful disposal than the average home.  I was wrong.  No sooner than I stuffed it full of food, the darn thing broke.  My guy said NOTHING to his parents about telling me to put more food down, and basically let them believe it was all my fault.  I was mortified.  His parents weren’t super upset with me, but it was a huge inconvenience and I felt stupid and irresponsible.  He never tried to clear it up or help me ‘save face’ with his family. Years later, we are married with children and I wonder sometimes if that was a red flag that I ignored or if I was an overreactive, sensitive asshole.	1642915809.0	sam6np	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sam6np/aita_that_broke_the_inlaws_garbage_disposal/	AITA that broke the in-law’s garbage disposal?
5g3oev06	I (21 non binary) smoke things. I’m in a place where it’s legal to. Because of an alcoholic father, my 22 year old girlfriend has panic attacks when i smoke, and also has them when she thinks about me smoking or drinking. I don’t do it excessively, and when i do i’m never around her.  I smoke because I have anxiety, depression, and autism. I find that being up there gives me a much needed break and helps me cope with my life. I never do it in front of her. I believe she needs to work through past trauma and we got into an argument today about it.  again, i only go out about once a month but the very fact that i’m doing it triggers her.  she’s angry at me and wants me to stop, i think what i’m doing isn’t hurting anyone and i think she needs to work through it.  I might be ta because i’m not giving her time to work through it and also i could just go on a shit load of pills if need be, but i don’t want to go through the system again.   aita?	1642915938.0	sam83w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sam83w/aita_for_smoking_when_it_triggers_my_girlfriend/	AITA for smoking when it triggers my girlfriend?
e35es5aq	I (Teen M) have anxiety. I used to get severely anxious and bite my nails down to the beds, sometimes they'd even bleed.  Recently, I've been taking great care of my nails and they're pretty long. I've been painting them quite often (I'm actually pretty good at it, I used to be an artist, so I do cool gradients) and taking care of them and my mother swooped in and started being controlling.  She repeatedly makes comments about the amount of spend on my nails and how I take care of them. She limits how much I can spend on them and will keep threatening me.   More recently, she set a limit I could only paint my nails once a week. Ever since then, she keeps threatening me with comments about how she'll take away my nail polish if I'm a perfectionist. I even said I didn't like my left hand (I have a weird skin thing on that hand and my nails are shorter, uglier, and I can't paint it aswell). She said she'd take away all my nail polish if I said something like that again. (I paid for my own nail polish, and she always makes remarks on how much I spend, nail polish or not)  I'm tired of it. My nails are the one thing I thought I had control over and my mother keeps trying take control over it. I'm super sick of her trying to take control over my nails and I just want it to be something I have fun with. Would I be the A-Hole if I confronted her and set boundaries between her and my nails?

h2zqxss3	My (F27) husband (M28) is genuinely a great guy.  We hardly ever argue, he’s supported me throughout, etc. etc.  He has a friend (M28), however, who is not a great guy.  We’ll call him Andrew.  This guy boasts about respecting women (while simultaneously only respecting the ones he’s attracted to), can and will argue about everything, making it his personal mission to make you feel as stupid as possible, and if you prove yourself right, he will get mad and backtrack, pulling at straws to get himself out of the hole HE dug.  Overall, he’s incredibly aggravating and I find it very difficult to spend more than a couple hours at a time with him.  He tends to only do this to women.  Which is why I don’t hang out with him alone, and I make my appearances few and far between even if my husband is present as well.  For context, I went to (and GRADUATED WITH HONORS FROM) law school.  I passed the bar exam FIRST TRY.  I’ve been a practicing attorney ever since I graduated just a couple years ago.  My husband’s birthday was a week ago, and we had a nice little get-together at our house with some of his friends, and Andrew attended.  At some point after dinner, my husband made a joke to which I responded (also joking) with some legal reference to whatever he’d said.  I honestly don’t remember what exactly was said.  Andrew cuts in, telling me I’m wrong and that’s not how [insert my reference] works.  I ignored him initially, but he kept fucking talking.  I finally snapped back and told him I was right, that I knew what I was talking about, and that it was all just a joke and didn’t matter.  But Andrew kept. Fucking. Talking.  Finally I slammed my hands down on the table and just yelled, “Who here went to law school, Andrew?  Who here graduated with honors from law school, Andrew?  Whose name is on the diploma hanging in our living room?  It isn’t fucking yours!  Don’t tell me how the law works when you didn’t go to school for it!”  It got really quiet after that.  I excused myself and went to bed, and from what I heard, the rest of his friends sort of just left shortly after.  My husband came upstairs and told me I should’ve just ignored him, that I ruined his birthday party, that this is “just how Andrew is”.  I told him he should’ve defended his wife when he knew as well as I did that I knew far more about what I was talking about than Andrew did in that aspect.  I pretty much lit into my husband for the whole ordeal, too.  And he and I haven’t spoken in the few days it’s been since the party.  We’ve exchanged formalities, but nothing more.  So AITA?  I just got tired of being belittled and having the field I studied my ass off to get into mansplained to me by someone who never went to law school.  TL;DR: My husband’s misogynistic friend tried to mansplain to me (a practicing attorney) how the law works.  I blew up at him for it and my husband is now mad at me for ruining his birthday party.	1642916913.0	samhqu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samhqu/aita_for_losing_my_temper/	AITA for losing my temper?
ifj8nao1	I (TransM19) already live in my own apartment, and struggle to pay rent every month... And my parents live 30 minutes away and offer no help to begin with. I wrote it off as me being the youngest of 4 and that they were tired of raising kids. Doesn't excuse it, but I guess if you really don't want me I'll see myself out.   When I was 16 my parents had stopped paying for my food and forced me to get a job on top of high school (this isn't the worst, but I had a really hard time in school due to anxiety and depression that they also believed I never had even after several doctors told them so.) I've been working for a while, and trying my hardest to save and live a better life. I came out around 14 as trans and they both have hit me, verbally abused me, and blackmailed me about it for YEARS. They still tell my my fiancee won't love me cause I barely get by and that being trans isn't something someone wants to have to deal with...   They get into my head constantly and break me down when I seem to be getting better. Mostly my step mom. She had told me at one point when my mother had passed away when I was 14 after years of not seeing her, that I needed to get over it because she wasn't a part of my life as much as they were. (This was three months after her death.)   Recently they told me getting sick was a dramatic stunt and that it was just me trying to get my long distance fiancee to stay with me longer. Which literally sent me into a panic attack so bad I ended up picking up an old scratching habit I haven't had since I had met my fiancee.  (About a year now)   My sister keeps telling me I'm being an asshole, and I can't seem to believe it... What do you guys think? If you have any questions for any clarification let me know.

10xvky	Yeah, I said it. Conquered. Not killed. Maybe kill a few…  I’ve read all the publicly available history on the place as well as all the attempts to contact them since the 1800s.   To me, murder is murder. It doesn’t fucking matter how primitive they are. When an animal kills a person, society kills that animal, even if it has to hunt it down. When a person kills another, we prosecute them and in some cases, they’re sentenced to die.   To kill people simply because they get close to the island or attempt to come ashore is not a good enough reason. So for the Indian government that holds authority over the island to blatantly ignore murder, I would say you have no authority over that place at all really. They attempted to recover bodies, but fled when the natives shot arrows at their helicopter. At that point, I think I would have started spraying machine gun fire all over. Send a message. We’re here to collect our dead and you will fuck off while we do that are die just as well.  Seriously, since murder is apparently not punished if it takes place on this island, I’m shocked they haven’t been massacred yet. A dozen outfitted men could probably completely wipe them out with the correct covert approach.   At this point your probably wondering, “why? There is nothing to gain.” I would normally agree with you, however there is a very good reason. Every attempt to contact these people (and even accidental contact) has been met with extreme violence save for one anthropology trip.   A group willing and eager to murder anyone who comes near should not be allowed to act on their own. And if India doesn’t want to do anything about it in order to preserve this “ancient people”… well it doesn’t really sound like India actually has authority over the island.  Waiting for it to show up in the news that a group of private mercenaries landed in the dead of night and killed everyone on the island. And I’ll sip my morning coffee and think “They always fired first, I’m glad someone fired back finally”  I know this post will be downvoted to oblivion, but I don’t care. Special status shouldn’t excuse murder. At the very least they should’ve known we’d kill them for killing ours. Yes, those poachers shouldn’t have been fishing near the island, and yes that missionary kid was an idiot for going there. However, none of these guys had ill intentions or expressed hostility towards the natives, and yet they were murdered. Fuck those savages. No body has the right to be left in solitude forever anymore. No one. The world is too populated now. Everyone is forced to interact with society, they should be no different just because they lack immunities. Boo fucking who. The whole world caught COVID. Shit happens. We get over it and move on with new immunities or die in the process.

ixgykzlg	I've been attending my friend's book club for a few years, and about 6 months ago, we had this one guy join. He was a friend of a friend of my friend and learned about the club that way.   We've been having the club in-person and online, and both times, he's tried to talk to me one on one about the book that week/month/whatever and my life. I didn't think much of it.   I remember once casually bringing up that I wanted a specific type of food that wasn't available in the area and at the next club meeting, he brought some for everyone but saved a package specifically for me.   There was this other time I said that I didn't want to go out to get groceries in the rain, and he randomly brought some leftover groceries he had to that meeting for me. I don't even know how he remembered that.  The other day, he asked me what my favorite type of food was and I casually answered that it was Mexican and/or Italian food and at the next meeting, he asked me if I wanted to go with him to check out this new Italian place in town. I said sure, and it's on the calendar for next week.  I told my friends about him, and they said that he might like me, and I told them that I disagree and that he's probably just being friendly.   They told me that I wasn't seeing clear signs and I told them that I know how we are with each other better than they do.	1642919020.0	san2n9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/san2n9/aita_for_telling_my_friends_that_i_disagree_with/	AITA for telling my friends that I disagree with their opinion?
gcx7qu9q	My suite mate is noisy what should I do?  Hello so basically the title says it all. My suite mate is annoying I’m sorry if it sounds rude but it’s true. So before we sign up for rooms we pick the level of noise we want and what time we go to bed so we get paired with people among the same criteria. I obviously signed up for quiet and bed by 10-11.   I am zoology vet major so I have a lot of science classes and I like to study in my room occasionally. My suite mate is a geology major and it feels like she has more free time then most considering she makes noises frequently.   She is always randomly singing in the day and I can hear it clear in my room. She sings in a exaggerated long put way and it ticks me off. She also calls her friends on speaker for 2-3hrs 2 times a day maybe 3 times a week and frequently in the weekend. On week ends she does it till 1 am and it really agitates me.  Sometimes on these calls she uses her loud voice and as if she’s calling in a hurricane and laughs too but like a loud loud laugh. I remember once at 1am I had a mini seizure because it woke me up (not a real seizure just the one you get from loud noises).   I would usually turn my heater on to block the noise but my room over heats and I can’t use music because I can still hear her.   I have never really interacted with her or spoken to her face to face because I’m an introvert but would it be unreasonable to ask my RA to enforce quiet hours like we’re suppose have anyway (it starts at 10pm)? Would I be a jerk and hated for asking I remember my old friend told me to let it go because mr floor mates would hate me for asking them to not make noise.   I’m ok with her doing it in the day but at night is where I kinda draw the line.   Also currently she’s been on speaker phone from 9pm-1am and it’s driving me nuts I can’t sleep.  Also additional info I’ve asked my RA about quiet hours before in 1st semester and she told us all if we wanted them to ask her but not sure if everyone would be on board we do have them but my suite mate doesn’t comply or know about them since they are posted in the building bulletin board anymore.	1642919132.0	san3oy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/san3oy/wibta_if_i_asked_my_ra_to_enforce_quiet_hours/	WIBTA if i asked my RA to enforce quiet hours?

Also additional info I’ve asked my RA about quiet hours before in 1st semester and she told us all if we wanted them to ask her but not sure if everyone would be on board we do have them but my suite mate doesn’t comply or know about them since they are not posted in the building bulletin board anymore.	1642919624.0	san8m2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/san8m2/wibta_if_i_ask_my_ra_to_enforce_quiet_hours/	WIBTA If I ask my RA to enforce quiet hours?
ie8nykha	So this all happened in the span of 20 mins.  My mom has been sick for the past three days, she had fever and body pain, she's still recovering. I also had high fever and was adviced to rest, I'm better since yesterday.  Morning, I was trying to clean my room and then came out to het breakfast while I heard my father saying he'll buy meat and my mom repeatedly saying no and that she doesn't want to cook (She is the one who usually cooks), I got mad cuz this isn't the first time he has done this, he has multiple times brought stuff tho she has not to but since he already bought them she has no option but cooking it. For example, two days ago, when she was sick the most, he was telling her boil him eggs tho she was in bed.   So went off on my father if he cannot hear her saying no and why he fails to understand and he isn't the one cooking and if he wants to eat it so bad, he can buy it from restaurants.   A few minutes later, I got 4 pieces of bread but purposely didn't tie the package as I wasn't sure if I wanted to it all 4 so i just decided I'll see if I'm still hungry by the 3rd piece and eat the last one or put it back into the package.   My mom sees it and tells me to tie it and i tell her okay, she then goes on about it and then again I tell her okay, gave her my reason and to stop repeating it, i told this a little loud, she got mad and started shouting how I always do this which is not true and I'm pretty sure she was referring about last week when I had a bun and my brother was asking about it so I thought he would take one and left it open. She then angrily told me to stop policing others (referring what I told my dad earlier) when I can't handle myself.  I feel really guilty about it but it made me feel bad she did stuff even though she didn't want to but she scolded me earlier once a few months ago when she was complaining of me not helping out at home which is not true again cuz I sweep and mop the house whenever she asks me to, of course I do it slower than her so she is extremely annoyed by that and I was at home idle for 5 months so I sweeped and mopped the home every single day. But my dad doesn't do almost any chores, he does them only when my parents have fought and mom refuses to do any chores. He does work but even whenever he is home, he sits on his phone for hours or sleeps and if he tries doing the dishes, they are always still dirty. So I pointed this out and she said I should go do his job then.   (I should mention, it's not like he doesn't have any free time, he comes home drunk on ¾ of the days which I believe consumes time.)  So folks, AITA? My mom told me to shut up but then again she is the one who does stuff and it's between my mom and dad. I just wanted to defend her.	1642920548.0	sanh91	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanh91/aita_for_going_off_on_my_dad_though_i_wasnt/	AITA for going off on my dad though I wasn't involved in the situation?
ixhxww6f	My (22M) close friend (18F) Hannah started seeing this guy, we'll call him Chad™️ (24M). Chad™️ sees a lot of women and isn't really a relationship guy, mostly just hookups. Hannah knows this now, but was trying to get over her crush after she was rejected so she has been hanging out with Chad™️ a lot. But she told me that the first time she did anything physical with Chad™️, he only told her afterwards that he isn't looking for a relationship, and that she felt a bit led on. This upset me a little because this is Hannah's first time being with anyone, and I feel like Chad™️ should have been upfront with her before anything happened.  Anyways, they've been hanging out frequently at night and she said he takes her out in his car to the orchards or parking lots to do their thing because he said he can't bring her home as it would be inappropriate (I guess he lives with an older female roommate).  What has really pissed me off is that he led her on, then got her to sleep with him, and now, he is telling her to not tell anyone what they've been doing. He says it should be kept a secret because "people will talk". And I don't know, that just gives me really sketchy vibes.  One day Hannah called me crying because she found out that Chad™️ had told a guy that Hannah was interested in actually dating, and now this new guy knows that they've slept together, and that they have this sort of friends with benefits thing going on. She is upset that now her new crush might have this preconception about her and that Chad™️ told him, while simultaneously and hypocritically making her keep it a secret.  What pushed me to feeling hatred towards him was that Hannah's colleague Lily (18F) told her that Chad™️ had also slept with her before Hannah, and Hannah and I both agree that Lily is less mature and shouldn't have been taken advantage of by Chad™️.  I just feel that Chad™️ is very predatory of these young girls and I can't tell anyone why I hate him because I don't want to be spreading Hannah and Lily's business to everyone in our social circles. I am also not too close with Chad™️ and I don't know if he's aware that I'm privy to what's been going on.	1642920639.0	sani60	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sani60/aita_for_hating_my_colleague/	AITA for hating my colleague?
d6qd2pr7	About 2 weeks ago my best friend F19 shared some news with me. She had told me that her mom and stepdad had been planning an arranged marriage for her without her knowledge. I was FURIOUS. probably more angry than she was. my friend is only 19 and not ready for marriage, yet. her parents on the other hand are ready for her to bare their grand children and carry on the bloodline. my BFF isnt even sure if she wants children yet. She was extremely stressed over the whole situation and didn’t know what to do as arranged marriages were not an uncommon thing in her family. I couldnt bare to see my friend having to deal with this alone, so i took matters into my own hands. I called immigration. Her mom and stepdad both were illegal immigrants from ukraine and had moved here to expand their family business which was a family owned bakery. On the phone with immigration informed them that the family had been lacing their pies and cakes with drugs such as marijuana and cocaine, as well as informing them of their citizenship. They ended up getting deported,and also got sentenced to a few years in prison, so now my friend doesnt have to get married to a total stranger. so AITA?	1642920738.0	sanj6o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanj6o/aita_for_getting_my_best_friends_parents_deported/	AITA for getting my best friends parents deported back to Ukraine?
ixhls1c3	I m32 is a SAHD to my kids f7 and m3 who I have with my wife who's 35. Being a stay-at-home father definitely wasn't something I saw myself doing but when my wife expressed to me how she doesn't feel comfortable living her kids with just anyone I stepped up and quit my job since my wife made enough so we could live comfortably. It was hard looking after 2 kids who are under 10 but im now use to it. My wife works 55 hours so I know she is tired but when she came home today she yelled about why the house wasn't clean and why I hadn't made dinner for her. The house was not dirty but had a few of my son's toys laying around because he stays in the living room while his sister is in class so I can see both of them. Her demands upset me because here's my schedule Monday-Friday. -wake up at 6am so I have time to get ready -wake my kids up and get them ready ( wash their teeth and face) -check my son's pull-up ( he is potty trained but he does have accidents) -log my daughter into her class -make breakfast for both of them -clean the kitchen after making food -make sure my daughter is actually paying attention -take my son to the bathroom -run after my daughter because she's not in her seat anymore -make her lunch -clean up dishes from lunch -help my daughter with homework -Log my son into "preschool". -basically im in class for him because he doesn't pay attention -makes my son lunch -puts both of them down for a nap -change my son's pullup -makes dinner for them By this time my wife comes home but she eats then goes to our bedroom which pisses me off because our kids miss her. When she does that it means im also on night duty and can only sleep if my 3-year-old allows me. At this point im gonna put my kids in real school and get a job so I can leave her because im communicated this and she ignores me.	1642921099.0	sanmky	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanmky/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_wife_when_she_says_i/	AITA for being upset at my wife when she says I don't do enough?
ixi8tkrd	My wife joined a new job a month ago. She works as a medical transcriptionist.   Every night, she works from 7pm to 4am the next morning.   I find it difficult to sleep because she works in the same room. Besides, I sleep talk so it's disturbing for her as well. She complains to me every morning that I was talking and yelling in my sleep and she wasn't able to focus on her work.   So I suggested to her today that I sleep in the guest bedroom and she can comfortably work in our bedroom. She got angry when I said that and started saying I'm being mean and that I probably don't love her anymore. I tried explaining to her that I suggested it only because we're both having problems. However, she wasn't ready to listen and just went to sleep until her shift.

ixgykzlg	This one guy I met at my friend's book club asked me what my favorite type of food was and I casually answered that it was Mexican and/or Italian food.  At the next meeting, he asked me if I wanted to go with him to check out this new Italian place in town.  I said sure, and it's on the calendar for next week.  However, I don't really want to talk to him anymore because he keeps doing these random things for me, like getting me groceries and random food that I mention, and it makes me feel weird and uncomfortable.  I have no idea what his intentions are and I want to ask my friend to ban him from the book club.  Truthfully, I think he's handsome and I am sort of into him. I just don't know if he feels the same way and that's why I'd rather cut him off and not talk to him. He stresses me out and I am already stressed this year as an educator.

brtznsyc	Not a native english speaker pls excuse my language   My (15F) Bestfriend (16M) have been bestfriends for about 3 years now . I've never been in a relationship and pretty uneducated in that department . The bestfriend (lets call him ANT) confessed his 'love' for me a few months back over text . we also are in 10th grade which is a big stage for every student in our country . The percentage we get determines the college we'll get into. now ANT and i have had a flirty bestfriends kinda relationship since 2 years . whenever we meet in school he is totally not the flirty kind and doesn't make a great effort to talk to me either. he basically wants to have a stable future get a good job etc which i completely understand since i am of the same mindset. I'll be moving out of our state next year for college and he wants me not to get into a relationship when im there and basically wants to go with the flow . I am probably in love with him and do want a relationship. I completely understand if he does not want a relationship now but the next year i want to start dating and exploring options . Though he says that its better if we remain bestfriends but 'Flirt and kiss and stuff'. I feel like he wants a relationship but without any attachments or commitements. Do i try to get over him and start exploring the next year or convince him by having a conversation somehow? He is also the BESTEST friend ive ever had and dont want to loose him as a friend.  ( we are both good with studies and i think i can prevent myself from getting tooo distracted even if we date but he doesnt think the same and feels a relationship would only distract him since he was in love before and SHE kept dragging him without giving any clarity over their relationship)	1642921546.0	sanr27	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanr27/wibta_if_i_started_dating_someone_else_even/	WIBTA If I started dating someone else even though my bestfriend told me not to?
ixi403gf	 I noticed an adult chat site on our family laptop.  I knew he was the only one who used it.  He didn’t deny watching the models but said it was the first time.  Then he became  angry at me for asking questions like does he pay for this, how often does he watch, is he seeing anyone else.   I am sick right now so can’t talk much.  He is blaming me and says he will not talk or doing anything else with me.  I apologizes for asking questions like are you seeing others as I know he isn’t physically seeing other women.

2hsyhxsj	My husband likes to hang out with his friends which is totally cool, but i find that he likes to insist that he is coming home soon between the hours of 11pm and 3 am.  Usually this consists of several messages like "looks like things are starting to die down now" and  "I'm going to make my way home soon" and "I'll probably head to the station soon"   5am always comes around and my anxiety deepens because I don't know where he is and who he is with as he eventually stops replying to messages and refuses to answer any calls.   An additional layer of anxiety comes knowing that he often hides who is hanging out with because it always starts off as him hanging out with with his male friend, and it almost always turns out that  he is hanging out with several people instead (often consisting of younger women) which I think is probably the part that triggers my anxiety.   I usually have to find out that other people are present by lurking one of the young girls that he is always in contact with.   The last time this happened a story with him tagged was uploaded to social media but a few minutes later it was mysteriously deleted.   When he comes home the next day he gets furious and accuses me of being too possessive because I have anxiety attacks and text/call him too much, it makes him feel as if he is trapped and has no freedom to have fun.   I always end up feeling terrible because maybe he is right and I am overreacting by feeling anxious.   Personally I don't mind if he hangs out with his girl friends but I find it worrisome that he tries so hard to hide it and that he chooses to return home the following day well into the morning or sometimes even the afternoon.   I've told him that it would be less of an issue if he came home at a more reasonable time like 3am, but he says that I'm too controling and paranoid.   Am I the asshole? Am I out of touch? We're both close to 40 and I just thought that being married meant sleeping in the same bed everynight even if it's not for the entire night. Just want to ask married people if this is normal.   I'm looking into getting some mental help so that I can learn to better deal with this situation and not have these type of expectations that seem to hinder my husbands happiness, plus the stress that I go through from these incidents are giving me actual heart problems.   Note: I don't accuse my husband of anything, but I sometimes am pressured to express that I feel a lot of distress from this happening, which in turn infuriates him.

akw2katr	Sigh. I really didn’t want to go about posting this on the internet, but it’s been bugging me for the past 2 days and I really need opinions.   So, I want to give you all some background first. My bf [22m] and I [22f] were best friends before we began dating. When his birthday was coming up, I had planned out all his gifts a few weeks in advance. I ended up getting him 2 Supreme sweaters that he really wanted, and a meaningful card. He had told me that he particularly likes that brand because his dad would buy him Supreme sweaters, but now his father grew apart from him. When his birthday came, he was so touched and couldn’t thank me enough for the gifts. He was ecstatic and I couldn’t be happier!  We ended up dating, but after 6 months we decided to end things on a very good note since I will be moving. After we broke up, we decided to remain best friends, and he reassures me that he has a lot of love for me and that he cares an awful lot about me.   My birthday was a few days ago and he asked me what I would like, but I insisted he really didn’t have to get me anything, because I am moving, and I’m trying to declutter as much as I can before I do. He insisted that he wanted to get me something meaningful so I told him fine. I asked for a glass globe we saw a couple days ago while shopping that reminded me of Beauty and the Beast. The best part is that it was only $8!! I told him it would be a meaningful gift that I can remember him by, since we always watched Disney movies together. He said ok, that he’d get that, and something more.   My birthday comes, I go to dinner with him and a few of my other friends, and then we all head out. Before I went home, he motions for me to come to his car and open the trunk. I opened the trunk and saw an old duffel bag. He told me to open it up and inside was a… used t shirt from a thrift store. Nothing special about it. Just a big white XL t-shirt with stains on it (I’m a small girl, 110 lb for reference). I was too stunned to speak and thought he was joking until he told me that I can keep the duffle bag too. He closed the trunk, gave me a big smile, and said “I really hope you like it! I got them from the thrift store!”   I was shocked, but managed to force a smile and later texted him to thank him for the gifts.  I know you might be thinking he’s tight on money, completely understandable. But the globe I asked for was $8, and I found out the shirt and the bag were about $35 total. And here is where I feel like I might be the AH… I couldn’t control my feelings and ended up crying when I got home. I’m not a materialistic person by any means, but I did tell him that if he wanted to get me anything, I wanted it to be meaningful, something I can remember him by… I feel so hurt but at the same time I feel like an AH for crying about it. I didn’t tell him that I cried because I don’t want to hurt his feelings.   PS: I’m so so sorry this post is so long. I tried my best to keep it short.	1642922019.0	sanvgu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanvgu/aita_for_crying_over_a_bad_gift/	AITA for crying over a bad gift?

Since my bday was coming up soon  and my friend wasn’t gonna be there he gave me early bday present which was a bra since I have moobs ( man boobs ) and I’m a little overweight. The boys and I are tryna think of ways we could get him back.  We were gonna send his Mum a dildo on her bday and say that it was from her son. Some ppl thought it was too far and others thought it’s justified bc of the prank to me. The group is split 50/50.

8r983885	 Everything has been so awful with me and my online friends. I’m scared to lose them. There’s this girl that feels left out because I created a group chat on discord without her in it. Some background information, we’re not close. Nor am I close to her I think boyfriend. I don’t know if they’re dating. We haven’t been close because of some incident that happened in August, 1 hour before my birthday. Her boyfriend argued with me calling me a h word and b word about me unfriending him on ROBLOX because I felt so alone and uncomfortable after he said he didn’t want to play with me when I asked to play a game together. He said he was only gonna play with (girlfriend’s name). She also went something along the lines of “Aw thank you”. I felt hurt but shrugged it off. (They weren’t dating at the time) After that one of the main friends of the group left online forever. (I don’t know the reason) and left the discord server we all talked in to this boy. He wasn’t bias or anything. (I left the discord server after I argued. Also I ended up just stopping the argument because I don’t want to feel like crap on my birthday) Then after a while when the boy got ownership of the server I started talking more in it but mainly avoided the couple. Now, I’ve taken a break since I can’t get the argument off my mind. I ended up playing this multiplayer game on ROBLOX with some friends and I created a group chat so everyone can talk together and strategize. Then, we started adding more people and stuff and talking. We currently have 10 people in the group which is the max. Now she feels left out cause people are talking there and she’s not there. Now, some people in the group chat wants me to apologize to her and say I don’t hate her because she thinks I hate her and she thinks everyone hates her. Now she wants to leave discord and they don’t want her to. And it’s pressuring me and making me feel like I’ve done something wrong. I feel like she always hated me and even despised me. I don’t want to speak to her at all but I feel like I have to. I feel like if I don’t reassure her that I don’t hate her and she leaves, I’ll be blamed. So am I the asshole for creating a group chat without her and not wanting to apologize?	1642922173.0	sanwuu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanwuu/aita_for_leaving_someone_out/	AITA FOR LEAVING SOMEONE OUT
gpvv7az0	so for a bit of context im currently enrolled in a 4 year university as a freshman undeclared major. since the beginning of the semester ive had feelings that college isnt for me, or at least the one im currently enrolled in. i basically screwed myself over because i applied to that school for all the wrong reasons (student population, experience, etc) basically without looking into any programs. in hindsight the best option for me wouldve probably been to enroll in community college first to figure things out.  *keep in mind that i deeply struggle with motivation to keep myself going and dont see a happy future ahead of me. probably irrelevant but thought id add it anwyay*  now getting into the real tea. my family, especially my mom, are very hell bent on me getting a degree. personally i hate college with a burning passion and was getting a bit too comfortable at home during my break. if it were my choice i would definitely drop out but im well aware that id crash and burn very quickly doing so because i have no plan in mind  so ive been exploring different options including community college. now one thing ill mention is i love airports and definitely wouldnt mind working in the aviation industry just because of how much i love the environment. i found an aviation program at a community college that seems very appealing to me. as a compromise, id get an associates degree then get into work.  i spoke to my mom and one of my sisters about this idea and theyre totally against it. my mom just insists i get the 4 year degree even though ive stated multiple times theres virtually nothing i like there, and my sister says dont transfer because they wont take all my credits, which honestly im fine with if it means.i dont have to settle for a 4 yr degree i dont want.  i feel very stuck and held back by their opinion, and thinking about the possibility of staying in my 4 year school is giving me so much anxiety. i know im not gonna get their approval but i dont want that to hold me back from doing whats right for me. so im considering just applying and transferring out and not saying anything until i get accepted and commit.   so i feel like i would be an asshole for a few reasons: my parents are the ones paying my tuition, making that move is just simply sneaky as hell, and i hate lying to my family. at the same time though i feel like they and their opinions have held me back from doing so many things for years and i just wanna break free from that. i dont want them to assume ill always listen because i sure as hell wont.   so WIBTA if i did that?  (note: transferring to community college would also save more money in the longrun and i could be out of school much faster.)	1642922051.0	sanvri	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanvri/wibta_if_i_transferred_colleges_without_telling/	WIBTA if i transferred colleges without telling anyone?
ilv3hhys	I’m a 69 year old widow. My son Henry is 40 and his wife Katherine is 41. When they got married Katherine talked a good game about having children but it looks like they made no effort to make it happen.  I’ve talked to my son about this on numerous occasions since he works for Google and can easily afford as many IVF cycles as it takes, but he’s always told me to “mind my own f***ing business,” as if I were nothing but white trash and it was OK to curse at me.  Even when Katherine was diagnosed with breast cancer I tried to be supportive, but when her ovaries were removed I spoke with Henry and told him it was time he got a divorce. Neither of us are getting younger and Katherine can’t provide the grandchildren he owes me.  His response was unforgivably hurtful. He called me “a callous old harpy who thinks people are disposable”. He said he didn’t owe me anything and that he had warned me before that asking him to choose between his mother and his wife would not end well for me, and that I didn’t have or deserve a say in his life or Katherine’s.  I told him he only gets one mother, and he said I was one too many. He told me to never contact him or Katherine again. We haven’t spoken in three months. He’s not on social, won’t take my calls or texts, and hasn’t even sent me a birthday card let alone apologized.  I don’t want to accept that I’m in the wrong, but this isn’t my world anymore and I’m afraid. Am I the asshole here? Can I get my son back? Without him my life is pointless.

7xka6v4e	I KNOW, it sounds pretty bad and maybe even rude. We work at a restaurant and ofc we are servers and we are constantly walking fast & passing people every day   Have you ever had a server reach over you ? While trying to grab a plate? Well she likes to REACH over her customers, and the other day I got a complaint from a customer asking to switch servers because she smelt like she hadn’t showered in days ( it was a Sunday and it was very busy and all servers had 6+ tables to serve )   A few weeks before that I remember someone asking if I could smell the bad smell that was in the air ( we work at a BBQ restaurant so let me tell you it always smells like meat ) so I told her no I couldn’t smell anything & once the table asked to switch due to her smelling. I put 2 and 2 together and realized she was next to us the day my other coworker complained it smelt   I went ahead and handled the table but explained to them that I was busy so it might be a couple minutes before I can take their order and they were 100% okay with it   But I do not have the heart to tell her she smells. On the other hand It breaks my heart knowing she can possibly lose out on money due to her hygiene.  At the end of the night when we tip out the house I ended up just giving her the tips that table had left me and just told her thank you for helping me out tonight	1642922348.0	sanybm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanybm/aita_for_wanting_to_telling_my_coworker_she/	AITA for wanting to telling my coworker she should shower before work?
cdki11n6	My boyfriend and I have been through it. We’ve been together for over a year but went through a messy breakup in between. It ended well but none of us took the breakup well which resulted in chaos.   I’m ashamed to say I didn’t do the healing or work I was supposed to do after and ended up making some very bad choices. I ended up pregnant in a very abusive situation and somehow my BF(ex at time) found out about everything even though him and I didn’t have contact.   He ended up talking to his parents and spent a lot of late nights struggling with mental health and University due to the updates someone was giving him. Resulting in his family not liking me anymore.   We’ve since got back together and worked things through. It’s already been almost 4 months. We set new healthy boundaries and talked through everything so we were on the same page. I’d say we’re in a way better place then we’ve ever been before and definitely happier. (Also I’m no longer pregnant)   His parents still don’t like me. (Which is fair) His mom was the worst at first. She said some pretty nasty things about how I probably was lying about being abused and how I just wasn’t a good person.   I’m not mean or a bad person. At the end of the day a lot of the issues we had in our relationship was due to immaturity for the both of us.   His dad feels the same way about me but he won’t even think about giving me a chance.  I know these things take time and I’m happy his mom is very slowly starting to come around. But, I can’t help feeling angry and embarrassed about this all still. His dad is going as far as not talking to him for a few days because of this.   I think I’m just uncomfortable with how involved his parents are compared to mine. And of course my feelings are really hurt about the things I’ve heard them say but I just need to know if I’m the asshole for being so angry at them for this.   I also want to note I haven’t treated my bf differently due to this. We have talked about it but from what it sounds like he doesn’t really stand up for our relationship. Please feel free to give me the harsh truth if I’m in the wrong here. I’m a 20F so sometimes I just don’t see things in a healthy mature way.	1642922605.0	sao0tn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sao0tn/aita_for_being_angry_at_my_bfs_parents/	AITA For Being Angry At My BFs Parents?
dfe7qtc8	I [27M] am a middle child with older sister[32F] and younger brother [18M] when I was younger around 14 my sister got her first car the week after she got her license and that was fine obviously but when I got my license my parents refused to buy me one which I completely understood because our family was having money problems but around 2 months ago my younger brother got a car almost immediately after he got his license which I did not like the fact of at all since I didn’t get one even tho we are still currently in the same amount of money problems so it’s not like my parents just have enough money which in fact they didn’t but anyways I got mad and yelled and called names (which I regret) so AITA (sorry for little detail my first post on here)	1642922746.0	sao1zi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sao1zi/aita_for_getting_mad_that_my_younger_brother_got/	AITA for getting mad that my younger brother got a car
qs9c9n7	Im piggybacking off an earlier post about the Asian-themed gas station. It made me think about how we used to refer to the corner store in the town I lived in when I was a teenager.   For context, here in New Zealand, corner stores are called dairies, and there are a lot of them. Most of them are now owned by Indian families, but the town I grew up in was a medium sized rural town in the South Island and, especially back then, there were a lot fewer immigrants than there were in the cities or in the North Island.   This town had probably 7 or so dairies dotted around. Two of them were on the high street, only a few shops away from each other. The biggest and best one was owned by the Singh family, one of the few Indian families in a town that was predominantly pakeha (white) and Maori.  This dairy was referred to as the Indian dairy. The other dairy on the same street was referred to as “the other high street dairy”, usually with the unspoken implication that it was the worse dairy. The several other dairies in town were usually referred to by their street name or area.   Unlike the service station in the other post, this dairy didn’t sell anything especially Indian, and was very much just your average dairy, albeit one with good selection, above average customer service, and a slushy machine. But everyone knew and referred to it as the Indian diary, including the owners son who was in my year in high school.   At the time it didn’t feel like racism - dairies are weirdly essential parts of life in New Zealand and it felt more like an acknowledgement of this families importance in our small town. But I’m willing to accept that it may have come from a place of unnecessary othering. So we’re we the assholes?	1642922873.0	sao32s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sao32s/aita_for_calling_our_corner_store_the_indian_dairy/	AITA for calling our corner store ‘The Indian Dairy’
ixjyt6pt	So tonight I was delivering uber, and I got an order for Popeyes, Popeyes in notorious amongst the food  delivery apps,   Anyways I got an order, I check what the order consists of, and it was just a combo, probably costs like $13  So I head on there   I wait for the order and then it Flys over my head that the employee handed me a huge ass order, it was at least $50 in food, at least. So I took the heavy acss order, and then I drop it off to the customer's door, no contact. Then the timing... right as the cusotmer cane out to get their food, I notice a missed call, and It's from Popeyes. Then it hit me that they handed me the wrong order. By then the customer already took the food. On one hand, carrying the heavy order is exhausting, on the other hand I would've been embarrassed to go back and ask the customer for the food  What ends up happening now is that the restaurant will have to choose to make the order again and get paid once, or cancel it and they lose the money they spent on preparing it. As for the customers. Maybe my customer might request a refund, idk. As for the customer who was supposed to get the huge order, they probably have to wait for it to be made again or get a refund if the restaurant chooses not to make it again	1642924558.0	saoicu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saoicu/aita_for_just_walking_away_from_the_situation/	AITA for just walking away from the situation?
4z07wqz	Girlfriend has a guy best friend who I see as way too friendly to her to be “just friendly”  My girlfriend and I have a pretty good situation when it comes to trust. One thing that makes me uncomfortable, her guy best friend. I trust her not to cheat and this story may portray her in a worse light than it is but I really do trust her. She is very open to me about this guy and other guys she associates with and always lets me know if they do anything strange.  She tells me this guy she’s close friends with is a “man of god” and has no bad intentions towards her except as friends, and claims he’s never made her feel like he has feelings, and said I can meet him next time it’s possible (we are a long distance relationship for most the time, she left my city to go to school in another state but still comes back very frequently).   While the trust is good, what concerns me is that this guy goes very over the top for her. A year ago, before we were dating, he took her out on Valentine’s Day, but “as a friend”. And I see their text convos (she tries to be open to me and let’s me see how they talk) and he seems to go out of his way for someone he sees as “just a friend”. Today, he told her that he is going to take her out to dinner, let her choose where, and pay for her. And she told me that he said he also has multiple gifts that he’s planning on giving her during dinner.  She’s very honest about it but she disagrees with me that it’s flirty behavior, and says once I meet him, I’d understand it. In the past too, one time one of her guy friends started acting a bit too flirty, and she brought it up with me and was sad, saying she thought of him as a real platonic friend and was disappointed when that happened.   Personally, I do have some female friends but I never find myself taking them to eat in a date-like manner, and buying them gifts. With my female friends, it’s always extremely casual, I’m never buying them gifts or taking them out to dinner one on one. It seems a bit too friendly for me... she says he’s just was raised as a very chivalrous person, man of god, etc. but to me it seems very romantic the way he treats her. I feel like she’s just naiive when it comes to guy’s mindsets.   She told me that if he starting moving different that she’s tell me and respond accordingly, and I do trust her, but I’m in a weird position where I feel like I’m allowing another man to take her on what I’d consider a date, even though it’s “strictly friendly”.   I very much want for her to have good friends even if they’re guys, to know that she’s in good hands when she’s in another state than me, but I feel at some point there needs to be boundaries that are respected. I’m not trying to become controlling and take her away from her friends, but if this guy best friend starts making things too romantic or his actions start showing he has feelings for her, I feel like it would be disrespectful for her to continue hanging out with him and I’d want to let her know that too.   She’s been very good at communicating this all with me, and tells me everything that happens and also wants to make sure that this guy, or any other guy she’s associates with, isn’t trying to make a move on her. And if I really wanted, She’d cut them off if she had to, I just don’t wanna go that route. I’d hate to feel like I’m controlling and take her friends away from her just because of insecurity or fear, I just feel like a relationship requires a lot of respect and some sacrifices, and if her guy friend starts showing more interest where it becomes obvious how he feels about her, I do feel like she should cut ties out of respect for the relationship.   Basically, I’m wanting to know if I’m tripping or if I should be setting stronger boundaries. My fear is about coming off as controlling, when really I just feel like you have to behave different and have stricter boundaries with the opposite sex if you’re going to commit to a relationship, even if it involves cutting off certain people. The trust is there for sure but I want to feel respected at the same time.	1642924189.0	saoent	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saoent/aita_for_not_wanting_girlfriend_to_see_guyfriend/	AITA for not wanting girlfriend to see guy-friend one on one?

4reg58hk	I have a very low patience and I am trying to work on it. So I work at a Telecommunication company I am 20 and I am a fresher at this job.  It was my first day getting inbound calls ever in my life(I did outbounds yesterday) i get nervous easily and i got nervous twice and my colleague yelled at me saying "If you did it like that they will not keep you anymore" "your call got transferred to me cause you couldn't handle it probably"(also in a very very rude tone) but i believe she was very rude on the call. Saying "tsk, tsk" and getting irritated with the customer.   I am not angry with her but its making me even more nervous. Now she said that "don't handle calls anymore and just transfer it to me if you get one." Today is Sunday so we're only here to attend inbound calls and I think i was doing a pretty well job. No boss here neither manager to see the situation for themselves.   I just wanna confront her saying that "Idc if they kicked me out if they think if i couldn't do it well, when you're saying it like that making me even more nervous and feverish."	1642925119.0	saonzb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saonzb/aita_if_i_confronted_my_colleague/	AITA If i confronted my colleague?

Moreover, I'm 48 and have spent all of my Valentine's Day's alone. Yes, 48. I've hardly ever dated anyone and I've asked about 5 guys out in my life and they all said they only saw me as a friend.

hmdmi5s8	They are not officially dating, but they have for certain had sex a few times and are, as far as I know, looking to make it official. They have been family friends for years. Everybody (their family, their friends) is aware and, I'm assuming, okay with it. This has been going on for about two or three months now.  I've told her my concerns about him being nine years older than us (we are both 19) and she doesn't seem to care. Her response was that her grandma got married at 14 and had a child at 15, with an older guy. Also that her parents are 15 years apart.  I'm almost positive the women in his age range are too smart to put up with his bullshit, so he is going after someone less mature and experienced who will assume *they* are the problem when things go wrong. All of our friends seem to not mind/think it's cute, I feel like I'm the only sane one.  Everyone (including people on Reddit) are saying to mind my business, that I'm jealous, that she's an adult. Whatever, thats fine. I'm staying out of her life and letting her make her bed to lay in, so to speak. I guess I'm asking for reassurance that I'm not an asshole for thinking this is inappropriate.	1642925744.0	saotjg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saotjg/aita_for_saying_that_my_friend_f19_is_too_young/	AITA for saying that my friend (F19) is too young for her boyfriend (M28)
hm5e1pqp	I tunnel vision when I’m upset and it’s driving my partner up the wall.  For example, if I have an important assignment due or we’re on vacation, I still get upset about things and when I’m upset it’s like I totally lose my sense of place. I never yell, insult, or anything like that, but I feel the need to say something about it.   I do think my partner adds fuel to the fire. They tend to get defensive when I say anything and see it as an attack. Then they get upset/dismissive/angry that I’m upset which makes me feel unheard and makes me feel even worse.   Ex. If I was at the park with my partner, and they kept walking ahead of me without me, I would probably say they keep walking off without me. Then they go “I’m just walking, I’m not even doing anything” and then I’m like “there’s nothing wrong with walking I just feel like you’re leaving me behind” and it just keeps going. Then they get mad and I feel awful and try to ask them to understand how I feel. This kind of cycle happens a lot.   Obviously this is at least partially because they’re annoyed by the pattern of me doing this, but when I feel unheard I feel like I need to press the issue until I feel heard. There are a bunch of times when arguments have gone on for hours because of this and other things.   As time has gone on I feel more easily hurt and unheard by them and they feel more easily suffocated by what I’m doing. We’re trying to fix it but I really do think I need to find ways to not constantly get upset about things, they have told me that constantly fighting with me is making it hard to sympathize with things that I say.  I usually try to use a lot of “I feel” statements and acknowledge where I could have done better, saying a lot of things like “I understand your perspective” and “that’s true, I could have done that better, sorry about that” but it’s to the point that my partner just doesn’t want there to be a conversation about it all the time in the first place.  Can someone help me understand what’s up here and how I can do better? AITA or is there something I don’t get?	1642926114.0	saowvl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saowvl/aita_when_i_feel_unheard_but_they_feel_suffocated/	AITA when I feel unheard but they feel suffocated?

ixkznaow	My (40f) son Matt (18m) lives with me. His father is not in his life. He left when Matt was 12. Ever since, Matt has become reckless. Failing grades, going out drinking, etc. His curfew was 12am, but now because of his behavior, I am changing it to 9pm. I know he's 18, but he still lives under MY house. Until he can get a place of his own, he needs to obey my rules.   Thing is, Matt didn't take kindly to this. He's started opposing me in almost every way, such as starting parties once I'm gone or calling my cuss words. I confronted him as to why hates his mother so much, to the point where I cried. He dried my tears and said he's a monster and probably needs therapy. I told him he's my beautiful boy and I love him. For some reason, he took me to his room to show me something.  From that point on, he slowly unzips his pants and shoes his 9 inch cock in front of me. I haven't seen his cock since he was a 10-year-old boy. I didn't realize it became that big. Then, he tied my wrists and dicked me down on his bed. He fucked my pussy until his cum was all over it. He shoved his big dick in my mouth until it was down my throat until I gagged and puked all over it. He licked my puke off and stuck his fingers in my ass.   He fucks my armpit and cums on it, licking the cum off my armpit. Then he tossed my salad and licked my leftover shit (I just pooped an hour before this and forgot to wipe) and kisses me afterwards. He fucked my eyeball until blood leaked on his cock and now I'm blind. He fucked my ear too. Stuck his cock inside it and now his manhood is full of earwax. A week later he gave me STDs and cancer.   But I still didn't lift his curfew. He got angry and drove off.

ixk8gmic	Me and my ex best friend where friends for 3 YEARS!!! (Keep that in mind) exb = ex best friend    It started when I dyed  my hair WITHOUT my mom’s permission… and my exb kept saying the whole time “you better not blame this on me if you get In trouble LMAO” like I would blame it on her ? And I told her no why would I do that your my bestie. And her mom takes me back home. Well my exb wanted to see my moms reaction so she goes up to the door with me and as soon as she opened the door my mom was like … and said bye to my friend and giving me the mom look so finally I got in and she said to me (I don’t care that you died your hair I just care that you didn’t ask me first 👏🏼) Well I was grounded for 3 days but I still had my phone so I Texted my exb and said (Girl I got grounded lol I cant come to your house for like 3 days🥲) and she didn’t respond to my message and so I sent her some gifts on text messages and she still didn’t respond. so the next day comes and her and her mom come to our door and gave us some groceries because we were struggling at the time. So I helped bring in groceries and I came in and sat down her mom kinda took awhile. when her mom finally came in she started screaming at me and I am there just like 🤯 She basically said that I blamed my exb for everything ? when my mom wasn’t even mad so Finally I just decided to stop talking to my exb and she got mad … of course and 3~4 days later we here a knock at the door *knock knock * we answer and they said hi I am a cps worker and we have heard complaints about *RANDOM STUDF THAG WAS NOT TRUE* and she came in and everything was fine and they dismissed our case and then the next day my exb comments on my TikTok account about very private and personal family stuff going on with my mom at the time. And so I blocked her and threw away all contact. But around 8 or 9 months later I see my exb at a private school event and I gave her the most ugliest look and man talk about biggest glow down of 2021. so am I the ahole for not being friends with her anymore??	1642926723.0	sap2hc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sap2hc/aitah_of_my_toxic_ex_best_friend_story_time_true/	AITAH??? ⁉️📌 of my TOXIC ex best friend???

I had this friend, who we’ll call T, in 7th grade. She was very pretty and pretty popular too. Not sure how to say this without it sounding weird but she was quite “developed” in the chest region. She always wore really deep cut shirts where you could almost see basically everything. Mind you we were like 13/14. Anytime we had a conversation she would stick her chest out further in ur face while talking. Eventually i just pulled her aside and told her that her shirts may be too revealing and i was afraid that something could happen to her since she walked home from school everyday. She stared at me in disgust, said ok, and just walked away. I soon figured out she told everyone in my friend group who called me an asshole for trying to tell her what to wear and that she can wear whatever she wants. This story has been on my mind for so long that i’ve thought about it and thought i possibly could be the asshole but i was just looking out for my friend.

Fast forward to the big day we're eating, it was kinda awkward could tell this would be the only date we're doing and here comes the bill...she said I have a few gift cards and the waiter asked if we were paying separately I said no and let her go to charge the cards. The girl wasn't happy with me lol she thought I was going to pay for my part.

hxnribhx	I know this sounds absolutely horrible but hear me out.   When I was around 12, my father used to have this dog he let freely roam the house, he would open any closed doors so she didn’t feel ‘trapped’. And she always used my room as a huge litter box. No medical reason for it, and she didn’t do it to anyone else, but it bothered the hell out of me. I’m a dog person, I loved the dog, but I told my dad he wasn’t allowed to let his dog in my room anymore.   This continued for months, and every time it just made me angrier and angrier. Obviously I couldn’t really do anything about it, because I wasn’t going to punish the dog after it happened and she didn’t know what I was upset about, and no amount of telling my dad to keep the dog out of my room worked.   Well one day I came home from school, sat on my bed and sat right in a puddle of cold dog piss. On my BED!!! That was my last straw. I don’t know why it never occurred to me to just get a lock for my door, but the next day while my dad was at work, my evil little preteen brain formed what I thought was the best idea of my life.   I was going to show him just how annoying that was. So, I fed the dog a huge amount and took her outside. Sure enough, she dropped a whopper out there.   I took a shovel, picked it up, carried it inside and plopped it right smack dab on top of my dads bed.   When he got home from work, he wasn’t really mad, just kind of glared at me as he carried the sheets into the laundry room and told me I had won and he would keep the dog out of my room, and we’ve even laughed about it a few times, but recently the subject came up while I was talking to my aunt, and she called me a huge jerk for it, saying that was disgusting and I was a horrible daughter for doing that.

ixlnsoit	I (39f) am a single mother with a daughter we'll call her Beth (18f). We lived together after her father has exhibited... concerning behavior. My ex husband Rick (43m) has always wanted to get back into Beth's life. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but he's been pestering me about it. I've expressed the idea to Beth, she opposed. But Rick keeps reassuring that he is a changed man with changed morals. He even bought her a car.  I invited Rick into our home, without Beth's knowledge. I didn't expect her to come home so early, but apparently she had a half day at school. She was outraged, complaining about why I'm "opening up my legs" to Rick and accused me of being a whore. She's very upset because of Rick's behavior. I showed her the new car. She ended up rejecting, spitting on it, and opposing Rick at every situation. Rick decided that we needed to talk at the dinner table. We did.   Rick explained how much he's changed and he had another gift for Beth, something he saved for her 16 years ago. He goes to his car and brings out something large. He suddenly turns off the lights only to reveal Beth being dicked down by a large vibrator. She loved every second of it and thought it felt good. Then Rick made me give her a rim job and forcibly puke all over her ass. Then Rick made me lick the puke out of her ass alongside her shit in her asshole. Then he shoved his cock into my throat and I sucked all of his babies out.  Then me and Beth made out while Rick fucks me in the ass, while fucking Beth with a vibrator in her ass. Then we both sucked his cock like lollipops. Cum was all over our faces. Then he shoved his dick into our eyeballs, until blood is all over us and gunk of flesh. Then he opened Beth's brain, killing her, and sticking his dick inside it. He fucked her brain in and out. Then he made me eat her brain. We threw her dead body in the trashcan where Rick ended up fucking her deceased pussy. Then Rick made me fuck my dog.

92ziiouy	to start off i'm (15f) very confused about my life right now. i've taken time to compile a list of the events that i clearly remember happeneing and am listing them down over here. i feel like i'm the asshole because i might be over reacting 1. a little while before we moved i slipped on the floor which had tile-type flooring. the first thing that hit the ground was my knee and as you can probably tell, it hurt like a bitch. i ignored it then but at random moments my leg would be acting up and i’d have severe moments of pain. i never told anybody because all of my childhood my dad kept telling me i was overreacting about my pain.the more and more this happened i started to disregard and invalidate my own pain. for this reason i waited 3-6 weeks before telling my dad. on the way to school, i was getting out of the car and about to head to the front of the school when there was a sudden burst of pain in my knee. it was so bad that i started crying and i held my kneecap. i don’t remember exactly but i think my knees were buckling.my dad on the other hand yelled at me for the following reasons a) making a scene and holding up other drivers b) for being weak and crying when we went home he didn’t bother taking me to the hospital. instead he had my mom take me. at the hospital it was revealed that my growth plate had a crack in it and they gave me a cast. to this day i’m so hurt as to why my dad didn’t even bother to come out of the car and check on me when i was crying. 2.he’s always said very mean thing to me. so here are some examples of what he’s said to me, my sister, or the both of us. a. “i’m not mad, im just shocked at how dumb you are” b. “some parents want to adopt, i want to do the reverse of that” (he wants to give us up)  c. “i wonder where i went wrong raising you” d. called me a chihuahua repeatedpt even if i’ve expressed my distaste  e. called me pimple face repeatedly f. “you’re so skinny that you’ll fly away if the wind blows”  g. i only get to wear what he deems appropriate the biggest problems i have are 1. when he yells he throws things around and breaks things.and afterwards he’ll come back like nothing ever happened 2.he always manipulates me into thinking he’s the victim 3. he denies doing anything to the point where i feel like i’m imaging things. i clearly remembered him saying the adoption thing i mentioned earlier but because of how strongly and confidently he denied it, im starting to think that im crazy. aita?	1642928068.0	sapdv6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sapdv6/aita_for_what_i_fee/	AITA for what i fee?
ixlqnhx0	I met someone through a mutual friend. I've known her for about 5 years, but I've started to see her differently recently.   I have a pretty huge crush on her as of late and I've tried to talk to her one on one and ask her about her life and generally show I'm interested, but she doesn't really seem interested in dating.  I asked her casually if she has been seeing anyone or anything like that, and she laughed and said that her life has been too stressful to date anyone.

i5w8ure6	I already made a post in r/badroommates but i wanted to make sure to cover my bases when asking the reddit gods for help. like legitimately, i'm at a breaking point. i just genuinely don't know what to do. I (19F)  have 3 roommates R (19F), N (19F), and E (20F). and i'm at a point where i just can take it anymore... i'm currently writing this at almost 2:30 am, i have work tomorrow meanwhile R &amp; N are doing god knows what in the kitchen but it's loud as hell and im just trying to sleep after my 8+ hour shift today. this is a recurring issue with R N and E always being loud as fuck late at night fully knowing i have work (or worse my 8 am class) the next morning, not even inviting me to join the hang out... many of these late nights are spurred on by alcohol provided by E's boyfriend (21 M). it just feels inconsiderate but i feel like i can never say anything because it's 3 (or 4) against 1. even though i've never done anything wrong that i'm aware of it feels like just hate me and give absolutely no fucks about me. this is among many other issues.   another big issue is that, as someone with multiple lung issues, i discussed with them before moving in how important it is that we as a unit stay as covid safe as possible so i don't end up hospitalized or worse (i am fully vaxxed and boosted) to which they all agreed. flash forward N, E and E's boyfriend all get covid...   i understand things happen but E never even got her first dose of the vaccine, works as a waitress at a wing bar and her boyfriend is in a frat. initially they all went home to quarantine so that's not where the issue lies. my big issue lies with E showing back up at the apartment unannounced with no mask in sight... 3 days later when she literally still has covid, N was back about 2 days after that. i just don't know what to do with any of these issues, the lease isn't up until june.. there are times that i seriously question my sanity and think that maybe i am the one in the wrong here i genuinely don't know but every time i look at it objectively or explain situations to people avoiding any biased or loaded words they agree that i'm not the issue. this really is a cry for reddit's help as someone who is nd and grew up an only child... i genuinely have no idea what to do or how to approach this situation.  *for additional context, we each have our own bedroom and bathroom with us all sharing a living room/kitchen area... my room has become a disaster as i've taken to eating in here because i don't feel comfortable or welcome in our common area, i feel trapped and confined to my room. i've learned to live with the emotional pain they've caused me but god i just want i be able to actually cook and then eat my dinner on the couch, i want to sleep at night, i don't want to have to drive the hour to my parents house every time i get a day off of work so i can get the tiniest bit of rest...  am i in the wrong here? would i be the asshole to bring these issues up and disturb the way in which we coexist?	1642928957.0	saplua	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saplua/wibta_for_bringing_up_issues_with_my_roommates/	WIBTA for bringing up issues with my roommates and making waves even though it's really just a "me problem" ?
ixm7y9o3	My husband has been staying long term in the hospital.  I go to a class and I had had several conversations with a classmate and I found myself feeling attracted to him. I really didn't want to think about him so I remember sometimes I would purposely rush out the door after class so he couldn't strike up conversation as he normally does but last week he struck up a conversation with me and we ended up talking awhile. He doesn't know I'm married by the way because my husband and I don't have wedding rings.  I ended up asking him if he wanted to grab a coffee sometime and he said no, he doesn't have time to meet outside of class.  To be honest, in my mind I did think of it as a date, but it could easily have been interpreted as a friendly thing.  Part of me feels that I should give my husband full disclosure and let him know that I attempted to date someone else but was turned down and part of me dreads doing so because he will be sad and anyways it's not like I specifically asked for a date (even though that was my intention) and it didn't go any further. I plan to be vigilant and try to avoid such situations in the future, like having in depth conversations with men.  I normally only talk to other women anyways.  I do want to be with my husband but had a moment of weakness because he's been gone so long.  Should I tell him or WIBTA if I don't say anything?	1642929745.0	sapsr2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sapsr2/wibta_if_i_dont_tell_my_husband_i_tried_to_ask/	WIBTA if I don't tell my husband I tried to ask another man on a date, if he declined anyways and the wording I used could have been interpreted as friends?
1g9mxxcs	I (F 29) and getting married in a few months, and I live a few states away from where I grew up and went to college. My close friend (f 30), whom I will call Kayla, recently told me she can’t afford to come. She was supposed to be a bridesmaid.   Kayla had a baby a year ago with her husband, and neither make a lot of money with their jobs. They also have a lot of debt. Of course I understand that it’s difficult to travel, and I don’t expect anyone to bankrupt themselves to come to my wedding. However, I planned a long engagement (1.6 years) due to the world circumstances and financially planning for the wedding.   But the thing is, she came down to visit with her husband in June of last year. I also offered my spare bedroom, a ticket voucher and to pay for half of her ticket- but I couldn’t spring for half of her husband’s. She seemed unwilling to stay with me, come without her husband and wouldn’t accept money.   I just feel very hurt, and like I’m not a priority for her. I’m generally the one that reaches out to her as well, and I very often don’t get a response back.   I’ve asked everyone in my life, and they think I’m being too understanding- especially as I offered to help.

p2gp5	 Hi reddit. 3:23 in the morning and I think I'm an asshole.  I'm a stand up comedian "hobbyist" which means professional comedians hate me - I'm taking stage time that they need to make money, and I don't need the money, but I need to get shit off my chest that's funny, and I'm too cheap to talk to a therapist, and my experiment in saving money by hiring a hooker to sub in for a therapist (to talk to, not for sex) led to her showing me her collection of professional videos, which weren't to my taste, and ... look, stand up comedy is where I get my therapy now. No one shows me videos of themselves getting gangbanged in a strawberry field by migrant workers anymore.  I recently moved to a new state. I'm an unknown comedian here. That means open mics again. There aren't any where I live. I'm not willing to drive an hour to open mic. I'm too old for that shit, and I have a day job. Gig led to another gig. They want clean comedy. Fuck. That rules out all my bits. Wrote new clean material. Deliver it. Someone gave me a dildo 10 minutes in. My audience turned into CSI: Special Dildo Investigation.  There were kids.  The owner of the place I wanted to perform at regularly saw a clip this. Said I was too raunchy. FUCK! I accidentally found the guy who used to do shows there but doesn't anymore. I called the guy, chatted briefly. He had a show planned in my state. I bought tickets to his show so he's at least getting money from me.  Went to the show. Chatted him up for details and advice on my local scene. You can't read standup, it doesn't work unless it's spoken and timed, so I need test audiences for new material and I'm getting blacklisted where I live for being dirty. Because someone gave me a dildo at a show.   He asked me to send him a headshot and a resume and to call him tomorrow. I have a day job. A nice one. I'm not going to give up six figures to travel around trying to convince people that I'm funny. I'm just a hobbyist. The kind of stage time waster that professionals hate. All I'd have to show for it in 10 years is more funny stories and regret that I gave up a solid career to do it.  He doesn't know that yet. But I don't want him to know all of that because I need to pick his brain about everything in my local area, which he knows well!  He doesn't drink, so I can't bribe him with beer, and I asked some other comics who said straight trying to pay him to talk to me is tacky, so I'm stuck.  I feel like I'm trying to manipulate someone into being my friend to advance myself; he's hilarious and I love his stuff, and it would be cool to be part of it, but I don't want that, I just want to know why the place 5 miles away from the place that gave me a dildo thinks that's too dirty. I'm pretty sure the same customers drink at both places.  Not sure what to do. I don't want to be an asshole. I want to try bribing him, but I've been told that'd be an asshole move too. I feel like all roads lead to assholery.	1642929692.0	saps9q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saps9q/aita_for_trying_to_manipulate_someone/	AITA for trying to manipulate someone?
ixmmpx6s	I have shit English don't bother mentioning it in the comments.  I was at the gym and I was using that bench thing that you can do sit ups on with weights. As I was doing them 2 girls with booty shorts right in front of me do squats. You can literally see their asses through it as they're doing the squats. I'm not trying to look but I have no choice as they're in front of me. I just do my sit ups and not really pay attention.  Well a third girl shows up (not sure if she knows them) and says "hey creep can you stop staring at their asses, what the fuck is wrong with you"  One of the girls in front of me doing squats looks at me and says "eww you look like a creep too"  I get really fucking pissed at this moment and yell "Im just trying to do my fuckign sit ups in peace, you all moved in front of me,  I am not here to look at your asses nor do I want to see that because none of you are attractive, If you don't want people to look at your ass don't wear booty shorts and squat in their face. now shut the fuck up and let me do my sit ups. "  They all leave and 5 minutes later some gym employee comes up to me and asks me to leave the gym for making them feel uncomfortable. I told him no fucking way I'm leaving. He then says I made the women feel uncomfortable and they have no choice. I explain my side of the story and he says he doesn't care. I then say "lets go check the cameras, it coincides with what im saying" another gym employee says "we should be fair and do that"  We go to the cameras and those 3 cunts come back over and ask why I haven't left the gym yet. The camera then shows I was in teh right. I say "are you guys all fucking happy now? Now fuck off and let me work out in peace fucking stupid cocksuckers"  The cunts are then screaming "now what hte fuck you aren't going to make him leave" I don't know what else happened but they all left. They left their shit in the gym because I left 40 minutes later and they still didn't come back. Not sure if they were forced out or left on their own. One of them had one of those really expensive metal water bottles so I took it home.	1642930245.0	sapwzl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sapwzl/aita_for_telling_a_girl_at_the_gym_not_to_shove/	AITA for telling a girl at the gym not to shove her ass in my face if she doesn't want me to look at her ass?

d65q1wuy	So I(13f) have two friends named Ava and Alice (fake names for privacy)  So my friend Ava has a HUGE crush on Alice and she told her a few weeks ago. Ava had told me about her crush about a week before she told Alice and it honestly didn't surprise me.   When Ava confessed to Alice she kind of freaked out. Alice isn't very good under pressure and just said "Oh... ok" instead of rejecting her. Of course I don't blame her at all as Ava put her on the spot in front of basically all of our mutual friends.   Now Alice was pretty mad at me for not telling her about Ava's crush and I felt pretty bad about it. Of course I wouldn't want to tell my friends secret but I could have prevented a drama in our friend group and I still feel a bit guilty but Alice forgave me.   So Alice got a boyfriend a few days ago. Her new boyfriend is really nice and a pretty good dude overall. But Ava (unsurprisingly) REALLY doesn't like him. She has the mentality the he "stole Alice away from her" and "Alice was supposed to be HER girlfriend. Not his". Now Alice is (and always has been) straight. Even though Alice makes it very clear she is hetero and not interested in girls Ava pretty much disregarded it and asked her out anyway.  I was talking to Ava yesterday while we were hanging out with our friend group (Alice's boyfriend wasn't there) and she said, and I qoute " even though she has a boyfriend she still dropping hints. Do you think I should ask her out again".   Honestly I was kind of tired of all the drama it was causing and was already in a bit of a sour mood as she had been asking this question over and over since Alice started dating her boyfriend I just said, "No she isn't interested and she never will be. Can't you just drop it? She doesn't like girls and she has already made it very clear she doesn't want to be In a relationship with you. She is happy with her boyfriend already so can you stop being salty about it? It's causing unnecessary drama and you've been making her uncomfortable for weeks."  Once I had said that everyone had stopped talking and we're looking at us. Ava had started crying and ran off without saying anything. And she called me and yelled at me for embarrassing her when she got home.  Alice thanked me for standing up for her but she said I was too harsh and some of our friends were saying I was an asshole to Ava.  So, AITA for telling her to stop trying to ask out Alice?	1642932544.0	saqh2t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqh2t/aita_for_telling_my_friend_someone_wouldnt_date/	AITA for telling my friend someone wouldn't date her?

2uuwg3dr	So, I (18F) dated this girl (19F) for two years. I was 16 when we first started going out and some things had happened surrounding my birthday and some other stuff that followed and I felt it difficult to trust her fully after that. But, she was my first love so I held on for a long time. I broke up in person as I still cared alot about her and I know she did for me too - she made it clear she wanted to remain in my life, and I did too. we agreed to be friends but take some time.  I get a message a couple days after as she replies to my story. the conversation goes along the lines of "I miss you, its not the same, i still have strong feelings for you and I don't know if i can get past that." and that she was heartbroken and had been crying non stop. i said "take the time you need, i want you in my life but you need to focus on yourself right now." She was weirdly pushing for an definite answer about how I felt about her, which was a bit strange but i brushed it to one side. we had a convo a few days later just talking as we used to and we both agreed how nice it was, and that we missed each other.  She posts to her private story of her in someone elses bed a day or two after that convo, someone shes never mentioned before. I text her saying "are you with someone new? if you are, i think being friends isn't a great idea, i don't want your new girl to feel conscious shes messaging her ex." and to be honest i was hurt she'd moved on so fast, especially since it was a long relationship and i was still upset about it. She reassured me it was just a friend and that she "would be a terrible partner if she had started seeing someone else already." which i apologised and said i must've been overreacting and I'd leave her be.  The night I was due to go out with some friends, I recieve a message from another close friend saying a girl she had matched with on a dating app was on my ex's private story briefly, i figured they were just friends. later in the evening, i stepped out of the club and shes stood, holding hands with this new girl in the queue to get in, the girl my friend had matched with on this app. They were being very lovey with each other. and drunken and hurt me went up to them and said something along the lines of "you're a liar, i hope you make each other miserable." she looked at me blankly and went back to her conversation. I broke down on a nearby street and went home. Turns out she had been on tinder 48 hours after we broke up, a day before she had the conversation that i broke her heart and so on. I saw her get into a taxi about 30 mins later, i wouldn't be surprised if she did it to get a reaction.   A few texts exchanged later and blocking her on everything, I think I overreacted. We broke up, so she should do what she wants, i want her to be happy but was hurt that it was so soon, and so raw, its not even been 2 weeks. AITA? do i deserve to be upset or am i being crazy?	1642932949.0	saqkp7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqkp7/aita_for_getting_angry_at_my_ex_showing_up_with/	AITA for getting angry at my ex showing up with hew new gf days after we ended it?
i0hi3g9g	I'm a freshman in college, and I joined a sorority. My boyfriend is a junior in college, and well, studies and play video games. He used to go out a lot but doesn't as much anymore. He isn't in a fraternity or anything, but he trusts that I would never leave him over some guy in a fraternity. (No hate to fraternities, majority of the guys I know are just gross so it's a personal distaste, some are super down to earth and cool!). This bugs him, which bugs me. I don't want him to worry about me doing something disloyal when I go out. No matter how intoxicated I am, I know my limits and I know my boundaries. I know part of this has to do with his insecurities because his ex was...not the best person to be in a relationship with. He told me he's working on his insecurities, but he still gets upset whenever I go out. Should I stop? I'm trying to put myself in his shoes but it's hard because I trust myself 100% that I would NEVER hurt him.

7ewjnyap	I am in my twenties have been friends with 'Amy' who is in her forties. We met at work, we get on really well and enjoy each other's company.  Last year, she came round beginning of November and left a parcel at my house that she had picked up on the way. I texted her and reminded her to pick it up after she left. For context, she lives 15 minutes away in the next town, but is often at the pubs in my town anyway because she likes them better. I see her round and say hi, but she never collects her parcel, despite often being in my town. It's a short walk from my house to the town centre. I keep reminding her to please come, she says she will. Meanwhile, I'm moving house and let her know she should come and collect it before I move as I'm downsizing and have very little extra space, and the parcel isn't small. I am also moving further away from her so it would make sense for her to come collect it while I still live nearby.  Everytime we plan to hang out from the time she left the parcel, she bails on me last minute or says she's tired after work, so it's left uncollected. I still see her around the pubs where I live which makes me frustrated that she doesn't have a moment to swing by and collect it. She messages me and asks to hang out a few times since, but then bails. I understand people are busy and if she came to hang out then she could collect her parcel, but she bails on me every time. She has also done this in the past before the parcel incident and she can be forgetful.   Fast forward to now, we still haven't met up despite my attempts and reminding her about her parcel. Her parcel is in my house 3 months later. This weekend I'm cleaning up the old place before returning the keys, and there are a couple of items to move, including her parcel. I text her again and ask her to please come and collect it. She says she will definitely come on Saturday evening (yesterday) and she will text me when she is on her way. I wait and do the cleaning. She is supposed to arrive around 7pm but never comes. I see that she has been on all her socials, but not messaged me and never came round. Now I'm really annoyed, because I have to leave this house empty and I don't want to keep carrying around her parcel for her. Up until I reminded her, she forgot all about it, so I was considering giving it to charity as it's been at my house for 3 months now, and this part may make me the asshole. I don't know if I should keep pushing and texting her when it's already been 3 months. For context, it's one item of clothing. Not sure how expensive it is, but it's from one of those websites similar to ASOS.  EDIT: our friendship has been slowly growing apart since around November, as I feel like she forgets about me and bails all the time. This is nothing to do with the parcel, but more the way she treats me. I know she struggles with a few personal things, and I have always tried to help her, but I feel like it's a very one-sided friendship at this point.

5bpg598q	For context my cousin and I practically grew up together and I see her as a little sister, but I recently followed her insta and I didn’t expect her to be posting some thirst traps. These pictures weren’t super, “trappy” , I guess but i could clearly tell they were thirst traps for likes.   These photos made me feel really uncomfortable and so I decided to unfollow, but when I unfollowed she messaged me asking why I did it. I was honest with her and told her that the pics made me uncomfortable and I didn’t want to see those kind of photos especially of family, but she chose to block me and not message back. I don’t know if I did something wrong or what so, AITA?	1642934216.0	saqvwl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqvwl/aita_for_unfollowing_my_cousin_because_her_insta/	AITA for unfollowing my cousin because her insta made me uncomfortable?
7o935p9q	I really don't know what to do anymore which is why I went on here because I feel like I'm going crazy.  The story is, my brother is 12 years old. He can fully take care of himself but chooses not to. Instead, he wakes up late, he's always on his gadgets, He isn't disciplined correctly, he complains when someone asks him to do something (like chores around the house) and he's also very pampered by my mom. Her excuse for his behaviour is because "he's just a child". I'm the first born daughter and I don't remember her EVER letting me off things so easily.   For example: I was organising books to place on our shelf, I asked him to grab my slippers because I was wearing his. He goes and yells at me, I know it's not an excuse but I was so fed up with him I threw a book at him. I know that was a very mean move and I don't have a valid excuse for what I did but I couldn't take it anymore, he ran to tell our mother what I did and she yelled at me too. I tried reasoning out with her, I told her that I was mad because he yells at me over the smallest of things. He also blames everything on me and somehow she believes everything.  She still yelled at me saying "You're the oldest you should know better"... I gave up the argument and just finished fixing the books up then locked myself up in my room and did my homework because I know for a fact I wasn't going to win.  The most recent problem I have happened today. It was time for lunch and I called everyone over to the table.   He said he didn't want to eat with him around which I know hurt my dad's feelings because why wouldn't it?. He went back to his phone and kept watching all those genshin videos. I mentioned it while eating, I asked my mom if he's just gonna let him off like that, and my dad also said something along the lines of ' he should have a consequence when he does that' , she just kept quiet and ate her food but I could tell she was mad.  I tried to make small talk to change the subject, I asked how the food was and other stuff but she just told me to keep on eating which is basically a very stern "shut up".   I heard her talk, she basically said I should just stick with my dad and listen to everything he says because I'm a brat who doesn't do what she wants me to do. Keep in mind that I only mentioned his behaviour at the table, I wasn't yelling or banging things around. I just asked if she's going to scold him.  Another piece of info, my dad was kind of absent at different times throughout our childhood, and when he's with us back then, he'd hit us with sticks and yell at us if we were disobedient, I'm still not pass that but Idrca.  Am I the bad person?I started the argument and now she'll sleep at my brother's room, she ignores me constantly. I don't even know what to feel anymore because it was said before, in past arguments she and my dad have that I'm the reason why they fight. I'm 15 so I should already know how to process these things but idk	1642934920.0	sar235	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar235/aita_for_saying_something_about_my_brother_mi/	AITA for saying something about my brother?

ixncxar1	Me (20F) and one of my bestfriends (20F) (we'll call her M from now on) have been friends for a really long time. Another one of my friends (19F), we'll call her L, has recently come back from studying abroad for a year and last week we met for coffee to catch up on our lives. M has never been friends with L, and in fact, she practicaly hates her.  The other day, M found out about me meeting with L and is now really angry with me and saying that since I'm her best friend and she hates L I shouldn't meet with her nor be her friend at all.  The thing is, when I was in highschool, I was bullied by this kid, A, and even now I can barely look at him without feeling pure disgust. M is friends with A, even knowing what he did to me in HS, but I've never told her anything, I simply asked her not to talk about him in front of me and we'd be good.  So now, she asked me to either be her friend or L's and when I told her no and brought up her and A, she said that it was different (I don't see how) and that I should stop being friends with L. She's making me feel like and asshole for not being on her side on this and saying that L is not good for me.  I know she's my best friend, but me and L are really good friends too and I don't want to lose either friendships.

isbehsdx	This is still happening as we speak and I feel horrible.    My town has high crime and car break-ins are normal here. There are a few groups of young adult males who go around every other night and steal cars or whatever is in them. They have shot and killed people multiple times in the past few years and never been caught.   I live in a gated community and they found their way into my neighborhood last month.  I feel like such an AH right now.... I walked outside at 4 am and saw a group of teen-looking males with flashlights looking into and ‘shuffling’ through cars. They were going from car to car on the dark side of my complex. It also recently snowed here so they were wearing hoodies and I couldn’t see their faces. I watched them go from car to car to car with flashlights and trying handles before I decided to call the cops. I told the dispatcher it’s not an emergency but I see males possibly going through cars and my community has recently been burglarized so I would like it if they checked it out.  The cops show up and when I look outside the males are in their cars. The same cars they were going through. They were probably looking for something and possibly heading home or to work and I just messed up their morning. I assumed they were breaking into cars with no proof and the cops have been questioning them for 30 minutes now. What have I done...

ixo96vqe	I am genuinely curious if my feelings are valid or if I’m being and ungrateful b!tch.   When my mental health goes downhill the first thing to go wrong is my room. I lack the energy and motivation to keep it clean to the point where you can’t see the floor and there’s no space left on my desk. Whilst it can look quite bad it is still an organised mess where I know where everything is located. During theses times when my room is a mess I keep my door closed as I feel guilty and embarrassed with the state of it and try hide it from my family. When my mental health starts to get better cleaning my room is one of the first tasks I can complete and this simple task gives me so much satisfaction as it’s a reminder things are on the mend.   On a few occasions my mum has stepped in whilst I’m at work and cleaned my room for me. Whilst I understand this is her trying to help me It has made me feel worse about myself. When this has happened it’s made me feel like more of a failure as I was unable to complete such a simple task, as well as feeling frustrated because it’s no longer an organised mess and I’m unsure where half of my things are. I have tried explaining my feelings to mum, the reason why my room can sometimes look like a mess and how cleaning it myself provides me that feeling of success and a positive change. Despite this she has continued to clean my room when it gets messy.   The last time this happened some things went missing (most specifically an expensive  ring I had purchased 2weeks prior. I do not blame her for the ring going missing it was just upsetting knowing where it was and coming home to everything moved around and being unable to locate the ring) and caused my anger. I complained to mum how I don’t appreciate her cleaning the room and telling her to stay out of my room once again explain the why it happens and why I’d like to be the one to clean my room myself, even if it takes some time to complete the task. Her response was along the lines of ‘this is my house, I will do whatever I like with it.’  So ATIA for getting upset and mad with her for cleaning my room?	1642935735.0	sar9yz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar9yz/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mum_for_cleaning_my/	AITA for getting mad at my mum for cleaning my room
7r5sscpc	I’m 22f who apparently ruined a good date my bf 21m had planned out for me.   bf is dependent on his parents, lives with them ( Al though is trying to change this situation) obeys them, says he has to because they pay for his whole life at the moment but this often comes at the expense of our relationship or us having a good time.  This is only ONE of many experiences that have been worse.   We went out on a date after 3 weeks, we’d been apart because he always slept or cancelled the dates prior and then got Covid which his dad gave him cause neither of them decided it was best to isolate rather than sleep in the same room. Their home is small so yes they share a bedroom.   He took me to a place I really wanted to go, he drives every time  I don’t due to physical disabilities so we had a very nice day. Not having met him for a while I just wanted to talk to him for a bit,hold his hand have an actual conversation for 20 mins before we get going home. He knew this.   We park the car and his mum calls him, asks where he is and immediately says oh she and her friends and his dad were coming there too. Then says we can’t join them even tho nobody asked. So immediately after the call he says let’s get going home cause my parents are coming and they’ll see us. ( his parents know everything about us) apparently his mums friends are too judgmental to see him with a girl and will raise eyebrows and say things to his mum. So to avoid that we had to leave the parking lot and our conversation. as if his mums friends would directly spawn in front of our vehicle and stare at us? This really pissed me off and the entire 1 hour drive back home I didn’t say anything! Before leaving I told him It wasn’t nice what he did or he could at least park somewhere else. I also told him will he refrain from marrying me because the mothers friends may judge ( I’m a different religion and they’re religious). And said how can I believe he won’t always be the same? He said I’m very pessimistic. Don’t trust that he will change once he’s independent. He tried his best and the date was ruined because of me.  I cried and left haven’t spoken much since.

53o2lw1w	Hey guys,  Hope things are well.  I am thinking of getting two earlobe piercings for the first time. I expressed my interest to my parents. My dad didn’t seem to care that much. My mom supported the idea for me to get it one day, but I didn’t tell her when I would get it.   I asked her one day if I can get it while at my parents home and she said no, so I plan on getting it at college.   In terms of finances, I will use my own money. I plan on getting two studs. In terms of professional reputation, I just want simple piercings, so my piercings won’t get in the way of my employment.   If I ask my parents permission for the piercings I feel they will just postpone it for some other day. However, if I get them during college and they see, I feel they will be surprised but eventually get used to it.   I am just worried that my parents will take the action in the wrong way, thinking it’s about rebelling or something. The truth is, I just think piercings would add some sparkle to my outfit.   I am a hard working student and am respectful to my parents. However, I really want to get piercings and don’t want to end up damaging my relationship with them in any way. I’m financially dependent on them, but am using my own money for the purchase.  AITA?

cxrhxjt6	(TW: Domestic Violence) english is not my main language, sorry if I make mistakes.  I (F24) have a friend (F24) from high school whom I rarely talk to. We follow each other from social media and like each other's posts and that's pretty much it. I am a lawyer so one day she asked me for a legal advice on something. We had a little chat afterwards and I asked her how is everything going in her life (I knew she was a teacher and had a bf)  She basically broke down crying and started telling me every bad thing going on in her life. We talked for 40 minutes. I was not that busy so I listened to her.   Here's what she told me while constantly crying, sobbing and generally being in a sad mood;  1. Her bf hit her. He slapped her face for something he was mad about. She sent him away but he kept apologizing  2. Her best friend told her she was not invited to her wedding party  (It's a traditional all girls wedding party, kind of like a bacholerette party) because she didn't go to some other event and her best friend was mad at her. Her best friend also called her a whore for this.  3. Her co-worker screwed her over and basically got some money which was rightfully earned by her. She did some extra work on a project but didn't get any money from it. Her co-worker claimed the work and got paid. Actually this was the reason she reached out to me in the first place.  I was horrified. I have never heard such horrible stories at the same time from the same person. To me, this is like a life-time trauma that I would have to deal with. I was shocked how she surrounded herself with so many toxic people. I told her to cut all of those people out of her life immediately. I told her to break up with the bf and never see him; tell your so called bff to f*** off for calling you a whore for no reason and sue that co-worker and get your money.  She said OK and we didn't talk for couple of months.   She recently posted a story about how much she loves her bf and best friend and nothing can come between them. And I asked her 'Is this about me?' And she said yes. She said I interfered with her life while she never asked for my advice. She said that I didn't know any of the people she told me and had no right to manipulate her like this. She said she is better than ever and so happy that she didn't listen to me.   Now I wonder; AITA for giving her all the advice? Should have I just listened and not say anything?	1642935710.0	sar9oh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar9oh/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_should_cut_some/	AITA for telling my friend she should cut some people out of her life?
itjbvblo	 My family and I went on vacation for two weeks, we planned on going to the zoo hoping it would be fun for the whole family. My daughter is an introvert, she stays inside every day, doesn’t have many friends etc. The day before we went she confessed that she didn’t want to go and that she wanted to stay home by herself, that. “The zoos for babies plus who wants to walk around for five hours and watch animals sleep in cages.” I told her that, “you will go whether you likes or not, we are on holidays and if you wanted to stay in bed all day you should’ve just stayed home.” She rolled her eyes and explained that she couldn’t stay home because I wouldn’t let her, she then left and had a shower.  The next day we went to the zoo and the entire time she was sulking and ignoring me. At the end of the day I asked her if she had fun and she said that she didn’t because it’s like every other zoo and I was an asshole for forcing her to go.

a0ei0mxm	(For reference I'm functionaly my little sister's other parent we don't have a dad and my mom always devolves into punishment when she posts pics like this)  My little sister (16) has been posting inappropriate pics of herself on insta. The pictures have escalated in their provocative nature, last year her feed was normal teen girl stuff selfies and her dog and now her boobs are the center of every pic in low cut tops from weird angles and sexual poses. I know what it looks like, there is no way she isn't posing it on purpose, it can't really be explained away with ignorance. Her boobs are literally every photo. What makes it worse is she won't private her account even after repeated requests to do so and her face is in every photo.  My mom and I have tried to reach out to her before and explain why this is inappropriate and not ok for her to do. But sis just gets angry or starts crying. She has a lot of body insecurities and I think the pics are her way of seeking validation. Even if she takes them down I think she'll just create a secret account. I don't want to push the topic again an alienate her or make her feel bad. Should I just let her make mistakes and feel the consequences later? Am I the asshole for asking her to take then down?	1642936453.0	sargl0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sargl0/aita_for_asking_my_little_sis_to_take_down_the/	AITA for asking my little sis to take down the inappropriate pics she's been posting
60yv1edc	I'm 30 years old now and a very happy lesbian. However, I have an event that's been weighing on me since I was 17 and I finally have to know if I was the asshole.   My very first boyfriend and I went to the 2008 Utah State Fair. We were madly in love and were invested in that romantic, wonderful, cheesy shit that I remember with immense fondness.   He played the game where you throw darts at a balloon and he won me a teddy bear. I received it with  a kiss and held it close to my chest while we saw a sad tiger prowling its small cage. I held it while we ate corn dogs and funnel cakes under clouds were the same color and texture as cotton candy. I held it while we rode the ride that spins and pins you to the wall like a butterfly until you're so dizzy that all you can do is laugh. We walked through an interactive exhibit and I left that teddy bear near the entrance. When we were done and I came back for my bear, a little boy was holding. I had the feeling that he didn't have many teddy bears to begin with--why else would he be holding mine? I told him to keep it. I felt really good about myself. I felt proud of myself for giving up something so precious, so full of love as an act of charity. My boyfriend didn't understand how I could do that. I didn't understand how I couldn't.

ifvxocqy	My (22F, A) boyfriend (23M, B) has a friend (22F, C). They met during highschool where C suddenly excluded B from their friend cycle.  Than C went abroad for a year and B had to redo a year, leading to them being in the same grade again. C pretended they were best friends, after B wanted to talk about why she excluded him, she ignored it. Anyways, they stayed friends.   B and i started dating 3 years ago. I met C, didnt per se like her nor dislike her so i kept it casual. We did hang out with the three of us but i didnt go out of my way to hang out with her either.   So two years ago, she invited her self on a vacation to Asia (we are from Europe, this was B's first time in Asia). I was mad, because it was supposed to be a trip with just B and I. We went there three weeks and she stayed with us (in the same room) for a week. There were some things i didnt like (shop lifting, cheap skate). Anyway, we still kinda bonded and became better friends.  She started sending me postcards and we hung out more.  Then for B's birthday i organized an online escape room (covid). And B invited some people and created a whatsappgroup. I knew most of them, however, i was shocked when one of them said something racist. So i said something along the lines 'im a bit uncomfortable with this, i prefer to not joke about this. I am sure we will all have fun with the escape room, lets just try not to joke about this.'  Damn i had backlash, anyway, the guy who made the racist jokes got mad and said that C thought i was overreacting. So i settled it with this guy and talked to C. Asking if she really said that behind my back and why. She was not pleased about me confronting her. Anyways, i said i settled it with the guy and wished she would tell it to me straight if she didnt like something.  However, during the escape room itself she ignored me the whole time. So i quit the escape room and did something else (mind you, i organized it).  So fast forward, B and I are moving for our study. C only asked B about the moving (even though we previously talked in a group with all three and B and I are moving together). C only asked B to hang out (B declined). C only send B a postcard and specifically said that C only wished B a happy new year/good study. (Even though those cards were previously for the both of us). C never texted me again nor ever mention me if she ever texted B (so no, how are you and A?)  So AITA for telling B that i truly dislike how she is acting. Also that she ignored him before (in highschool) and is doing the same to me? That i still dont like how she invited herself to Asia? How she always shoplifts and is trying to profit from others?  I also said ' She could have at least written the card to both of us but she didnt. if you want to hang out with her, i dont want to be part of it. i would also feel some type of way if you do hang out with someone who is actively trying to ignore your partner but i wont stop you.'  Edit1: the racist joke was about colonialism and how true blood people are superior to Indonesian people. (It was clearly a joke but i dont like those type of jokes).	1642937910.0	sartxl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sartxl/aita_for_feeling_excluded_am_i_overreacting_and/	AITA for feeling excluded (am i overreacting?)

ixp271dm	 My husband Joseph and I have been married for 2 years, his mom IS a lot, She takes bride in the fact that she "put an end" to Joseph's first wife's abuse and control and thanks God daily for getting rid of her.   Joseph was saving up to buy us a house for years and finally had enough money to buy one. After some house hunting that lasted 4 months, we found the house we wanted and we're now in the process of moving in.   Unbeknowest to me, MIL hosted a celebration at the new house inviting over 20 ppl and also, she got a copy of the key from Joseph that I didn't know about. I felt upset cause I didn't agree on neither of those things but I kept it cool during the party. until MIL said that she wanted to send some furniture in, I said she didn't have to but she replied "of course I do, my name is on the title so it's technically my house too". I froze and said Joseph didn't tell me. she was like "he didn't? Weird!!". I asked her why, she did not contribute with money and besides as his wife, my name should be on the lease not hers. She replied "Well, I've decided to have my name put on the title instead of..yours *just in case* especially after the stunt his ex pulled by "stealing" everything in the divorce, including his apartment that she claimed to own half of, and you know... life can be unpredictable so "we're" just being careful not to be put in the exact same position". I was seething#!#!@ I started arguing with MIL about her overstepping the line by getting her name on the title when she contributed absolutely nothing but she argued back that I can say the same about myself then, explained it's Joseph's house *originally*   Party was cut short and I waited for Joseph to get back to talk about this. He said it was her idea for one but then, he had to say yes because she had "legit" concerns and was right about reconsidering having my name on the title especially since I didn't contribute with money as well and so in comparison mom is family but I won't be in case of a divorce and he can't risk losing half his property. I reminded him that I basically handled rent, bills, utilities for the past 4 years for him to be able to save up so damn right I contributed.  He said it's really not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be because it's just his mom's name on the title but she "realistically" owns no part of the house. I said clearly this wasn't the case because she's already acting like she the co owner of the house and besdies that I just can't get over the fact that her name is on the lease while mine isn't. I demanded to have her name removed from the title immediately.   He begged me to let it go but I insisted I want her name removed from the title or I won't be moving my stuff in. He started saying I've ruined his joy and caused him stress over nothing by insisting on having his mom's name removed.	1642938238.0	sarx2h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sarx2h/aita_for_wanting_my_mils_name_removed_from_the/	AITA for wanting my MIL's name removed from the title of the new house my husband purchased?
75o7fbqk	First time poster here but I genuinely need some outside advice. Sorry for the long read. I (36f) am a nurse and have been supporting my best friend (33m) through the cancer diagnosis and treatment of both his patents over the space of 3 years. He is high maintainence and very head strong (even before going through this horrendous situation) but I absolutely love him and let him away with some pretty toxic behaviour because he makes up for it in so many other ways. When his first parent was diagnosed I dropped everything and traveled across the city to be with him. I was there for him as much as I could but over the months he put so much pressure on me that I had to set boundaries and be firm with him about his expectations of me. To be clear I was really struggling with anxiety, depression and insomnia so I was trying to protect my own mental health while trying to also be there and support him. He cut me off, literally blocked me on every platform, because I was a shit friend and wasn't there to support him. Time went on and we eventually made amends. I welcomed him back and just let the past sit in the past. Since then I have started working in Oncology and unfortunately his other parent received a cancer diagnosis. Again I was there every way I could. I talked to his parent on the phone, giving advice, guidance, talking through treatment options etc. Basically I was the on call nurse when there were questions or concerns for both his and his parent over the period of 6 months. While this was exhausting and taxing on my mental health I wanted to do everything I could. Cut to 2 days ago, we were texting every day, I was giving daily advice on would care, diet etc and my friend asks if he call the next day for a chat. I had a hectic day ahead, medical appointments and two birthday parties, so I said I was busy and explained why. He responds with a really harsh txt saying that I don't have time for him with everything he is going through and I was being horrible for listing all the nice things I was doing the next day while he was there dealing with two parents with cancer.

5ghadvyh	So my brother broke up with his ex S two weeks ago. He was with S for a year and a half. They were engaged and S has a five year old by her ex. My brother was like a father figure to S's son. My brother broke up with S because he wasn't in love with her anymore (Though he said he loves her.) and he said he wasn't sexually attracted to S anymore. Last Monday my brother flew to another state to meet a girl he met over Instagram. He stayed in her home and everything.  Who picked up my brother from the airport when he came home? S and her son. (He lives with our parents, for context next.) S was living with my brother at my parent's before they broke up.  I housesat for my parents to look after their home and pets while they and my brother are away. Last night, S and her son come over and spend the night. S sat on the couch across from me when my brother wasn't around and said this to me softly: "I'm hoping he and I can fix things." That made me feel so guilty for her. She went to bed with my brother last night.  I so want to talk to her about my brother about his trip and he's acting so cagey. My ex and I were friends for years after he broke it off and it just hurt me. It felt like I was still the girlfriend without being the girlfriend. I don't want S to go through the same thing. I'm afraid she is going to be hurt. I feel so conflicted and guilty. I don't want to betray my brother but I don't want S to be hurt more either. So, would I be the ass?	1642939348.0	sas7nz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sas7nz/wibta_if_i_told_my_ex_sil_the_truth_about_my/	WIBTA if I told my ex SIL the truth about my brother's actions?
imktldjm	Tbh I feel kinda funny writing this. I look at the title and I'm like "wow, that really happened" but I'm here anyway so...  I threw a boys party last night at my place and invited some of my friends and my cousin. Look, I really love my cousin. I never had a brother but he was always there for me, the big brother who helped me with bullying when I was little, would let me play on his pc and so on.   He is a really great dude, not just with me, with everyone, but he doesn't really know what personal space is. To put it short he is the kind of guy who you tell "make yourself at home" and then find him balls deep in your nutella jar. (before you ask, it never happened but just to make an idea of how "at home"he feels"). Granted, he doesn't mind if you shit like that at his place but anyway, some of us have boundaries.  Anyway, after everyone arrived I told them they can do whatever they want, I only have 3 rules: no sex on my bed, don't break furniture and don't drink the 2 beers in the fridge behind the soup pot. They laughed, maybe they took it as a joke, idk.  The thing with those beers is last summer, when I moved in, me, my dad and his friends were doing some repair work and my dad's friends brought a few Heineken beers. These beers had country flags in the shape of stars on them because at the time the European Championship was going on. The thing is, they weren't really any special, the taste was the same and they were in every shop's fridge, not rare at all, but still, given they were made for a specific event, I can say they were limited edition.  And 2 of these beers remained around here and stood in my fridge since. I don't really know why I haven't drank them in those weeks until the final, but then the final came and it was England - Italy, the two teams on the bottles, and I said "damn, this must be a sign or something, I will keep them for something special".  And that's how they stood in my fridge for the past 7 months. Before you ask, their expiration date was sometime at the end of 2022 so all was good. And like a week ago I found out my gf is pregnant, so I was really intending on opening them on the day my child was born.  The party rolls, everything's cool, and at some point we run out of beers. I put something on and go out to get another case. I stg it took me 10 minutes to cross the street, make small talk with the cashier, pick up a case of beer and get back. 10 minutes. And there was my cousin, burning through my second beer, with the first already finished.  Now, I was upset, it really brought me to a bad mood, but I didn't make a fuss about it. I just said something like "man, I specifically told you not to touch does" and left it at that because I didn't want to ruin everyone's time.   An hour or so later, there came that moment in every party when the music stops and you all stay in a circle and drunkenly talk about deep shit from your lives. I told them about my gf and the baby, and briefly mentioned that's what I was keeping those beers for and for some reason my cousin thought that was a great moment to make fun of me for it. Like really dumb, tasteless jokes, aimed at the fact that "good thing you finally realized how stupid that was" and "were you gonna feed the baby beer?" Dumb shit like that.   I told him to stfu, I'm not cool with it so he should at least shut up and hope I forget about it, but he kept on trying to convince everyone he was right and I was dumb for being upset because it's no big deal. His arrogance and the way he laughed it off when I told him what it was all about really pissed me off so I took a cigarette from his pack and threw the rest out the window then told him to go after them and don't come back.  He left without a word and that was that. Kinda ruined the mood but it is what it is.  No one really said anything, but looking at it now, did I overreact?  Tldr: my cousin drank the beers I was keeping for the birth of my child when I specifically told him not to, but I threw his cigarette pack out the window in response.	1642939646.0	sasae1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sasae1/aita_throwing_my_cousins_pack_of_cigarettes_out/	AITA throwing my cousin's pack of cigarettes out the window for making fun of me after he drank my limited edition beers?
hutf5gjw	Wife (36f) and I (36m) had a fun date last night and both came home ready to have sex. Sex life has had its ups and downs but has generally been good for both of us.   She’d watched something on tv earlier in the day with full frontal male nudity that clearly included a huge prosthetic penis.   Upon taking mine out last night, she held it and said “this is underwhelming after what I saw earlier.”  I got bummed out and it was an immediate mood killer for me, which I told her.   She got upset as I tried to explain why that’s a mean remark, then she cried and asked if that was so mean, she wonders what else she’s been saying that she doesn’t realize is mean and that was sorry she ruined the night. From that point I was just trying damage control.   I told her that no guy wants to be described as “underwhelming” in that moment, but now I’m thinking I should’ve just laughed at myself and accepted it.

So I stole her shampoo bottle(16M) and jacked off to hentai(18F) as much as possible until I filled it up all the way. I put the bottles back and the next day her hair smelled like cum(78M) and she was crying. My Mom(21F) and my dad found out and started to yell at me, so with my huge 900 inch cock(78M), I cummed(2000 Gallons) all over them and then they all drowned in cum.  I am now facing life imprisonment(200 Years) but I honestly dont think I deserve it and that they are overreacting.

So me angry and patently waiting for the talking to end trying to sleep said “GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY HOUSE” even though it’s actually my moms house is away.

ixqdim1m	I'm a widower dad of two (Daughter 11, Son 13) they both attend the same school in our district. They used to take the bus but not anymore and I'll explain why in a bit.   So my son started complaining about this group of kids picking on his on the bus, I remember him telling me about it but to me it sounded like it wasn't a huge deal. Well, he got into a fight with them and ended up getting kicked out of the bus along with his sister. I spoke to the principle but nothing worked, couldn't get my son and daughter to be on another bus. There was no other way it's either this or getting more severe punishements.   I told my son he just caused himself and his sister to be banned from getting banned from getting on any of the buses in their school, he tried to say those kids were harassing him and he tried to ignore them but couldn't take it anymore. I thought that was just an excuse to engage in trouble because he made the situation worse even when he thought he was standing up for himself. As a result I told him I will only drive his sister (she's innocent in this, she didn't start any fights with anyone on that bus) to school but he has to figure a way out to get to and from school on his own. He pitched a fit on how unfair that was but I told him if he's capable of picking fights with other kids then it shouldn't be hard for him to find a way of transportation. I suggested he reaches out to his adult cousin and ask him for help as a temporary solution but he started yelling about how wrong I was to blame him for this outcome when those kids started this whole mess.  He's not speaking to me, doesn't even sit with us at the table to eat. I feel so overwhelmed and exhausted thinking about these situations and resenting being put in them. But I think he's made a decision that he has to deal with after he refused to avoid trouble.	1642940290.0	sasgja	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sasgja/aita_for_only_driving_my_daughter_tofrom_school/	AITA for only driving my daughter to/from school and not my son even though they both attend the same school?
ixpugxp4	So first of all english is not my first language so please ignore it   Second this is a bit of a long story    This happend last week on the weekend. Me (m21) and my best friend (F19) have a long history together and 2 relation ships. I supported her trou some failed relationships   I went to visit her because she is studying in vienna but life's like me in an other part of austria (400km) and i had everything booked and ready. Roughly 500€ for 2 nights   The day started extremely good and we had good fun in a mall. After we were almost done shoping she sayed that she needed to talk to me about something. She told me that she really likes me but that she is in an relationship with someone i know and she knows i absolutely don't trust and like him because of personal reasons  We both talked and she sayed that i couldn't change her mind wich i didnt even try but i gave her a word of caution  She than sayed to me that i shoudnt lie to her about my feelings  my mental state and that i can trust her   She wanted to know everything that happend from work ( i work for a special unit ) and i told her everything.  After that we calmed down a little and i hugged her but then i noticed a noice from her headphones. it wasn't music but a voice. The voice of her Bf thats wenn i confronted her about it and she sayed she just wanted to make sure that i didn't hurt her but we talked that out to  We went inside to drink coffee and a coworker from my unit saw how 2 people followed me and texted me that he was going to cover me in case that things take a turn to the worst.  After we drank the coffee we wanted to leave but i told her that we should get around a corner quick so that i can get something out of my backpack.  My coworker was next to us about 10~m and signalt me that the 2 were coming. I was ready for a big fight  Then te 2 guy's came around the corner and it was her Bf and her last Ex.  I instantly know that she had told them to protect her. So i konfronted them all and she told my everything. After that i wennt to the trainstation alone. I texted her that its absolutly not ok to tell me that i need to be honest and trustfull to her when i cant trust her  I took the next train home were the drive is about 4h after i was home i wennt to sleep  Today she asked me if i could send her some money 50€ and i told her she need's to give me a reason why i should and she told me because she trusts me and has no one else   So AITA for not wanting to support her and breaking the contakt that we have ?	1642940350.0	sash3c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sash3c/aita_for_not_supporting_my_best_friend_after_an/	AITA for not supporting my best friend after an incident ?

4jx26f2r	Ok so... first time posting, from mobile, English is not my first language, yada yada yada.. so be patient with me. And I'm seriously wondering if I'm overreacting and could be AH  Just in case there's gonna be a TL;DR at the end.   For context: I (17 nb) have a complicated family life. My parents (53 f, 51 m) have been fighting for years at this point, and got working for a divorce cuz my dad cheated on my mom and they were just really angry at each other for years and years. This situation of perpetual stress reflected on their parenting manners, and even if I've been neglected for some years now I'm doing much better, I'm attending therapy and they're trying their best to fix up their mistakes along my journey  Now from the title it might sound like my dad does bad things when he's drunk... No. Neither of my parents never physically abused me. But he's very fragile and "demands" love even when sober, also if I'm reluctant in giving it. I don't hate him, but I feel like our bond just... Isn't the same, I can't pretend nothing happened for the past 8 years. The being overly intense and affectionate shows through when drunk btw (obviously). Well last night he started texting me (he works outside our town, far away), I tried to laugh it off because he couldn't even write properly, but after a while I just... Started getting nervous. He wouldn't stop responding, and nervousness turned to sincere awkwardness, I felt very uncomfortable. The exchange wasn't weird, like there's nothing "incriminating" in the chat, but something just clicked very bad  It turned to pure anxiety and after a while I started crying, and I stopped looking at the texts. I wanted some comfort but my mom was asleep, and my first instinct was to "cover" for him and keep it to myself. The only possible explanation I have is that maybe I linked it back to an episode where I met his mistress and while drunk she wanted to hurt me and my mom, and that in general I've never been in really happy situations when my dad was drunk. This morning I told both my therapist and my mom, and it makes me feel a bit better, now I'm afraid I could've screwed up or that I'm just overly sensitive and it's all stuck in my head  So please tell me, AITA?  TL;DR: Me and my parents have a rough background. While in another town for work my dad starts texting me random stuff and demands of affection when intoxicated and it triggered me for unknown reasons to the point I cried and felt uncomfortable.	1642940487.0	sasiki	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sasiki/aita_for_feeling_uncomfortable_around_my_dad_when/	AITA for feeling uncomfortable around my dad when he's drunk?
6k5nh2z0	Hear me out. Several mornings in a row, early in the morning, my grandmother consistently complains of how disobedient I’m being by having my devices turned up, claiming she can hear the voices from what I watch, and occasionally punishing me for it. Sounds reasonable- except I keep my devices on mute until 10 in the morning on weekends, and she sometimes does it when I’ve hardly even woken up. There’s been a time when I was awoken by her at 4 in the morning because she thought I was using a device, and was unable to stay awake easily the rest of the day. Today, she punished me for ‘using my phone noisily’ when I had gotten up to use the bathroom. I’m getting tired of this cycle, as it’s a regular occurrence. Would it make me an asshole to say she’s delusional and suggest she find help?	1642940858.0	sasm33	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sasm33/wibta_if_i_call_my_grandmother_delusional/	WIBTA If I call my grandmother Delusional?
ixqvu73d	My partner and I recently got engaged. He is Greek Orthodox and I am Catholic. Neither of us are practicing, however I attend Christmas and Easter masses with my family. I want to get married in my old high schools chapel. It’s absolutely stunning, the architecture and stain glass windows are incredible, and it’s known throughout my country as a beautiful chapel. You can only get married in it if you’re a past student of the school. My partners family wants us to get married in an Orthodox Church. I have spoken with my old school and they have agreed that we can have a Greek Orthodox minister perform the ceremony in the chapel, but that’s not good enough for them. My mother and I both went to that school, and I sat in that chapel every week dreaming of what it would be like to get married there. They want us to have a traditional Greek ceremony, conducted entirely in Greek, for the benefit of his grandparents, who don’t speak English. My partner doesn’t even speak Greek, and having a Greek ceremony would mean none of my family, or any of our friends, or even myself and my partner would be able to understand our own wedding ceremony. The only member of his family that actually attend church are his grandparents. I want to get married in the place that holds huge sentimental value for myself, so AITA for “not respecting their religion”??	1642941165.0	saspa2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saspa2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_married_in_an/	AITA for not wanting to get married in an Orthodox Church?
i6rkuxzx	  So I might be the ahole for ending a 8 year friendship by ghosting my bestfriend.   I (17f) have been friends with this girl (18f) for about 8 years now. We’ll call her A, A and I have had an on and off friendship for years where she’s blown things out of proportion, such as once she ghosted me for months because I went to the beach without her. We became friends again a year ago and have had a lot of fights where she’s yelled at me etc. Anyways the final straw for me was a month ago when she refused to cover for me in front of my parents. I asked her to cover for me as I have very religious parents etc and I was out on a date. She insisted that lying was wrong and refused to help me, even texting my mom that she doesn’t want to get involved and some other shit that almost got me caught. I got really mad as I have covered for her for years, (such as once she wanted me to spend almost 300$ of my own money so that we could go to another city for her to meet a boy she only texted with).   Anyway she acted as if she had the right to be mad at me because I went out with a guy?. I stopped contacting her and ghosted her for about a week before her mom got involved. Her mom completely dismissed my feelings and acted as if my friend was innocent so I calmly told her that me and A have different views of friendship. Later that day A texted me and told me off and acted as if she’s done nothing wrong.   Now I know exactly how A is, she wants to argue and she wants me to have a attitude so she can justify her actions. Instead I calmly told her that I can’t continue the friendship because of our different views and told her I’m not mad anymore (I had dropped it at that point). She once again went off on me telling me I had an attitude and that she was innocent. I decided for my own mental health to not continue the conversation and let it go. A later texted a mutual friend and acted as if she had done nothing wrong.   For context, me & A are from very different cultures and I feel as if she doesn’t understand the concept of strict parents. She’s not been supportive (before the friendship ended) with that I mean when I started a relationship with a guy she would always negative things about him or me such as that he would eventually get tired of me and leave.     She has also always dismissed my feeling etc such as once I told my friends about being sexually harassed at work and my way of coping is to joke. So once when A was talking about something I joked about my situation and she got mad because “she’s already heard it beforw and we were talking about her” . Another thing she does is always hit my legs, arms or head and do everything to annoy me. When I tell her to stop she ignores me and continues. Every single time I decided to give her another chance but I just couldn’t this time. It was like she wanted me to get caught and have consequences.

ab7h5jri	My girlfirend has told me before that she hates hanging out with people on her birthday because she gets a lot of unwanted attention from people who couldn't care less about her but insist on wishing her happy birthday, and also because of some past family issues that used to take place on her birthday when growing up. I told her that maybe she should only hang out with people that truly care about her but she said she finds celebrating birthdays stupid anyway so I just left it at that. She has the same outlook on Christmas and other holidays.       However, she hasn't told me she isolates herself a whole week before her birthday too. I've recently had covid and I really missed her since we don't live together. When I finally got out off quarantine I messaged her about a time to meet up and she initially agreed, then she remembered her birthday is next week and she told me she doesn't like seeing people in that time frame. I promised her I wouldn't bring up her birthday if we go out, but she still refuses to see me or to explain what it is that would bother her if we met up. I was very disappointed that I had to wait another week before seeing her and I told her that her whole mindset regarding holidays is very immature and that she's the only one responsable for her happiness and no one else will care. I also told her I feel offended that she's treating me like those aquaintances that only remember her on her birthday and she called me self-centered for thinking this was about me. She also said that I was disrespecting her boundary and she shouldn't even have to explain herself.      I think do respect her boundary since I accepted I wasn't going to see her but I also find this boundary very rigid and immature, especially since she refuses to explain what bothers her.

hyntk	So this happened before the pandemic and before everywhere was understaffed. I (M, 20s) was visiting my parents and we were all in the same car doing errands in town. We decided to stop at a drive thru to get some drinks. The lady at the intercom started taking our orders. There was some kind of fruit smoothie that was offered in 2 flavors, mango and pomegranate if I rember correctly. Here's how the conversation went:  Me: I'll have the pomegranate.  Lady: oh. I'm sorry, we only have the mango.  Me: oh okay. No big deal. I'll have the mango.  Lady: we don't have that, we're out, we only have...pomegranate.  Me: then I'll have pomegranate.  Lady: we don't have that, but we have the mango.  At this point I just screamed "make up your mind!!" Really loudly into the intercom. My parents said I was being an entitled brat and my mom reached back to pinch me hard on the leg, and they apologized to the lady when she got us our drinks. I don't think I did anything wrong.

asrqbnq0	My mom (36F) and her boyfriend (22M) met around six months after my mom left my dad. Things were alright at first. He would come over two to Three times a week and stay the night on some occasions. We got along fairly well though he made me uncomfortable. He didn't do anything weird I just didn't like his presence in our house, but my mom was happy so I didn't bring it up.   After a while he got more comfortable, playing with my sisters, a nine year old and a five year old, and going as far as to hug me. I don't really like it when people other than my mom and sisters hug me, hell I don't even like it when my dad hugs me unless I invite him to. I made it clear that I didn't like it but he continued to do it. At this point I had gotten used to him randomly hugging me. I still rarely hug him back though.   Here's the thing. He makes racist, homophobic and sexist jokes a lot of the time. And as a Bisexual girl, who doesn't tolerate racism of any kind, was understandably upset about it. His maturity levels are in the negatives. The only reasons I can't hate him is because he spoils me and my sisters (he has a lot of money to spend on others) and because he makes my mom extremely happy. I don't think I have ever heard my mom laugh with anyone as much as she has with him. Not even my dad.   Whenever he is in a bad mood, he becomes a total asshole, complaining about the stupidest things and upsetting my mom with his negative attitude. He comes over pretty often and it's beginning to annoy me.   A lot of the time, I can't say something without him finding something negative to say about my statements. He found out my best friend was trans and has been calling him a "she-boy". I told my mom to do something about it but she didn't, claiming he was only doing it to annoy me. And it was working. Having him around can be extremely draining.   He has even made comments about me moving out the moment I turn eighteen, I am currently fifteen. My mom defended me, saying he had no say in that but that was about it. He had also joked about my mom being pregnant, when they brought his friends baby bed to our place to store it since they didn't have space. That led me to a mental breakdown, I was so afraid of it being true.   I think that I'm being reasonable when I say I don't want him moving in, marrying my mom. But sometimes I doubt myself and feel like I'm just being a jealous bitch.

ixr2o7xr	I (23F) have a best friend (also 23F) who I have known for several years. We met in college, and have been very close ever since. We even live together now. She is an amazing person, and has helped me through a lot of hard times. We have never even been in a fight, apart from minor disagreements. However, there is one thing that keeps bothering me about her.   She keeps referring to herself as poor, when I know that she has a lot of money on her savings accounts. She comes from a family with decent income as well, so it's not like she is truly ever in any economic danger. She often complains about how she is worried about making ends meet, not being able to afford food, that she only has like 20 dollars to live on after paying rent and other bills etc. Yet she still eats out, buys new games, clothes and other things she enjoys while complaining about how poor she is. She never used to be like this before, the greedy mentality only started after she got a part time job. Before that, she managed to get by on student loans only without any problems or complaints. It's like the money has gone to her head in a way.   In her defense, she is not in school anymore, so she does have to rely on the income from her job. I also understand and appreciate that using her savings isn’t something she wants to do. It sucks, but she is not poor. I feel like that is a very entitled and privileged thing to say, and I get very provoked every time she brings it up. I think it’s very disrespectful towards people who are actually living in poverty and don’t have a safety net the way she does. I do think she is a hard worker and a good person, and I respect her opinions on pretty much everything. Except for this. I haven’t said anything about it yet, but I just can’t listen to it anymore. I am, however, afraid that she will take this the wrong way. I don’t want to hurt her feelings or make her feel like I’m attacking her.    I just want to make it clear to her that I don’t want to hear about it, or that she should consider wording her complaints differently. Instead of saying that she can’t afford something, she could say that she doesn’t want to spend money on it. It makes a huge difference in my opinion. Yet, I feel like it is not my place to decide how she talks and feels about her own money. And I know money can be a very sensitive subject for many people. So I feel like I might be the asshole for trying to force my opinions on her. I’m scared that this will turn into a huge argument, but at the same time I feel like not saying anything is making me build up some resentment towards her.   So, AITA if I bring this up?	1642943764.0	satffe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satffe/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_stop_calling/	AITA for wanting my friend to stop calling herself poor?
i9lmxplz	My whole life, my mom had me convinced I was born in 2002, but my sister which i thought was my cousin showed me my birth certificate and it said 1998, and it said that the person I thought was my aunt, was really my mom. Recently a man came up to me at the park while i was playing basketball and he said he was my dad, and he had a tattoo that was the same name as mine. This man's name was also on the birth certificate my sister showed me. When i confronted my mom about it (who i thought was my aunt) she said he's lying and he's just trying to use me for when I get drafted into the NBA. I've been playing basketball ever since i was a kid, and I currently play for my college basketball team, but I broke NCAA regulations thanks to my mom lying to me, so now I forsure have no chance of getting drafted into the NBA. My sister who i thought was my cousin told me that my mom was using me as a retirement plan the whole time. Am I a asshole for not wanting to speak to my mom ever again?	1642944003.0	sathrc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sathrc/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mom_for_lying_to_me/	AITA for getting mad at my mom for lying to me about my age, and saying she's my aunt this whole time?
ixqkzk78	I've (31f) been with my husband "J" (31m) for 10 years, married 5, and we've got two sons "F" (nearly 3) and "N" (two months).   I've always gotten along with my inlaws, they've always been welcoming to me and they ADORE our kids.   J has always been a bit insecure? Un-confident? Particularly around his own personal style and hobbies. We are nerdy, both of us. We met through my sister as she knew we were both into gaming, steampunk, anime, etc.  Over the years it's come out in discussions with J more than once that his dad had been unsupportive. Stuff as small as telling J that once he hit 16 or so he shouldn't be doing warhammer anymore as he was too old. He judged horribly when J finally got the confidence to start playing airsoft (something he'd been curious about for years) as an adult, and then it came out that J had always been interested in becoming a police detective, but his dad had told him he was "too sensitive" to make it. He became one after we were married, I'll point out, and he's brilliant at it.   J went through some goth/grunge/punk stages as a teenager, and his dad would make comments, some of them actually homophobic. To point where Js confidence is so shot, it's taken until he's in his thirties to stop asking my approval to how he should dress, do his hair, etc. After years of me going "it's your body and face - do whatever you want!" He worries I won't find him attractive, but after having kids and him seeing me worry over my changing body, he's finally realised that his own sentiments of "I love you regardless" Go both ways.   For some reason his dad looks to me to keep him in line. If J does something he doesn't approve of, he looks to me and goes "what do you think?" And I give him the same response I give J. That's never changed.   Now he and his wife watch my eldest 2 days a week, and he can do no wrong in FIL's eyes. He's even cracked jokes about teasing him and stuff and has said "when he brings a girl or guy home the first time." So either he's not actually homophobic, or he's grown out of it since J was young, but he still makes remarks on J occasionally.   I may have recently, while he was adoring our son and commenting on Js beard (which he thinks is too long, but I happen to love), snapped a bit. He asked me why I didn't get him to trim it, and I responded with the usual "It's HIS beard! You better not make comments like that to F when he gets older!"   It brushed over quickly and he's not been angry or nasty with me, but he's more cautious about what he says to me. I can see him treading carefully and he's uncomfortable? Maybe I should have left it? He's been better recently and he loves our kids so I think he was already trying to be better.	1642944661.0	satp2p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satp2p/aita_for_telling_fil_not_to_treat_my_son_how_he/	AITA for telling FIL not to treat my son how he treated his?
8odn1pct	A couple of weeks ago I had told my mom about how my bestfriend/cousin said that "you have bad memory just like your mom, maybe you inherited it from her" during a discussion and she got angry (my cousin has a history of being a bitch and a liar so my mom never liked her) because she loves talking bad about the respected adults in our family. My mom said she will talk to her mom and I asked her multiple times not to.   Eventually something happened between my mom and her brother about my cousin's family which led to my mom spilling the stuff I told her that day. My cousin's mom found and and yelled and hit my cousin for saying these things and trusting me this much.  I feel bad but at the same time I don't. She likes to talk shit about my other cousin's dad IN FRONT OF HER because she knows she won't say anything! She has done a number of other things that infuriated me but since she is so opinionated and thinks she cannot be wrong so I didn't point it out that much.   Now she is mad at me and says she made a mistake of trusting me. I'll admit it's my fault she got in trouble but she no one ever points out the bad things she has done!	1642944684.0	satpe8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satpe8/aita_for_telling_my_mom_what_my_best_friend_said/	AITA for telling my mom what my best friend said about her and accidentally getting her in trouble?
i3haz2ou	I've (25f) been with my fiancé (28m) for almost 7 years. We are still in love and I consider him my best friend-but even with all the love in the world- time can make things a little stale and boring. Our sex life has become just another menial task we do daily like brushing our teeth and showering- both of us expressed this to each other last week and I was THRILLED that we seemed to be on the same page.  So here's where I thought things were going in the right direction. We bought some toys, fetish gear, even went as far as putting a listing for a third to join us . We booked a staycation, and within an hour checking in, we heard a knock on the door from the third that we both were expecting. I opened the door expecting a hot girl, but instead there was this giant tall blonde man. Okay- I'm down for whatever at this point. He comes in- my fiancé tells me to sit down and watch and the mood shifted. He shoved this guy on the bed and started performing oral on him. I was shocked because I've never thought this was a fantasy of his, and after a minute of watching you could tell this was not k my something he was into...but it became clear through their actions and what was said that this was not the first time this has happened. I went into an shell shock- I thought we were here to get our shit back on track and now I'm realizing I'm watching the man I love be with the man he loves- or at least is highly attracted to. I left and checked into my own room for the night.   When I woke up, I confronted him as best as I could about what happened. I demanded to know who the guy was, how he knew him, and if this was a relationship that was preexisting. He blew up on me and told me he was doing this because of me and bc I was "so bored with him" that he thought bringing another guy in was the only was to make me happy. I asked again if he knew this guy and what their relationship was. He stormed out and LEFT ME at the hotel, which was an hour away from our apartment. I had to take an Uber home, and when I got to our home, he told me I needed to leave for the accusations I made and that I ruined our relationship.   I'm beyond myself right now, this was the last thing I was expecting this weekend. I love him and if this was something he needed and wanted to pursue, even though it would break my heart, I would always support him. Am I the asshole here? Should I have approached this differently?	1642945313.0	satwuv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satwuv/aita_for_questioning_my_fiancés_sexualitynsfw/	AITA for questioning my fiancés sexuality?(NSFW)
dqcmhgyb	I (22F) live in a 2 bedroom 2 bathroom with a roommate Lainey (25F) and both our cats (technically not allowed on the lease but the property manager doesn’t care and numerous people have cats and even small dogs in the apartment). We aren’t particularly close and just moved in together because we’re in the same grad program. We don’t really talk and stay to ourselves but have had an overall cordial relationship.  I’m due with my first child in 8 weeks and need to move to my own place to make room for me and the baby.  I found a place also owned by my current property manager that was pretty affordable given rental prices right now and still in a great spot convenient for school and work. My property manager was okay with me breaking my lease (originally ending May 31) as long as I found someone to take over my lease. He explained to Lainey and I that it was important that Lainey get to know this person as all three of us would have to sign the lease.  I found North (26F) on a subleasing page and she seemed pretty chill and we hit it off and she loved the apartment. North did mention she had a cat that I knew wouldn’t be a problem and a larger dog (later found out it was a pit bull that she just tried to call a lab mix) that I said probably wouldn’t slide. North said she would get it registered professionally as an emotional support animal which IS  allowed under the lease.I gave North and Lainey’s each other’s number about a month ago and figured they would talk before anything was signed. All leases were signed about two weeks ago.  I have two weeks before I move out and apparently Lainey and North hadn’t spoken to each other at all until two days ago. North never got her dog registered and Lainey isn’t cool with the idea of having a dog here at all. North is now mad at me and says I fucked her over and she has nowhere to put her dog and will now have to pay a lease for a place she can’t move in.  Here’s where I may be the AH. North called my landlord really upset about the situation and now he's putting it on me to resolve since I'm the one who told North it was okay to have a dog. I told him that I told her an ESA was okay according to the lease (which he acknowledged was true) and she also had Lainey's number to reach out to make sure she would be cool with a dog anyway. Lainey shouldn't have signed a lease without talking to her new roommate anyway which she had over a month to do. He says if North doesn't pay rent bc she's not moving in, he would have to take Lainey to court to evict her which would ruin her credit and he couldn't believe I was okay doing that to a friend/roommate. I told all three I'm focused on my baby and Lainey and North should have communicated better and none of this was on me and I wouldn't be involved with how this plays out, as I did what I was supposed to do by finding someone to take over my lease.	1642945548.0	satzi3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satzi3/wibta_if_i_let_my_roommate_get_evicted_and_left/	WIBTA if I let my roommate get evicted and left another girl without housing?
dokin3vv	My (25F) husband (24M) is an amazing dad and husband. Just one area he has a problem with is ignoring stuff that needs to be done until I ask him to do it. We have two daughters, 2, 11 months. Every morning they need diapers changed, youngest needs a bottle, oldest needs milk and breakfast, and the dog needs to be taken out. Usually I have to ask for him to help me out with doing everything. This morning I just so frustrated so quick because he was just scrolling on his phone (after he made himself breakfast but no one else) while I’m trying to get the girls situated. I snapped at him that the girls have needs in the morning and he can’t just sit on his phone and do nothing. He said “it’s Sunday morning, we relax and watch cartoons” I said the children watch cartoons, the adults get the things the children need.   After I took our dog out I apologized for snapping at him, and he said I just need to ask him for help and I’ll avoid a fight, and I told him I need him to step up and take initiative and know what needs to be done. I’m tired of doing it and I’m tired of having to ask for help.

iwwnu9y1	A little context: I (15F) and my boyfriend (15M) have been dating for a year and a half.  I’m going to sound like every single teenage couple right now but I think there is a pretty big chance we’ll stay together for a long time as we are both mature, communicate and do love each other.    I am close with my uncle (18M) too because when I was little he was as my house nearly everyday. He’s a little autistic and in school he had no friends so I was basically his best friend. He’s also always been very overprotective of me.   As I said my uncle is overprotective. When I first started dating my boyfriend, I hid it from my whole family . I told him around three months ago and he wasn’t very happy. He started saying he knows what teenage boys are like and that he’ll get bored of me and find someone else. The first time he said it, I didn’t care. But he said it multiple times making me insecure and doubt my relationship. I didn’t tell him how I felt since he was only looking out for me and wouldn’t purposely hurt me.  My uncle met my boyfriend a month ago on face time. They’ve never met in real life since I rarely see my uncle now. My uncle quite liked my boyfriend saying he seemed pretty cool. After this, he stopped saying the negative stuff and even began saying he liked my boyfriend.    Yesterday, I went out with my boyfriend. We went shopping, I bought a nice dress and my boyfriend had a new outfit on. I thought it would be cute if I took a mirror picture of us both and post it to my social media. My uncle was angry over my post and I was confused to as why. He started saying he didn’t like my boyfriend and it was inappropriate that I post something like that when I know he can see it. I only figured it out an hour later but behind us was another mirror and my boyfriends hand was resting on my ass. If I’d had realised, I probably wouldn’t have posted it but honestly, I don’t think it’s that big of a deal. All guys touch their girlfriends asses. I told my uncle he’s overreacting and that obviously my boyfriend has touched my ass.   He was so angry saying that he needs to control himself and not touch me up like that. From then, he’s made it extremely clear he hates my boyfriend and has started back with the negative comments. My boyfriend is also mad telling me my uncle is weird and cares way too much and I should tell him to fuck off.   WIBTA if I cut my uncle off unless he starts getting along with my boyfriend? I just want my family and my boyfriend to get along. I just think it’s weird he cares so much.	1642946704.0	saud39	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saud39/wibta_if_i_cut_my_uncle_off_because_he_hates_my/	WIBTA if I cut my uncle off because he HATES my boyfriend?
ixticx3y	Me and my boyfriend had a rocky start when we first got together. we would often break up and hookup with other people only to get back together it was only after a year and a half we finally clicked and now we’ve been together for almost 2 years.   we have Friday movie night every weekend but since his brother came down with covid we haven’t been able to see each other so i suggested we pick a movie and watch it at the same time from our own houses.   we ended up picking a movie about a girl who loses her memory and her psycho co worker pretends to be her husband and lie about her entire life to her. halfway through the movie i was texting my boyfriend and told him i knew that the fake husband was a bad guy and my boyfriend jokingly said “no kidnapping is so in these days” so i jokingly replied back something along the lines of “oh sorry i don’t think we can get married anymore” but apparently he didn’t read it as a joke.   fast forward a few hours he had work in the morning and was getting ready for bed and said goodnight and said he’ll always love me even if i don’t wanna get married, i reminded him that it was infact a joke and i do hope one day we can get married and this is when he got really angry   he texted me saying why the fuck would you joke about something like that when especially since our past has been so unpredictable and i knew he had always wanted to get married and was hoping it would be to me. i explained the joke and how it relates back to the movie we were watching but he wouldn’t have it and sent me a very short goodnight message. i texted him the following morning only to get a two word reply.    he is very upset and i suppose i can see why but it was whole heartedly a joke and i didn’t think he would be this offended especially after i explained the meaning behind it. am i the asshole?	1642947108.0	sauhz4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauhz4/aita_for_joking_about_marriage_with_my_boyfriend/	AITA for joking about marriage with my boyfriend
13mn68	My wife (35/F) and I (39/M) have been married for 3 months. Honestly things started off on the wrong foot. I caught her sexting multiple guys 2 months before getting married (why did we get married then? I felt pressured to go through with it). Anyways when we started dating she had a guy friend who was always around. I was familiar with him as we all ran in the same circle. I mean just about every date we went on he was there or whenever I’d go to her place he was there, if we were out he’d meet us out. He was married at the time and I always found it weird. I asked her about him and she told nothing was going on and they were just good friends, but sometimes it felt like I was a third wheel on their date. Fast forward to a few weeks ago I’m cleaning out our storage closet and I pick up a bag and some letters fall out. They are from that guy to my wife and it’s about their sexual exploits. I call my wife on it and she begins lying about the situation, but I put the letter on the table. She said I didn’t specifically ask if she slept with in the past I just asked if there was anything going on right now. I feel like that’s a little dishonest. This guy was always around and I was trying to become a genuine friend with him. I feel like I’ve been played. Again I didn’t call her out for sleeping with him. I called her out on omitting the fact that they had slept together previously. Now she’s just accusing me of looking for reasons to be upset and nothing she does is good enough. Every time it seems we’re about to turn a corner and I let my guard down something else pops up.   TL/DR: My wife lied about a former relationship I specifically asked about and I called her out on it.	1642946728.0	saude0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saude0/aita_for_calling_out_my_wife_for_lying/	AITA for calling out my wife for lying?

I think the break up was very hard for him, as he was very much in love.   I never told him because I was ashamed and I felt like it would shake up his confidence and change how he views me.  We got better friends in the last few years. He is marrying his new GF this year and invited me to his wedding. I don't think I will ever tell him. Not now or ever.

9go31s1h	My (16m) parents got divorced five years ago.   Mum is a successful influencer. She started writing and became successful for being a mum and business women. She has a Instagram account with a decent number of followers.  Dad is a Key Account Manager and paid the bills for everything when my mum was an aspiring influencer. He did everything she wanted and totally supported her.  Mum told my dad that she wanted a divorce the moment he told her that he got fired. She said that he is a loser and an unemployed idiot. She then took us to a resort 8 hours away and expected my dad to follow her and fight for their marriage. We stayed there for two weeks while my dad had to organize his leave and didn’t know she wanted him to follow. So when we returned she blamed him for giving up their marriage.  Mum soon dated a lawyer and she always emphasizes how awesome her life is now.   Dad met his new girlfriend online and fall in love with “Beth”. After dating Beth for about half a year he introduced us to her and we had a wonderful time. Mum on the other hand totally freaked out and told dad that he is not allowed to see us until Beth has introduced herself to mum. She believed Beth, because she is Asian, is just dating him for money and a residency permit. Beth immediately met her after she heard about it and mum was pleased.  But mum’s behavior is getting worse. She decides what we are allowed to do and when, what to watch on tv and movies (Marvel is just for nerds and nerds are losers, who didn’t work for one day). She does make a lot of side remarks about my dad and Beth being losers and poor. When my younger brother had his birthday on a weekday dad and Beth planned to come over after work. They both left work early at 4 and when dad called her, she just replied that my brothers birthday is obviously not important enough for them for being late and that she won’t let them in at this time since she has more important things to do.   Living with mum really is exhausting. I am responsible for taking the trash out. When the trash bin is full because she just put something in it she yells at me for being lazy and inconsiderate and I have to take the trash out immediately even if I’m doing something else.   She threats about putting me to boarding school every other fight and says that we are spoiled kids. I know we are in puberty and therefor sometimes irregular but I feel like my mum is exaggerating everything.   When I came home with a bad grade mum yelled and blamed me for being stupid while dad sat down with me and explained me what I did wrong and how I can do it better.  Lately I feel very happy staying at dad’s place and miserable for going back to mum’s. My gut says that I would like to stay with dad and I consider telling them that. I know that dad would totally support that but mum would totally freak out.   So WIBTA if I tell my mum, that I want to stay with my dad?	1642947632.0	saunvv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saunvv/wibta_if_i_tell_my_mum_that_i_want_to_stay_with/	WIBTA if I tell my mum that I want to stay with dad?
51o6snqw	Hi Reddit.   This account is used by multiple people/friends as a throw away account for their issues so please don’t look at old posts to try and compare.    My partner(27M) of 5 years has serious sleep issues, or so they say. Every time they go to sleep they will sleep for a minimum of 12 hours before even remotely awaking up. This has caused major issues in our relationship, I am unable to get them up at all as they become rude or don’t even hear me at all. We have missed family events, holidays and important meetings because they can’t get themselves up.   I confronted them about this issue and said it’s not normal, we went to a doctor but nothing seemed to have worked, medication wise. We tried a routine with them, such as reading before bed or meditation, nothing has worked. I’m starting to think they are lying about it and are just lazy. I end up doing most of the household stuff and organising things because of the sleep issues, it’s mentally draining doing everything by yourself while your partner sleeps all day and then will be up all night.   We got into a heated argument about it as I felt neglected in the relationship and told them I think they are a liar and they are just lazy and don’t want to pull their weight. They said I was an asshole and stormed out. I haven’t seen them since. I do think maybe I have overreacted but they don’t seem to want to help themselves max   So Reddit am I the asshole ?	1642948220.0	sauuvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauuvy/aita_for_calling_my_partner_a_liar/	AITA for calling my partner a liar?
ixuijswx	I (16f) have always been picked at by the same group of girls since I started my sophomore year. This one girl "Jackie" is probably thr most aggressive of them.   If I say ANYTHING she deems slightly funny, she repeats it back in a whiny voice. I asked my friend to pass me a fork and she mocked me. I was humming in a loud room full of students and her and her friends told me in particular to stop making noise even though I was 2 tables away. They make fun of my clothes, my hair my voice, my weight... EVERYTHING.   Jackie is pregnant by her boyfriend, to our knowledge the entire thing was consensual and she decided to have the kid on her own ideals. That's all I'm gonna say about that. I was on the bus and asking my friends about an amusement park and one of the scarier rides and she butted in and said "I wouldn't do that if I were you. Girls your size can't be too careful on rollercoasters." I was over it so I said "Look Jackie, I don't think you should be giving any advice on being "too careful".   Apparently this was a "low blow" because despite keeping the baby, she's really not happy about being a teen mom. Her friends are calling me a bitch and saying that I went too far and what I said was just so mean spirited. My friends are on my side, but I can't help but feel like I should've just ignored her and went about my day.	1642948440.0	sauxri	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauxri/aita_i_tell_a_teen_mom_not_to_give_me_advice/	AITA I tell a teen mom not to give me advice

cfa5tnbi	I 30 year old female and my ex husband 40 year old male got a arranged married in Pakistan in 2016 but my visa was not approved until a year later. This was due to complications in the visa application. As a result, my ex husband had a lot of legal costs and appeals to go through. This amounted to nearly £10,000 (my ex husband claims). Once my visa was approved I finally arrived in England. I went to live with my husband and his parents. Within the first week I knew that I did not love my husband and wanted to leave. After talking to my family, I realised that I should not stay with someone that I did not love. My ex husbands family said that I am making this decision too quickly as I have not given them a chance. I was accused of using my ex husband as a free entry to England. One night me and my husband got into argument. I was told to go to another room. I was so angry that I called the police as I no longer wanted to stay in the house. My husbands family told the police that I was using them and called me a manipulative. I was escorted with the police to my cousins house. Since, me and my ex have been divorced. He is now demanding that I pay for his costs in sponsoring me to the UK. I told him that he was my husband and that he knew the costs associated before he married me.	1642948486.0	sauy95	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauy95/aita_for_not_paying_my_exhusband_back_the_money/	AITA - For not paying my ex-husband back the money he spent on my visa application?
ixtz1ogk	To be clear I sincerely believe that she does not love her son. MIL has never liked me. At first there was a lot of the typical drama with a difficult MIL, then it was just like a switch flipped one day and suddenly she didn't care at all. I'm talking she hardly speaks more than a few sentences. It took her 4 months to meet her first grandchild and then she never really came to meet the second one and just saw her at a family party when she was like 9 months. MIL never calls, rarely visits and doesn't stay more than an hour, doesn't share anything remotely personal about her life. We found out she was remarrying from a wedding invitation in the mail. Don't get me wrong, I love it, but it hurts me on behalf of my husband.   Recently we were at a family members house and MIL's sister was upset about dating again after a divorce and how hard it is. She hasn't dated in twenty something years and one thing she mentioned was everyone is so obsessed with boundaries now a days and people are just "weird and cold" MIL said that she doesn't get the concept of boundaries in a relationship, boundaries are for extended family you secretly don't like or a weird co-worker who wants to be your friend, but she can't imagine having them with her husband. I saw my husband roll her eyes and I asked her to clarify does she just not do boundaries with her husband or with anyone she loves.  MIL paused for a minute and said really anyone she loves. I said "cool, guess we know who you don't love" MIL called me an evil bitch out of the blue. We left shortly after and my husband is ok with it and feels she should be called out, but other family is saying I caused drama for no reason and we aren't entitled to her loving us or giving an explanation on why she doesn't love him.	1642948958.0	sav3xg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sav3xg/aita_for_publicly_accusing_mil_of_not_loving_her/	AITA for publicly accusing MIL of not loving her son?
ixsudr30	A little backstory before getting to the issue in question. I went through a period of bad depression and retail therapy was one of my unhealthy coping mechanisms. I mainly bought stuffed animals.They are also very cheap so I could just buy a bunch at a time.   Now, I am a lot better with my mental health and currently pregnant with my first child. My husband and I do not have a lot of money. He is the only one working. Basically we are barely getting by. To help, I have been deciding to declutter more to make space for the baby and decided to begin to sell off a bunch of my old stuffed animals. The brand that I bought a lot of just so happens to be very popular and people will pay twice the original price, sometimes more if it's rare.   I honestly don't know the value of the stuffed animals because that was never my reasoning for purchasing them. So I just use the estimated price on the resale app that I use. Since I just want to make a quick sale I just list it for the recommended and even pay for shipping out of the earnings.   So last night I was listing about 10-15 and then all of the sudden I have a bunch of random messages from people. They all say that one of the stuffed animals I just sold (for about $14-17) is actually worth more than $100. Some even selling for almost $200. I was completely shocked about this and reached out to the person buying the stuffed animal. I apologized with something along the lines of, "I have been getting a lot of messages that this is worth a lot more than I originally listed it at. Due to personal issues, I would rather sell it at the higher price right now." I would feel really bad for selling at the higher end so I just ended up listing it on the lower end.   But the buyer, was understandably disappointed. I did feel really crappy about it but I really need the money right now. I didn't know but the buyer went and posted our conversation in a group with my username saying they were upset. Next thing I know, I am randomly getting a bunch of messages calling me a horrible person and hope karma comes around. I didn't know where this was coming from until someone messaged me and explained. I told them that I do feel crappy about the situation but I am about to have a baby and I would rather have the money because I am struggling financially. I would rather be a terrible person than a terrible parent.   Thankfully, people in the group ended up taking my side. Saying that we are in a pandemic and lots of people are struggling financially. The buyer who I cancelled the order on ended up deleting their post but I have still been getting some people messaging me here and there saying how terrible I am. Maybe it's hormones, I am already a very sensitive person and felt like crap for doing that, but I feel like it was really crappy to do.

ixtzaakz	So basically last night my sister had her friends over, I always hate when she invites her friends over. So  every time my sister invites her friends over I lock myself in my room for hours at a time and only leave to grab food and bring it to my room and go to the bathroom. My sister try’s to act like she’s so cool in-front of her friends and I hate it. Tonight we had a huge argument I texted her after getting popcorn from down stairs because she looked at me like I murdered a man. I said  “Why are you being such a bitch. Just because your friends are over doesn’t mean you can act fucking spoiled. Do you understand now why I didn’t want your friends over because when your with them your always a bitch. Your also being an asshole to mam and dad what’s going on in your brain that makes you think that you have the right to be fucking bitchy.” She responded saying that I had an attitude for talking to my older sister like that and said things about me that made me feel shit. Now this is when I think I was the asshole after exchanging a lot of long paragraphs I say something along the lines of “I hate you, your one of the worst people I’ve ever met in my life you always treat me like shit and like I’m a fucking murder. I thought you where a good sibling but I was like very much wrong” So am I the asshole for getting mad at my sister when her friends where over?	1642949411.0	sav93m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sav93m/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_sister_at_her_sleepover/	AITA for getting mad at my sister at her sleepover?
ixnyxn5a	Before I say anything I apologise because I’m new to this and I’m not expecting many responses I just need to get this off my chest.   I (22f) am living with my parents (46f) and (44m). My father has been drinking for as long as I can remember, even before I was born. He’s the only person that drinks in the house, my mother never really drank even when she was younger maybe one or two drinks when she’d go out but never to the point where she’d be s**t faced. I used to drink when I was going out with my friends however this has stopped and I haven’t been drinking for a good 4 years. Once I stopped it never really tasted good anymore.  Anyway long story short my father drinks himself to oblivion every single weekend. My mother and I despise that and it causes us a horrid amount of stress, he was put into hospital a few months ago and my mum and I thought this would wake him up and make him realise that he needs to get his crap together, however it didn’t. Two weeks went by and he was back on the drink as if nothing ever happened he was also put on medication and his BIL told him he can still drink when on those meds no problem which I think is outrageous. When he was in hospital we were worried sick, we couldn’t sleep or eat my mum obviously had to take days off work and tell her manager what happened and of course when my father found out he wasn’t happy and kept saying that everyone around will know he had to go to hospital. Personally I didn’t really care whether people knew because I was more worried about his health rather than what others would say.  However nothing has changed, I am so sick and tired of him and I really don’t want anything to do with him, his drinking has caused my mother and I more stress than anything else in our lives and it kills me to see her having to deal with him. My mother and I are very close and we always talk about me moving once I finish college and how she’ll come with me. I have no objections because I would do anything for her.   At times I feel like a bad person for hating him so much and wanting to leave him on his own and show him that if he doesn’t get his shit together this will be his life in the future where he will be all alone but then I think because I am his daughter I have to stick around. I am so repulsed by him he only ever thinks of himself and when we bring up his drinking problem he laughs and makes nothing of it sometimes to the point where he will prioritise alcohol over us.

axkd4h08	   I know the title sounds wrong but hear me out.     This morning, me, my sister (i’ll call her Kari) and my mom (i’ll call her Nat) all sat down to talk about some legal issues we were facing. The conversation started out with Nat and Kari going back and forth with arguments against each other.   At one point during the conversation, Nat starts ranting for half and hour non-stop and getting off topic. i tried to reason with them and say i understood them both and express my own stance on the whole ordeal. Before i could even get a breath out, Nat pushed me and told me “shut your mouth, im not done, we’ll hear you out next” . So i did, i heard all 45+ min. of her speech, no murmur or comment, i wanted to be fair. When she stops talking , this is what happened:   Me: Listen you both make great points,  i understand Kari when she said [insert argument] but i-  Nat: That’s not true  Me: hear me out , i meant to say-  Kari: (to Nat) You have no argument whatsoever  I kept trying to interject since this topic affects all of us and they didn’t even look at me. I kept getting angrier and admittedly raised my voice and again and again saying “are you kidding me? I’m right here you know, this is cruel”. They never once looked or missed a beat in the conversation even when i waved my hands and raised my voice even higher telling them how hurtful it was. I felt like an actual ghost. Keep in mind that this went on for a solid 27 min.   I was so frustrated , i tried speaking over  them to no avail. Finally, i screamed a lot higher how stupid it was to treat me like dirt. Then all of the sudden they grab me and laugh at me telling me they’re done talking now and to get over it since it was no big deal. I was livid and told them repeatedly to let me go and leave me alone and how hurtful it was and how tiny they made me feel but they even talked over me while hugging me. i pushed them off many times and told them to “leave me alone please” .   I went to the living room , sat on the couch when Kari jumped on me and grabbed me so hard i couldn’t move while Nat was still trynna laugh it off. I told her three times to let me go. She told to stop being an idiot. I screamed that i was gonna push her if she didn’t stop. she didn’t so i pushed her off me and hit her hand when she tried to pull me back. Nat stopped laughing and told us to stop fighting. Kari told me it was cruel to push away my family from hugging me and left with teary eyes.   Kari keeps sending me paragraphs of text calling me a bitch for pushing my family away and that i acted like kid. I was genuinely hurt since this is the first time i’ve ever screamed so high in frustration and idk if i handled it the right way.  Am i the asshole?   TLDR;  Mom and sister acted like i didn’t exist for half an hour ignoring my screams. Tried hugging me and telling me to get over it. Told them to leave me alone, they didn’t so i pushed my sister away	1642950795.0	savquw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savquw/aita_for_pushing_my_sister/	AITA for pushing my sister?
41qizps4	My gf’s parents are really into conspiracy theories and refuse to get shots. Both my girlfriend and I got sick with the latest thing, and it was mild. I told her that visiting her parents is really risky, but she says they are their own people and can make decisions for themselves. While I agree, they are her parents and should anything happen to them, it would be really devastating for her and I just don’t want to see that happen.  We got in a fight over this, and perhaps I overreached? Maybe it wasn’t my place to say anything? I’m not sure.

5dx1pwec	 Horrible title I know  but I will provide context. I live in a city in the midwest in an area what is somewhat iffy with crime over the years. In my years living in this area I’ve had my car broken into multiple times as well as other issues with locals in my area. So to start of I (23m) was at a gas pump yesterday filling up my gas, when I decided to get back in my car to beat the -6 degree temps we were having. While sitting in my car, this guy (20s?) walks directly in front of my car and starts waving to me saying hi and trying to talk to me through the window, it’s also worth nothing I didn’t know him or had ever seen him before this happened event. He was wearing a dirty brown jacket and sweatpants so i knew he wasn’t one of the gas station workers.Just as he began talking my car was done filling and I had to get out of the car to close my cap and leave. The second I got out of the car the guy is approaching me and talking to me but in the heat of the moment I just wanted to leave and wanted nothing to do with this random guy. And when I wouldn’t say anything he kept repeating “oh so we don’t help others out here huh?” I literally had no idea what he was talking about and at this point he was standing between he and my driver door, so I quickly speedwalk around him and get back into the car and got out of there as fast as I could. After I left the dude went back inside the store. So my question is aita for completely ignoring this guy, or should I have heard out whatever he wanted to tell me? I kind of assumed he was a homeless guy asking for something because I’ve had other times where people would randomly ask for money from me or others in the streets or even stores, so I chalked it up to this being the case. The guy basically triggered my fight or flight because he kept trying to talk to me even though I gave clear indications I didn’t want to be talked to and wanted to go about my way.	1642950897.0	savs22	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savs22/aita_if_i_ignored_a_homeless_person_trying_to/	AITA if I ignored a homeless person trying to talk to me?
c14zj8sc	So my little sister (5) wanted to go to the zoo with me today, so I took her. After we had watched some animals, we went into the “snake house” as she likes to call it. There are snakes there amongst other animals such as spiders and geckos.   So my little sister was watching one of the snakes, whilst another girl about her age pushed her away. The girls father didn’t care and he went to his daughter and they looked at the snake. So I told my sister “don’t bother, some people are entitled assholes who can’t raise their kids properly. Just ignore idiots like them”  The man looked at me, and asked me what my problem was. I told him that his daughter was a spoiled brat, with no care for other people, and that she probably got it from him. Then I ignored him, and went on with my sister.	1642951081.0	savuby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savuby/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_a_stranger_is_a/	AITA for telling my sister that a stranger is a bad father, whilst making him hear it intentionally?
hvkac8s8	It’s a late south Alabama night and me being from Alabama I was drunk on the porch, naturally. I get a call from an old ex gf where I can hear the dude screaming and she’s telling me she’s scared. So with liquid courage coursing threw my veins I put on my captain hat and went to save-a-hoe. So I’m speeding down the highway drunk with my headlights off (I was young and very stupid I am in no way promoting this behavior). Anyways so I pull up to the street after a 30 minute drive and I see them outside screaming at each-other. The guy was wielding a led pipe and the girl ran to the truck and got in to safety. At that point the guy rushes my truck with the lead pipe not knowing who I am. I get out and yell “you won’t hit my fucking truck with that pipe” the guy immediately remembers me from school and realizes he doesn’t want the smoke so he walks away. Now this is the crucial point in the story because from here I could have walked away and secured a win on the road. But instead of kneeling with the lead late in the forth I decided to throw a Hail Mary and rush the guy saying “you won’t hit me either”  and in hindsight this is where I fucked up. In my mind I know he’s going to swing at my head and I’ll duck it and fuck him up so I go anticipating that. He swings, i duck, and boom! He delivers a blow so hard it was forsaken from god himself right into my ARM. This catches me way off guard and I look down at my arm for some reason and look back up just in time to see myself get cracked over the head. I fall to one knee and my vision starts coming back and I get up and start screaming at him again and approaching him and he has the most horrified look on his face and I’m thinking it’s because of how tough I am but I look down and realize everyone’s scared because of the massive amount of blood gushing from my head. I had on an all white pollo just for the occasion and by the end of it I looked like the crimson tide outfitted me for the game. So I’m like well shit. I go back to the truck and the girl gets in and i immediately speed off about 10 feet, get stuck in a ditch. Then I get out to make the most awkward eye contact of my life with the guy who thank god is not perusing us, just watching us at a very awkwardly close distance. I get in, crawl it out, and head home with his girl. Now I had no original plans to sleep with this women but by this point my moral values had drastically changed. We get home and bandage my head up and I have sex with this girl, record it, and sent it to him. That’s what he knew. What he didn’t know was those 10 second videos were the only sex that happened that night because I found everytime my penis throbbed even the slightest it made the massive injury to my temple throb as well and I was effectively taken out of commission for sexual conquests. The next day I drop her off and they were together 2 days later.	1642951287.0	savx2a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savx2a/aita_for_picking_up_dudes_girlfriend_when_they/	AITA for picking up dudes girlfriend when they were fighting?
ixvjdtko	MIL and I have had an awful relationship. Awful doesn't even encompass it. I've never hated anyone this much, I've never had anyone hate me like this. It got to the point that there was a year of mutual no contact after she broke down crying and told my husband she didn't want to be his mom anymore.   He reconnected with her a couple years ago and things have been better but still not great. Recently we had a party at our house and MIL got there a little early (there were other people there when she arrived). The rule is no shoes in the house, but dinner was going to be outside. MIL had her shoes off but put them on to go outside. She went to run and jump into someone's arms and her heel snapped and she fell, and accused me of cutting it. Honestly I think someone did cut it because they were Manolo Blahniks and I can't imagine those shoes just snapping, but I did not touch her shoes. Also she wouldn't have fallen like that if she didn't decide to bolt out of the house.  Anyway she whined that I cut her shoe. Her husband tried to joke that he'd buy her new ones and I'd be crying if it was my shoe because my husband doesn't make enough money. I even let that assholery go because I really am trying, but MIL was adamant that I cut her shoe.  That was about 3 months ago and we recently had another dinner party. Dinner was in the oven and we were in the living room socializing. MIL went to the bathroom. She came back and about 40 minutes later went again. When i went to take dinner out it was burned and dry. I've cooked this recipe before and I consider myself a good cook, so i was shocked. I was also embarrassed because we had some people there I wanted to impress. Also, maybe relevant, MIL is a phenomenal cook and doesn't seem to like that I am a good cook too and acts like it's a competition.  When the people I didn't know as well left, I accused MIL of ruining dinner and pointed out that she could have turned the heat up the first time she went to the bathroom and down the second time and the timing was suspicious, plus she probably wanted revenge for the shoe she thinks I cut. MIL said I can't just accuse her. I said it is too suspect and I don't believe her. MIL started yelling at me that she has her period and she bleeds very heavily and was worried about getting blood on her skirt/my couch and do I want to talk to her doctor. That did cast some doubt in my mind, but I still feel she did something just due to our history.  I said she is temporarily banned until I feel comfortable again. My husband really doesn't know what to think, but some people feel I shouldn't do it without proof.	1642951876.0	saw4f3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saw4f3/aita_for_accusing_mil_of_ruining_dinner_with_no/	AITA for accusing MIL of ruining dinner with no proof and temporarily banning her from the house?

I am just so worried that if i take him to the hospital to get checked out they will take him away from me.  For background my son accidently killed his biological father after we got into a heated argument. He doesn't remember how it happened, so I made it look like shelving collapsed on him in the garage. We then moved to another town to start over, but it seems like bad stuff just keeps following us. Now i am at risk of losing our new business because of false advertising, i don't want to also potentially lose my son. I had to pull him out of highschool and he is now homeschooling with one of his friends who also works part time at the business we own. my son is the sweetest  person on earth, he just gets confused some times. he has recently taken up taxidermy which is a bit alarming to me but it seems to keep him busy, i just wish he would go out and spend more time with people his own age.

Fast forward to my 18 my parents wanted to throw a birthday party on my behalf however we now had technical difficulties at my home and our gate fell apart…  Well guess what no birthday anymore. We didn’t spend Christmas for 2 years and that meant no Christmas presents. Now in no way am I mas at my parents for those because I am grateful for everything my parents do for me but my mom lent my aunt money a few years ago and she is does not want to ask my aunt that money back. So now we are no longer having my birthday plus we are in debt. I feel super guilty cause I told my mom to ask her money back and I feel like I’m pressuring her but I just want to know if I’m the a-hole for telling her to ask the money back?

ixvgv45k	I've been with my husband since we were teens. He comes from a pretty dysfunctional family. FIL was a great dad but an absolutely awful husband, verging on emotional abuse. They are from a culture/social class where arranged marriages were common and theirs was mostly arranged.  At some point MIL met a man and they became "friends" He was also in an arranged marriage, very unhappy and he said he couldn't leave until his kids were 18 (about 4 more years) for the first year they had an affair and flaunted it in front of FIL. After a year her BF proposed that she move into a house he owned and be like his full time mistress, he'd give her an allowance, pay all bills, etc.  FIL was humiliated. My husband was angry and hurt for his dad. It really strained his relationship with MIL and being dumb teens we took justice into our own hands and snuck into the new house while she slept (she gave her son an emergency key) and set off stink bombs in literally every room. She had to flee in pajamas and almost puked. the house stank to high heaven for like a week. We also videotaped her escape for FIL.   MIL cut her son off for throwing a water balloon at her and he didn't see her for the next year. As of today they have an ok but surface level relationship. They have somewhat worked on things and he at least sees his dad for who he is now. We bought our first house after years of saving and are so proud. We had a small housewarming dinner and MIL said she had to go to the bathroom and her husband (he did marry her when his kids turned 18) went with her. They were gone a long time so we got suspicious. They were in our bedroom trashing shit. MIL poured sticky substances all over the bathroom floor and put glitter in our bed. I wanted to cry. When I came in her husband sprayed liquid ass and i nearly puked (I get karma but I was a kid when I went after her love shack)  I burst into tears and my husband was furious. MIL said I was being a baby and payback is fair. My husband kicked her out because I couldn't even talk. We decided they are banned forever, even if we host family holidays in the future. MIL said she doesn't care she is banned but it hurts her that we are so hypocritical and if we wanted any relationship we should have laughed.	1642954421.0	sax1pq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sax1pq/aita_for_banning_mil_and_sfil_forever_over_their/	AITA for banning MIL and SFIL forever over their revenge prank?

So my dog doesn't like kids she will put up with them but if she can get away from them she can. I told the kids that were there to please leave her alone and she was put in a room away from everyone.   After abit I went in to feed her and was sitting there with her  (She eats better when someone is there) anyway I walked away to use the bathroom come back and this little girl is poking my dog while she was eating. My dog was not reacting but she is hold and could snap. I got really stern with said girl telling her to not touch the dog.

hodal1ea	So my (m32) girlfriend (f28) and I play this game called rim world and we play together a lot. So we decided that we would build different bases on the same map and have our own colonists and resources. It was going fine until she freaking stole a advanced component from my base (which is very rare) and I got mad. I told her to give it back or I will kill her colonists so she said fine and gave it back to me, but I said I need more as compensation so she gave me an extra component. I was still kind of salty so I went to her base and had my colonist kill a prisoner she wanted to recruit as a joke. She was visibly upset because she was trying to recruit him for a while but I didn’t care as it was just petty revenge. When the next raid pops up, I sent my colonists to fight the raid and she said she will get on the mortars to support me. Instead of supporting me, she destroys my whole base with the mortars, and let’s the raid kill my colonists. I was upset at this point and start yelling at her in real life and push her off the chair. I told her we had a truce and she broke it and was yelling at her while she was crying.

She has had many of these sorts of phobias due to her autism, mostly when she was around 9-10, however they have all faded over time except her balloon fear.   Although we have quite a close relationship, this was the first time she outright asked me to help her get over one of her fears. She told me it was because she had tried to get over it herself and was unable to. She was scared of what others at her school would say if they found out. After a few days of thinking about it, we came up with a solution.  Since her exams are approaching shortly, I thought it would be good to kill two birds with one stone. Every night, she is to do one page from either her maths or physics textbook, as those are the two subjects she has had the worst grades in. Nothing too bad, but we both agree she could do better with revision. Afterwards, I check her answers and for each incorrect answer, I put one balloon in her room and remove it the next day.  I thought this was fair, as it would both help her to get over her fear and encourage her not to make mistakes. She was hesitant but agreed as well. Things went fine for the first three days, as she managed 100% each time, but on the fourth day she made 2 mistakes. As per our agreement, I put 2 balloons in her room and said I would take them out the next morning.   She avoided her room like the plague (she usually spends most of the day in her room), and in the morning I saw both balloons in the hallway. I questioned her about it and she broke down crying, she asked if we could stop the textbook agreement since she "doesn't think she could face it right now".   I told her that her exams were important, but she said that she would keep revising just without the balloons involved. I felt that would defeat the point of facing her fear so I told her no, we could stop after her exams. I tried to explain to her how this was a good test of resilience because in the real world, mistakes have consequences and those consequences are often a lot scarier than a balloon. She kept crying and told me to get out of her room.   Now I'm conflicted, my husband told me not to be so soft on her since she's not a child anymore, but also don't like seeing her upset. I'm still going to stick with the agreement since she asked me to help her face her fear, but I also don't want to stress her out too much before her exams.

ixx5fox1	I (22M) get along pretty well with my brother's friend (25M). and we both seem to enjoy each other's presence. We didn't have each other's contacts for the first four years of knowing each other but we would chat to each other a lot whenever we saw each other and he showed interest in me.   Recently in December during a small party/get together, that my brother and I and the friend in question all attended. His friend and I chatted a LOT and he was very interested in me. Since my brother was leaving for couple months, during the friend gave me his number and told me "Make sure you text me!" he was telling me how I could always contact him for anything. After the party ended, My brother had to go to do some errands so the friend asked me if he could drive me home, I was down for that. We both talked a lot in the car, it was very easy for us to have a conversation, it seemed like we were always good friends (When reality is we were acquaintances who got along amazingly well). Few times during the drive the friend told me couple times to make sure to text him, I assumed he wanted to be friends. And we told my brother, and he was pretty chill with us talking, and I asked if he wouldn't mind us going out for coffee or something, he told me he didn't mind at all.  During the rest of December we texted couple times every 2days-2 weeks. But he barely replied to me because he's a busy guy after all he's in Medical School and has thousands of other obligations. But whenever he replies, he's always apologizing for the late replies and then just talking and asking me questions, but then when I reply back he doesn't reply until the next day or doesn't reply unless if i double text after few days. And also he never reaches out, it's always me who does. This makes me question his intentions. We did make plans to hang out last weekend but our plans fell through because of the snow storm. But I trusted that he wanted to be friends because if he didn't want to be friends he would have either never replied or replied but in a dry way.  January (This month) rolled around, and I called him for help and he was down to help right away and he did and then we both talked a bit and whatever. But my family is making me question things.   My brother seemed kinda mad (I don't know about what) when I talked to him on FaceTime and then he asked me to give my phone to my mom and then after we ended the call, my mom asked me if I talk to the friend. I'm like uh yes but barely. And then she's like "oh please, I know you spam his soul and text each day. STOP texting him. I don't want your brother to be mad about you talking to him."  I asked her if my brother said anything about him, and she denied it. But I don't believe it.  But since that moment, I have not texted him since then and felt really bad about myself. I still do not know if he talked bad about me or if he actually does want to be friends or idk his intentions.  Am I the asshole for assuming that he wants to be friends?	1642955515.0	saxgmk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxgmk/aita_for_assuming_my_brothers_friend_wants_to_be/	AITA For assuming my brother's friend wants to be friends?
h1qfo20b	So, for a little backstory, I (19F) just got into the college that I had always wanted and I got close with one of my classmate (21M).   When I met him, I knew he had a relationship of almost 2 years, so I backed down even if I had started liking him. From day one, he was giving me way too much attention and everyone saw it. Fast forward, he ended up knowing my feelings. I told him straight up that he was an amazing friend and to just ignore it because I wasn't that type of person, but he said that he liked me too and he wouldn't ignore it. A few days later, when I basically told him I was there for him just as a friend, the next day when me and others classmates went to his appartment to study, he told everyone (when I was to the store) that he liked me and was going to break up with his gf and what he should do next.  Fast forward, they broke up but he was weird. He was all that I was looking for in a person so that why I kinda ignored the red flags (plus, he just ended a relationship, so I didn't want to appear overbearing or else). It was like a rollercoaster, one day we were fine and the next day we weren't talking, without anything happening, but in person he was really affectionate. He was giving me mixed signals and I did the same (and boy, did he not like that!), because I saw how weird the situation was. Learning about him still talking to his ex really affectionate and admit to still sleeping with her, I was really just stepping out of that "relationship" with him. He then got mad because I wasn't chasing him like his ex was.  Now, what made him pissed off? (although I feel like insecure is the perfect word)  When I told him I had options (more like a joke in that situation) after he tried to make it seem like he was like a god in my life and should just be more willing to do whatever he wanted. Then I was ignored by him for a few days until the end of the week, when we saw each other before I went out of town. I then learned that he was back with his ex. My other classmate said that it was my fault for saying that and making him bad.

f2dvdgl4	So I also posted this to r/lgbt but I want less bias opinions too.  Would I be the asshole if I don’t want to come out to my friends even though it’s actually just my best friend. They’re non-binary and bisexual so I know that they will see no problem with it but that’s not the reason. I feel like they’ve always pushed being bi onto me (and I’m not) when I was identifying as straight. I feel like them saying that I’m bi and saying how I was ‘supposedly straight’ when we were talking about sexuality just hurt my process of figuring out who I am. They also once sent me an ‘am I a lesbian’ pdf which like, I very obviously am attracted to men, there’s no doubt about it. Because of this I don’t want to come out to them and so I won’t come out to anyone. I have no problem with not coming out so this is no problem to me and will cause no harm to myself. I’m just wondering if it’s wrong or selfish to do so.  Also if it helps  - I’m omnisexual but heteroromantic.  - I’m female  - And only feel romantic attraction to men but sexual attraction to every gender - The reason I see not coming out as not a problem is that since I’m still heteroromantic I will only be dating men so it’s not like they actually need to know who I might hook up with in the future	1642955574.0	saxhdn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxhdn/aita_if_i_dont_come_out_to_my_friends_even_though/	AITA if I don’t come out to my friends even though most of them are queer???
blnbrp4n	I (24f) work from home, so I spend quite a lot of time at home. My housemate, "Mia" (25f) isn't employed at the moment as she's starting an online business. She hasn't many friends around here as she's from abroad (like me, but from another country) she only goes out to do groceries or for an occasional walk a few days a week. We've been living together for about 6 months.  My problem with Mia is that she spends every waking moment on the phone or making video calls, we have thin walls and she has a strong voice (even when trying to speak quietly, and she forgets in a minute anyway) so I can perfectly hear anything she says from the other side of our apartment. Since she wakes up in the morning till after 1 am when she goes to bed. The one or 2 hours she's not on the phone, she's watching TV. At first, I thought I could deal with it as I can't understand her language anyway so it's not like I am receiving any input, so to speak. Or I would just put on my headset with some music. But it's starting to really wear me out. It's freezing cold here and I still go out for hours so I can enjoy some silence.  Today I've had a terrible headache since I woke up and asked her to please leave the phone just for a day. She asked me what does my headache have to do with her talking with her family. To just take a pill. I told her I just need some silence. She got mad at me, went back to her room, and went back to being on the phone again as she received a call.  I understand I can't ask her not to pick up or make calls for me, and that she may feel lonely. But I wake up and fall asleep hearing her conversations and her ringtone every day. And I think the headaches are caused by me wearing my headset every day, I've been suffering from them during this whole month.

isgab8le	Okay. so for some background, my roommate “Grace” (20F) and i (20F) have been living together since freshman year (were sophomores now). About a week into freshman year we went to this party and i saw a really cute boy “Alex”(21M). We talked for a few months but it didn’t really go anywhere.   He started to like my roommate aka my best friend, and she told me when he first admitted it that she 1. would never date him bc of previous instances with him, and 2. she would never date him bc she knew i really liked him.  flash forward to this year, and i’m pretty sure she’s been lying to me about a lot of things in regards to him. she would randomly disappear in the closing months of last semester and refused to tell us where she was going. i figured she was going to see a boy. a few weeks ago she “started dating” Alex. looking back on it and using context clues i’m pretty sure they’ve been dating for at least a few months.  we’re still in the dorms for financial reasons, and she came to me wednesday asking if Alex could stay over Saturday. i was hesitant because i had work on sunday and she and i sleep in the same room… and we all know college students typically can’t keep their hands to themselves. but. i reluctantly agreed when she promised they wouldn’t do anything.  i spent the entire night unable to sleep because of how uncomfortable i was in my own bedroom.. they were trying to play it off like they were just sleeping but i could hear their moans and them sucking face all night long.  i had work at noon and at 9am they were still feeling each other up.  Grace doesn’t think she did anything wrong, and i kinda lost my temper at her the next day.

7k08d55u	I was at dinner with a few of my guy friends that I haven't seen in a while, so we were all catching up. So I said to my friend Jack "like  oh I heard you and so and so were together for a bit" and he got mildly upset of course like "what that's not true like who said that" and I was like "oh yeah sarah mentioned it a while ago." and then the conversation continued to him talking about he most recent love life.   Little info. sarah has a superiority complex and constantly mentions my guy friends--who she actually doesn't know. However, she's now officially dating one of them who is kind of on the outs. He tells her every detail about what the other guys are doing, and then she repeats it to me as a way to feel idk superior. So her boyfriend tells her too much stuff about other people. And she runs hot and cold, when she's nice its great, when shes negative and talking about other people its annoying.   Fast forward to last night, sarah is in my room, and the guys are in their own. So i guess sarahs's boyfriend said something off to my friend Jack, and he went off "well you need to tell your girlfriend to stop telling \[me\] that I'm with people." As you can assume, her boyfriend texts sarah that this is all happening. She stands up and says "did you tell Jack that I said that" and I said yes I did it was casual conversation. Then she said "i never said that". and I said "you did...a while ago, and that is what I told him. She starts packing her stuff up and storms out and slams my dorm. Meanwhile my roommate is here just watching this all go down.   My personal opinion is that she wants everyone to like her, especially Jack, because she thought he didnt like her. Now that this has been confirmed shes blaming me for having a conversation with my friends.   &#x200B;  AITA in this situation.   &#x200B;  I also know this sounds so childish, and genuinely I could go without speaking to her because it is.

fytpolir	I (24f) am currently pregnant with my second child, I broke up with the father before I even found out I was pregnant because he pressured me into sex 2 weeks after I had hip surgery then lied about putting a condom on (he opened it so I heard it then didn’t put it on) until after he finished the laughed it off and said he wanted me to have his baby…. Well it worked. I couldn’t trust him after that and left then found out I was pregnant. I don’t trust him with me but I’m not heartless so I let him be involved with the baby and pregnancy. The thing is I refuse to have him in the delivery room with me, I’ll have to have a C-section and while yes he should be one of the first to meet the baby I need someone I trust and can keep me calm with me while delivering and that’s my mom. I’ve explained this all to him and he’s fighting back more on it the closer we get. Yesterday it was “well I’ll have to, you’ll have security throw me out if I try” which is true but only for actual delivery as soon as we’re both out and in post delivery room he’s welcome to be here. But between the guilt trips and push back from him I’m just wondering if I’m TA for my decision.	1642956892.0	saxzj9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxzj9/aita_for_just_wanting_mom_in_the_room_with_me/	AITA for just wanting mom In the room with me?
9mdf42mk	It sounds really bad, right?  To cut the story short, I (22F) wanted to leave the house. My bf (24M) took my keys and didn’t realize I had a spare. I started up the car and started to back up on the driveway. He ran up behind my car to stop me. I was crying, I couldn’t see, and I was never very good at pulling out anyway.  I tried pleading with him to move. Moving my car backward an INCH at a time. I never even touched the gas. I’d release the brake for half a second and then press it again. The speedometer never even hit 1 mph, I was going that slow. I never felt that I hit anything. He slaps the trunk of my car a couple times and I give up. He’s not budging. I give up and pull forward. Turn off my car and stay there.  After a couple minutes I hear a cry and hysterical sobbing. I step out and he’s laying on the floor where he was standing. I ask if he’s alright what’s going on. And he starts screaming “You  h i t me!!! You h i t me with your car!!!!!! You were going to r u n me over!!!!!!!!”  I start panicking. Did I? Maybe I didn’t pay attention when I pulled forward. Is it possible? I start panicking and apologizing, not that that could make it right. I ask if he’s injured and where (I’m an EMT), if I should call an ambulance. I think, maybe I r a n over his foot when I was pulling forward?  He won’t stop screaming, he won’t tell me if he’s injured, he’s curled up as if he’s in pain. Eventually my neighbors come out to his screaming on the floor and rush to check on him. Immediately he stands up, and the woman immediately goes “Okay you’re safe I’m out I’m leaving” and nopes right out of there.   I look at him angrily. “You’re fine? You had me so scared. The whole neighborhood came out. Did I even actually h i t you?”  “You did h i t me! When you were backing up. I felt your car touch my knees. I had to h i t your trunk so you’d realize how close you were. You would have r u n me over. You h i t me. Don’t worry I won’t tell the police.”  I think he faked it. I never felt anything and nothing checks out. Later he changed his story and said “It was a miscommunication, I never meant to say h i t it was the wrong word. You just touched me. I fell on the ground screaming and crying because I was emotionally overwhelmed and collapsed.”  AITA for what happened? I never should have backed up knowing he was standing there, but I was hoping he would leave.	1642956946.0	say0a1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say0a1/aita_for_h_i_t_t_i_n_g_my_bf_24m_with_my_car/	AITA for h i t t i n g my bf (24M) with my car?
ixxde3vs	Posting for my parents.  We have an ongoing situation in our family. The older generation had 7 children total, 4 boys, 3 girls. The boys all got married and started families at a normal age, and the girls...just didn't. All three girls are still unmarried at 35, 32, and 27. Two of the girls have children but were never involved with the fathers.   Because the girls don't have husbands or boyfriends, the manual labor tasks that would fall to them fall to their fathers. Of course we don't mind helping our daughters, but at this point we're all over 65 years old. We aren't going to be around forever and we definitely can't keep helping them on the level that we have to. The boys are starting to worry that it's all going to fall on them and be a constant obligation when they have their own families.    I understand that every family is going to have one "maiden aunt" who never gets married and is a collective family duty, but that's one in q generation, not all of the women in a generation.   We wanted to have a family meeting to have a talk about what exactly can and should happen here and what their expectations actually are for family help if they are going to stay single, and things quickly went south with them calling us sexist. I don't think that's mean or out of place at this point to consider the future when we have an unusual situation that doesn't really have a guidebook.

I moved out of my mothers house who is an alcoholic in with my dad who is also an alcoholic to go to a different school. His gf doesn’t like me and a lot of the time I don’t get fed and my dad doesn’t even know about this.

ixyiq6va	My (25F) coworker (30s?M) is Muslim. I don't know him well, but I do know this, because he has to schedule his participation in meetings around a specific prayer schedule. He has a flexible work schedule, where most of his work is at home, but he comes in two days a week and when an issue comes up with a client.  Yesterday, he needed to come in for an emergency meeting. He seemed very rushed, and I casually asked him if anything was wrong. He said he wanted to be home in time for his wife to make it to plans she had with her friends, because he was supposed to be at the house, and they couldn't leave the kids by themselves. He left shortly after.  This morning, I asked him if his wife made her plans, and he said she did. I asked him how many kids he had, trying to be conversational, and he said three "at the moment." I thought that phrasing was weird, and he explained that he and his wife were foster parents. I asked him if the kids living with them were Muslim too, and he said only one was.  I was shocked. I told him it seemed inappropriate to have kids who weren't Muslim living with a Muslim family. He looked annoyed and said we shouldn't be talking about this. I asked him if they let the kids eat bacon, and he said no, they didn't keep pork in the house. I said I thought that was unfair, and he got really huffy with me. He asked me if I thought the kids would rather be sleeping on cots in an overcrowded group home than in his nice house where each kid had their own room and fresh home cooked meals that just didn't have pork in them. Then he stormed off.  I still think the situation is messed up and want to call the Department of Children and Families. I mentioned this to my boyfriend, and he said that I should mind my business and that asking my coworker about his religion at work was playing with fire. I feel like I have a duty to these kids though.  I know I offended my coworker, but he chose to take offense. The well-being of the kids is the most important thing, right?	1642958565.0	sayn1b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sayn1b/aita_for_looking_out_for_a_child/	AITA for looking out for a child?

If we’re hanging out alone, i would try to keep as much distance as i can between us, anything to signal that we’re not friends/together. I would walk quicker in a busy sidewalk so its as if im walking alone. I feel like a bad friend, but I already brought this to his attention a long time ago. I really can’t wrap my head around someone who chooses to wear things with stains and holes in them, willingly, with no care. He has money, he’s just terrible at managing it that he spends it over other things. He doesn’t care about looking put together, that he sometimes looks homeless. Shaggy beard, shaggy hair, holes in his sweatpants and stains on his top. He says he doesn’t care about what he wears so its not like i can talk him into dressing better.

8twhoign	Ok so, my friend and I have a tradition of trying out beers together(for 2 years now), and usually pay half/half for them  For some time already, he's been working for his college tutoring, and brags to me about how much he's making, meanwhile I'm broke and don't have a job, also a college student.  This time I found something new we haven't tried, he told me to buy it.  I got kinda upset that he didn't even consider asking if it should be on him, which I'd decline anyway, out of politeness, and told him he should buy them since I don't have a job currently.  He hasn't replied to the messages I've sent. Am I the asshole?  TL;DR: Friend brags about the money he's making, I'm unemployed, tells me I should pay for beer, I politely tell him to fuck off, AITA?	1642958742.0	saypgl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saypgl/aita_for_straight_up_refusing_to_pay_for_something/	AITA for straight up refusing to pay for something
9ajjt97v	Four years ago, my mother died in a car accident and my dad forced my brother and I to do all the hard work.  Getting money at home was my way of getting what I thought was rightfully mine. Me and my brother didn’t receive an allowance or pocket money, yet were expected to do all the chores. Thus, we’d take money we found around our house as some kind of compensation for our hard work and spend it on toys, food, etc.  One day while looking for money, I ventured into my parent’s room and opened a drawer and inside was an envelope with my missing mother’s name on it. It also said the envelope contained something like £23. It was from the hospital and was part of the contents of her purse when she died. I knew it was wrong, but I thought “What the hell?” So I took a couple of pounds.  Later, I took more. And more. Eventually, all the money was gone, yet I left the envelope in the drawer. My dad said I ruined her memory and he cried the whole night.

hlufpzui	So me and this guy had a thing right he was cool at first but I think he got the wrong idea and started coming around uninvited. He knows where I work and we live in about a 5 mile radius.   I started to think something was off with him but couldn't put a finger on it. One night I was out with some friends next to a spot he hangs out at and when I stepped outside for some air he was leaning on my car hand on the doorhandle. I started yelling at him and quickly realized he was hammered AF.   I think I scared him cause he moved away and started walking towards what looked like his uber.   Flash forward a half hour and he's passed out in the middle of a parking space? Next to my car?   I hated the scene he made and the fact he put his hands on my ride so I hopped in and left sort of... giggling about it. Blocked him too.

iy02ofz0	I'm a Male, 25 years old, work in the IT industry. I have a relatively good job, with stable income and I'm generally healthy, despite being a little overweight due to stress eating.   I've been chronically anxious ever since I was a kid, and this caused many problems in my life. (chain smoker and at one point almost alcoholic)      I go to therapy, every week, and I have used various types of medication during my life. It has helped me a lot, I'm free of Nicotine and rarely drink.      Despite the improvement over the years, sometimes my anxiety just explodes for some reason or another and I want to talk to my friends about it.      "Why do I feel Alone", "why am I unable to socialize as I did when I was younger", "Do my friends hate me ?", "Why cant I be satisfied with my current life" and all this sorts of thoughts.      When I have these I tend to go to a friend and talk about it, and sometimes just talking can help me relax a little bit, but some of my friends say that they can't help me, I should just go to therapy or take medications or whatever.      I understand their side of things. Talking to an anxious person is hard, its energy consuming and most times the person you are talking to cannot do anything about it.      But I just want someone that I'm not paying (the psychologist) to listen to me and so I cant share a little bit of my pain. It reached a point where I will just not talk to anyone about it out of fear of losing my whole group of friends.      AITA for thinking they should listen to me a little bit, for thinking they should care a little.      I'm having a hard time drawing the line between my friends just not caring about me and they just stopping for their own wellbeing.	1642958784.0	saypzy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saypzy/aita_for_trying_to_talk_to_my_friends_about_my/	AITA for trying to talk to my friends about my fears and anxiety ?

14eoyt	I have been streaming video games on Twitch since October 2020. In September 2021, I started seeing a woman, and I made sure to tell her I streamed. Things were going well, but as time went on, she became upset about my streaming because there are women in my Twitch chat.  The first issue we had was when she found out I was following some female Twitch streamers on Instagram. She said “liking someone’s selfie is telling the person you’re attracted to them and interested in them,” which I told her is not true. Because I care about her, I unfollowed people.  Moving forward, she'd hang out in my apartment while I streamed. After each stream, she would ask things like “who’s this?” and “why did this person say she missed you?” I tried to explain that people saying “love you” and “I miss you” in Twitch chat doesn’t mean anything, at least not in the sense where there is any attraction or emotional investment.  After another stream, she said she didn’t like how I called my mod and best female friend irl by a nickname. I was annoyed but agreed to not use it.  One day, I opened up TikTok, which I rarely used, to show her something. There was a DM from a woman on Twitch sharing a TikTok video along with laughing and hearts emojis (there was nothing else before those messages). My gf was furious, going on about women only sending heart emojis if they're interested. I told her that’s not the case and I wouldn’t respond. She countered with "you would have responded if I didn’t know about it" and I agreed, saying I would have sent laughing emojis if the video was funny. I deleted my TikTok, saying I would show her DMs so she could trust me.  Yesterday, we got into an argument because a woman who hasn’t been in my Twitch chat in awhile came in saying “lurking but wanted to say hi. Looooove you and I miss you." All I said was “miss you too!” My gf was pissed stating I have no boundaries with these women, who are disgusting for sending heart emojis and things like that when I have a gf and some of them have bfs. She said it’s wrong that I let them say these things to me without a care in the world. I exploded saying she doesn’t trust me, she doesn’t support my hobby, and she’s reading into things that mean nothing. I even brought up how I stopped calling my best friend by her nickname, stating “let’s take your male friend, (NAME). You call him (NICKNAME). Imagine if I said I don’t like you calling him that.” She told me that’s totally different.  Anyway, she said "I'm never going to be okay with these women in your chat." Twitch streaming is a passion of mine, and I don't want to give it up. I love connecting over video games with people. I tried to explain that if she trusted me, she wouldn’t have to worry about what people say because it comes down to my actions in the end. My gf sees it differently, saying she’s a woman and she knows what women want and what they’ll send and say to try and get it. Is she right?

52fmxw6z	My (26F) Mom (67F) and I have a reoccurring argument about my childhood dog, Max.  The family got a white lab named Max when I was 8 and my brothers were much older. She became my dog very quickly, and we were irrespirable throughout my childhood and teenage years. Max was truly my emotional support animal before I knew that was a thing.  My brother ended up getting a pit bull from a website when he was 20 and I was 13ish. My Mom would cry every time we left there because my brother was young, worked a lot, and this dog was obviously high energy. She was distraught about this dog to the point that she basically just took her. One day, she took her home and my brother was fine with it.  Max and her dog got into a fight maybe a year into living together. Her dog was terrifying, honestly - you could tell she was bred to fight. It was a traumatic experience to see my dog being mauled by another dog. Max had to have emergency stitches and we were told she could have due to where she was bit.  After that, my mom decided to separate the dogs. This didn't last long, and they ended up together again. Another dog fight happened. The same thing again - separation, then fight. This happened 4 or 5 times, I can't remember exactly.   Her dog was sent to multiple trainers, would learn briefly, then as soon as my mom got her home she'd completely fuck up any progress made.  One Christmas, Max was attacked and she had to have stitches on her cheek. We took her to the vet on Christmas, my dad with blood on his face. Instead of this being a traumatic topic, my parents have brought this event up as a joke this last Christmas.  When I moved away at 18, I had to leave Max in a house with that dog and my mom, who obviously preferred the other dog. I believe at that point they were always separated, so Max was alone a lot. I was able to take Max to live with me, but only for 6 months because she got sick with lymphoma and had to be put down.  This is a regularly argued about topic, and I've never received a sorry. The topic has been used as a subject for jokes about the trauma of it all. My moms dog has since passed as well (evil never dies - she got to be 14 years old) and she has plaques for her dog, a blanket with her face on it, keeps her picture around always. My dog (OUR family dog) is absolutely no where to be found.

ic4ccoqa	AITA i was at home and I didnt know I wasnt supposed to have people over. I invited a friend and we were sitting around talking with my sister ( shes 12 ) we were sitting around and he made a somewhat inapropriate joke, he asked her to cross her eyes and stick out her tounge and see if she tasted salt. She did it and I got kinda mad at him. Then that made me think of a prank I pulled a while back and asked him hey stick your tounge out and pretend to shake salt on it see if you can taste it. He doesnt speak great english and misunderstood. My sister however understood and did it. Then after a bit we were talking and somehow someone said uwu then he started talking about h3nt@l I had no idea he would do this and didnt kno wwhere it came from and asked him to stop. He didnt and eventualy my sister looked it up. She mispelt it the first couple times but then she found it. It was at this point my dad asked him to leave and got mad at me for inviting him. I didnt know he was going to do that and it was way out of character for him.

ibnak0tx	On mobile.   Hi everyone, I am not at a loss, however I am fed up.  I (30s f) teach high school. I have three students who are failing my class.  Student 1: One hasn’t shown up in weeks. Student 2: is obsessed with his gf and because he cannot sit next to her, he “will not work.” His words. All he does is put his arms around her and they look at each other’s faces. All class. Foreheads touching. Zero work is done when they are together regardless. So they’ve been separated during class.  Student 3: is a class trouble maker and for some reason, also will not work.   All good kids, in my book, ALL THREE are very capable of doing the work and HAVE done some, but all three are missing every single assignment given. I won’t tell you their grades, but the highest grade out of the three is lower than a 15%   Student 1: who hasn’t show up in weeks. I just found out that parents wanted this student a work from home. This student was supposed to complete and submit work (I have everything online for them), NOTHING has been done.  Student 2: Does not have a learning disability. I spoke with counselor/went through documentation, there is zero reports of an undiagnosed disability. He simply is refusing because he is away from his girlfriend. His girlfriend also slacks in class, but not failing.   Student 3: will not work. Also does not have a learning disability or any disability. This was researched with the counselor Friday.   Everyone who I can contact has been contacted parent/guardian wise. Multiple times. For all three of these students NO ONE has replied or gotten back to me. The high school administrators are also in the loop.   The situation:  Student 1’s parents are fighting and wants them to have PERSONAL 1-1 TIME. Of course now that grades are due and their GPA will be tanked. They say student 1 was out because they feel unsafe with the big bug of the world. So we should honor it.  I overheard Student 2 and Student 3 saying that they’re just going to come to me right before grades are due, to ask me for help and how to do every single assignment that they haven’t turned in, to walk them through them all and “basically give us the answers because if we fail, it looks bad on her.”  Why I could possibly be the AH  Grades are due next week. Report cards come out the next day (if grades are due Thursday, report cards come out Friday). Now I am willing to help, but I will NOT make them a priority over the students I have who worked hard and are getting their work done. I understand that now it is very overwhelming for them. But I will just get to them if and when I have the time. But they have to work on their own until then.   WIBTA if I went about it in this way?	1642960120.0	saz8pt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saz8pt/wibta_if_i_dont_make_my_failing_students_a/	WIBTA if I don’t make my failing students a priority?
ndzzhn	Writing all this for the 2nd time because I dropped my phone right when I was about to press "post" and it all got deleted.  Me and my boyfriend have been together for about 2 years. We're both it our early 20's. We hardly have fights, just small disagreements.  He is the absolute sweetest guy I've ever met. We often talk about our future together, and we've discussed marriage multiple times (although we don't plan on doing it soon. We're in no hurry). We've agreed that huge weddings are a waste of money and that a small wedding with friends and family would be alright. We also agree that we don't need official papers to show our love for each other, but he's never said he doesn't want to get married. This is why our conversation tonight took me by surprise.  He sent me a video of a guy running for his life when his girlfriend caught the bride's flowers when she threw them. I told him I'd be broken if he ever did that. He said he finds it funny, and it doesn't mean that the dude doesn't want to marry her, just that he doesn't want to marry, "like all of us".  I asked what he meant by that, and he said he simply doesn't like the idea of marriage, but if he does it it's gonna be with me. Copy-pasted (and a bit translated) text of his:  "If I'm given the opportunity of marriage or stay a couple forever with all the benefits of marriage, I won't marry. But since that doesn't apply, I will"  I ask him if the benefits are the only thing he cares about, and he says "It's one of the things I care about. For example, if im in the hospital, you can't come visit me unless we're married", which is true.  He said he doesn't find marriage that important and that there's nothing wrong with it.  At this point I'm in tears. I want to tell people I'm going home to my husband. I want to have his last name. I want people to see a ring on his finger and be like "damn, she must be so lucky". I told him all of this, and I've definitely told him how important it is to me in the past. That why I lost my shit when he said "I didn't know it was that important to you, how could I?"  Because I told you. That's how. I called him a "fucking asshole".  He's apologised, saying he didn't know. This was his last text.  I'm currently crying at work, hoping no client comes til I manage to calm down. I have no idea how to handle this situation. I can post screenshots of our conversation if needed for any reason (I'm pretty sure I'm not making any sense right now, I hope I've explained everything well enough).  I just can't stop thinking that I'll never be able to enjoy marrying him, knowing that it has 0 meaning to him. That he only wants the damned benefits.  AITA for reacting like this, or should I have just understood that we simply have different opinions on this subject and not given it much thought?	1642960194.0	saz9pl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saz9pl/aita_for_calling_my_boyfriend_a_fucking_asshole/	AITA for calling my boyfriend a "fucking asshole" because he said he only wants to marry for the benefits of it?
5fvfp9fd	 . One thing my boss also does is my patient is bedridden, and she needs to take her in her liquid because she has late-stage dementia. It’s hard for her to Eat and swallow, and she chokes very quickly. My boss knew I had little to no experience with the elderly when I got this job, and she gave me the most complex patient to work with or be a caregiver for because all the other patients aren’t bedridden   I try using bright-colored food or dessert or playing music that she likes or using lovely images and stuff and a friendly, calming tone to try to get her to eat. I try to bring desserts and things like in a small amount to get her excited about eating and look excited about eating. I try to eat in front of her to show that I like to eat also or to try to get her excited about eating or me or my behavior, but some days she won’t eat or will push away from all the staff or will lash out and push away from all the staff even the staff that are considered her favorites I looked at the notes and on days that I wasn’t there are days where some of the team cannot get her fed or anything or get her any liquids but somehow   My boss blames me and says that I don’t have a motherly touch and am awful at my job. I barely got any training, like just a week of shadowing or just like the other CNA‘s helping me out for a couple of days and then just being thrown in, which I’m not complaining about. Still, the patient also lashes out constantly and pinches and breaks the skin or like yanks on clothing and Hair. She does this frequently with staff, and even if we try to de-escalate the situation, there’s nothing we can do because I have to change her diaper.   My boss constantly tells me I’m terrible, talks shit about me behind my back to other employees. I stay later after work to help other CNA‘s like trying to change her diaper and stuff and see how they do their job, or I show up early, like 20 minutes before sometimes to try to like change her diaper or get help from other CNA‘s to see what I can do better or build my a better relationship with her. I try using positive affirmations with my client try using a calm tone of voice and giving her a nice touch, trying to calm her down with music, or trying to explain what I’m doing before what I do, like changing her diaper, not to make her uncomfortable. Still, because I’m the only staff member, it sometimes makes sure I’m comfortable. I’m tired of going to work and being told that it is my fault I’m physically lashed out at. My boss constantly gossips about me to other employees and tells them that I’m awful. Well, I am saying nothing of this to my face or giving know following up or training or shadowing to help me out at work. Why does my boss treat me this way?

doe1sjd0	So yesterday me, my dad and his girlfriend that he already broke with and is back with her again, were watching a movie and they invited me to go ride a bike and since it wasnt even 2 days we came back from a trip in Chicago i said: No, Chicago was a perfect city for us to bike on and do everything, i want to rest and be on my own, we could’ve biked in chicago if you had actually paid for stuff.  So adding a bit more context: We went to Chicago to stay at my aunt house for 1 month and my aunt paid for EVERYTHING, food, parking, lodging when we went on a road trip, groceries, fuel etc and all my dad bought was stufd for him and his gf and when it was time for all to pay togheter he kept saying his card was blocked, and he wasn’t grateful for being there either, he kept saying he sidnt wanna come and that he wanted to go back to his gf and its very rare for Brazilians to go to America rn let alone for one month and he kept creating fights with everybody.  So when i called him out he was mad and when the movie finished there was a big apider in my room and he kept saying he was humiliated and all and i almost said what about the times you humilates me by kicking me out of the house or letting my cousins bully me or when you called me retarded and an imbecile in front of everyone.

It seems my SIL has already taken many things from her house for her children and grandchildren without checking with anyone.  I understand that she was her main caregiver and if she had asked I don’t think anyone would have had a problem with it.  There were several things that have disappeared that some of her grandchildren wanted, my son included.  Since my husband’s death has have often felt left out by the family.

5iwtv6wl	So I (17m) have this friend (NB) who I talk to almost on a daily. They have severe paranoia and I try to help them. I try to listen, give advice, all of that. I'm usually their primary shoulder to cry on, and sometimes, whenever the conversation takes a wrong turn, or doesn't go their way, they start slandering me.     Friend was going on about how they fear that the members in a Discord server we moderate together might hate them. I try to tell them that it should be the least of their worries. As you can tell, I don't have a degree in therapy so my advice was mediocre. My responses were relatively dull, and all of a sudden they tell me that I'm repeating myself and that I don't actually care about their problems. I didn't know what to say at all, so I just tell them to believe what they want. They go onto say that I wanted them to shut up all along and that I didn't care about the conversation at all. Then they say that they're going to do chores and pretend I don't exist.     I do care about their problems, but I'm tired of being the constant therapist for them. I hate when they lash out at me, and start saying this type of stuff. They just apologized to me, but I don't know if I should really forgive them.

2c38ijh9	My girlfriend (25) and I (23) are in a LDR, living halfway the country from each other (US). We’ve only been going out for about four months and we haven’t been able to meet in person yet. She lives with family and frankly, it’s a terrible and toxic living situation. She wants to move but isn’t in a financial position to do so alone and has no one to move out with. She wants me to move to be with her.   I don’t want to. Not that I particularly love the place that I live now, but I’m not going to pack up my life for someone I’ve never been able to meet in person. I don’t mean for it to sound like I don’t like my girlfriend, I adore her and I want to visit her and be with her. I would happily live with her. But I’m not going to dump my friends and family, quit the job that I love, and get rid of my things to move to a state I have no interest in living in. It sucks that she’s in this situation and I wish there was something I could do to help, but I don’t want to move.

But Rick keeps reassuring that he is a changed man with changed morals. He even bought her a car.  I invited Rick into our home, without Beth's knowledge. I didn't expect her to come home so early, but apparently she had a half day at school. She was outraged, complaining about why I'm "opening up my legs" to Rick and accused me of being a whore. She's very upset because of Rick's behavior. I showed her the new car. She ended up rejecting, spitting on it, and opposing Rick at every situation. Rick decided that we needed to talk at the dinner table. We did.   Rick explained how much he's changed and he had another gift for Beth, something he saved for her 16 years ago. He goes to his car and brings out something large. He suddenly turns off the lights only to reveal Beth being dicked down by a large vibrator. She loved every second of it and thought it felt good. Then Rick made me give her a rim job and forcibly puke all over her ass. Then Rick made me lick the puke out of her ass alongside her shit in her asshole. Then he shoved his cock into my throat and I sucked all of his babies out.  Then me and Beth made out while Rick fucks me in the ass, while fucking Beth with a vibrator in her ass. Then we both sucked his cock like lollipops. Cum was all over our faces. Then he shoved his dick into our eyeballs, until blood is all over us and gunk of flesh. Then he opened Beth's brain, killing her, and sticking his dick inside it. He fucked her brain in and out. Then he made me eat her brain. We threw her dead body in the trashcan where Rick ended up fucking her deceased pussy. Then Rick made me fuck my dog.

ix5rkfus	So, one of my friends (17F) is very haughty about the fact that she has a job. She thinks that it means she has a better work ethic, will be more successful in life, and is under the impression that we’re jealous of her for having one. She works at a fast food chain and constantly tries to flex about it to us.  Ironically, no one in our friend group envies her at all or wants a job, and the majority of parents at our school would never even allow their kids to have jobs, since it distracts from school and extracurriculars. She also has the lowest GPA in our friend group, no offense to her, so that destroys the idea that she has a better work ethic.  She was talking about how she’s going to be much more successful than us after college since she “knows about the real world” and “knows about money.”  So I was like “Okay, since we’re on the topic then, why don’t we compare your older siblings to the rest of our older siblings?” All of us are the youngest in our families, and our older siblings are all well into the workforce.  Her older siblings who worked in high school are significantly less successful in their careers than the rest of our siblings, none of whom did. Most of our siblings are earning double or triple the income of hers.   And I was like “So, could you explain again what makes you think working in high school is somehow going to make you more successful than us? Because the evidence isn’t on your side.”  And then one of my other friends pointed out that her comment about knowing more about money isn’t true at all. Most of us actually know a lot more about investing, finance, and saving money than her. We’ve all taken classes on it and have experience managing money.  She threw an absolute fit at us, saying we hate her and are somehow jealous of her, after we pointed out how absurd her superiority complex is.	1642963316.0	sb0jf5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0jf5/aita_for_pointing_out_the_difference_in_career/	AITA for pointing out the difference in career success between my siblings and the siblings of a girl who says she’s going to be more successful than us?
iwnrut9z	I’m new to reddit so do bear with me but here goes. As a bit of context I have two guy friends who are cousins that I grew up with and both of them got girlfriends in the past year. Now I give this context as a point of comparison as to me they’re both equal, they’re like my brothers as I don’t have any siblings. One of them, Lewis (21) got a girlfriend about a year ago, he never introduced me to her officially or anything he just mentioned in passing that he does have one when I teased him about it. Oh the other hand, the cousin told me directly, showed me who she is and all and said we would be really good friends. Now we live in different countries because of university but I used to facetime them and chat to them regularly, still do with the cousin. However, since Lewis has got with his girlfriend our conversations have gone completely dead they start and end at “how you doin? Good you? Good you?” And that’s it. He also seems to have distanced himself from his cousin massively and even ignored him when they accidentally happened to be in the same spot at the same time saying he didn’t want to disturb his cousin being out on a date at a christmas market, he didn’t even say hello to him.  I can’t help but think Lewis’ is girlfriend (19) is being possessive of him since he changed his demeanor completely or something else might be off? I tried talking to him and ask if he’s truly okay but we can never really have a proper conversation  Edit: I know it’s not my place to comment on someone else’s relationship but i can’t help and be concerned when i see him be so retracted	1642963022.0	sb0exw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0exw/aita_for_judging_my_close_friends_girlfriend_whom/	AITA for judging my close friends girlfriend whom I never met …
hnpwwwl3	I’m a young mum of an adorable 9months baby and married to a lovely husband. Postpartum was a very difficult period and I am thankful my husband and my family in law were here for me to help out.  Coming back from maternity leave I unfortunately got fired from my job. I took the opportunity to extend my maternity leave and spend more time with my newborn baby. My husband was back to work , and was barely helping with home chores, but knowing I wasn’t working, I let it go.   He also started again going out for sport three to four times per week, just like he used to do before our baby was born. I got frustrated because ever since I delivered my social life was him and his family and i barely make time to see my old friends. And when I do I feel guilty to leave my baby alone with my husband who’s tired from work.  Now, I’ve started freelancing to help with our finances and also recently decided that if my husband isn’t lowering his outings, I shall also go back to my pre-baby social life just like him, 3 days a week. It sounded just fair to the both of us.  In reality, I barely manage to see my friends once a week or every other week.   My husband has been sick and stayed home the whole week. Tonight my husband needed to go out same day than me. I had scheduled that outing 2 days ago so clearly said I wouldn’t cancel because I’m really in need of a break after more than a week without going out of home and looking after him. So I go annoyed and told him to figure it out from his side. He was insisting that I should take the baby with me, which I refused, as this my only “time off” from the week.  I left really pissed off and told him to let me breath and stop guilting me whenever I’m going out.  So am I the asshole ?	1642963433.0	sb0l0q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0l0q/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_must_handle/	AITA for telling my husband that he must handle our baby and let me breathe and hangout with my friends?
g7ql5taw	Did another post about this, but To make a long story short, my soon to be ex-husband, doesn’t work/pay bills or help with my son. He preferred to play video games all day no matter how many discussions I had on the issue. I got tired of his behavior and filed for divorce. He got the paperwork and had a total meltdown and said that I’m stupid/ugly and wasted HIS time, and the only way I’ll ever get friends or another man is by buying them.   He then demanded that I pay him $2000 for a Gucci sweater that my daughter accidentally messed up, months prior, before Christmas. I told him he was crazy, there is no way I’m giving him any money. His response was that “he was going to take his money from everything in the house,” meaning he intended to start breaking my stuff. He also threw a heavy sunglasses case in my direction, but says he was just throwing it towards me. I called the police and he calmed down right away. This all happened yesterday, but things kinda cooled down during the evening, he acted like nothing happened and watched TV. However, he then accused me of trying to get him arrested and said “sorry it didn’t work, you lied and tried to get me in jail for domestic violence.” At no time did I try to get him arrested, I simply called the police to keep peace, but he always plays victim.  Today, I decided that if he’s going to be verbally abusive and act a fool then he doesn’t deserve access to use the food that I brought, the internet, or a phone on my cell phone plan, so I turned them off. I also told him any food in the house is for me and my children. He acted a fool again and said I’m controlling, crazy, and petty. Maybe it is petty, but I feel like I’m doing something to not be walked all over.

b4uuyz2d	So there's this town in the US.  It was a rural town, with 90% of the houses built in the 70's and 80's. There are around 6,000 homes or so in the town. So it's a town big enough to have multiple areas to it. They're all very similar but have very distinct personality to each of them.   &#x200B;  The local water commision of the town mandated that every home in the town install a filter to eliminate farming runoff. It wasn't a huge problem, but foresight turned out to be a major safety boon in the succeding years. Most people had replaced those filters with better ones as they rebuilt each plane, about once a decade or so. Some decided the existing filters were good enough, and couldn't justify the expense, about 1,000 per home.   &#x200B;  The water supply for the town comes from a river that we have no towns close enough to compete for the water. Slowly that has been changing though and up until recently the closest town was about a thousand miles away.   &#x200B;  About 10 years ago, we were told of another town going in up river of us. It's not really a new town, but it's expansion has brought it close enough to us for them to need some of our river water. The citizens of that town are hard partiers. So much so that it's anticipated that enough of the cornucopia of drugs they consume will leach into our water supply.   &#x200B;  Most of the newer water filters will catch those drugs, but those folks who chose not ot update their filters will be at severe risk of disease or drug related problems. We've been working with each section of our town for that decade to get the remaining homes updated, but that's just too unreasonbly hard of a timeine to meet.  &#x200B;  As a result, we've asked the town up river to just not do as much partying close to our water supply while we figure things out. Are we the asshole in asking them that?	1642963564.0	sb0mrb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0mrb/aita_town_water_supply_problem/	AITA Town water supply problem
iy2sm0wq	This is my first time using Reddit but I’ve seen these things on YouTube I hope I do it right.   My wife is 24 and I’m 37. We have been together for 3 years and have been married 1 of those years.  We recently had our first big fight… I moved into the guest bedroom and have been staying there since.   I have 2 boys from a previous marriage. The oldest is 16 and lives with my wife and I. I grounded him a couple weeks or so ago with clear disagreement and many protest from my wife.   To my surprise I came home from work to my son playing video games. My wife owned up and told me she had been allowing him to play when I’m not around. Later he tells me that she also gave him a phone and allowed him to have a party. All things I had grounded him from.   She argued with me and I told her that he wasn’t her kid so she had no right to undermine me and play mommy just because she didn’t agree with me.   She recently told me she would not enforce punishments when she’s watching my son. She won’t cook for me or do laundry. She’s only taking care of herself and my son.  I’m refusing to speak to her until she apologizes but my son says I’m not handling this correctly and that I’m being rude to her.	1642963921.0	sb0ruw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0ruw/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife/	AITA for arguing with my wife?

gygbtyqz	I was taking out my trash this morning (Apartment complex, dumpster is at the end of the complex) and my neighbor let his three (he's only supposed to have one) dogs out. One of them is a nasty little fucker who barks and snarls at people. (This dumbass also doesn't use leashes)    The dog runs around the building all the way to the dumpster, snarls at me and then runs at me and attempts to bite my leg. I kicked him the face to get him off me.   My dipshit neighbor walks up and says "Oh his bark is much worse than his bite." I simply yelled "Why don't you use a fucking leash?" He didn't say anything and walked off, yelling at the dog repeatedly because it wouldn't go with him and wanted to stand there and snarl at me some more.    I think i'm fine but I told my mom and she says that I can get in trouble for kicking it since it didn't succeed in biting me. What? Am I supposed to just let it draw blood and ruin my pants?

f6fjquin	So I, M(20) work with a F(20) who I became friends with at work. We used to talk all the time at and outside of work. Recently I stopped talking to her because I feel as if I am the only one who actually cared to talk. For instance some of my coworkers/friends always say hi or I say hi and talk to them when I am not or they are not busy. This girl is always around them but I stopped saying hi or anything to her because I don’t want to have to initiate every conversation. She says I am being childish and immature to which I do feel as if sometimes I am, but I really don’t like dealing with trying to keep a friendship that seems one-sided. She now gives me glaring looks and doesn’t want to talk to me.

901htn52	&#x200B;  This is my side of the storyfor u/OofOofMate's story  So I had just met a new friend on a popular game. We added each other to a chat app we will call her Kelly she was a year or two younger than me but I didn't mind. She introduced me to one of her friends we will call him Adrian. On the second day she started talking about one of her friends that she had lied about her age to. I told her she shouldn't have lied about her age especially he didn't lie and he was 3-4 years older than her. She added him into the group chat we where in andwe went into a call Flash forward a day and Kelly tells him about her real age. He said he wanted to think about it and decided he wasn't comfortable and blocked her. Kellywent to me and told me to block him. I refused because we had gotten to be good friends. I tried to reason with her and tell her that he wasn't okay with being friends withsomeone her age. When I went to ask her if she was okay I had noticed I was blocked. I didn't think much about it and went back to talking with my friends. Then I saw their was 3 notifications for people joining the group chat. I had met some of them all of them being long time friends of Kelly. I had realized that she had all dmed them because all 3 and the ones already in the gc started to attack me. I again tried to reasonbut I was at this point mad and was coming out as rude. My friend that ill call Elliot started to fight back as I blocked all of them. My account got locked because it was suspicious to block 5 people.I had toinsert my phone#. When I came back they had said transphobic things about me and treated my Friend Elliot like they were a group kids making fun of a five year old standing up for himself when Elliot was much older than them all.We both left the gc andI had unfriended Adrian due to my overthinking and worried he would be mad. Few days later Adrian Dmed me asking how I was. I asked him why he wasntmad at me and he was confused. Turnsout he had been off for a few days and didn't know what happened. I told them about the situation and they weren't to happy. They talked to Kelly about it and they ended up not being friends anymore. Few days later Adrian rekindled with Kelly she wanted us both to apologize to eachother. I felt Ihadn't done anything wrong butI agreed. A while later I was added to a group chat with a message already sent of Kelly apologizing. Im gonna sum up what she said but it went something like this. "Hi, listen im sorry I really like your nameIm serious :D, anyways I didn't mean it and i wanna write more but I gotta eat bye" I sent it to Elliot and weboth agreed it wasn't a valid sorry, so I responded with "I don't think you mean that. "I added Elliot and my other friend we will call Sid to the gc and sid had started talking with Kelly how it wasnt okay what she did. Kelly started trailing off talking about crushes and stopped listening.Kelly left the gc some hourslater. We haven't talked to her for a while. I still question myself.

iy32h3oh	I (16F) am a huge Potterhead. When I found out that JK Rowling said all those nasty things about trans women, I was devastated. My cousin (19F) is trans and came out five years ago. We aren't particularly close, because we live in different states, but my whole family supports her and her journey.  Well, over winter break my friends and I got together to throw a HP themed Christmas party. It was a lot of fun. We all wore robes and had fake wands. We drank butterbeer and enacted scenes from the books. It was so cool. A couple of weeks ago one of my friends posted the pictures on social media, tagging all of us. My aunt saw them and was livid. She called my mother and asked her if she knew what I had done.  My mom was confused, to say the least. The three of us ended up getting into a sort of argument. My aunt said that if my cousin saw those pictures, she would be devastated. She called me selfish and cruel. My mom thought that was too much and told my aunt to apologize. When my aunt refused, my mom hung up on her.  I talked to my mom, and she doesn't think I have anything to apologize for. She knows I'm not transphobic. However, my aunt was really, really mad, so I'm not sure. I love Harry Potter and don't want to give that up.

it0lnbey	My fiancé’s family lives in another state than us and his cousins offered to throw us a wedding shower there, his father offered to pay for it and told the main cousin they would work it out. I said to let us know when to buy tickets to fly in and thought that was the end of the matter on our end. I was expecting a small family style dinner at one of the restaurants his family normally hosts their events at. The cousins expressed they would take care of everything because they know we are busy with wedding planning and my own family health issues.   I’m completely overwhelmed and sick of them constantly contacting me for ridiculous minutiae. Bickering about the theme. Sending me competing caterers and venues and trying to get me to pick a side. Texting me to call my future father in law to ask this or that, etc. when they could just ask him at Sunday dinner or call themself. They were constantly bickering about choosing the date or a given venue’s parking in my e-mail. I kept saying my fiancé and I would be grateful for anything they decide to do and we do not want this to be a high-pressure event or for my FIL to be paying for an unnecessarily extravagant event.  They’re still literally expecting me to do everything for an over the top shower from out of state down to asking me to ask his mom to find and scan baby pictures. I sent the pictures and the cousin responded with a link and description of the decorations and quantities she wanted me to order, saying I could ask an aunt I don’t have contact info for to pay, and another aunt I don’t have contact info for to arrange pickup.   I was sitting in the ER with my brother when I got that email and I literally just lost it. When I called my fiancé he basically said he didn’t care about the shower and didn’t want to get dragged into it. So I hung up and responded to the email chain to say thank you but we do not need a wedding shower and just look forward to having dinner with them the next time we visit and removed the wedding shower event from our wedding website.   Well, now my fiancé is fielding calls from assorted relatives and we are at odds. I said the only thing I will do is purchase a plane ticket for a given date if they choose to host a wedding shower and I don’t want to hear another goddamn word about it. He’s not great at confrontation or disappointing people so he’s struggling with being left alone to respond to everyone as they don’t seem to accept the subject is dropped. I’m feeling guilty and sad but also angry and resentful they’re acting like stressing me out is some great favor I’m being a brat about.	1642965466.0	sb1dqn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1dqn/aita_for_cancelling_our_wedding_shower/	AITA for cancelling our wedding shower
u7wyyq5	I’m a 26 year old disabled person who lives with my sister in a house we split the rent on. My sister has a very close friend and the two of them are practically inseparable.   The other day, her friend, let’s call her M, said she wants to come over for some drinks. My sister agreed and the three of us hung out in the living room for the night, and it was super fun.  That is, until M brought up the troubles she’s having with her son’s cat...   M and the father of her children are split up. Her 15 year old son, K, goes back and forth between his father’s house and her apartment. K’s cat lives at M’s apartment.  K’s dad has a few large dogs who aren’t great with small animals so keeping the cat at his dad’s place apparently isn’t an option.  Apparently, every time K goes back to his dads place, the cat gets upset and starts peeing on everything. My sister and I have three cats of our own, so we know how bad cat urine can smell.  That however, is where my sympathy ends. While I do understand that constantly having to clean up cat pee really sucks, what she said after really upset me.   M said that if K doesn’t do something about his cat’s behaviour, she’s going to shove the cat in a bag and toss it over the side of the bridge out of town and into the river to drown. I’m not even exaggerating, that’s almost word for word.   When she said that, I immediately told her that’s really messed up. She told me she was joking and my response was that killing a pet isn’t something you should ever joke about.   She laughed and told me to calm down before changing the subject. I shut up after that but wound up just ignoring everyone and browsing my phone the rest of the night until I left for bed.   I have BPD and am severely bipolar so arguing isn’t something I can really do without getting super emotional so most of the time I’ll drop things and get awkwardly silent. I apologize if that sounds like I’m making an excuse, but I digress.   After M went home, I approached my sister and explained that what she said was really messed up, and that I wasn’t comfortable having her around the house anymore if she’s going to joke about killing pets, especially considering how much we love our own.  Later on I found out that this same person has posted a video of them on social media shooting a BB Gun at a squirrel for fun, so I do not trust her. I realize that probably wasn’t okay for me to go looking for but I wanted to prove a point.   My sister agreed it wasn’t okay to joke about but then said I’m over reacting because it was clearly a joke, and that M is going to come over whether I like it or not. I texted my dad about it and he agreed with my sister and said I was being unreasonable about it and that I need to drop it.   It’s been bugging me a lot because I feel like I’m just causing unnecessary drama.

Back in 2012, my oldest 2 would come to see me everywhere week and my youngest lived with me because I was still with their mother. I was a very bad father bad then and I would normally play harsh games when their mother wasn't home like hiding and seek and if I found you I could spank you or if you weren't asleep I could spank you which their mother watches. I would normally put my hands on my wife and my son but we divorced back in 2013. My ex-wife took my youngest kids to live with her and her mother and my oldest stayed with their mother. There were times I would try and see my youngest kids but their mom would call the police on me and I only saw them once while they were still under the age of 10. Fast-forward to these past few years they only contact me for money and won't even meet my new girlfriend. I told my youngest daughter I would send her money for Christmas and about a week later she reminded me about it without even asking how im doing so I simply told her she will get it when she does but she just sent a rude text and it seems like her sisters are also ignoring me. She also bought up the fact I promised to see them in 2021 but me and my girlfriend were busy trying to find an apartment.

I (18f) and my bf (18m) have been dating for almost 2 years and we’ve had a lot of problems during that time, mainly his preference to be on the game rather than talking to me. I don’t mean that I want his attention 24/7, it just bothers me that most of the time he’s the one that starts conversations, says that he’s “not busy,” and texts back inconsistently because of the game. He would text me back every 20 minutes in between rounds (and I would text him back immediately like a fool) and this went on for months until I had enough and I told him how I felt and he even deleted a bunch of his games without me asking. This was great for a while but recently he’s been doing it again and claiming that he hasn’t. His main argument is that if we were on facetime he wouldn’t have to worry about texting back but there are two problems with that: 1) I don’t have the time for ft, it requires more attention than texting and i’m always doing something, 2) we used to ft a lot until he would be on the game and would literally shush me or just hold a finger up to make me stop talking if anyone in his party was talking, even if they were just in the lobby. I got tired of being ignored even on facetime so I stopped doing that. Today he woke up and almost immediately went on the game, which I understand because he’s allowed to have fun but then he asked me to play imessage games because “it’s plat and the character im playin we sit in buildings man. i be scroll through tik toks durin that so.” I figured since he had down time I would say yes but I let him know that if he started texting back every 20 minutes we would immediately stop playing. I sent him the game and waited for him to play, not even to play back but just to start, and 20 minutes later I get a text back. I was upset and I told him that he was the one that wanted to play and it’s unfair to do that to me. He said that he was getting off the game but I told him i was busy (which isn’t a lie) and he didn’t even apologize. He’s texted me and sent me tiktoks like normal and I’ve been opening them and not answering because I’m upset and he still hasn’t apologized.

iy4t8ghi	So my laptop stopped working and took it the a store where they said it’s about a 1000 dollars to repair it( MacBook).  Waited for a week or two to see if it would work. And it didn’t. Bought a new one.  My friend wanted to buy it from me because he thought it’s worth fixing.  I double checked the laptop the night before and miraculously it started working. This is two months after it stopped.   He had already sold his laptop. But I didn’t sell to him because I wanted to give it to a family member if it was in a working condition.   He had to buy a new laptop. He can afford it( not the issue)  AITA?	1642966439.0	sb1ri1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1ri1/aita_for_not_selling_my_laptop_even_though_i_told/	AITA for not selling my laptop even though I told someone I would
grvzoq8c	Hi, I'm 39F and my husband is 35M. My son is 17M. My husband is my son's stepfather, and he's been living with us for about 4 months  Our daily routine is my son and my husband both taking showers in the morning and then my husband drops him off at school on the way to work. We only have one shower in the apartment. The problem is that my son takes way too long in the showers, like 30-40 minutes. It's made them late several times, and I've confronted him about it, but he just shrugs it off. It's also taken a toll on the water bill.  This morning, my son woke up a bit early and showered first, and stayed there for about 1 hour, which is just ridiculous. My husband needed to shower too, and had just come home from running so he did desperately. Even though I kept knocking on the door, my son would not get out so I just told my husband to jump in and start washing himself anyway to not waste any time. So he did so, and my son was very embarrassed. He was apparently masturbating, and was also shocked at seeing his stepdad taking his clothes off. They got in a big fight and were both late. They haven't been talking to each other since  So, AITA? I understand that my son feels violated and I have no problem with him masturbating, but he can do it after school if he really needs to. He needs to understand that it is my husband and I's place, and we need to use the resources too.	1642966557.0	sb1szg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1szg/aita_for_having_my_husband_jump_in_the_shower/	AITA for having my husband jump in the shower with my son?
i6pwa8b8	 I(15) am a third party and not directly involved, but I though I’d put it on here with as much info as I have to see what you guys think anyway.  So a little context, My dad was adopted when he was 18 days old by my Nana and her husband ,who wanted children, but couldn’t have any. They had gone to the adoption agency to talk about adopting and took my dad home the very same day. Growing up, My dad always knew he was adopted, but never really cared about finding his birth parents because, in his words, he was happy with the deal God gave him.  My nana’s husband died when my dad was 13 and my nana became a nurse so she could support them. All in all, my dad never had hard feelings toward his biological parents, and never searched for them because it wouldn’t have been better than the family he had been given.   Fast forward to a couple of years ago, about a year before my dads 50th birthday, he got an ancestry dna test as a Christmas gift from my mom, so that he could find out the percentages of different nationalities he was (my dad thought it was cool). What she didn’t know was that after you send in your dna to be tested, they also match your dna to relatives who took the test. Well, when my dad got his results,it came up ‘CG is your father’.   My dad got in contact with him, and he told him that the only girl he was dating at the time was J, who to my dad’s surprise, was someone he knew, and grew up down the street from. Her number was in his contact list. Neither of them knew. My connected with his birth father and half brother on his dads side (I now have a new Uncle and grandpa, and they’re great) and had the conversation with his bio mother, who had gotten married and had a bundle of kids with her husband (one of whom lives right behind my nana, another one my dad had worked with for years and had always been teased about how similar they were and how they must’ve been brothers. I guess his coworkers were onto something). The problem was that my dads bio mom’s husband didn’t want his children to know that their mother had another child before their marriage, and my dad’s bio mom won’t argue with him on it, and doesn’t plan on ever telling them. Their children are all in their thirties and forties and have their own lives and children, I have cousins who don’t know they’re my cousins. My family and I think that they’re adults who have a right to know, but my dad is slightly hesitant to tell them because he doesn’t want to throw a wrench in their marriage for something that will come out eventually, I also think deep down he is hoping she will stand up to her husband tell them herself, but I’m not sure that will ever happen.  TLDR; my dad’s bio mom’s husband doesn’t want their adult children to know they have an older half sibling ie. my dad  So, Would my dad be the asshole for telling his half siblings they’re related?	1642966565.0	sb1t39	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1t39/wibta_would_my_dad_be_the_a_hole_for_telling_his/	WIBTA Would my dad be the A hole for telling his half siblings they’re related?
desb1b3s	One day last month when I (18M) was about to go somewhere to get something to eat when my mom was like "buy me something too". I then mentioned to her that I needed money too because I was promised to get paid back a long time ago for something that my parents wanted me to pay for one of my sisters to have. Although I didnt mean to say it in a pretty "douchey" way, I admit in my opinion, I was kinda the asshole for that because of the way I said it, and that pissed of my mom mildly and I did try to apologize for that. A while later, I overheard my mom telling my dad about what I said and he was like, "well he just doesn't know how to talk to people".  Even though he was right about that, this really saddened me because for a huge majority of my life, I always had a problem with making friends and being social in general. I would either push people away or I was just too scared to be social because of fear of pushing people away. When I got home from getting something to eat, I overhear my mom talking about me, saying to my dad in a angry manner "I hope he never talks to me again for the rest of the day" or something like that. This made me mad because i felt like what I said was a simple mistake and I was sorry about that.   Later that day, I was searching up therapists because I wanted to fix my social skills and better myself as inspired of what just happened. I asked my dad what insurance do we have and he is all confused on why I'm searching up therapists. He then comes back downstairs getting upset at only me and instead of trying to get me help, he gives me a long talk and says to me "you need to stop being so soft about everything". He then mentions about how he thinks I'm ridiculous for refusing to buy my mom something (even though I NEVER FUCKING SAID I WOULDN'T BUY HER ANYTHING), how he and my mom spend over thousands of dollars worth of items for me, proceeds to call me stingy and says I will be stingy to my "future wife and kids", says "are you gonna kill yourself if you go out there and someone calls you a racial slur???", and then talks about the bible.   During all that, I tried to tell him that what he was saying had nothing to do with anything and I do provide for the family, but he just shuts me up. Needless to say, he thought that this whole speech he made would help me while in reality it only made me feel even worse about myself and it only made me even more afraid talk to people.  P.S: Now even though I'm posting this on this subreddit, i dont think my parents are abusive or anything like that and they do most definitely love me. But I just believe that I am being very misunderstood and feel like I can't talk to them about anything.	1642966957.0	sb1yia	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1yia/aita_for_being_soft/	AITA for being "soft"
9dfbawt5	For starters this takes place about 10 years ago when I was in college so nothing can be changed now.   So if you meant in the college I started dating this guy who was blind. After my first kiss I was so excited to go to my ASL interpreting class to tell my friend/ASL signing partner, let’s call her Aurora that I had my first kiss and when I went to describe him to her I said his name was that he was blind and let’s be honest there was only three blind people at the college so she knew exactly who he was and it turned out that the DND group I knew he was in was the same DND group that she played in, which I didn’t know she played DND till that moment. So shortly then after I ended up joining their DND group. Since I was new to DND, When I had questions I would sign my question to my friend Aurora and she would sign the answer back that way I would not interrupt game. Which let’s be honest eventually turned into us having side conversations in ASL while waiting for our turns.   Since the three of us were all friends sometimes my boyfriend and Aurora would hang out. And since we could we would have side conversations in ASL right front of him. We weren’t ignoring him. We would be watching a movie or something. He quickly caught on something was happening because we would giggle and we told him we were talking in asl and he never had a problem.   So was I the Asshole for having ASL side conversation in front of my blind boyfriend/ Fiancé with our mutual friend.  Side note 1: Aurora and I were signing partners for ASL so we had to have ASL practice conversation that we documented as part of homework for our ASL interpreting classes. So the conversations teaching me how to play DND and the ones we had just for fun while  the 3 or more of us hung out we documented/ recorded as part of our ASL home work.   Side note 2: Me and my now ex were together just a month short of 8 years engaged 7 of those 8years (you can see his public proposal at Sakura con on YouTube). We only split up because my health got worse as we knew it would (just 15-20 years earlier than expected) and he couldn’t handle that I wasn’t always there to be able to help him and I needed help and he couldn’t (well he wouldn’t help me) so I had to move back home for my health. We stayed best friends after till he started dating this new girl recently and she wouldn’t let us be friends anymore.	1642967048.0	sb1zpk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1zpk/aita_deaf_boyfriend_vs_asl/	AITA deaf boyfriend vs ASL
68nigc90	Okay this is going to sound really weird and superficial, but here goes:  I (20f) recently attended the wedding of my cousin (28m) and his wife (28f). They live in a really warm area of the country, so the wedding was outdoors so that it could be covid-safe.  The invitations didn't really specify a dress code; like they didn't say "casual" or "formal" or anything like that. The dress I wore was this dark blue peasant-y summer dress that I bought from Target a few years ago. It has white flowers and buttons down that front with short sleeves and kind of a stretchy bodice, and it comes down to just above my knees/below mid-thigh. I wore it with a pair of black heels and did my hair and makeup and wore a straw sunhat. Before we left to go to the wedding, I asked my mom if she thought it was appropriate for an outdoor wedding and she said yes. She knows a lot about manners (she taught me how to set a table, to always write thank-you cards, etc.), so I trusted her.    It was a beautiful wedding, and I definitely didn't feel out of place. Everyone was wearing dresses of similar styles and lengths, and some people were even wearing fancy sundresses. However, most of the dresses people were wearing looked a little less childish, more sophisticated and more expensive than mine. No one had anything negative to say about my outfit (to my face, anyway). But apparently, my aunt took another one of my aunts aside during the reception and told her that my dress looked a little too "trashy" for a wedding and said it looked like it came off the Forever 21 clearance rack. My other aunt relayed this to me and my mom, and we told her that it came from target. My aunt (the one who complained) said that it was "too low cut" (it's a square neckline that comes maybe 2-3 inches below my collarbone) and made of "cheap material" (it's made of kind of a stretchy jersey). For the record, the bride, my second aunt and my mom are all on my side, and most of my other family members don't know, but I'm a little worried that it's just because they don't want me to feel bad and it might have actually been inappropriate to wear such an inexpensive and causal dress to a wedding. So what do you guys think? AITA?	1642967090.0	sb20b7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb20b7/aita_for_wearing_a_target_dress_to_my_cousins/	AITA for wearing a Target dress to my cousin's wedding?
iy2r1u50	I was with my husband's family the other day and they were discussing dating people of certain jobs and if some jobs are a turn off. I think it's pretty normal for everyone to have one or two, like I would never date a doctor.  MIL's boyfriend "Todd" said that he would never date a woman who 1) didn't work 2) worked in STEM or finance 3) anything minimum wage 4) had less than 4 weeks of vacation time a year 5) had to wear a uniform.  Now to be honest I think Todd is a huge huge asshole for various reasons. I pointed out that was literally most jobs. Todd said that's ok he doesn't settle. He then said women who work those jobs are boring and he hates boring women.  I pointed out that he is a privledged asshole who wouldn't survive outside of his little bubble, probably sexist, and I can't believe he even has a girlfriend. MIL says I'm a dick because those are just his preference, but I found the whole conversation very offensive.	1642967128.0	sb20th	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb20th/aita_for_calling_someone_a_privledged_asshole_and/	AITA for calling someone a privledged asshole and saying they wouldn't survive in the real world because of dating preferences?
59kmdrdm	To keep this short (I'll add context if anyone needs it) but basically I ("c" 19 studying design so I have Ps knowledge) have 2 sisters and recently had a big argument with my sister "A" (early 20's). The argument was with my sister "A" and so I thought it was cool with sis "B" (late 20's) cause she never said anything to me.  Anyways day after another of me not talking to sister "A" (I sleep separately cause I need space to work in), sister "B" was ignoring me (which is usual of her she usually doesn't talk to me a-lot cause we don't see each-other and other reasons related to her (she usually is either in work or in her room), anyhow she kept ignoring me so I didn't notice anything until she sent me a message asking sth from me with in a rude way so I just didn't respond and did it anyways I let it go but I figured sis "A" prolly told a twisted version of what happened to sis "B" and sis "B" is hating me for it or sth without asking me about my version of the story.  I'm already in my finals and stressed enough to a point of me returning to doing things to myself and stuff of that kind. Anyhow I needed someone to help me with sth for a final project which basically woulda taken 4 mins max of that person sitting and holding sth so I can take a video of it without even showing their face. so since me and sis "A" are not talking (per her request), I sent sis "B" a message and asked her to help me, she obv saw it cause I heard her and sis A laughing and stuff and she is usually on her phone, she didn't respond tho so a few hours go by and me telling myself she will see it or sth, I go to her and ask if she can help me, she doesn't look at me and tells me "when I have time C" so I just take it as is and do it myself which took me hours and a lot of fails to get it somewhat right alone.  I just decide to ignore both of them because I am already in a bad place mentally and stressed and I don't need this. about a week goes by and a few minutes ago sister "B" sent me " C hru, can you help me with sth in photoshop that has to do with my PHD" I don't respond then immediately like a min later she sends \*sends me pics and description of what she wants\* "Tell me if you can help me please!" and I don't respond.  given that I have a final exam tomorrow and am currently cramming for it and honestly I wanna ignore her like she did to me cause all my life people have only come to me when they needed sth and now my family is doing the same and I honestly am done.  and yes I'm 19 and we all live together cause culture. also sorry if I said sth wrong English isn't my first language.  WIBTA if I ignored her and kept studying it's already stressing me out I Can't focus.  tldr; my sister who ignore me for no reason didn't wanna help me with my final project in uni then comes asking me to help her with her PHD.	1642967148.0	sb212j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb212j/wibta_if_i_didnt_help_my_sister_with_her_phd_to/	WIBTA if I didn't help my sister with her PHD to be petty?
ipz0wtfh	My boyfriend and I moved in together not too long ago and I got a job at a plant.  I work 40 hours a week and it’s a very physical job which I’m not used to so it can be really hard on me.  I lift 20-40 pounds constantly and i occasionally push 500 pounds in a buggy so it’s a lot of work and I’m absolutely exhausted by the time my shift ends.  When I come home, I stay up for about an hour to spend time with my boyfriend and then I pass out.  On the weekends I do my own dishes but I don’t do much else because I’m exhausted and I use that time to recoup and prepare for the week.    My boyfriend said that he thinks I should do more (cook more, sweep or do laundry more). Which I would do but the way he said it almost felt like he was unappreciative of what I do.  (Honestly I think you need to contribute more around here. It feels like I’m doing all the work here for little to nothing in return).  Even though I’ve paid for rent, groceries, our phone plans, his weed, helped pay his brother back for spotting him and I’ve been working hard to get us in a better situation.  He’s been great helping me out and making things easier on me otherwise but I was offended by the way he worded what he said.  I replied “Nothing in return huh? So why don’t you cancel your phone plan, let me smoke all your weed and let me eat all the food I bought for you since you get nothing in return for your hard work?” He told me that’s not fair of me to say, so I told him that it wasn’t fair for him to say he felt like he got “nothing in return” for doing household chores.  He said “Oh my bad , guess I didn’t realize material things were the be all end all.”  I said he was purposely missing the point and that again if he was so sure he didn’t need all the extra stuff I paid for he can give it all back to me.  He told me I sounded like a manipulative parent, so I snapped back and said “Well maybe you wouldn’t feel that way if you treated me more like a partner and less like your mother.  I’d be happy to contribute more to household chores but you don’t get to pretend that I’m not the reason we have a house to clean in the first place.”  He stopped talking and won’t talk to me since that argument.  I’m scared that I hurt him and I really didn’t intend to.

iy2j0xoc	-Had to change some words because it was worded poorly-  Throwaway because this conflict has been tearing my relationship apart and I don't want to make it worse. My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. He got some new friends at the start of the school year and I was totally okay with it. I quite honestly encouraged it. I now really regret it. Like deep to my stomach regret it.   It started when I got invited to a discord server which his new friends are in, because I wanted to know his friends, and I've ended up quite fond of 3 people. Two people who I though hate to my guts are called 'sarah' and 'carolina'.  Around 3 months into me being on the server my boyfriend calls me and tells me they want to throw me out of the server. I got upset and asked why and he tells me Sarah and Carolina thinks I'm traumadumping for saying my everyday issues. Those consists of: "ugh school" "omg stupid ----" "I'm so dumb". I got upset, couldn't understand this and it got heated and I ended up just leaving.   2 months later gets an invite back. Gets thrown out 2 months later for being a drama queen because I told them not to talk shit about me.  I got invited back. And here's where it goes wrong. I befriend Sarah, because i realize Sarah might have some personal issues and I try to help her. Everything's going great. Carolina hasn't been online for 3 months which doesn't bother anyone. Suddenly Carolina comes online.  Me: Think about not living 3 hours from your boyfriend Carolina: I, cringe. Me: I miss boyfriend Carolina: I miss boyfriend :cringe_emoji:  This resulted in me ignoring her until her boyfriend made an insensitive joke about my boyfriend. I at this point had enough. I tell her to shut up and just be quiet, and then she plays victim. After she said my boyfriend likes kids. Because we have one year of age difference. After she made a joke about my boyfriend's looks. Etc. Sarah and I was okay. She somewhat understood. I now realize that was naive of me to think.  Some weeks later I thought it was back to normal again. Carolina and Sarah flirts in the discord. Telling how they'd fuck each other and send polaroid nudes to each other. I had sensed we all had fun so I randomly sent: "Cringe :puppy_mad: " and it all exploded. I was completely speechless. My boyfriend and three of the friends from the discord server all seemed totally confused too. Sarah left a whole message about how I'm a whore who tried to fuck her boyfriend etc. Etc. Etc. (I did not, i don't find her boyfriend hot and wouldn't ever think of cheating on my boyfriend?)  I am acting as if nothing happened. I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to start more drama. I am aware I should have shut up, but I honestly also had enough.  So... Am I the asshole?	1642967173.0	sb21ev	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb21ev/aita_for_calling_someone_cringe/	AITA for calling someone cringe?
fvuynpoj	Ok for context I (24f) live alone and recently contracted covid. I work as a hospices nurse so I was told to take 2 weeks off. Wasn't too sick just very congested and tired so I didn't really leave the house instead relying on Walmart to drop off food and Door dash.   Now this door dash person I've had trouble with before they have a very unique name so I'll just call them M. M many times has gone and not listen to my request to have the food left on the doorstep and ring the bell. Insisting on handing it to me and ringing the bell constantly until I open the door. If I order a drink I never get it because it "spilled" or the restaurant didn't give him one.   The other night I was trying to start cleaning up and noticed I was out of dish washer pods so I ordered some along with a few other things to be delivered. After a few minutes I looked at my phone and saw that none other then M was my dasher. I sigh that means I'm gonna have to deal with something and go back to folding laundry. After about 45 minutes I get a ding saying my order was dropped off. Go to the door to get the stuff and there's nothing there. Look around the porch and I can't find it. I try and contact the driver but nothing. So I report it as not dropped off and get a credit and order the same stuff again. 45 minutes later a different dasher drops off my order (doing what I ask and leave it on the door step and ring the bell)   Almost 2 hours later at almost 10 pm someone starts banging on my door and screaming. I go and open I and see none other then M with my stuff. He starts yelling at me that he's dropping it off right now and I should learn to have patience I open the door grab the shit and tell him then he should learn to do his job. He calls me a bitch and tells me to change the report. I call door dash the next day and tell them what happened and they said they would handle it.   The dasher has shown up at my house twice now yelling at me cause of what happened. He said because of this they fired him and he can't take care of his family. I think I did nothing wrong but some of my coworkers think I shouldn't have called door dash so I'm just wondering am I the asshole?	1642967234.0	sb2277	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2277/aita_for_reporting_my_dasher/	AITA for reporting my dasher

3rcd42mb	I am a bi F (49) who was discussing my son (10) with my sister (44), who is a lesbian. We were talking about how we would feel and what we would say to him if he turned out to be gay. I said that I would tell him he would have my unconditional love/acceptance/support, but I would warn him that it is not always the easiest lifestyle.   What I meant by this is that some people are not as accepting of out gays and their life choices, and I explained to her that I just thought he should be aware of this. My sister herself has been through some tough times since coming out, not only within our largely conservative Christian family but in greater society as well.   I said I wasn’t trying to imply that someone could choose not to be gay. But coming out and making lifestyle choices accordingly can be difficult, as she knows all too well.

byviuy4x	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I’m not interested in entering into discussions around ‘how bad the vaccine is’ so don’t bother.  To the crux of the matter, we are having our housewarming soon after buying our house.   My partners best friend has completely lost the plot around the vaccine, like is convinced it’s going to kill everyone and has gone very very deep down the rabbit hole to the point where he and his wife have lost their jobs and are having to sell their house as they have no income. He thinks he is ‘saving’ people by telling them not to get vaccinated.   Before he went like this, we had invited them to our housewarming along with a number of other friends and family, including my mum who has COPD (double vaxxed and boosted) and friends who have small children and babies. I also have lung issues which aren’t as serious.   I want to uninvite my partners friend as: a. I don’t want him ruining the evening talking about how evil the vaccine is and trying to ‘save’ people- it’s literally all he talks about.  b. I don’t want to expose vulnerable people that I love and care about to unvaccinated people who don’t believe in Covid.   My partner says we can’t uninvite them as they would be offended and it’s not fair to invite everyone else except them.  So, WIBTA for uninviting them?   N.B.

94s3zmos	So this particular story is one that I need help deciding if I am the ah or not. I ended up get sick the end of December beginning of January. Everybody around me thought is was because of everyone else getting sick from holiday gatherings. A close relative had tested positive so I had to get tested and it came back negative. I was experiencing nausea and vomiting but it was chucked up to be acid reflux. I got tired of feeling sick so I set up an appointment with my doctor to see what was wrong. After I checked in for my appointment, I had to give a urine sample. Mind you my cycle is irregular and I hadn't had one since September but the test in October was negative and I wasn't feeling sick or anything like that. Soon as the doctor came in he asked if I gave my sample and I said not yet. He told the nurse to get the cup so I can take it. Soon as I put it in the lab door and walked back to talk to the doctor, the nurse came and said it was positive. I started crying because right now is not the best time to have another baby but I was taught if you lay down then you gotta handle the consequences. I don't believe in abortions and it's out of the question. I told my child's father and he got mad and said that I set everything up and it's my fault we ended up with a baby. The thing is I don't know how far along I am or when I conceived since my cycles are irregular and I didn't get sick until after the holidays. Where I might be the ah is I told him that a few years ago when I was pregnant with my 2 year old he was saying he should have been his. But now that I'm pregnant with his baby his attitude changed entirely. So I've decided to keep my baby even though he wants no part of the pregnancy and is conflicted and keeps saying he doesn't want a baby. He even asked why would I add more stress and I'm already stressed out. I told him since I've been in therapy I now have the tools needed to handle it but he is still trying to convince me to have an abortion. So am I the ah for deciding to keep my baby even though it will be stressful and I will be a single parent?? He has another child that he takes care of and was there the whole pregnancy, birth, and all the firsts. I'm just so emotional and confused. Please help.	1642968340.0	sb2hp6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2hp6/aita_for_keeping_my_baby/	AITA For keeping my baby

bjvnn1pi	My daughter was born 6 weeks to early, so she had to stay in the hospital for a bit.  When she was three days old I was discharged from hospital.  I was obviously very upset to be leaving the hospital without my baby.  My doctor talked to my husband like I wasn't standing there.  He said she has PPD, and needs meds. He then handed him a prescription for anti depressants and told him that he needed to force me to take them.  My husband and I reported his unprofessional behavior. It turns  out  that  a dozen so other women  had  a similiar complaint, all  nicu  mommies. Several of them are now suing him for his med pushing and gaslighting.  I have recently been asked to testify against  him. My friend says I am ruining his life over nothing  so AITa?

1th8xy7d	Tl;dl bf feels he doesn’t have to do shit around the house cuz he pays 60% of the time.    Been dating for nearly a year. I drove from fl to Washington to be with him after only a month of talking. A month later he got hit by car and I chose to stay and take care of him while he recovered. There were a lot of low points and challenges along the way but I did my best not to crumple despite the physical/mental strain.  I don’t regret doing any of that. I know deep down he probably wouldn’t have done it for me if the roles were reversed. I didn’t have to/ need to stay/ wait for him to be released home. He had family and friends and coworkers. I had no one. My support group were 3113mikes away. His family didn’t know me and made no effort to keep me updated on his condition. And during covid, when he could only have one visitor per day. I’m getting off topic.   Anyway,  fast forward 7 months and he’s made a full recovery. AITA for asking this guy, if maybe he could empty the dishwasher for me or do the laundry every now and then?  I’ve done so much and I feel like I’m still doing so much that maybe I’d like to be taken care of too.   His response? “Who pays for everything? I pay for everything so why should I have to do anything else?” He then tells me I’m ungrateful and he goes into fit saying how nothing he does is good enough for me.  Yeah, I know he pays a majority of most things but I pay when I can if I can and if I can’t I usually go without because I don’t want to feel like I expect it of him. I even got a job so he doesn’t have to feel the need to always pay. Now I work a job m-f 8-4 then come home to household chores that could be done since he’s home all day.   I thought I was in a relationship.   Anyway, there’s so much more to the story but this is  one of many of AITA he tells me I am.	1642969097.0	sb2rvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2rvy/aita_for_wanting_my_partner_to_think_of_my_needs/	AITA for wanting my partner to think of my needs too?
iy5ldyzd	"Chris" is my husband's mom's BF. He has had a lot of issues with my husband and I. He is someone who really likes to provoke people for fun and he likes playing knight in shining armor. MIL had some issues with her son and I before she met Chris and he decided he was going to treat us like utter shit to win points with her. I'd say it worked though, MIL eats it up.  Recently Chris took a picture of me without my consent. It is me wearing my husband's sweats and tee shirt and eating a burrito. He put it on Instagram with a caption about how men in my generation have it tough if that is what is out there. I asked him to take it down and he refused. I asked MIL and she said no.  I decided I was going to do the one thing that pissed Chris off until he took it down and be near him. I followed them around for two days, crashed date night, pissed him off in the bathtub, was all up in his face when he wanted to cuddle on the couch. MIL was miserable and told him to take it down, but instead he posted another picture in which my husband and I were clearly fighting and encouraged people to guess what we were fighting about.  I continued to be in his space all the time and follow him and ended up finding out that he was buying an engagement ring. I told him that he could take it down or I could let MIL know (via Instagram) about the ring. He said I'm an asshole because her marriage ended so badly and it traumatized her, so she deserves a beautiful proposal and I'm evil for ruining that over a joke. I said he is the one ruining it, just take it down, when he knows my self esteem is absolute crap and he really hurt me.  My husband is on my side and wants to tell her about the ring anyway, which I told him not to. Chris is still sulking and telling me I'm an asshole because she is somehow more deserving of a proposal than anyone else. i was told I'm an asshole because he's just trying to make MIL feel better because of our previously strained relationship.	1642969365.0	sb2vr7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2vr7/aita_for_forcing_a_man_to_take_down_an/	AITA for forcing a man to take down an embarrassing picture of me by threatening to expose his proposal?
iy65j4un	Last weekend for my youngest daughter's birthday party (she's 5), I rented an old-fashioned but well-kept playground park for three hours (10:00 to 1:00). Yes, rental playgrounds are still a thing, or at least around here! To my shock though, when I arrived with my youngest daughter and her siblings at 9:00 to get set up, there was a group of about 10 random strangers there (3 adults and several kids). I left my kids in the car so that I could talk to these people. They said that park management allowed anyone to use the playground area until 15 minutes before rental hours, and when I told them that I needed more time than that to set up, they were indignant and said they just got there and wouldn't leave until precisely 9:45. I went back to the car and let these strangers stay on the playground for like 15 minutes, but I had absolutely had it when I saw a young girl spill applesauce all over the ground without an adult cleaning up after her. I got out of the car again and asked one of the adults (her father) if he would clean up at all, and he said "15 minutes is plenty of time for *you* to get ready. It's just applesauce." I stormed back to the car and had two of my teenage children help me remove those random kids from the swings and monkey bars and whatever else and brought them over to their parents, and we demanded that they leave. Finally they obliged, and one of the kids' moms mumbled something that made it sound like I was threatening them and told her kids that there are "bad, bad people in the world." This completely soured my attitude for the rest of the day but I put on a happy face for my daughter's sake. After the party when I got home, I suddenly realized that I might've taken out my anger on those kids rather than only the parents (they were crying when I made them leave). I keep going back-and-forth thinking that I did something terrible but then I remember how snarky their parents were to me.

92ziiouy	second time posting because of me not being able to understand how reddit works. to start off i'm (15f) very confused about my life right now. i've taken time to compile a list of the events that i clearly remember happeneing and am listing them down over here. i feel like i'm the asshole because i might be over reacting 1. a little while before we moved i slipped on the floor which had tile-type flooring. the first thing that hit the ground was my knee and as you can probably tell, it hurt like a bitch. i ignored it then but at random moments my leg would be acting up and i’d have severe moments of pain. i never told anybody because all of my childhood my dad kept telling me i was overreacting about my pain.the more and more this happened i started to disregard and invalidate my own pain. for this reason i waited 3-6 weeks before telling my dad. on the way to school, i was getting out of the car and about to head to the front of the school when there was a sudden burst of pain in my knee. it was so bad that i started crying and i held my kneecap. i don’t remember exactly but i think my knees were buckling.my dad on the other hand yelled at me for the following reasons a) making a scene and holding up other drivers b) for being weak and crying when we went home he didn’t bother taking me to the hospital. instead he had my mom take me. at the hospital it was revealed that my growth plate had a crack in it and they gave me a cast. to this day i’m so hurt as to why my dad didn’t even bother to come out of the car and check on me when i was crying. 2.he’s always said very mean thing to me. so here are some examples of what he’s said to me, my sister, or the both of us. a. “i’m not mad, im just shocked at how dumb you are” b. “some parents want to adopt, i want to do the reverse of that” (he wants to give us up)  c. “i wonder where i went wrong raising you” d. called me a chihuahua repeatedpt even if i’ve expressed my distaste  e. called me pimple face repeatedly f. “you’re so skinny that you’ll fly away if the wind blows”  g. i only get to wear what he deems appropriate the biggest problems i have are 1. when he yells he’ll come back like nothing ever happened 2.he always manipulates me into thinking he’s the victim 3. he denies doing anything to the point where i feel like i’m imaging things. i clearly remembered him saying the adoption thing i mentioned earlier but because of how strongly and confidently he denied it, im starting to think that im crazy. aita?	1642969893.0	sb32y4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb32y4/aita_for_my_resentment/	AITA for my resentment?
bx1xxw8i	I (26F) have just got back from a girls trip that my sister and friends arranged for my birthday. They booked this months ago and paid my share as a surprise and I had an awesome time.  I asked my fiancé (29M) if we could go out for dinner the day before my birthday. I wasn't expecting anything majorly fancy, and did not expect him to pay either. He said yes and we chose a place.  On the actual day of my birthday, I had asked a few friends and their partners to meet at my sisters place (it's bigger than our place) for a games night. Before I invited anyone, I called day fiancé and he said he would like to come. I then invited friends and their partner so we had even numbers for games etc.   Tonight, (after my birthday trip but before the other two plans) my fiancé said he doesn't think he can afford to go out for dinner. I said this was fine.  He also said he couldn't afford to pay for the birthday gift he was going to get me. I offered to cover the cost until he got paid (it's booked with deposit paid which I would lose if we just cancelled).  He then says he doesn't want to come to the games night because it's a 'waste of time' and he doesn't think it's normal to have three events planned for my birthday. Note - this is normal for me, I have a lot of varied groups of friends, a fiancé and family so I usually spread plans across them.   Being at my sister's house wouldn't have cost him anything at all (she is happy to provide food and drink for the 8 of us attending). I told my sister he doesn't want to come and she suggested we just do it as a girls night not couples. This now means I would have to explain to my brother-in-law and partners of my two friends that they're no longer invited because of my fiancé no longer coming.   That doesn't feel great to have to do, but the alternative is that I'm the only person without a partner present making games awkward on my birthday.   So, AITA and how do I solve this?	1642970065.0	sb35ax	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb35ax/aita_for_having_more_than_one_birthday_celebration/	AITA for having more than one birthday celebration?
5u14z1sh	This past October, during an argument I did something I have never did before. I went through his phone. I found a message in his FB messenger from a weird name and commenced to reading the contents. Turns out it was his ex (we’ve been together 5 years, they broke up 7 years ago) the contents of the messages were how they love and miss each other, and planning conversations around mine and her fiancés schedules. I was furious. When I confronted him about it, he blew up. Defended it, and to this day has yet to even allow me to tell him how much I read. Anytime I bring it up he loses his shit. I have confirmed as much as I can that they don’t have communication anymore. (Her fiancé checks too as I did contact him at the time)   But since then, he refuses to talk about it. So I make it a point to go to bed early, fall asleep quickly etc. just to avoid any real physical contact. I have told him why I do this. And it ends in an argument.   Side note: Even his bitch ass mother knew they were talking and said NOTHING.   So I am doing therapy and trying to figure out my next steps, but am I the Asshole for this??	1642970076.0	sb35g9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb35g9/aita_for_withholding_sex_after_he_gets_caught/	AITA for withholding sex after he gets caught texting his ex?
iy4t8ghi	Was hanging out with a group of friends and their new work buddies. We were all drinking and I tend to be more talkative and huggy when I’m drunk.    We’ve all hung out 3-4 times at this point. Met a guy and we just naturally had a lot of common interest. We’re we’re sitting next to the pool and talking about something he was upset over something with his work so I gave him and hug. We sat there for about 20-30 minutes hugging and talking.   I’m regularly a full time nurse and I’m pretty busy most days. But I was free at this time of the year  so we were just texting a lot and sending each other memes. Purely platonic stuff.   Last night at a dinner we were talking and every went to go sleep. But we just sat outside and talked. I had a feeling that he wanted to kiss me but I didn’t initiate anything or steer the conversation in that direction.   Today morning he said he was sorry and wanted to kiss me badly but chickened out.

4k2eoosw	The people: me (22tm), my father (54m), and my sister (19f)  Info: My family is quite conservative and staunch in their views (I am not). Without going into detail, they are there reason my mental health has never been good. I moved out when I was 19 and am still trying to recover from them. Behind closed doors, my sister wasn't bad, but she's always sucked up to our parents and has become much worse after my mother fell down into conspiracy land. Our parents are divorced.   I've been LC with my mother since moving out, but I go to dinner on Tuesday with my father. After a few...hiccups, he's learned to hold his tongue.  Hiccups include calling me a bad person when i could not go see my grandmother who had cancer, bashing trans people, and other things.   Story: Last Tuesday, had a dinner set with my father.  I got a text 5 minutes prior that he'd be bringing my sister. This already had me annoyed, as it's last minute (I always give 24hr notice if my partner comes), and we don't have any relationship. But I try to suck it up. Dinner gets started,  and 5 minutes in she brings up politics. I tell them to not bring up politics,  or I will walk out.    That lasts about 20 minutes before she brings up how great the police are. I mention that no, they're quite corrupt and it needs to be fixed.  So she goes on a tirade claiming that I want to get rid of police all together, and how I want to just control people's thoughts and violate the 1st amendment. I never brought that up.    It devolves quickly from there. She keeps bringing up strawmans and red herrings, which i shoot back at. She keeps calling me a Democrat and literally wouldn't listen when i said there's more than two political ideologies. She claims that "Republicans are the party of small government"and when i bring up how restrictive they're platform is, she trells me I'm wrong, like it's not an easy Google search.   So,  i flagged down the waitress, boxed my food, and left. I texted my father the day after to explain why i was hurt, and he just kept saying that she "needed to get out of the house today", and he couldn't have done it another day.

K has been up my ass about the situation while O is much more laid back. Anyways, I recently got motivated to try and buy NFT’s and told them both (they want to finance the project, both of whcih will be putting an equal amount), while I take control of the pool money, as well as handling crypto conversions and doing the research. They decided to give me 10% of any pool earnings, but I just feel like I should be entitled to at least double of that, since I am doing all the work.   Another example of such would be if we were all to pitch into a raffle of my choosing, with them paying the tickets. And lets say the prize was a pair of shoes. Who gets the shoes? Or who has more control over the shoes? Do they get to have majority votes over me wearing them just because they paid? I was the reason we entered that raffle in the first place.   AITA?

1nhwiooo	My (30f) best friend Alexa (29f) was in a long-term relationship for 5 years and ended that relationship 1 year ago. Since then she has been trying to rediscover herself and that has included re-discovering her sexuality as well. She likes dating apps, hook-up culture, etc. which is fine of course for her to do (just setting some background).  My other best friend Jess (28f) is getting married in February (in which I am the maid of honor) and we are going to have the bachelorette party in Las Vegas (YAY). We are all super excited to spend quality time together with 5 total girls going to this trip and have a packed schedule of fun activities to do.  Well the issue I have come across is Alexa is now setting her dating app locations to Las Vegas and trying to already solidify seeing a guy (or guys) for when we get there. She says she will do all the bachelorette activities we have together but after we are done for the day (1AM-3AM) she is going to leave us for the night to go see someone for a hookup and potentially stay over this random person’s place and meet us in the morning. She is very excited about this prospect and hooking up with someone in another town. My question is, is this appropriate for her to do at Jess’s Bachelorette weekend when we should be putting our focus and attention on making Jess feel special? Not only that but it stresses me out to think of her leaving our group to see a random dude in a city we aren’t familiar with. If this hookup came up organically while we were out partying where she met a man we all saw by chance and wanted to go back to his place, I don’t think there would be an issue because it was something that happened naturally, but specifically planning to hookup with someone while we are supposed to be bonding together and focusing on Jess seems a little selfish to me?  I’d like to add that during these occasions in the past on previous vacations with Alexa, it becomes a whole event of praising that she looks great before she leaves a bunch of times, talking about the hookup afterwards, and trying to share in the post hookup-excitement of it all so it’s not a one and done type situation.  Here is where I may be the asshole, I don’t want her to feel like I am telling her she can't have sex because she’s an adult and that's ultimately her decision but I also don’t want to put a weird energy into this bachelorette weekend and make it about anyone else other than Jess? I am really trying to figure out if I’d be the AH in this situation?	1642971208.0	sb3kxi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3kxi/wibta_if_i_tell_my_friend_she_shouldnt_hook_up/	WIBTA if I tell my friend she shouldn't hook up overnight with guys at my other friend's Bachelorette weekend?

I yelled at her saying I’m not wasting my time doing drugs like certain Cousins eg jack and Jill or dating people and wasting a lot time like friend in question.

4dn1tenz	I'm F40 living in Ireland. Lots of issues with my parents and cut contact 7 years ago. But until recently I saw the following as one of the few nice things they but now I think it might be actually horrible.  When I was about 10 we had a student from Spain stay with our family while she studied English for one month at the local college. She was 16. After she went home my Mom stayed in contact with her's and one year later her family invite me to stay with them in Spain. I'm not sure why my parents said yes since we definitely couldn't afford it and I was a very shy child who was actually autistic although not assessed until I was 30.  I travelled alone although I had an uncle working for the airline so I think the staff kept an eye on me. I stayed with the family in 4 different locations in Spain including their main home, vacation home, grandparents home and another relative. We travelled by car between the locations. I don't remember anything hugely negative but I know I was very homesick, got badly sunburned frequently and got terrified watching Silence Of The Lambs.   I was only able to call home once per week (it was as 1992 so no cell phones etc). I mostly hung out with the then 17 year old girl and her friends/cousins (boys and girls). They all spoke some English. I spoke no Spanish and her parents and sister also only spoke Spanish. I do remember the 17 year olds teaching me dirty words in Spanish and trying to get me to smoke. And being embarrassed when they were making out with their boyfriends/girlfriends.  So as I said I always thought I was really lucky to be given this opportunity but now I'm an adult and a mom I'm thinking it was in fact a terrible decision by my parents.

7vshehuu	Post says it all.  I plan on telling my girlfriend that I will be making the decision to end our relationship if she continues to be friends with her friend x.  I feel like she has crossed my boundaries and I'm going to let her know this next week.  She has been talking to x saying things like, "I love to see that smile", "I can't wait to see you more", and "meeting you was like listening to a song for the first time and realizing it was your favorite".  We've been dating for a year and she just started talking to this guy again 4 months ago, before me they used to fuck around, but she ghosted him a while ago.  In the beginning I didn't think it would be a big deal and I wouldn't tell her who she can and can't be friends with,  but I started to get suspicious and went through her phone and saw those texts a month ago .  For the past month I've been telling her I don't trust this guy, pretty sure I know something is going on between you two, etc.  She denies everything and says she just talks to him like that cause he's a good friend, would never have feelings for him, only wants me.  Loves me, wants to be with me, make the relationship work etc.  I want this to be true but I'm not gonna risk wasting my time when she's got this other guy and, to me, being sketchy.  Thus either me or him, because that's the only way to trust her at this point.  I want this relationship to work that is why I'm even resorting to this.  Am I the asshole or does this seem appropriate?  I just want an idea before I do it, she gets very emotional Everytime I bring up anything with this guy, so I don't really know if I'm taking it too far or not.	1642972709.0	sb467j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb467j/wibta_for_giving_my_girlfriend_an_ultimatum_of_me/	WIBTA for giving my girlfriend an ultimatum of me vs her guy friend
ixmmw7bu	I met this guy at a volunteering organization we're both part of. We've known each other for about 3 years.  At first we just casually talked to each other and I never thought anything of it. However, he started doing random things out of the blue.  Like, once, I was going to walk home in the rain with no umbrella as I didn't bring one and he walked me home in the rain with his umbrella even though I lived 20 minutes away from him (neither of us brought our cars).  Then, there was this other time when I said I was craving freshly baked cookies but didn't have the time to make them because of my job, stress, and hassle, and he asked for my address and delivered some to me.  Then, today, he asked me what my favorite type of movie was, and when I responded with my favorite genre, he asked if I wanted to go over to his house to binge watch some shows together.  I said yes without really thinking about it, and now I'm regretting it.   I'm kind of into him, but I don't know if he feels the same way and it stresses me out.   My job is taxing enough (I am an educator and there's SO MUCH HASSLE THIS YEAR and I constantly fear for my health, plus kids aren't learning) and I don't need additional hassle from him.  WIBTA if I told him I had too much on my plate to date him as of now? I doubt he knows how stressful being a teacher is.	1642972846.0	sb487k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb487k/wibta_if_i_told_someone_my_job_was_tiring_me_out/	WIBTA if I told someone my job was tiring me out too much for a relationship?

iy4w0bsf	As I (31M) have Raynaud's disease (my extremities will sometimes lose circulation when they get too cold) and I live in an old house without the greatest heating system, I wear slippers when I'm inside almost 24/7. When I go outside, I'll step directly out of my slippers and into my outdoor shoes so as to avoid touching the cold floor with my feet at all. Sometimes I'll forget about my slippers after I've taken them off and leave them sitting on the kitchen floor.  My roommate (31NB) *hates* when I do this, with a passion I'd reserve for wrongs more akin to a war crime. I've listened to their concerns and remember to move them out of the way maybe 75% of the time now. When I slip up, I never consciously do it out of spite - it's pure forgetfulness and old habits (which I have made considerable, if imperfect, progress in breaking). But my roommate acts like I've dropped a dookie in the middle of our shared living space for that remaining 25%.   If I'm not home when they discover my slippers in the wrong place, they'll sometimes hide them, leaving me to struggle with bloodless toes while I figure out where they went or drop them in a salty snow puddle on the shoe mat (which also houses winter boots). If we are both home when I slip up, they'll launch into an angry, belittling lecture on leaving my slippers in the middle of the floor every. Single. Time.   I'm not a terrible roommate. I do 75% of the dishes. I'm largely responsible for keeping the common areas clean. I'm mainly the one who keeps the driveway free of snow. As someone who is possibly on the spectrum, I have a strong suspicion that my roommate is also on the spectrum and though we sometimes have competing access needs, I try my best to make the environment we live in a comfortable one for them.   It's like none of that matters in the face of a pair of slippers being left on the kitchen floor every so often.   The other day, my grandma died. I mentioned it to my roommate in passing this morning and while I wasn't expecting a tender heart to heart about it, I was hoping for an "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss." I didn't get it. Not twenty minutes later, they were ripping into me again about the slippers and honestly, it kind of broke me. They can rant about a small slipper slip-up, but can't spare a sentence for polite condolences??  This is the first time either of us has lived away from family. While I understand that when you live with roommates, you're going to have to pick your fights, deal with the potentially unsavory quirks of other people and make compromises, I'm not sure my roommate gets that. WIBTA if I pointed that out to them the next time they go nuclear over a pair of slippers?	1642973445.0	sb4gi5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4gi5/aita_for_occasionally_forgetting_to_put_my/	AITA for occasionally forgetting to put my slippers on the shoe mat?
d3fodzwd	I (20F) am maid of honor to my sister (22F) who’s getting married this summer. Backstory, I’m a real estate agent in California and am very well off for my age, I own a house a new car, and can afford pretty much anything I want. My sister and all her of her bridal party minus me, work in the the lower paying jobs of health care but are all able to pay for things they want. My sister wanted to go away for the weekend for her bachelorette party, so we looked at Airbnb’s, found a really cute one in Nevada and decided on it, it was $270 a night and we had 6 guests total, and for the weekend it added up to almost a thousand dollars total (gas, added fees, etc) so I put everyone in a group chat to discuss payment, they all immediately offered to pay for other things, food, drinks, party items etc, I kindly stated if we’re all staying there then we all need to pitch in for the Airbnb and also the food and drinks. They agreed, or so I thought, so I booked the Airbnb for the weekend. A month until, no one has paid, and I asked them all about it, I got a load of excuses saying they needed to pay bills or for food etc (they’ve had almost 7 months to save) so I cancelled the booking and got called a spoiled brat by my sister and her friends saying it’s the least I could do since I’m “loaded”. I was uninvited to a bachelorette party that isn’t happening and also uninvited to the wedding, so I took all the thing back I bought for the weeding which included lanterns for the isle, candles and fake plants for center pieces, cancelled the photographer and the videographer, if you can’t tell, I paid for a lot since her soon to be husbands family doesn’t have much money so I helped her and my mom pay for things, I didn’t cancel the venue, food or alcohol vendors. Once I informed her that, since I was no longer welcome, I took back everything I paid for, she immediately started crying saying I should’ve known she and her friends were joking and that they were just upset, so now she’s telling everyone I’m “going broke” and wanted my money back for everything I paid for and left her “stranded”, meanwhile I’m still sitting in my $500,000 house on the beach with my 2022 Mercedes in the driveway, So AITA?	1642972818.0	sb47qp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb47qp/aita_for_cancelling_almost_everything_for_my/	AITA for cancelling almost everything for my sisters wedding?
iy8mgyw4	Ok so I know I sound a bit like an asshole. MIL and I have some issues, nothing too bad but she is smug and overly competative.  MIL looks extremely young. She looks like she could be her husband's daughter despite not having a big age difference.  At a family cookout the other day my mom told MIL if she looked like her, she would lie to guys and date men in their twenties.  MIL laughed and asked why she would want to do that. I thought she just meant she wouldn't want a large age gap, which i get, but she said men in our generation are so weak. She said she would never pay for half of a date. She had one young BF as a rebound during her divorce and she said he sucked in bed because he kept asking her if she liked it (god forbid someone care about consent) and that they are so sensitive and insecure. Then she brought her own son into it and said we planned my proposal together and what is even the point. She said she wants a man who acts like a man, which eww.  My mom said MIL was actually right. I jumped in and said MIL should really date in her own age range anyway because I don't know many men my age who like leeches and she is kind of like a parasite. MIL told me that I'm jealous and I'd be a housewife too if I could. I told her men my age have self respect and like women with ambition, not someone who isn't even literate.  At that point MIL's husband went absolutely bezerk and called me a racist bitch and told me to get out. I tried explaining that she had just made fun of her own son's proposal, but he was furious. I sent him a text saying I know I took it too far and I'm sorry, but he said I'm banned forever and if I think someone not being able to read English makes them illiterate then he doesn't want me around his kids/grandkids.  My mom says I took it too far and was mean to MIL and said I just have to understand that women of their generation want different things. Umm MIL is in her very early 40s and my mom isn't quite 50, so it isn't like they are boomers. I found the conversation problematic and didn't like that she trashed my proposal.	1642973581.0	sb4ik9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4ik9/aita_for_telling_mil_no_one_actually_wants_her/	AITA for telling MIL no one actually wants her?

i54yzz6i	I (F22) been seeing this guy (M26) for months now but recently I’ve been traveling so haven’t seen him in a month. When I returned I’ve traveled to his city to see him. The first two nights we did the deed like the usual. On the last night I was staying at his we both had a little drink but I’m a light weight so was quite drunk.   Anyway, fast forward to when we get in the bed and due to alcohol I’m way more forward and we proceed to have sex but he proceeds to ask me if I’m on the pill. To which I obviously I replied the truth which yes I am. We’ve been having sex for few months without a condom now since he knew I was. I didn’t really mind at this point since we haven’t seen each other in a while. What got me pissed off is what he proceeded to do next.    He asked him three more times during the whole time we were having sex if I’m on the pill. Each time I answered but I got more and more frustrated since I didn’t know why he keeps asking me the same question. He finished in me and when he got off the bed he proceeded to say “you better fucking be on the pill” and that’s when I saw red.   I got up and went to his spare bathroom in which I tried to calm down as I never get angry. But the anger didn’t go away so I stayed for almost 20 mins with angry tears in my eyes. I’m not sure what got over me next but I opened the door and marched back in the room where he asked why I was gone for so long. I, on the other hand, opened my backpack and took out 4 boxes of pills and proceed to throw them all at him. He got angry and said that I’m over reacting and that I’m in one of my “moods”  I left the next morning and haven’t seen him since. So am I the asshole for getting angry and am I overreacting?	1642973653.0	sb4jl4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4jl4/aita_for_getting_mad_at_a_guy_m26_im_seeing_for/	AITA for getting mad at a guy (M26) I’m seeing for asking if I’m on the pill
7xctd	My son’s biological mother left me for her meth dealer when he was 2 years old. The two of them had another child while I had joint custody of my son. One night, after a meth bender, the two of them snorted a bunch of Xanax and passed out on my son’s baby sister, killing her.   I was immediately granted full custody. When it became clear just how much had gone on when my son was under her care, my now wife and I took her to court to completely terminate her parental rights. When presented with the evidence, the judge stopped our attorney mid sentence with, “I’ve heard enough and am disgusted with *bio-mother*”  He terminated her rights and granted my wife’s adoption request in the same hearing. This terminated the rights of the entire toxic family as well.   As a courtesy, I have been allowing the bio-grandmother monthly visits so that she wouldn’t be punished for her daughters actions. Even though this grandmother tried to cover up the drug use and neglect that had been going on. This was on the grounds that she would be just a “family friend” as he didn’t remember most of the whole ordeal.   Over time, she has snuck behind our back and taken pictures of him to share with the bio-mother. Probably whispered god knows what into his ear while we were in a different room. I think it’s worth noting that I’m describing a person with borderline personality disorder who has been highly manipulative throughout her entire life.   We invited her to the birthday party but she declined. Her reason was that she wanted her own personal party with just the two of them.   Also, when teaching my son recently about not being a taddle tell, he responded with, “I won’t taddle anymore. Especially on Nana, cause she gives me toys and candy so I don’t.” We couldn’t get any more information out of him.   The decision was made to pull the plug. I just sent her a text informing her that all personal visits are now suspended and to respect our privacy as a family.   I just had to walk out of the house to cry because I’m absolutely sick to my stomach. I just took away someone my son loves and he has absolutely no clue what I have just done.   AITA? Because I sure do feel like one. Even though it’s a decision I’ve made to protect our closed adoption until he is emotionally ready for disclosure.   He’s just now piecing together that my mother makes her his grandmother. And my wife’s mother means she is his other grandmother. “But… what about Nana?” has come up recently.   I don’t know. I just know this feels terrible.	1642973812.0	sb4lpf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4lpf/aita_for_removing_my_sons_biological_grandmother/	AITA for removing my son’s biological grandmother from his life in order to to keep his adoption a closed one?
ejkmpr28	I'm a 14 year old student. I'm almost in 9th grade and there's this thing that makes me guilty about myself sometimes. I think I'm selfish and bad thinking like it. The thing is I feel I'm better than any other school mate.  Most of my school students are problamatic, as what I feel. They make comment about someone's apperance, are racist, plus im sure homophobic and transphobic as well because my state/country is full of it and doesn't support it. I was like them too, not someone who make fun of someone's apperance, but transphobic and homophobic. But lockdown changed me and I become a better person to be honest. And although I have never bullied/have been rude to someone intentionally, I won't say I was/is completely nice with all. Even after lockdown, they all are mostly still the same. Problematic on the grounds I have mentioned, even my teachers. They are sexist, and when I try to express my opinions against them regarding things I felt wrong, and are definitely wrong, my classmates support my teachers. They don't even know basic political things, i know it doesn't matter much. But whenever I have debate with my social science teacher because I don't like her castiest opinions, they without even knowing anything; support the teachers. Basically they are teacher's pet.   It's lockdown again and everything have gone online, I don't talk with anyone either. These things makes me feel weird to talk with them. I know I'm not being nice here, just because they are not politically aware and not taught what is right or wrong, I shouldn't think myself am superior. But sometimes I think I deserve a better place, with more better and open minded children and teachers.   P.s pardon for my poor English.	1642974294.0	sb4spr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4spr/aita_if_i_think_am_better_than_my_schoolmates_and/	AITA if I think am better than my schoolmates and is deserve a better school?

Only some family and friends knew about this surgery because I didn't think it was very important or something people needed to know. My friend(23F) who has infertility issues had no idea about my surgery but knew I was transitioning.

After dinner she asked if we could talk and I said sure, not knowing what it was about. She asked me if I could be a surrogate for her.

i5c5liv8	My (27F) biological dad (43M, we'll call BD) has never really been involved in my life. In my adulthood, I've only really maintained a relationship with BD to appease his parents, who have always been moderately involved in my life. Normally, I would have invited BD to appease my grandparents, but everything kind of went to hell in October 2019.   My now-husband and I got engaged in June 2019 and planned our wedding for August 2020. In October 2019, I received a text from BD, who was working as a Student Resource Officer in a high school, that he had been put on administrative leave with no other information. In February 2020, BD was charged with 7 felony counts of sexual misconduct with a minor, relating to 7 different students at the high school. At this point, I went very low contact with BD as I was generally uncomfortable with being around him.   I was laid off in March of 2020 so my husband and I got married quickly in our backyard and pushed the big celebration out to this coming April. My husband and I both have teenaged half-sisters who are in the wedding party. As far as I know, BD can't come to the reception anyway because of his bail conditions (can't be around children under 18; trial has been delayed due to COVID).   I called him the other night to explain that I was uncomfortable with him attending in light of the circumstances and asked that he not attend. He got huffy and told me I should defend him to anyone who might be uncomfortable because I'm his child and I know him. I explained to him that he's never really been a father to me and I don't really know him. He agreed not to come and then hung up on me. Since this conversation, my grandparents have completely shut me out.   I'm really not comfortable with him attending, not only because there will be teenage girls there, but I also just don't really want anything to do with him anymore. Maybe I should have waited for the legal process to play out before just deciding he was probably guilty, but based on everything, it seems like there's pretty convincing evidence.

ch4sbpdl	I (21f) am a college student who lives at home. I am in therapy once a week for an hour at a place roughly 15 minutes away from where I live. I recently got in a fight with my older brother (22m) about respect for my mother and all she does for me, and that I should be grateful, and that I "make my mother drive me to therapy". However, the way I see it, she signed up for this. My parents do not let me drive despite having a license, do not allow me to get a ride from a friend (or have friends over, or even make calls without getting yelled for it or passive aggressiveness from my mother). I am not allowed to have a job (along with my other siblings) so I cannot afford to move out, get an uber, or afford a car; however when I ask for money for the train or college necessities I often get accused of stealing, while my older brother has a credit card they pay off for him and my younger siblings don't get an entire guilt trip when asking for things. I know I've always been the black sheep of the family since I'm severely mentally ill, however it is exasperated by my mother (as confirmed by many therapists). I think I might be TA because I could technically do Zoom sessions for therapy (which I hide from my family), as in the past there have been instances of them snooping (confirmed by them bringing things up which I spoke to the therapist about), or constant interruptions (my sister coming into our shared room to grab something or my mom coming in to "check up" on me). So AITA for "making" my mom take me to therapy? I understand it is another obligation on top of driving me to/from the train station for classes, and she has other children to worry about, but she and my family constantly use this excuse despite there being a million ways to go about things.  (Everyone might assume there is something I have done in the past to warrant there behavior. During my high school years I was a "good kid" by most standards, i.e. straight A's, no dating, no drugs, etc. However even then I was not allowed to have friends or go out. When I was 18, I started drinking, experimenting with drugs, dating boys/girls, very first year of college things, but always kept my grades up. I hid this from my parents, and when they found out, even stricter rules were placed. I stopped, and their rules and backhanded comments have only gotten worse.

iy9ux2af	I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years now. During that time we have been through university together, and I have gone on to study a masters degree, with my goal always being doing a PhD afterwards.   My girlfriend claimed to be supportive of this idea at first, and I applied to several PhD programmes last year, which I was rejected from. As the rejections came in I became more and more upset, and what hurt even more was that each time I told my girlfriend I had been rejected, she was visibly happy about it. I should add that I am a good student, and the universities cited a coronavirus-related lack of funding, rather than a lack of ability, as the reason I was rejected, and recommended I reapply this year.  I have since got a job which pays quite well for the level of experience I have (I earn considerably more than my girlfriend), and we have been able to move in together. Although the job is in the field that I studied, I don't enjoy it for several reasons (long hours, poor work culture, etc), and would still like to do a PhD. I raised this with my girlfriend, and she just started crying and would not stop until I promised to not apply.  Her view is that I make good money, and the chances are the amount I make will radically increase over the next few years if I carry on working at the current company. This would mean that we could afford to buy a house and have a generally good standard of living which, in her eyes, would be worth the price of not enjoying my job.  I love her, and do want to be with her, but I am seriously considering applying anyway even though I know that it will likely mean the end of our relationship. Without a PhD I am unable to do the job that I want to do, and would still be earning more than her, even as a student. She has told me that if I took a paycut to do this I would be "ruining her life goals", which made me feel a bit used, as not doing this would be "ruining" my own life goals. I fully understand that it isn't ideal, as i would be a student until we were both nearly 30, which would probably delay some life events, but I am increasingly unhappy in my job and I don't think I can do it for much longer without becoming seriously depressed.   I have suggested the possibility of us moving abroad to do it as a possible solution, where I would actually be getting a payrise to study for my PhD, and she would also earn considerably more that at present. This resulted in more crying and was quickly shot down, as she doesn't want to move away, which I understand.  So, WIBTA for going ahead with the applications, even though I know that it will make her upset and possibly be the end of our relationship?	1642975418.0	sb58ri	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb58ri/wibta_for_pursuing_a_phd_even_if_it_means_the_end/	WIBTA for pursuing a PhD even if it means the end of my relationship?
9umpn5kb	About 6 months ago I (14 male) dated one of my friends and he (14 male) dated for a couple of weeks and then I found out he cheated on me and my best friend with each other and we didn’t know he told us he broke up with the other. So I was pissed about that but me and my friend decided to not let him know we knew so we acted normal to see what he would do, he sent me nudes when I told him I didn’t like nudes and didn’t like people for their body I like people for their personality. Then he tried to change me from an atheist to a Christian when he knew I didn’t want to be a Christian, then he told people I was a trans female saying he didn’t want to call himself gay, then he told me I was the source of his problems and right then was when me and my friend broke and we told him we never wanted to see him again. He made rumors about us both and tried to get us to stop being friends, it didn’t work and he lost most of his friends because he tried to victimize himself and everyone knew he wasn’t the victim. And I learned that my friend works at subway and the first person that walks in everyday is him so ya I’m not going to work there I was but literally every time I see him I get mad and want to hurt him so I decided to not apply.

She dumped him and he was apparently heartbroken. His life fell apart and he lost himself.  So now 7 years after that, my wife gets a Facebook message from Rick. So apparently he was diagnosed with cancer and the cancer didn’t respond to treatment and had now spread to a point where he’s done for. He now has less than 6 months to live.  In this message, he told my fiancée that his life was changed forever since she left him and he never found a love like her and wanted to see her before his death. My fiancée told me this. She spent years with him and even if she didn’t love him anymore, his death would cary a lot of emotional weight to her.  So fast forward to this Wednesday. They already met once. And she gets another message from him. He tells her that he knows she’s engaged to me, but since he’s about to die he figured she’d at least consider his last request of her. He said the best sex of his life was with her and sex with no woman was ever like with her. He was wondering if she’d sleep with him one more time. He also made it clear that he did not want me to know or even know about the message.  She of course said no. He then apologized for overstepping his bounds and asks if my fiancée can see him one more time as he’s feeling worse every day and is still in love with her. She agreed.  And here’s my problem. This dude asked her to cheat on me with him. I get it, dudes dying and my fiancée is a goddess in the bedroom, but still, that’s so fucking inappropriate and I felt disrespected.  So I tell her I’m not comfortable with her seeing him and that if she went to see him I’d consider it crossing a boundary. She asked me why I’m all of the sudden not okay with it, I tell her that it’s because he literally begged her to fuck him and never tell me.   She said she wasn’t going to do it and called me insecure and an asshole for telling her that she can’t see him as he’s about to die. I tell her it’s inappropriate for her to see someone who’s trying to talk her into cheating with them, whether their dying or not.

hpbgkx7r	So I (F) 25 and boyfriend (30) have been in a long distance relationship for more than a year. It's not easy... when it's good it's amazing but when it's bad it's chaotic. My boyfriend is really jealous and we have had many issues because of that. I usually work from home and rarely go out so i can keep the peace between us. But sometimes i have to go to work and everyweek i work with a different team depending on the project. Wendsday i had to go to work. My boyfriend facetimed me during lunchtime, i couldn't hear him since it was really loud. I texted him that i couldn't hear him since i don't have my earphones and he hung up. Since that moment he was acting really weird, and giving me the silence treatment. Everday i called him asking him what was going on but he wouldn't tell. Today he finally told me and he was upset because he is sure that i was taking my lunch with a male coworker. I told him that there was no guy and that this week there is only girls in the team in which i'm working. He told me that i could have showed him who i was taking lunch with but that would have been really unprofessional. And then he tells me that he knows that i still have my ex on instagram. For me it wasn't a secret and the thing is i haven't talked to that guy in 5 years so i didn't even noticed it. I told him that i can delete him right now and that i really didn't care. He kept calling me a liar accusing me of having a secret life, and that i'm not ready for a serious relationship (i am planning to move to his city by the end of 2022). So in retaliation he told me that reached out to his ex who clearly has still interest in him. I told him that it's really fucked up to go and talk to her. He kept saying that he is treating me the same way as i was treating him. I always do my best but right now i'm in pieces and feel betrayed. I feel like i keep giving but it's never enough, but i keep asking myself, AITA for having my ex on social media even if i was ready to delete him ?	1642975912.0	sb5fzh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5fzh/aita_for_having_my_ex_on_social_media/	AITA for having my ex on social media ?
iy97usmx	I (21M) have glioblastoma (brain cancer). I went through months of gruelling treatments but it was all in vain. My doctors told me that I have about 3 months to live at most. After seeing enough dying cancer patients (end-of-life care or not) while in the hospital I've decided that I really didn't want to leave this world that way. Trust me, it's a terrible way to go. Thanks to the help and support of my amazing doctors I got permission for euthanasia (lethal injection). I'm set to die in a few weeks. I'm really content with my decision, I just hope that my condition remains stable until then.   My family on the other hand, reacted very negatively to this. They told me that I'm extremely selfish, that I just don't love them enough and want to abandon them faster, that I shouldn't take the easy /cowardly way out and I should treasure every moment I have left and that I'm making things more difficult for them than they already are + a lot of other things like that. Their words hurt me so much.  I love them but why should I have to die in an excruciating way instead of a peaceful and painless one for them to have peace of mind? Aren't they the selfish ones for wanting me to suffer for their own well-being?	1642976015.0	sb5hgf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5hgf/aita_for_choosing_to_die_by_euthanasia/	AITA for choosing to die by euthanasia?
9fuq3gdy	So for context, I’m 15F and the guy in this story (let’s name him John) is 15M and half white half Pakistani. I have a decently big friend group.  Fast forward to 2 days ago. We’re talking in a group chat and start joking about our own races/genders. One girl says that she hates Greek people (she’s not Greek) and he goes wild calling her racist.  Obviously, that’s not racist. I explain how it’s not racism and he starts trolling me, just making fun of my actions and what I’m saying.  John then adds his friends and he and them start saying some wild shit. I’m from Palestine so John took that opportunity to tell me to go get bombed by the IDF. And proceeds to call me a sand monkey etc.  I usually wouldn’t be that bothered with racist remarks, but I have had close family die from war in Palestine, and John knew that.  At this point though, I just left the group chat to calm myself down. They then add me back, and start making fun of my appearance, just the usual shit about my weight and my face (I’m recovering from anorexia).  At this point I’m furious and extremely upset so I insult him about his family problems. It’s the only thing I knew would hurt. And so he becomes extremely mad and everyone says I took it too far.  I obviously don’t agree and so when all my closest friends talked to him like nothing happened, i was pissed. I told my friend (let’s name her Lana) to take John off the group chat but Lana refused because apparently “she doesn’t wanna take a side” (but imo what he said was way worse).  When John asked me why i was so mad, i reminded him about my dead relatives. His friend takes the opportunity to make fun of my dead relatives. I lost it.  I start insulting John in the group chat even after Lana tells me to stop multiple times. If he can say wild shit and it’s justified then why can’t I? (To clarify, I said nothing racist).  Lana then removes me. I dm her, obviously pissed, because even though I was mean, he was straight up racist and cruel. But it’s been a few hours and I’m beginning to think that maybe Im in the wrong for being pissed at her. She just didn’t want drama. So what do you think, AITA?  TL;DR, I insulted my friends family problems after he was racist towards me. Should I be mad at my close friend for staying neutral?	1642976138.0	sb5j6q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5j6q/aita_for_snapping_on_my_friends_for_not_taking_my/	AITA for snapping on my friends for not taking my side?

One time, I noticed someone put a bag of milk on top of my mushrooms which I used to cook and I sent this message in our groupchat :  "Who the fuck put a milk bag on top of my mushrooms?"  and I wonder, as it was probably an accident/mistake/oversight and I wonder if my message sounds too aggressive or harsh.

iyagkatk	I (24 f) was invited to an old colleague’s (25 f) wedding. We keep in touch randomly off and on, exchanging messages every few months to keep tabs on each other’s lives. With Covid they’re being very intentional about who they invite. When I casually asked if I would be getting a plus one to bring my partner to the wedding she explained that I would not be because they had a limited amount of people they could invite. I opted not to go and give my seat to someone else and send a nice gift instead.

72aglo4g	 I am annoyed at my older sister and tired of my family's financial situation. Money is always tight for me and my low-income family, even when I was young. My mom works part-time at a nail salon and my sister, who graduated 2 years ago from college is currently working an office job. She sends a portion of her paycheck to my mother to help support our family of 3. I am a full-time student attending a prestigious engineering college. I don't work, because I am solely committed to finishing my degree. Before my sister graduated college, my family was financially supported by a relative.  Last night my sister and I were eating dinner in silence. I was thinking about my assignments. She made a comment at the dinner table. "You should conversate with the people (which is my mother and sister) who fund your bank account." What she said made me angry. I don't deny that they technically do, but I don't go out and go on a spending spree. What pisses me off is that when she was in college, she had no regard for spending. She told me a few weeks ago to be careful with my spending as a college student. While she was in college, she was completely fine with dropping hundreds of dollars for drinks, food, and sorority fees. She had some paid internships, but I highly doubt that they covered her expenses. I would occasionally hear my mother saying she had to send money to my sister's bank account during that time. She had so much fun during her time in uni, and was able to balance her school and social life. On the other hand, I try my best not to spend needlessly. I don't go out that much. I don't go to bars at all because I have so much classwork. I am not a part of greek life because its expensive. I don't have many friends either. I have to make a 1-hr commute daily to my classes because it is cheaper to live at home than a nearby apartment. There are things that I want, but I know I can't afford them.  She spent so much in college and we were financially supported by a relative, and when my sister graduated, my mother started asking for a portion of her paycheck to help support the family. Now that she is in the position to help support the family, she is annoyed that some of her paychecks are now used to support the family. Now that I am a college student, I have to be careful of what I choose to spend money on. I feel like she is being hypocritical and this situation is unfair. I am just annoyed. AITA for feeling this way?  P.S. Honestly, I don't blame her. I too would be unhappy if a portion of my paycheck gets taken away. I am also grateful that she is helping to support my family, which relieves the burden on my mother, who raised us all on her own.  I know I can't change this situation and it could be much worse. All I can do is make the most of what I have.	1642976507.0	sb5ogd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5ogd/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_sister/	AITA for being annoyed at my sister.
g2wdyp70	So what's been happening is really long and ill give you a condensed version. I've struggled with picking at my skin for years, it used to be just bug bites, but it's escalated to all over my body. In the begging my parents talked to me about it a few times, and I would try to stop, but I couldn't. I tried setting up a reward system, but they never really followed through with the reward. Mostly they just punished me. I went to a dermatologist who said what I had was normal and a lot of people do it. My mom scheduled appointments for a naturopathoc doctor who just reccomended a bunch of natural stuff that didn't work. She blamed it on vaccinations I had had when I was younger. For a awhile I didn't have to talk to her, ( we did telepath as she moved her practice to new york) but my parents have scheduled another visit with her, while I'm at work. I'm scared what thier going to tell her. I've been trying to break my habit with a little bit of success but my parents seem to think I can just "stop" doing it. I also have over weird habits like doing things more than once, or repeating phrases in my head. This helps fight off the impulses sometimes. The urges get worse when I'm stressed... which is a lot.

iybgko2m	I went to a place for lunch just now - kind of the vibes of Chipotle but they don’t make it/build it in front of you. You order & pay and then get your food after. It’s healthy with smoothies and quick meals.  When I paid I didn’t tip. And when my food came the girl brought me my food in the container with nothing else. I wasn’t bothered, I went and grabbed a fork and some napkins said thank you etc.   But I overheard her and her coworkers talking shit about me saying I obviously didn’t get the hint that I’m an AH for not tipping them and that’s why I was given nothing. I was super confused. Was I supposed to tip them?? I’ve never had this issue before.	1642977050.0	sb5vyz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5vyz/aita_for_not_tipping/	AITA for not tipping?
gnvsczvw	So a while back, when me and my former friend Trevor while friends, we shared a lot of things together, and he brought up the topic that some people were telling him to drop his other long time friend, Cale.Trevor didn't really want to drop Cale to be honest, but everyone was telling him to, he didn't know what to do so he asked me. I previously dated Cale and he was a terrible person, but he seemed okay to Trevor, so i basically said "don't drop him if u don't want"and Trevor stayed friends with Cale.  After that, me and Trevor got into a fight and we aren't friends anymore, have hardly talked since then. The fight was over something sort of small, i may have overreacted but he was in the wrong. I regretted cutting him out completely after that but thats not that important. A while later, Trevor starts to crush on my best friend and texts her a lot. She responded and texted him back, they played online games together too. But sometime after, she started battling her own mental problems and became too tired to text people back constantly. So it looked like she was ignoring him. Trevor then reached out to my friend from other places and she finally responded and explained. He just responded with "k" and left her alone. Then cussed her out on his story. She was so confused.   Later found out that Trevors friend Cale had lied to Trevor saying my friend had said bad things behind his back and said things like she wanted to drop him because he was friends with this trouble maker. My friend and Trevor talked it out later realizing Cale was only trying to ruin everyone's relationship with each other by lying about everything.  My friend told me briefly about this and then i went to Trevor a few days later apologizing about how i suggested he doesn't drop Cale, since I didn't know he was that bad. I thought if i had told Trevor to drop Cale earlier, none of this would have ever happened. I felt bad. Trevor was like "uh ya its fine he wasnt that bad back then anyway". Then later wrote "but why did she tell u its none of ur business." I write, "i asked, not her fault"and then he blocked me  don't know what he was expecting, he doesn't keep much of his friend's privacy either.  AITA?  TLDR: apologized to a former friend about something, probably shouldn't have even brought up. He didn't want me to know. May have wrongly involved another friend.	1642977056.0	sb5w2b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5w2b/aita_for_bringing_a_point_up_to_a_schoolmate_but/	AITA for bringing a point up to a schoolmate but possibly involving my friend?
iy74a8tr	My (36M) boyfriend (24M) have been dating for 1 1/2  years. He's FTM (this is important context) and sex is a pretty big aspect of our relationship. I'm a gay man, but I like to think I'm pretty good at navigating his anatomy (I've had sex with a woman before and she had my two kids, so I know my way around a vagina) and he had no complaints before. I won't get too detailed, but we try to be pretty give-and-take. I enjoy sex with him a lot and, as far as I'm aware, he did too until recently. The issue here concerns oral sex.  You may remember a few months ago, there was a big controversy involving Batman not going down on Catwoman. I've looked up to Batman my entire life, so when my boyfriend mentioned it to me in passing saying it was ridiculous, I wanted to look into the situation myself. Once I did, it really opened my eyes. Heroes don't do that, so why should I?  I didn't change anything immediately, but I slowly started giving him oral less & less. I've successfully skipped out on it twice. Last time, he went down on me and clearly expected me to return the favor (we were just messing around). I think he was confused when I didn't and started settling down to fall asleep instead. He didn't bring it up directly, but he also didn't try to have sex with me for a few days, which isn't normal for us. So I made the moves on him and he got all pissy and started complaining about me not going down on him. He went on about how it hurt him and made him feel 'rejected & unwanted.' I told him that wasn't the truth at all and explained my Batman-fueled realization.  It turned into a huge fight. He called me ridiculous, pathetic, told me to grow up, and said oral sex was the only thing I was passably okay at because of my tongue piercing. I told him that hurt a lot and that he was just being overdramatic, oral isn't that big of a deal. He's refused to talk to me or let me touch him since (this was all about a week ago), and even threatened to kick me out of the apartment if I didn't change or leave him be (for a bit). I don't know how to fix things without compromising my wants, or if I should even try.

iy9ux2au	Hi Reditt,  So I have been haveing some negitive run in with my neighbors. In short the are a young couple who are extermly antisocial (the neghborhood says they have aspergers or some other kind of social autism) and they like to make horrifing costumes and sclupters in there yard. I have bee fighting with the city for months to try to put a stop to them. Becuase i am sick of my kids haveing nightmares becuase the girl is randomly outside paniting a zombified disney princess.   thats just a short background on the issues i have been haveing with them. On to the most recent events then. So the city center did a steampunk night yesterday. My oldest girl (12) loves steampunk. So for a few weeks we worked on getting her a costume put toghter. She entered into the steampunk nights costume contest and we really thought she had a good chance of winning. Untill i heard the anouncer call my neighbors names... They come out on stage in these like old diving gaint divingsuits with gears and stuff. the girl had a gaint bloody needle and the guy had a gaint bloody drill an arm. Well of course they won and i was pissed. I went to complain to the staff. I told the staff this should have been a kids contest and that couple should be disquilfied. The people at this event were nearly all children and there parrents. I saw very few adults dressed up at all. I feel like it is wrong for this couple to come in and ruin a community event, let alone do it will all of their ussal gore and blood.

94dgt3fz	I (f19) often have discussion with this guy that goes to my school m(18). We talk about gender related things,  relationships and marriage,  race, abortion, and etc.   We've talked a great deal about lgbt and its clear that while he says he isn't homophobic, he has an intolerance to a lot of things lgbt related. He is also very judgemental while claiming that he isn't and he let's his religion (Christian) get in the way of how he sees people in general that don't "live by the bible" (neither does he).  I told him from the beginning that lgbt is one of the things i am passionate about defending,  and not only bc my best friend is gay but also bc i can't stand the ignorance that comes from people that are against it.    Me and him often disagree bc we just have different mindsets, the point of us having different discussion is just a lil friendly debate and exposing each other to different perspectives.  But I feel that his perspective can be very black and white and ignorant , esp when it comes to lgbt. He gets borderline disrespectful, and since its something I'm passionate about, I would rather not get into conflicts over this.   I suggested that we lgbt related topics out of our discussions bc its clear we are always gonna disagree and when you're constantly disagreeing over the same thing but just different ways,  that can get aggravating.   I explained this the best way I could, and he took as "I just like disagreeing" with him.	1642977312.0	sb5zhh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5zhh/aita_for_saying_that_i_dont_want_to_discuss_lgbt/	AITA for saying that I don't want to discuss lgbt anymore?
451nl1l2	This is a fictional scenario that is, frankly, likely to happen in a near future. To begin with, some ground context :  I live in Belgium and I am 21 years old. I am currently into the equivalent of college in Belgium, in the first year. I have no idea what to do with my life and I'm doing this just to avoid working or to do nothing, since my country basically pays me to go to school. I'm also living with my dad and sister.  Before, I lived for one year, alone, in a student studio for studies which I dropped to go and live a full year with an ex of mine in France. You can guess how that ended. Mentioning this so you know I kind of have life experience in my bag already.  The mother of my sister and I died years ago due to complicated reasons linked to her new husband. We were seeing her once every two weeks as my sister and I true father was and is the one having custody for us.  Thing is, my father is a terrible one. He loves us dearly but is just objectively so bad. He : - Is unemployed and has been for years (not due to any illness) - Drinks a lot, smokes, takes marijuana - Brings several people at home until late in the morning or disappears for the whole night - Burns all his money to those activities - Makes my sister miss school on several occasions  Because of that, I kind of have to act as the second father of my sister. And also give several hundreds of euros to my father every months so we can 'eat'. Put in quotes because he uses that money for his stuff, mainly.  I totally hate that situation. Money apart, I love my sister and she can be the most precious little thing, but his immature acting makes me have to care for her way too much. I don't want to take care of her until late in the night and put her into bed almost constantly. I wouldn't mind if that was occasionally. There's loads of other tiny details like this that just makes this situation unbearable.  Which led me to contact a sort of social worker because I was fed up. Now that this has been done, he may be removed from his position as a father if they find him incompetent.  I spoke about it to my family who all basically said that if this was to happen, I'd be the legal parent that have to take care of my sister.  And I just don't want to. I'm 21 years old and in studies. I already don't want to have any child later because I feel like I already raised one.   But at the same time, I can just picture the day my sister has to go into a totally foreign family. How she'd be crying her guts out for me to not leave her. Just picturing this tears my heart.  Given this complex situation, I can't quite know if I am just being selfish and an asshole or if being 21 years old and not wanting a child enough reasons to not hypothetically have to care alone for my sister in a near future.	1642977548.0	sb62ju	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb62ju/wibta_if_i_let_my_little_sister_9yo_go_into/	WIBTA If I let my little sister (9yo) go into foster care ?
itma9eyb	For context I (13 female) and my friend (12 female) had a sleepover during the snow days in South Carolina, I’m gonna call her Rose.  Rose and I had been friends since the beginning of the school year, we met through a close friend who I will call Jenna. Jenna and Rose have been pretty close and did a lot together, I had invited Jenna and Rose over and they both excitedly accepted, however because it snowed and the roads were very icy she could not make it to my house. We went out in the snow to sled and after we came back we played some Vinyl and before we went to bed I put it away, by the time I woke up in the morning around 10:40 I found that she had left. I got ready for the day and then I saw one of my Vinyl out on the ground I picked it up and the Vinyl album had felt lighter but I went to go put in the correct spot anyway, and then I found another Vinyl out of place and I picked it up but it had no Vinyl in it, my Parent (female 48) and I looked everywhere and didn’t find any Vinyl so I texted Rose and she denied having them so my Parent contacted her Parent (female 45) and asked if Rose had them or if she could check for them. Roses parent looked and sure enough they had the Vinyl she then contacted my parent back telling her that Rose had it but misunderstood saying “She had told one of the girls how much she wanted a record player and they let her have some Vinyl for it” that was a lie, the next day Rose returned them around 5:30 didn’t ring the doorbell and took off. I go to play the Vinyl they she took to make sure it was okay and one of the Vinyl was scratched up and ruined. My parent contacted Roses parent about it and she then she used PayPal to send money to my parent paying for a new Vinyl, My parent said drop it so I did. I wake up the next morning see my phone blowing up from one of the group chats I’m in, it was Rose and she added a High Schooler (female 14) a freshmen we will call Pearl. Pearl had kept saying she was getting someone to beat me and the people who defended me up, my friend (male 13) who we will call Cam contacted an 8th grader (male 15) who we are calling Bryan. Cam texted Bryan sending him some screenshots of what Pearl had said and asked if he wanted to beat us up, he said no and that he was not going to beat up 7th grades and definitely not me back his Homie is my cousin. Then Jenna added Bryan to the group chat and he said “I never said I wasting going to beat you 7th graders up and I wouldn’t because I know all of you and I’m friends with most of you” Pearl then said “Fine I will go to the middle school and beat them all up myself” I then got my parents involved (female 48) and (male 46) they then both contacted the school and they said that they would like to see me and my parents in the office Monday morning around 8:30 and I will be pulled out of home room to explain the situation to the principal and the resource officer so they could investigate.

ixmmw7bu	One of my brothers is finally getting married to his girlfriend of 15+  years. They dated for a long time and didn't really want to get married until now for god knows whatever reasons.  Anyway, he asked me to come to his wedding and I told him I didn't want to go because I'm older than his girlfriend by like 5 years and haven't ever really dated anyone.   He then asked me about a guy, Jacob (fake name), I met at a volunteering organization who walked me home in the rain, baked cookies for me and asked me to watch movies with him and told me that I should stop being a Debbie Downer and bring Jacob to the wedding with me as my date so I can attend and be happy at his event (rolls eyes).

iybow8t1	my boyfriend (20) of 2 yrs and i are very different people he likes drinking and im more of a stay at home or go on a hike kinda girl.  In the past few months weve been hanging out with my friends alot more notably mostly this one girl liz (18) her and my bf get along really well and laugh constantly together and always have a good time together while im on the sideline bored and sober while theyre drunk and chatting away (i know i should just join in but their conversations cant really be jumped into)   But to me atleast they seem incredibly flirty and it makes me feel jealous im not a very self loving person as is so i do tend to feel like im worthless and he would be better off dating her than someone who rarely in his eyes has a good time with him and after our most recent hang out with liz i told my bf about how i felt but has yet to give me a way we will deal with it other than ignore it.  He talks to her now more than i have since me and her were 15 at a time when we hung out daily.  Im not sure what to do tbh I want to bring it up again ir just cut of contact with her as we aren't that close anyway But either way i feel like the assh*le  So AITA?	1642977940.0	sb67v2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb67v2/aita_for_being_jealous_of_my_boyfriends_friendship/	AITA for being jealous of my boyfriends friendship
4s9ue2qn	Okay so I (M17) used to get along with my girlfriends best friend just fine until one day he flirted with me and continued after I told him to stop, I'm not homophobic at all, it just made me really uncomfortable, especially since he knows I'm straight and in a relationship. I felt literally disgusting after that and I told my girlfriend just how it made me feel.   Now, this whole thing started because she apparently told him that I mentioned a desire to make out with him (I did not), when I then showed her the texts that made me so uncomfortable she just said "Oh wow, I thought it was worse. You made it sound like it was really bad, it's not". I then told her that that's pretty fucking rude but whatever.  Fast forward to today, she got mad at me that I said I don't really like him anymore when she was talking about something that happened regarding him. I'm actually on the phone with her right now and she once more mentioned how I'd ruin things because now we couldn't go on double dates with his partners and him..  So am I the asshole in this?	1642978397.0	sb6e66	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6e66/aita_for_disliking_my_girlfriends_best_friend/	AITA for disliking my girlfriends best friend?
itef25o7	The relationship has been rocky for a while for a variety of reasons after 3 years together. Mainly relating back to her emotional issues which means communication is impossible. So I've become unhappy with a lot, which can't be addressed which then has a domino effect and my dissapointment means I dont behave how she wishes. Without exaggeration, there is no approach I can make to have a discussion about any of the multitude of things that have induced a borderline depression in myself. I live with her, she knows I love her endlessly, she knows I offer affection, she knows I've spoiled her with gifts throughout the relationship, she knows I desire love in return but aside from empty "I love you's" there is no more physical affection, no sex, no effort to want to do things with me, no effort in close to a year to visit my mum who is super nice to her. The list goes on, but I have to accept it because she has these "issues" which she is medicated for with anti-depressants.   We have had sex 6 times in 6 months. And they have all been me initiating despite being mentally destroyed by over a years worth of rejection. She says her anti-depressants play a part which I accept, but there needs to be some consideration for the other person in the relationship. For 2 months early in the relationship when I had a brief period of low libido and work tiredness, hell broke loose, I was screwed and shouted at for making her feel unattractive thus I made the effort to change it for her. Now, for a year and a half the sex has been so infrequent I've been so sensitive about raising the issue, it results in her getting irate. I tried to raise the topic tonight again whilst relaxing together in bed, because she had mentioned two weeks ago about seeing a doctor about this issue (I know a change of medication could be a solution) me trying to follow up on that discussion went as normal. She got angry.   I proposed a hypothetical scenario to her, something I wouldn't do however I wanted her thoughts. I said "because you deny sex, would you be okay with letting me have sex with other people, I don't think you would". She said no, proceeded to get angry at what I said and cut me deep with "what if I said I want to have sex with someone who doesn't need a pill to keep it up?". I've suffered with porn induced ED in the relationship which hasn't been a big issue as its only prevented sex once or twice, I will take a small part of a pill sometimes to ensure it doesn't happen. It brought me to tears that she stung me like that, it didn't seem relevant or comparable to what I said at all and she doesn't understand that. Her go to tactic is to blame her current action's on things I've said or done years ago, empty insults which I've apologised profusely for and never repeated. I've never had a sorry, for any of the multiple insults and personal attacks she has made on me.  Tl:dr: gf insulted issues I've had with ED after I tried addressing our dead sex life	1642978685.0	sb6hqp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6hqp/aita_for_this_exchange_of_comments_and_an_insult/	AITA for this exchange of comments and an insult from my GF of three years?
9rxezb41	My ex-BF and I (both mid-20s) dated for about a year in 2020/2021, broke-up and started dating again a couple months later. We never DTR this time around though... I wanted to. Just to understand what he really wanted from me. Since he'd previously been the one to break it off due to fear of commitment and a host of other personal reasons. But he was kind of resistent to sitting down and having a proper chat. He just assumed I wasn't going to see other people, after a drunk chat where I said I wasn't interested in games. And to give him some credit, he did insinuate he wouldn't either. But he also kept using phrases like: "Be patient with me", "I need time" and "Let's just see how things go". Which wasn't giving me the strongest sense of commitment. So, although I told me close friends the whole truth, I kept going on dates for a while behind his back and never referred to him as more than a friend to "outsiders". At some point he introduced himself to a buddy of mine as my boyfriend and got a rather surprised response. Which upset him (my ex) greatly. I felt bad. But am I really the asshole here? I feel like I gave him ample opportunity to ask me to be his girlfriend. But that, I guess, was too scary. So he just steam rolled me when he was convenient for him. For the record: We're no longer an item. But the situation still plays on my mind sometimes.	1642979083.0	sb6ndq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6ndq/aita_for_not_calling_him_my_boyfriend/	AITA for not calling him my boyfriend?
ds5t563k	The 5 year anniversary of my grandma's death from cancer is coming up in 2 weeks and I'm not going to the memorial. I know, it sounds selfish but it's for a reason. My Aunt is going to be hosting it at her house and is only inviting our close family.   I was good with this idea. That was until I found out that she was only inviting me because my dad asked her to. I have had little to no contact with my aunt for a little over 10 years and the only times I call her is for my prescriptions. But, in my eyes, contact issues do not dismiss the fact that I'm her niece and that I'm my grandma's granddaughter. My grandma helped my dad raise me when things were tough and has always cared for me like I was her own. She was like an angel on earth and it hurts that such a beautiful soul was taken at the wrong time.   My dad also doesn't have a lot of contact with her either, but still tries to be nice. He was overjoyed about remembering his mother's death but was confused as to why I wasn't invited. Apparently, she wasn't inviting me at first because she "doesn't trust me well enough." She went on to explain that she has seen my social media and doesn't agree with my lifestyle or my boyfriend. My dad, being the amazing person he is, told her that I'm doing amazing considering some things I've gone through in the past and that my boyfriend is one of the most respectful people he's ever met. It took some convincing to get her to invite me.   Yesterday I got a text from my dad asking if I and my boyfriend would like to go to a memorial for the anniversary of my grandma's death and I said yes. I called my aunt afterward and thanked her for inviting me. She told me that it was just going to be close family and I was good with this. I asked if she was okay with my boyfriend coming with me. The only thing she said was that I could stay for a few minutes but not the whole time. This enraged me and I snapped at her saying things like "She would be so disappointed in you for this!" After I had calmed down I told her that I wouldn't be coming because it would be pointless to stay for a few minutes.   I just got a call from my dad saying that he could understand my anger but I shouldn't have said those things. So, am I the asshole??	1642979355.0	sb6qv9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6qv9/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_a_memorial_service_for/	AITA for refusing to go to a memorial service for my grandmother?
ixmmw7bu	I asked a guy from my volunteering club to go to my brother's wedding with me after my brother gave me that stupid piece of advice.  I framed it as like, "I really don't want to go to my brother's wedding, but my mom and siblings will be mad at me if I don't, so will you go with me to make it suck less?" and he laughed and said that he'd gladly go with me.   However, I've thought about it again and I've realized that even with a date to the wedding, I'd rather not go to the event. I hate large celebratory events, even those for myself. When I won teacher of the year at my school, all my siblings came even though I didn't tell them about my award and it was really awkward for me.   However, I already asked a guy to go with me and told him all the logistics, and he's already blocked the date off, so WIBTA if I decided not to go to the wedding?	1642979384.0	sb6r76	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6r76/wibta_for_not_attending_an_event_after_i_asked/	WIBTA for not attending an event after I asked someone to accompany me to it?

ix6719c8	So me, M26 have a gf, F23. Ill admit, im ugly. Im tall, but kinda chubby. Super pale, shaggy blonde hair, freckles, glasses, basically a nerd. My gf on the other hand is absolutely gorgeous. Shes short, brown, big eyes and big glasses, adorable and genuinely could model. I dont know how i managed to score her, well.. until now.  Her 2 closest friends, A and M, are really annoyng. Loud, bitchy, angry girls that are always in my buisness and judging me. They have a groupchat where they give me advice on her and stuff. The topic managed to rear around her exes once, shes had 3 past relationships. One short term casual thing, one long term pretty serious one and one sort of not dating yet but close for a short while. I know their names but ive never seen them, so i bugged A and M to send pictures. Lets call the short casual relationship 1, the long term one 2, and the talking phase not yet dating 3.   1 was tall, chubby, white, and a massive nerd.  2 was lanky, tall, nerdy, blonde.   3. was tall, chubby, white, GINGER, and a maasive nerd.  Im in no place to call them ugly but yeah, these dudes were massive nerds and not scoring in the looks department. Just like me.   M proceeded to say that they were both aware of my gfs type of ugly tall nerdy white dudes and i guess it made more sense why she liked me, looking as gorgeous as she was. I wasnt mad or anything it was just interesting. I made a comment about her type while we made dinner and she asked me if M and A told me about her exes. I said yeah and shes a bit mad that we talk about her rough pst on a daily basis in the gc and her issues and stuff but i explained they were just helping me understand more because my gf never talks about those thngs (childhood, family, exes, rough times)   M and A are mad too, so AITA for snooping behind her back?	1642980058.0	sb70bu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb70bu/aita_for_snooping_making_comments_ab_my_gfs_past/	AITA for snooping & making comments ab my gfs past and exes?
e2tyy2km	Now, typically, this would be an automatic yes. But let me explain. My friend has been around me for a long time, but we've not been friends for too long. No more than a year.  I also feel the need to mention we're not talking sexual boundaries, but like basic "you should" and "you shouldn't".  About a week ago, me (16,M) and my friend(16,M), we're gonna call him James, were hanging out in his house. Now, I have a bad habit of not thinking about boundaries unless they're spoken of directly, so I always ask. It's always basic boundaries, and if it's not, I make sure to note it so I remember. This particular day I was being chaotic and pushed him onto the bed in the middle of a fake argument. I didn't notice the mood switch when he went back to yelling at me, and made a joke right back. After that he stormed out of the room, slamming the door behind him.  Afterwords he came back into the room and demanded that I leave his house. I walked back down the street to my house and was bombarded by messages from our group chat, calling me a terrible person for ignoring James's boundaries.   Now, I don't remember James setting any boundaries dealing with pushing him onto a bed, but I may be the asshole for forgetting he's ever told me (if he did). He hasn't spoken to me since.  Tl/Dr: My friend hasn't spoken to me since I pushed him onto the bed while playing around. I was later told pushing him was a no-no zone.

7xpul0av	I’ve (28m) been with my gf (25f) for about 5 months now and she just moved into my house (she couldn’t afford her rent but I have a good job so I own my house outright), the house has stables where my horses live but she doesn’t really like horses. I have 6 horses (Kiwi I - had since I was 10, Alexandra - had since I was 18 as well as Tsar & Kiwi II - Kiwi I and Alexandra’s twin foals who are both 8 and Pancetta & Parsley - two miniatures I rescued and have had as long as Alexandra) I absolutely love animals in general and my gf has no problem with my two dogs (Missy & Stormi - both pit bulls) but she is frightened of all of my horses, I don’t make her have anything to do with them as they will only let me look after them.   But a week ago she told me to sell all 6 and put her name on the deed to my home. After this I told her to get out but I didn’t let her use the car I bought for her (Aston Martin DBX - she always pointed them out saying she liked them) and Made her get a taxi because I didn’t think that she deserved the car my hard work bought, I don’t see why I should sell 6 horses whom I’ve known and cared for for years just because she’s scared, I saved for the first three years of my career (I’m a tax lawyer) specifically so I could move out of my townhome in London and live by the sea in a house with stables for my horses.   As much as I liked my gf I didn’t trust her on the title for my house, she grew up poor and neither her or family work hard so I was worried to put her name on the deed, as she’d be entitled to 50% of the houses value. She’s saying I’m selfish and if I loved her I’d give her the car I bought back and sell my horses, she also says that I only don’t trust her because she grew up poor and I “don’t understand her struggles because of my daddy’s money”. After she said that I told her never to speak to me again but she keeps calling back and trying to tell me how bad of a a person I am. Am I really the bad guy here?	1642980454.0	sb75bk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb75bk/aita_for_leaving_my_gf_over_a_horse/	AITA for leaving my gf over a horse?
is81thnr	I (female, 19) am a singer-songwriter signed to an indie label in Columbia. As someone with little relationship experience, my music is generally based on other peoples' lives or is purely fictional. Last week I completed the chord charts and lyrics for a song about an unfaithful wife. This song began as a fictional story with no correlation to my personal life. However, my co-writer on this track (male, 71) suggested that I use the names of people I know in real life so that my writing doesn't get debunked if I eventually do interviews for this single (which is up in the air at this point as I only have 89k followers on Soundcloud and have only done five interviews in the past with locally-based magazines). The names Austin & Marcy Lee, my brother's best friend and his fiancé, came to my mind immediately as they flowed nicely with the rest of the lyrical content. I adjusted the names and am releasing this song in a few weeks as my debut solo record on major streaming services like Pandora and Tidal. I'm excited to put myself out there but nevertheless, I'm worried now. You see, my brother's best friend, Austin, is also my ex-boyfriend and I have a lot of pictures with him on social media. It'll only be a matter of time before people notice who this song is "about"... I even used his last name in one of the verses. As far as I know, his fiancé is faithful, but I didn't write the song about them anyway! I'd feel really bad if I damaged their relationship or her reputation based on a fictional story, but there's not much I can do because of my record label's strict release schedule rules (meaning I cannot cancel the release date of this song). I think it will be fine since none of us are celebrities who'll have the whole internet coming after them, but the line "Marcy Lee going around town like the bed girl she won't tell you about" (pun on bad girl) is gonna keep me up all night until the song is out. I'd really like y'all's input because I don't want to be feel bad about this and need a way out without not putting the song out.

55q5u9fc	I’m sorry if format is off, I’m on mobile.   So about 4 years ago I(20f) moved across the country and away from my best friend (20f), who I will call Alexa. Since I moved away I have not seen Alexa in person and we have stayed in contact daily for the past 4 years.   Recently, a member of my family passed away and I will be traveling back to my home state for the funeral. While in town, I wanted to visit Alexa and spend time with her since I haven’t seen her in years. She tells me I am her best friend daily, and we used to hang out for weeks at a time when I did live near her.   About a year ago, Alexa started having severe issues with her anxiety and has not left her house at all since. I understand the anxiety is debilitating, and I have supported her throughout her time dealing with it.   However, I asked if while I was in town if I could visit her at her home and hang out with her. She said no, that she wouldn’t be able to because of her anxiety.  I got upset because she is my best friend and I honestly just wanted to see her even if it was just for a couple minutes. I have struggled with anxiety most of my life, so I try to be accommodating but she doesn’t want to see me at all. Alexa doesn’t even want me to drop something off or wave at her through the window. I probably will not be able to come back into the state for at least another couple of years. And it upsets me that I can’t even invite her to the funeral, when she knew this member of my family very closely.

My boss, unknown m, often calls me late and asks me to work extra shifts during the holidays and also sometimes tells me to go home. Example : one Saturday he double booked me and one other staff member so made me work half an hour without pay before letting me go home. Not only that, but his staff consists of all teenagers (to keep costs down I assume) and we do all of the work apart from cooking (tips - despite claiming to be shared equally - are not). I have regularly witnessed the teenage staff dropping things on the floor and giving them to the customers anyway. This includes cutlery, and FOOD that has been DROPPED ON THE DIRTY FLOOR and put straight back on a plate and given to an unsuspecting customer.

Then today my brother went in and got a haircut at the same place and they fucked up his hair, like they gave him a squiggly bald spot, the sides were even, bro couldn’t even cut straight. This place used to give good cuts but I guess they kind of fell off now. My brother and I are pretty pissed and he already gave a bad review saying not to go their and I kinda want to also give a bad review but theirs some good barbers their that can actually cut so if I warn people about that guy it might drive business away from the good barbers but it might be to risky, so WIBTA if I left a bad review warning people.	1642981029.0	sb7cwe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7cwe/wibta_for_leaving_a_bad_review_on_a_barbershop/	WIBTA for leaving a bad review on a barbershop who messed up my hair?
ihd0q8qy	Hello all, I (60F) have a daughter (23F) who has one son aged 15 months, with another baby on the way. Growing up me and my daughter didn’t have the best relationship but we’ve been working on improving our relationship since about the time she got pregnant.   Recently, my daughter and her fiancé’s kitchen caught on fire so they were advised to stay elsewhere for about a month- 2 months time. Typically I would see them once every two weeks but When she asked to stay with us I must admit that I was stoked, as this was more time to spend with her and my grandson. Well since she’s been staying here we clashed over one main issue, screen time.    My daughter thinks that my grandson shouldn’t get more than an hour of screen time a day for his age. Since she is a stay at home mom, she incorporates screen time throughout the day, but supposedly no more than an hour. Since she’s been staying with us she’s let me spend time with him each night before he goes to bed, and I work a lot so I’m pretty tired majority of the time so I just turn on a baby sleep video for me and him to watch for a while.   The first couple of times my daughter mentioned that he gets no more than an hour and would ask me to put the phone away. I would say no and she would take him away from me. Just recently, she explained that he had screen time for about 40 mins already that day and so I need to watch no more than 20 mins of a show with him. I didn’t like her demands and honestly feel like screen time is our way of bonding, so we ended up watching about an hour of cocomelon. When I told daughter she needs to get over how I spend my time with my grandson, she replied that if I cannot respect her boundaries I do not get to spend as much time with him. Then she questions why I can’t read him a book sometimes or just wait to watch him when I’m not tired because I’m “ruining” the routine she built.   Since then she’s been acting distant. I feel like she’s being very dramatic and overbearing about this screen time thing, especially since they’ll only be here for one more month and this is my way of bonding with him. Her father however says her kids, her rules which has me questioning if I’m wrong here?	1642980978.0	sb7cbc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7cbc/aita_for_not_caring_about_my_daughters_screen/	AITA for not caring about my daughters screen time rule?
a8jl7ik3	My sister (11 year old) had a friend (13 year old female) which was originally my mom's friend's daughter (ill call the friend MT for short). Mt originally had problems with family especially that her parents have split up. I felt bad for her knowing how hard it feels to see your family fall so I gave her my number so she can contact me if anything happens. Ever since I gave her my number she kept talking to me everyday. I didn't have any problem with it because that's the point of me giving her my number. She kept saying that she's worthless or ugly etc. I kept telling her not to think this way and gave her an encouragement boost. But one time she started venting saying that she's getting bullied at school and she can't do anything about it (note that my mom works as a teacher in the same school). I asked her about what happened she said that there was a note in her bag full of threats and attacks towards her. I tell her ill go tell my mom she 100% will be able to help, but she kept telling me not to for no reason. Although I agreed I still felt suspicious about the whole situation. The other day she said that her neighbor r*ped her. At first I was furious, but I started thinking about it. Why would she come to me first when her mom is the best choice to tell? Plus, she has a little sister (9 years old). Heck, why didn't any neighbors heat the screaming or the calls for help? Especially that where they live is very crowded with people and a lot of thin walls that you can literally hear the food cooking from another apartment. I told her that I'll call her mother to tell her, but again, she kept saying not to. At this point, I knew she was lying. She only wanted attention thats all. I decided to ignore her mainly because I can't trust her anymore. I remember even my sister telling me lately that she was so happy when her dad left, and all what she's doing is just a play to make me listen and talk to her. I was fuming, I have never felt so betrayed. I try doing one good thing to someone and this is what happened. I ignored her for 3 weeks straight until we got to meet cuz my mother wanted to meet hers. She came to me and asked why I wasn't replying. I answered that I can't trust her anymore knowing that everything she said was nothing but lies trying to get my attention. She called me a piece of sh*t and that she will off herself. I've had enough of her bullcrap so I told her mother everything. And ever since I haven't heard anything about them. I've recently started thinking about it and asking myself if I was at fault and worried if she actually did it.

iydqc7c6	My boyfriend vapes. Constantly. Everyone knows it. He vapes in public, around his family...everywhere. I get it. Everyone is addicted to something. Not my favorite quality of his, but it is what it is. Not only that, his family, friends and myself have all tried to help him quit. He always goes back to it. He has no shame about smoking around anyone, anywhere.   Now that you have the back story, here's where I need help. His mother was in town, and she was getting onto me about drinking diet soda because it's got chemicals in it. Asking what happened to me and all with the poor choices of drinking diet soda...I got tired of it, and said "Well your son is a smoker, we all have bad habits". She knows full well He smokes and has tried to help him quit. He got furious that I called him a smoker. I just don't get it. He will vape around anyone, but if it is pointed out, we are in the wrong.

56v7l3j6	I have been violently throwing up for the majority of the night from 1am - 4am I was alternating between the bathroom and the couch. I am running on a maximum of three hours of sleep and still fairly nauseous. Around 9am my boyfriend goes to the store since Sunday is his day to cook. He got home around 10:30 and started cooking while I had moved to the bedroom to try to sleep some more (ended up watching a movie).  He was downstairs cooking for awhile and around 2 I felt ok enough to go downstairs and make a cup of tea and try to help cook. He was almost done with everything so I just helped clean up and keep the kitchen tidy for him.  We finish up everything around 4pm and chill on the couch to watch some LoL and relax. We watch a few games and I go upstairs to switch out the laundry from the washer to the dryer and he follows me saying he wants to “do it”. I am still not feeling 100% so I’m like “ehhhh I’m good” and he starts to chase me in good fun saying “I’m horny let’s do it!” I end up running away laughing and trip trying to open a door to “escape”  We then both have a laugh and head back downstairs to resume watching Twitch and chilling. We come back in between games and I suggest we go outside to play with our dog while he has a cigar. Before we go outside I grab a glass of water and show him the leggings I’m wearing and ask “are these the type of high wasted leggings you like?” Referencing a conversation we had about him liking high wasted leggings and thinking I didn’t have any (this was the first time since that conversation I had worn leggings so I thought I would bring it up) He then proceeds to say “you know I’m horny why would you do that? You’re a piece of shit for doing that to me” I was like “what? Why are you calling me a piece of shit I haven’t done anything?”  “You’re enticing me when you know I want to do it and that makes you a piece of shit” I tell him I wasn’t enticing him and he says you can’t tell me how to feel that is what you did.  I tell him it wasn’t my intention to “entice” him just ask if these are the types of leggings he was referring to and proving that I did own them He than says “fuck you for doing that to me you don’t have any testosterone and don’t know how this feels”(which is true. I don’t have testosterone and don’t really know what it feels like to be so horny that the sight of leggings and skin would drive me over the edge) I tell him he’s over reacting and getting mad over something innocent and It wasn’t my intention to entice him.  He says “it’s like you waving a piece of wagyu steak in front of me and say I can’t have any and that makes you a piece of shit and fuck you for saying that’s not how I feel”  He then gets up (we were outside at this point) and continues to watch the games without me.  I go back inside and I tell him that he has solidified that he won’t be getting any sex anytime soon and go upstairs to shower.  So AITA for “enticing” my boyfriend?	1642981809.0	sb7mqe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7mqe/aita_for_enticing_my_boyfriend/	AITA for “enticing” my boyfriend?
grpcyd1b	For context, I started getting into 80's show animatronics (think "The Rockafire Explosion") through a friend of mine. One thing led to another, and we've began making a game after joining forces with another person. (For privacy's sake, the first friend will be called Nick, and the second person will be called Ellie.)  Making my own game has been a life long dream of mine, and I'd honestly never thought I'd be doing this. There's one problem though, I severely dislike Ellie.   They've done close to nothing that they've promised to do, and anything they have done, I've had to redo because its horrendous.   Basically, it's just Nick and I doing the work, while I have to patch up anything that Ellie's designed. Obviously, I don't want to be harsh and get upset at Ellie, but I'm meant to be on holiday right now, and it's been nothing but work.  I've been wanting to talk to Nick about this, but I don't want to cause drama, or seem like an a\*\*hole for disliking them, but I'd much rather do something once and do it right, than someone else do it and then I have to redo it.  So the question is, would I be an asshole if I talked to Nick about possibly removing Ellie?  Also sorry for any formatting/spelling and grammar errors, I've lost my glasses.	1642981896.0	sb7o1i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7o1i/wibta_if_i_were_honest/	WIBTA if I were honest?
iycay2ex	This guy I've known for a while is stressing me out. I like him, but I don't know if he likes me and I am too scared to ask. I've asked out 10-15 men in my life and they all said no.  He's walked me home in the rain before, baked me desserts, and asked me to watch movies with him at his house. I asked him to be my +1 at an event today and he said yes.  However, I'm already really stressed by other things in my life and he's just adding to it. I'm thinking of avoiding him as a way to alleviate it.

x7kgy	So I'm in several meme groups on facebook and in one I made a meme about my boyfriend and how he really seems to only make small talk with me. Nothing rude or mean just that I am sick of small talk and that I find it pointless. I just wanted a post to talk to people about their significant others and their experiences with similar situations . However over 80% of all the people who commented on the post started tearing me apart with comments like 'put your big girl panties on and stop making memes' or 'grow the fuck up and talk to him like an adult'. I got kind of flustered and really angry so I deleted the post.  I figured that was the end of it but a few people who commented on the deleted post tracked down my post history in the group and started attacking me again on a different meme I made about an ex that was from 4 months ago. They demanded to know if this was the same boyfriend; then one of them called me a fucking clown and used the clown emoji a bunch of times. I ignored it after that and one of the admins of that group PMed me and said he would take care of it. I guess he kicked the people from the group he didn't specify I thanked him and went about my business.   I decided to make a meme in another group unrelated to the first one about the incident for a cheap laugh. You would not have known it was my post unless you were in the first group and knew my name as I was very vague in the meme. So people were asking me what the context was and before I had the chance to answer the chick who called me a fucking clown came out of nowhere. She started telling people the context making it out like I am some huge asshole and how I don't deserve my bf, that I need to stop making memes about it and let it go. I blocked her immediately and someone called her out for stalking me as she had just joined the group today.   I'll openly admit I should have talked to my bf about the small talk irritating me and some of the not mean comments were giving me actual advice on how to change the conversations to get off the small talk. But I feel like as someone who enjoys making memes I should be allowed to complain about my life through memes. I don't think I deserved to be stalked and called a fucking clown however.  &#x200B;  Before anyone asks I deleted the original meme in question at some point as I cannot find it anywhere on my phone.  &#x200B;  TL;DR I made a meme about my bf and got harassed over it by multiple people and then stalked by one of them in another group I am in after they called me a fucking clown.	1642981983.0	sb7p5e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7p5e/aita_for_making_a_meme_about_my_boyfriend/	AITA for making a meme about my boyfriend?
7bq115b9	So here's the context:  It have been in Twitter since 2018, my reason to be there was because I wanted to be popular (As I was always the unpopular/invisible kid). My friend on the other hand is pretty popular, he's among the "popular kids" is well known to other classes, is complemented by teachers and stuff.  And ever since I became his friend...I got compared often to him. Not by teacher but by my classmates, WHATEVER I did would be reason enough for them to go "Your friends does this better".  So then I thought: "If I can't be popular at school, might as well make myself popular on the internet" and decided to create a Twitter account.  And...it went decently...  Speaking from now I have currently 240 followers, yes a big number but took me 3 years to reach that.     Soon my friend found out I had a Twitter account and decided to create one too to follow me. I didn't think too much of it.  Next day he created his account and followed me, and soon he started posting his own stuff, like: videos, photos, drawings.  And the, 5 months later, we had reached 11k followers...  And I was...just so furious and pissed at him. Like, I've been for that site for 3 whole years!! Yet he stays there for 5 months and all of a sudden he deserves those 11K followers.  He went to celebrate his 11K with me throw Discord, but they I exploded. I said how he didn't deserve any of those 11K followers, how much I fought hard to reached the number he had gain for 5 months and that I should be the one with such numbers.  He got extremely upset, he ended the call with me and I cried my frustrations away.  The next day he blocked me on Discord, Twitter and WhatsApp. In my school group people say I'm a jerk who should be sorry for saying those words.  I feel bad but not enough to say sorry, because he always had the admiration and spotlights, and now that I said he didn't deserve them because he never worked hard to get them while I've been I'm the asshole?  So tell me, Am I the Asshole?	1642982453.0	sb7v7j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7v7j/aita_for_thinking_my_friend_doesnt_deserve_his/	AITA for thinking my friend doesn't deserve his followers because he's been on Twitter shorter then me?
iydpzuvz	In February of 2021 my partner, fiance, and father of my child left me in the middle of the night. I knew things hadn't been great for a while, but I also thought we were working on things. His major issue was that I didn't want to have sex with him, but it wasn't personal at all. I'd experienced severe trauma in the last 3 years, from nearly dying giving birth, to finding the strength to join a massive court case against a serial abuser. Yes, as a victim.  After our child was born, we raised her equally, and I constantly had to reassure her dad I was still attracted to him, but I just didn't want sex. He seemed to understand. One night, I was sent evidence he was sleeping with someone else. When I confronted him, he told me he didn't want me anymore. He left the next day. Over the next week, it came out he was sleeping with half a dozen people over the last year, and was telling everyone I was awful...while I was paying off the wedding. he later admitted he said that so he wouldn't look so bad. Now to the AITA. I couldn't speak to anyone for the first few weeks. I was devastated. I couldn't eat. I didn't know who I was, where I was, or why this was happening.  But one night I choked up the courage to call my oldest friend. She didn't answer, that's fine. I'm not the center of the universe. Over the next week she messaged me twice, and I didn't respond. I couldn't. I was in a self pitying bog of despair. We had been friends for years and often went silent when we were low, so I figured, given the circumstances, she would understand. Evidently not. After 2 weeks I messaged her saying I'm sorry, it's been a lot, and I just didn't feel up to responding.  Her response was to tell me "I cant do this anymore, you worried me, I'm done" and blocked me.  I was...mortified. no, I haven't put her through anything prior. She was also my child's godmother. And I absolutely tried to ask why she had come to that decision.   I'll tell you now. I sat on the floor and sobbed. I thought I'd run out of tears given the circumstances, but this just set me off again.	1642982107.0	sb7qmy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7qmy/aita_for_dropping_off_the_earth_for_a_bit_after/	AITA for dropping off the earth for a bit after my baby daddy left me, and all his indiscretions were still coming out?
32et5ib	My father recently passed away suddenly in NZ. I live on the other side of the world and I'm struggling with the loss. I live in a close-knit, small community far away from NZ and everyone expressed to me how sorry they were for my loss and that they were here for me. Since then, I haven't heard from any of my local friends. All I want is for someone to reach out to me and send me a msg along the lines of "hey man, are you okay? Do you want to go for a drink?". I went out tonight and saw some of my close friends and they asked me how I was doing. I'm normally a private person and don't open up much, but everyone tells me to be honest, so I am and I tell them I'm struggling. I think that's enough to tell them I need someone and still I hear nothing from them.

iyebfbd2	Last year my wife's parents sold their house and planned to move to a state they've never been to. They cashed in on a hot market, bought a camper and set up shop at our house. Originally they weren't going to bring over much, but when the move happened they brought with them three trucks (originally planned on 1), bought a new trailer (to everyone's surprise), kept their 4-wheeler (originally planned to sell this), and something like 70% of their house stuff which is stored everywhere from our garage to a shed out back and one of our guest bedrooms/bathroom. They also have a son who now lives with us. No one pays rent or helps with bills, and really only the mom of the family helps with stuff around the house.      On the first day they moved in my wife and her dad had a *very* bad fight - some stuff her dad said was pretty bad. He's been "dealing" with some anxiety which is why we've tried to be flexible, but ever since that fight there's been a weird stigma at our home. They also said they'd live with us for a few weeks and it's been about 5 months now. Their plan to move out of state is also moot now that they've visited - turns out they don't like it. :)      From my perspective we've given plenty of wiggle room for them to get their affairs in order, but it seems like no one really wants to do anything. In the mean time they are burning through their cash like crazy but still have enough to either pay rent or buy a house elsewhere... Plus it seems like this is just a lot for a young couple to deal with anyway... We are planning on moving in the next few months and so they'll have at least that long to come up with a plan.

We were reading a post about à man that said no to his wife when she wanted to go see her dying ex bf (who wanted sex).   And i was telling her that obviously op wife ex bf was being manipulative, and we got on a argue about « if a ex of you was texting you because he was dying and wanted sex, would you grant it? ». She asked me if i would let her, and i said no. She said that a ex of her done that, and she would let me, even if it would hurt her. Then, she explain me a scenario where she think it would be appropriate.   I asked her « do you think about one of your ex in particular? ». She said no, and got angry cause i ask, even if i know her story with her exs (they were toxic, and did horrible things to her). She hung up on me after telling me i was horrible.   She is angry now, i send her an excuse but idk.

iycxumtb	This was fairly rushed  I f42 has 2 daughters 18 and 13. My 18-year-old had just turned 18 on November 3rd so she's freshly 18. She gets really good grades so when she says she's going out with friends I trust and believe her. My daughter is a senior in high school and before she was 18 she wasn't going out with friends so when she all of a sudden started going out I was super happy for her. She all of a sudden started getting new things that were quite expensive but she has a job and she's good with saving so once again I was happy for her.   Anyway, my 13-year-old shares a computer with her sister because hers was broken but im getting her a new one for her birthday in a few weeks. My daughter came down to me and showed me a dating website and it was logged into. I knew it was my oldest daughter and I was concerned so I looked into her messages and ahe had lots of messages with people my age. She was sending inappropriate pictures or sleeping with them for money and they paid alot. I was hurt and upset because she was putting herself in danger and she was lying to me about what she was doing. When she came home I took away all her stuff and now im driving her to and from school. She is also doing all the chores to keep her busy because I can't trust her. She is now threatening to move out with some random guy she met and I don't know what to do.

iyczxwor	Currently typing this on my way to the honeymoon spot. I and my husband had been dating for about 6 years prior to our wedding. I'm a particularly clean person. I love to keep stuff tidy and neat. I also bathe regularly, making sure I never smell. I hate mess, bad smells, and untidiness. I get headaches when I smell bad scents.  My husband is sort of the opposite. Throughout our relationship, he hardly brushed his teeth. When we first started meeting and dating he did, probably to appear clean and attract me. But once he got comfortable around me I slowly realized that he rarely brushes. There was even a point in time I dreaded him leaning in to kiss me because of how awful his breath would smell all the time. I would tell him that I wanted him to brush his teeth and why all the time. He'd tell me he would, but never did and would complain that I never kissed him.  As frustrating as it was, it wasn't enough for me to break up with him since every other aspect of our relationship is great. Fast forward 6 years later and we're at our wedding.   After the "you can kiss the bride part" is over, he lowers his mask, leans in to kiss me, and I just get the most awful whiff of his breath. It smells like straight garbage and I just instinctively back away. He's confused, and I tap my cheek for him to kiss instead without saying anything. He awkwardly does, and everyone claps, giving me strange looks.   Afterwards, he demands to know what the hell had happened and I explain. He's furious, saying I had embarrassed him in front of all his friends and family on our wedding day over something as trivial as breath.  I tell him that if he had bothered to brush his teeth on our *wedding* day, this wouldn't have happened. He walks away angrily.  So I guess he explained everything to his mom, because now my MIL is saying I'm terrible for embarrassing her son like that. I really don't think I'm in the wrong for not wanting to kiss bad breath but I'm not sure anymore.

aga2ivq6	I, 15f, work in a small cafe every Saturday. I get paid enough for what I do and work 4 hours once a week. My boss, unknown m, often calls me late and asks me to work extra shifts during the holidays and also sometimes tells me to go home. Example : one Saturday he double booked me and one other staff member so made me work half an hour without pay before letting me go home. Not only that, but his staff consists of all teenagers (to keep costs down I assume) and we do all of the work apart from cooking (tips - despite claiming to be shared equally - are not). I have regularly witnessed the teenage staff dropping things on the floor and giving them to the customers anyway. This includes cutlery, and FOOD that has been DROPPED ON THE DIRTY FLOOR and put straight back on a plate and given to an unsuspecting customer. I don’t know what to do as I am just the pot washer and don’t want to “snitch” on a teenager just trying to earn some extra money.

iydsuf3o	AITA? My late husband 42 had a toxic family who only contacted him when they needed something. A job, money, legal help or whatever. He always gave them whatever it was they wanted if we had it to give. After both his parents died and a few rough years for the business he just was no longer able to “help” anymore so they pretty much ended all contact with him as he was no longer helpful. He tried to maintain a relationship for years but to no avail. I even begged his siblings to communicate more. We ended up having to move 6 hrs away for work and had lived there for almost a year when he had his accident. Mind you none of them had even spoken to him in over two years so they knew nothing of this move or life change for our family of six. Since the accident was so serious I sent a message to his siblings to let them know.  Doing so went against his wishes he had stated many times over the years. He did not want me to contact them at all if anything ever happened to him. Immediately drama started and expected me to let them stay in our home there while I stayed in ICU with my Hubby who was in a coma at the time. I had my children staying with friends 6 hrs away. The oldest was 17 and youngest 7. I had to stop telling sibs what was going on because due to exaggerated details they were telling everyone to have a story. After 2 weeks it was obvious Hubby was not going to recover from this and I had to withdraw care and let him go as heartbreaking as it was. His family immediately flipped out and started in on me. I was just his wife and not qualified or should make these decisions it should be them. I was just doing it for the money and so on. The entire situation was a nightmare as it was without their drama. It was so bad that our oldest had a horrible panic attack even maxed out on her meds. Mentioning them would send her into one. Because of this I asked that they not attend the funeral. My children did not want them there and neither did my husband. They ended up showing up with all their extended cousins and crashed my husbands funeral just to make a scene. One adult female even got in my 17 year old daughters face to hit her before one of my friends stepped in. Who does that? This cousin didn’t even know it was his daughter. So I had to have the cops called and them thrown out. My child has even told me she wouldn’t need therapy or meds to get through this if it was not for her fathers family.  Every decision I made the entire time from the accident to the funeral was to protect my children from as much pain and heartbreak as I could. As a mother I put them before me as I knew this is what my Hubby would have wanted.  AITA for putting my children before his siblings after all they done?	1642984039.0	sb8fjg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8fjg/aita_in_laws_edition/	AITA IN LAWS EDITION
iycay2ex	There's a guy I met through friends and a club who walked me home in the rain, baked stuff for me, and asked me to watch movies with him at his house. He also recently agreed to be my +1 at an event.  I felt stressed by all of this because I didn't know what his intentions were, so I called him a few minutes ago and asked him if he liked me.  He seemed extremely relieved and stated that he's liked me for years but never had the courage to do anything until recently.   I told him I was annoyed that he never said he liked me and wasn't more obvious and he apologized.   He asked me if he could take me out to dinner tomorrow just to talk everything over and hang out and I said, half-jokingly, but half-seriously, that I'd *maybe* go out with him if he'd be more forward and obvious in the future.	1642984092.0	sb8g6f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8g6f/aita_for_getting_upset_at_someone_for_not_being/	AITA for getting upset at someone for not being obvious/forward enough?
iyf2ygir	Okay, I need serious help. I know the title sounds bad, and maybe it is, but please hear me out. For a little context, I (27, f) have/had a wonderful fiancé (27, m). We had been together since college, and were each other’s rock thru everything. We had a few small issues along the road, but made it out just fine and loved each other all the same. Now, here’s the issue. My fiancé, we’ll call him Will, had AWFUL hygiene. This has been an issue since we first started dating, as I value hygiene and have multiple dedicated routines to make sure I’m as hygienic as possible. He never showered daily, didn’t wash his hands after using the rest room, had a 3+ month streak of not washing his hair at one point, hasn’t brushed his teeth in weeks, and that’s not even all of it.  Recently, we moved in and last year, were engaged. This is where it got really bad. He constantly smelled like an unwashed middle school wrestling mat, didn’t pick up after himself, and didn’t even buy soap/toothpaste when we moved in because he “didn’t need to”. It was disgusting. One day, we’re watching an ASU-UofA game when I almost puke from this vile smell that I couldn’t shake off. As you may have guessed, it was coming from Will. He was offended, and that’s when we broke out into a HUGE fight. I told him about all of it. I admit, I was very harsh, but I couldn’t live with it anymore. His scent made me PUKE, LITERALLY. I kicked him out, and after a talk with my friends I called him over in person to ask if we could put the engagement on hold. Remember, this had been a problem since we started dating, and I brought it up many times in a very polite and supportive manner to be brushed off with a cold, hard “no”.  There was always an excuse, always a reason he couldn’t. I couldn’t live with it anymore. Being around him turned into dread because the stench was so rancid. I wish I was over exaggerating. Now his family and friends are all reaching out to tell me off because I was “out of hand” or that my reaction was “out of pocket”. I don’t think it was. I think that he needs to get his shit  together, because I should not having to be telling my GROWN fiancé to shower more.

icw40san	 So for context, me and my friend are both 22 and in our last year of college. We became friends earlier this year after figuring out we both play PC games. She seemed hesitant at first, but I asked her if I could join her discord server and she said yes.     She used to have plenty of people who would get in discord parties with her and play with us, but recently those guys have played less and less (likely because they know that she’s been successfully courted by me, and that they have no chance).     Yesterday, I noticed she was online and not in the vc, so I sent her a message and asked if she wanted to play and I got no response. So today, in order to grab her attention, I jokingly said that I would cut my throat if she didn’t play with me.   She started crying and shoved me away and ran away. One thing that’s important to note is that I am not insane, I do not want to harm myself, I just thought it would make it more likely that she would play with me. She completely overreacted imo, but I have to ask am I the asshole for this?	1642984324.0	sb8jcp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8jcp/aita_for_threatening_to_harm_myself_if_if_my/	AITA for threatening to harm myself if if my friend didn’t play video games with me?

Okay, so the big mess of a story is on the link above. But basically, I(22F) found the mistress on Facebook, and I found her two daughters (20,27) as well.   Their dad already knows because my mom send him a message. He is absolutely devastated and doesn’t want her leaving (her plan was to leave in February). But while they were separated (I believe), I don’t know how much, if anything, they know of their mothers infidelity.   She says she loves my dad and wants to be with him.    I don’t know if it could help at all, but this is a giant mess. My mom is wanting to work it out, and maybe her kids knowing could affect her actions.   I could be the asshole for telling them about it if their parents don’t want them to know. But it does effect them just as much.	1642984362.0	sb8jty	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8jty/wibta_if_i_told_my_dads_mistresses_daughters/	WIBTA if I told my dad’s mistresses’ daughter(s) about their affair?

i9cyxiwa	I (24f) stay at home with my kid (3F) My boyfriend/her father (32m) hates kiddie tv with a passion.   I love certain Disney movies (I’m not a “Disney adult” I just like them now and again), and I really enjoy movies such as Tangled and the Incredibles. My kid watches these shows with me and loves them, and I love the fact that we have a similar interest so we can watch the same stuff and I can relax while she is also entertained.   My boyfriend disagrees. Before our daughter was born I never used to watch kids movies or shows, and now he finds it really unattractive that I keep watching them. If he comes home from work and finds me immersed in Frozen he gets really angry and says he feels like a p**do dating an adult with such childish interests.   We had a huge argument recently because my daughter and I watched encanto, and we kept singing “we dont talk about bruno”. My boyfriend said he can’t be attracted to someone who behaved like a child.   He says I spend too much time with our kid, so now I’m acting childlike and watching kid movies.    I don’t want to act like a little kid, but I enjoy watching cartoons with my daughter.	1642984599.0	sb8mna	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8mna/aita_for_watching_disney/	AITA for watching Disney ?
3cdufonv	So to start it off I met this guy a month into moving into college. I thought about fucking him but was immediately told he had a girlfriend. I backed off.  But the only things I heard about her from him were bad shit. When talking about his relationship he was always complaining tons of red flags.  She really didn’t allow him to have friends and required him to talk to her for a good 2-3 hours every night. He would often lie and say he was going to bed to come to hang out with me and my roommate or our other friends. Many nights he would come in and basically talk shit about her- about how she was being emotionally manipulative and difficult. Things, like her being mad at him but not telling him what he did and holding it over him, were quite common. He would often rant to me and my friends about her pissing him off for this or that.  We all agreed it sounded toxic but he insisted he would marry her and live happily ever after ect.  I offered to him. Said if ever broke up with her I'd be into fucking him. He said cool and we left it at that. While I was persuasive (possibly mildly manipulative) in cuddling him and asking if I could do things that were slightly beyond platonic, I did not initiate anything. He kissed me first. I stopped a minute into it and said “what about your girlfriend?” He didn’t seem to care. One thing led to another and we fucked twice that weekend. He texts me up the next day says he feels guilty and that we would need to stop.  Within the next weekend, we were back to fucking. We fucked for nearly three months. Alternating between only on the weekends and sometimes multiple times a day, he still continued to date the girlfriend through this. I thought if I fucked him he’d realize he didn’t like the girlfriend.  So I have major attachment issues and a crush on this man. He’s sleeping in my bed almost every night. We get to a point I’m having breakdowns quite consistently because he’s not treating me like a person anymore. We'd fuck and stuff but anything outside of that he wouldn’t hang out with me like a friend anymore even though he was in my room more than his.  When we were fucking everything was great he hold me and stuff but anytime outside of that he’d completely one-eighty like we barely knew each other. It was emotionally exhausting because I never knew what to expect.  I told one of our mutual friends about it who knew the whole situation and she had a talk with him that led to us not fucking anymore. He’s apologized and we’re on good terms but I still like him- I still want him. So I told him he should come clean to his girlfriend. Not for her sake, I personally don’t care for her but if he intends to marry her. He’s mentioned multiple times that if she finds out ever down the line their relationship is over.  We convinced him to tell her the next time he sees her over break. All I can think about is if she breaks up with him if maybe he’d go back to fucking me?

iyfecph9	Ok so  my self and my best friend (we’ll call her Sarah) decided to do our school play together while doing so i started talking to this one guy( we’ll call him Alex)in the show and Sarah and Alex got super close, like they were real touchy and everything but i didn’t think much of it as they assured me that they were just friends. So now Alex and I started dating and Sarah and him  are still super close friends. It started making me a little questionable between them so i asked both of them to of course still be super close friends and everything but to respect some boundaries like not flirt basically. After that they didn’t respect the no flirting boundary i ended up breaking up with him but assured them both it was just because i lost feelings(which was a lie ) so now he’s my ex and they are still flirting and i haven’t talked to Sarah  for a couple days and she keeps asking me why i’m mad . She doesn’t see any wrong with it and it’s driving me crazy because itd be totally different if it was her and not me in the situation.

a65geviv	This might require a lot of backstory so here goes. Im 15, my brother is 17 turning 18 soon. My brother (I'll call him Steve, not real name) is autistic and has ADHD. This combination makes him a unique case, at least I think. He's overall a self centered asshole that doesn't care about you or you needs, just wants what he wants. He invades my space but I'm not allowed to do anything about it, he breaks everyone's stuff and doesn't care, and when he doesn't get his way, he goes into extreme screaming and angery yelling fits. Not cartoons autistic, but more of a "go f*** yourselves, I hope you die" to my parents kinda way.  He's accepted to college, and plans to be an auto journalist (like top gear) but plans to stay here for the first 2 years.  I'll admit I've not been the best to him, so in that regard I am the asshole. Honestly as much as it pains me to say, I've never liked him. Maybe that's part of why he's such an ass. But last night my parents sat me down to have a talk. They know I have plans of joining the army right out of high school, and after that pursuit of a welding career, and said that they will look after my brother for the time being until I'm on my feet after all that. But then they said that they want me to take him in and be basically his parents for the rest of his life., or mine, whichever ever ends first (their wording). After 12 years of constant conflict with him, I don't want to, and there is no way he would like that either (they haven't told him about the plan).  After clearly saying that he needs to either figure it out himself or be their burden, but not mine, they flipped out saying I've always been the "insurance", and that now I'm taking the rug out from under them. Calling me a regret and disappointment. I cared about him from a brother standpoint for my whole life, but the idea if leading a life of my own seems impossible to do with him being a constant pain on me like he was/is for my parents. I want to marry one day, what woman would marry someone with a selfish, asshole roommate that can not and will not leave.   TL;DR - my brother is difficult to say the least, and my parents call me an ass for refusing to preemptively take him into my care for the rest of my life.	1642984822.0	sb8pch	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8pch/aita_my_parents_want_me_to_look_after_my_brother/	AITA - My parents want me to look after my brother for the rest of my life
eavs2fvh	So my sister has all ways been the favorite sibling. She get whatever she wants and if she does not she will hit, scream, and have a full blown tantrum. Today I was working and just got done with a busy 5 hour shift and my dad was picking me up. I always get my dad a drink. She wanted a drink to but I told her that i just want to go home. She is always want a hard to make drink and thinks I should be her servant. She started a full blown meltdown and was giving me the silent treatment. When that did not work she started to cry and screamed at me to make her a drink. I told her to knock it off. She shut up but later my dad told me that I "hurt her feelings" and that I NEED to make her a drink. I told him no I am tired and if she wants she could pay for her drink. So that my coworkers could make it. My dad got mad at me and said that I ether make her drink or I am grounded and he is taking my Xbox. I said you could take my Xbox i payed for it and she could pay for the drink. I got told to go to my room. So that it where I am at the moment waiting to see if I get grounded or something.	1642985018.0	sb8rzg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8rzg/aita_for_not_getting_my_sister_a_drink/	AITA for not getting my sister a drink

8lrukgs0	I, 30(F) lived with my mother up to age 17. I got put under my father his custody (murder attempt). About 2 months after I turned 18 he asked me to leave because his girlfriend could not stand me.  I moved back to my mum for 3 months, had another murder attempt and have since been living on my own.   For 27 years I believed it was all my fault until they made me realize I am not responsible for my father or mother as a child.   I haven't had contact with my "dad" in 12 years. I now know how bad of a father he was. He refused to learn me to drive a car, or a bike. He never came to my hobby competitions or never wanted to play with me. (Yes, I have a sibling -28M- with who he did all do that).  My brother is saying I need to apologize to my father. I am refusing to do so because after all, it is my dad (I don't call him that anymore btw) who treated me like he did not want me.  And he has actually said that. When he was on the phone with my mum I accidently heard their conversation and he said: What aboug (OP's name)? I never wanted kids back then.   I cut my mother off contact last year. It took me alot of years to get on my own feet and last year I fulfilled my dream of starting my own dog breeding. When the pup was born my dog gave no milk so my mum told me to kill the pup and that my brother was right about not having contact with me anymore so I fulfilled her wish.   With christmas my grandpa (only person of my family I still see) he begged to have a family together. Meaning my mum, brother, my bf and me. I agreed.  Christmas went fine until my boyfriend asked me why my mum and brother had to make it so clear they are disgusted of me.  My brother kept bragging that he has a house (my grandpa paid for it), a car (my dad & mum paid for it) and a gf (for a whole 7 months) and how I was still renting (I'm renting because I plan on moving to my bf's homecountry but I am not leaving my grandpa).   Ofcourse after christmas I cut off ties again. But thats where it started going wrong.  My brother is texting and calling me daily that I should apologize to my dad and mum. After all they did alot for me (my dad forced me to stop school! I eventually finished on my own)  I told him no and he now got my grandpa involved.   My grandpa knows my mum has tried to kill me 3 times and what my dad did but he is now just saying: they are still your parents.  To him I said I would think about it.   I really am choking on the thought of apologizing to either.  My brother says I'm an entitled selfish b****.

h5akno2i	A little background:  My wife ( 29 F ) grew up in a strict religious house, she was verbally, mentally and physically abused, alongside her 4 sisters, till she was around 22  years old.  During our second year of dating, she told me all about the abuse and how it affected her, and so many things made sense because there were alot of signs that I noticed indicating abuse. Since then I lost l respect for her parents whom she still had a relationship with! But out of respect for her, I never meddled.   Fast-forward to last year, I was on my way to pick her up from her parents house. And I see her outside waiting for me with a panicked face. She got into my car and told me to speed up and leave. When I asked her about it, she was shaking and she told me that she had a small dispute with her older sister, in which her sister put her hands around her neck almost strangling her. Her sister never even realized what she was doing. I wanted to get back to the house to confront her sister, but my wife begged me not to. For about a year, they never spoke. I was glad because I don't want to see my wife hurt in any way. And even though they weren't speaking, they would still see each other on family gatherings. Her sister has a kid ( whom she never hit whatsoever so no worries there or I would've called the cops on her ) and so my wife's nephew was the reason why she never minded seeing her sister because she loved spoiling him. Now her sister wants to reconcile, and she apologized for her Unspeakable behavior about a thousand times. My wife is really considering forgiving her sister for what she did, which caused a dispute between us. I don't want them to reconcile! I have zero respect for her sister because out of everyone, after all the abuse they all had to endure from their parents, she should've known better to control herself!!   My wife is currently mad at me for asking her not to reconcile, and for insisting that they shouldn't be on speaking terms, but I don't think she is in the right here. But I can also be wrong.

ixad2wg6	So i have an old dog she’s 12. My sisters dog recently turned 1 and isn’t that well trained. Her dog and my dog get along but sometimes she’s too much for my dog and doesn’t really know when to stop playing. Her play methods are biting her legs, jumping on her etc.  Recently my dog injured her leg and has been limping. I’ve tried to keep her from running around, walking the stairs etc. My sister called my yesterday and asked if she could come over and bring her dog. I told her that she could come over, but i don’t want her dog to come because of my dogs injury.   That sent my sister into a meltdown. First she was like “why do you always act like my dog is the devil??”. I told her i didn’t think that i just didn’t want her here causing extra stress to my dog. Then she assumed i was making my dogs leg injury out to be more than it was just so i’d have an excuse to tell them they couldn’t come. I told her that wasn’t true either and that she needs to relax.

9tjfyayd	My (42f) daughter (19f) is very insecure about her looks. She blames her looks for everything that goes wrong in her dating/ social life. For example when she doesn’t get invited to a party or if a guy rejects her. She’s also rather whiny about everything in general. I offered to send her to therapy in an effort to help manage her negative emotions. When she turned 18 I offered to get her cosmetic surgery if she wanted. She was happy about it but my husband was furious with me because he wanted her to try therapy. Now to be honest, my daughter is no beauty. She’s a little below average. She has a big nose, thin lips and a rather huge jaw. I have never said any of this to her and always told her that she looks nice. Even though I’m positive to her face, I do believe that her looks have held her back. I myself was rather unattractive as a child and I remember how I was treated. I have learned that what you look like is very important. All these feel good slogans about inner beauty are complete bullshit. It’s important to be practical. So, we soon found her a therapist. After the first session, this female tells us that my daughter has “BDD”(body dysmorphic disorder). I completely lost it. I told her to stop feeding my daughter delusions and that we both know that my daughters insecurities aren’t unfounded. This woman tried telling me that “well I think she’s very pretty”. Oh yeah? Could she ever be a model? Or could she be a movie star? I told my daughter that she either has to accept that she isn’t pretty and focus on other aspects of her life, or she needs to get cosmetic surgery. My daughter was very happy that I was honest. My husband on the other hand thinks that I’m being too superficial.	1642985778.0	sb91bd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb91bd/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_shes_not_pretty/	AITA for telling my daughter that she’s not pretty and that she should accept it?
7j8r43yv	TLDR: boyfriend was secretly texting ex and when I confronted him about it he left and ended the night in jail for public intoxication. We also just signed a lease. WIBTA if I kick him off the lease?   This is a wild one so buckle up. Sorry if it's too long.   Background:  My boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) have been together for a little over a year. I have my own place but I "moved in" with him about 3 months after getting together. I'm still in a lease at my original apartment so it's basically just been an expensive storage unit/back up plan. We recently decided to move in together officially, and just last week signed a lease to a new place that is perfect. I'm in love with this new apartment.   Since we are moving soon, and this is the first "adult apartment" we would have, I wanted to host a house warming party. I have it set for February 26th.  This is where the story begins. I was looking at my Facebook group where I had the party, and was looking through the guests. My boyfriend had invited someone (Sammy F) that I didn't recognize. I decided to investigate her profile, and looked at some pics from two years ago and found out they dated.   I confronted my boyfriend as soon as he got home from work and we had a huge fight. To be honest I don't even remember a lot of it. I guess he invited her by mistake? But he fessed up that they have been talking for several months. "Nothing happened though I swear!!!! " he told me. I retaliate with "then why did you feel the need to keep it a secret?"  Now I'm all types of lost. We have previously talked about letting the other one know if one of is talking to an ex.   The argument ended with him storming out shouting that he's going to go see /vent to my cousins (they're close). I just sat at home and basically waited for him to text me. Finally after a few hours he texts me that he's going to stay the night at my cousins place. Fine, whatever.   My aunt calls me about an hour later saying that my boyfriend got arrested and is sitting in jail. Oh my god. Are you kidding me??? And to be honest this isn't the first boyfriend I've had end up in jail 🤮😩 but that's a story for another time.   He was just there overnight for basically being rowdy/public intoxication and got out this morning. He came home and again we fought, and it ended with us not speaking to each other.   I have no idea how to navigate next steps. We signed a lease together for my dream apartment. Is there a way for me to salvage this relationship? Or is he just useless and I should leave him and kick him off the lease? I do love him, but I'm not sure I can trust him again after he kept such a thing a secret.... Then became so rowdy he went to jail???? I think I should kick him off the lease, but that could leave him homeless. His family is states away and he doesn't really have any friends locally. I feel like I shouldn't deny him shelter.

9q4dudyo	Not a parent, and my parents are deceased. But... my occasional lunch group likes to text "Happy Mother's Day/Father's Day!"greetings and chatter about it and ping everyone every few minutes about it and it gets me down.  Some of them are parents, and some are fortunate to have living parents. So, "Happy Mother's Day/Father's Day" is relevant for them, because they have children or living parents who can treat them/be treated to hugs n' kisses and dinner and whatever suits them. That's a-OK with me... people can celebrate it the way they want to.  What I don't like or want is the constant "ping" reminder on my own phone because it just reminds me of my loss. I miss my parents dearly, and I don't want to feel that pang of loss twice a year because a group is gleefully sending greetings to each other and I just happen to be part of that group.    One of the group's father had died a month before Father's Day, and sure enough, the group "Happy Father's Day!" pings went out on schedule. I was mortified. I know they all mean well, but it seems they don't understand the "rub it in" factor of this.   I'd gone so far as to shut off texting completely on my phone on those days.

Anyway, he had a lot of mental health issues and cancer as well so I'm so scared he's gone and that he didn't just block me, I'd be so happy if he just hated me right now, well, I'd be sad but it's better than thinking he's not alive.	1642986076.0	sb95gb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb95gb/aita_for_being_a_bitch_to_my_exboyfriend/	AITA for being a bitch to my ex-boyfriend?
iygc7za1	 My wife is an avid reader, her interest is mostly historical fiction/and mystery. She reads during the day which I don't have an issue with since she's a sahw and has plenty of time to pass and I work 8+ hours everyday.   My issue is that she starts reading during nighttime which is the only time I get with her. I'm not talking about dinner together and chilling on the couch but when in bed. Instead of talking to me and asking me about my day she'd put her glasses on and grab her book and start reading. I find it a bit rude of her to ignore me while I'm right next to her. I told her she should reconsider reading while I'm around and she looked at me confused. I explained to her that I find it rude of her to ignorey presence in the room let alone the bed and focus on reading. I suggested she quit reading during this time and just read during the day when she by herself and with 0 distractions. She laughed me off but after seeing how seripus I am especially after I said I'd ban the books from the room, she argued that I had no right to tell her when and when not to read but I wasn't dictating anything, I was just pointing out how unsuitable I find her timing. She told me off and said there's no excuse for me to object to her reading since we get enough time to talk during dinner and our couch time. I obviously pissed her off because she stopped talking to me because "I was being too much" and she needed to finish reading so she went to the other room.  AITA for what I told her or did she get offended for no reason?	1642986345.0	sb98yi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb98yi/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_stop_reading_during/	AITA for asking my wife to stop reading during nighttime?
iygpnh9o	So me (19) and my boyfriend (20) met at work and are now dating. The only reason people at work know were dating really is because sometimes she show up together and leave together if we have the same shifts. We never show PDA at work or really even pay attention to each other that much at work.   The other day my manager texted me when i was at home and asked where my boyfriend was because he was supposed to be at work. I found this weird because why would he just text him, but not too weird because like i said we show up together a lot. I told him i wasn’t with him and to text him instead.   Yesterday though was where it got weird. My manager came up to me at work and asked if we were going to move in with each other. I was like “oh haha i don’t know about all that yet…”. Then he said “Well just know that young relationships almost never work. Keep that in mind when you guys are all lovey dovey in your car at break. Teen pregnancy will ruin you”   That caught me off guard at first. I guess it showed in my face because he kind of chuckled and told me to loosen up. I said “i’ll loosen up when you stop acting like creep” and kind of just walked away.  Later my other coworker told me i can’t talk to him like that because he’ll start cutting my shifts for being rude towards him, because he’s done that to other people before. He also supposedly told my boyfriend about the interaction (my manager), because my boyfriend , who wasn’t at work that night told me that he was just joking and i cant just go around calling people creeps.	1642987058.0	sb9hhh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9hhh/aita_for_telling_my_manager_to_stop_acting_like_a/	AITA for telling my manager to stop acting like a cree
hyguoogc	I know this title sound bad but listen for a second. My ex (we going to name her Lily) dated for a week and a half. It was good at first then she went insane. My best friend (we are naming her Jennie) and I are very close. We been besties since 3rd grade. Me and lily broke up because she was rude to my friends (she was convinced I likes Jennie) and she made me uncomfortable after sending me a pic of her with a shirt or bra on. I told her I did not like it and pls don’t send me pictures like that since I don’t like stuff like that. Anyway after the break up here is where the chaos started. She been getting her friends to text me on all social platforms and keep saying that I asked lily to send a pic like the pic she sent me but she said no. I can tell u IN DETAIL what the pic was. (I won’t because I don’t want to be attacked but still). She won’t stop harassing me and today when she made another account I told her she was a obsessive liar who could not stop bugging me and keep spreading lies. I want to tell the police but I would get in trouble with my mom since I can’t date till I am out the house.

etpuzr0s	Okay so this happened a few summers ago but I’ve always wanted outside opinions that weren’t our friend group. Summer if 2019 I was going through a really bad divorce with a really abuse ex and we have 2 kids together. Needless to say I was not in the right state of mind and to top it off I left so quickly to get away from the scary abuse that all I took with me was my clothes and my kids clothes in trash bags. We moved into my parents and I started working that month again but had no money to my name before that because I was a stay at home mom.  Now to the actual story..I (23 F at the time) and one of my best friends (also 23 F at the time) decided to get in my parents pool. Both of my kids were down for naps and I had the monitor out with us so I could go get them when they got up. I keep my towel by the pool with my phone in it so it doesn’t over heat in the sun, she asked me to put hers in it too. I heard my son wake up and we both got off our floats and BOTH removed our phones from my towel..for some odd reason she put her phone back in the towel (still to this day I don’t know why)  and when I got out and picked the towel up the phone dropped in the pool. I immediately jumped back in the pool got the phone out and ran to get her a bag of rice. I was super apologetic and felt really bad and in the heat of the moment I did say I’d reimburse her. She was extremely rude and cold towards me and was saying things like “you have no money and can’t pay me anything” “you’ll need to take out of your savings I guess”.  She left and her and her parents went to the store and they bought  her a new phone. She then took a picture of the bill which was $600. After talking to my family and our mutual friends they all were like uhh this is literally her fault and if anything 50/50. So I venmoed her $300 and basically said I didn’t want to be friends anymore because of the way she acted after the fact. So, years later and she’s completely out of the friends group from this situation ( I will say this was the cherry, many things happened leading up to it for all of us) but AITA in this situation?	1642987864.0	sb9rc4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9rc4/aita_for_accidentally_dropping_my_friends_phone/	AITA for accidentally dropping my friends phone in the pool and not paying for it
fzgwjbhx	So, a little backstory, my name is Justin, I am in middle school in 8th grade. I don't have that many friends and I am kind of a loser to everyone. But when first quarter started, I met a kid named Ivan in my 4th period music class. He was cool at first and always only talked to me. He was into anime, and videogames. But he was also very vindictive and didn't support my dreams and told me that everything I did was "cringe." But I didn't mind at the time nor cared because he was the only person who would talk to me in school, everyone else that went there just talked to me on discord. But even so, we agreed on alot of things. We eventually added eachother on discord, but he always kept spamming me to get online. I wasn't bother by it at first. But then after a few days after I added him on discord, he ended up trying to convince me to join his chat group full of nsfw images. I felt extremely uncomfortable with this. So I tried to explain it to him that I'm not into that kind of stuff. He acted as if I was wrong for not liking it, and he basically tried lying in the main group chat with all of my friends. Saying that I was the one sending those pics. Me and him had a heated discussion in the group chat, which resulted in me lashing out at him, telling him that he's an awful friend, and that all he does is shame me for trying to change myself, and he spams me on a daily basis for no reason. After I said that he basically had a, "How dare you" moment, and started acting really cringy attempting to act like an anime character. Even worse, I knew he played Danganronpa ALLLLL the time, so this wasn't a suprise to me. He kept bitching and moaning and spamming me and my friends. I ended up blocking him the next morning. A few days after, he didn't speak to me or approach me at all. But a few weeks ago, I noticed something weird about Ivan. When I got my first quarter report card, at the end of class when everyone was dismissed, he got up, and legit shoved his report card in my face. Sorta like a "Gotcha! I have better grades then you!" I was extremely confused at the moment. And also a few days ago during 6th period, I tried to get to class as fast as I could, and Ivan was in front of me in the building, with me on the outside. He legit stared at me and waited for me to climb the stairs, holding the door open. Then as soon as I got to the door, he slammed it in my face. On purpose.  &#x200B;  Am I the asshole?	1642988185.0	sb9v25	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9v25/aita_for_ditching_my_friend/	AITA for ditching my friend?
92xd04az	I (25F) am engaged to my fiancé (26M) (Zach) whose sister (24F) is getting married to her fiancé (32M). My fiancés little sister (let’s call her Rachel) has been dating her fiancé (let’s call him Bob) for 6 years, 4 of those which were in secret. Bob came to their country 8 years ago on a student visa and became friends with Zach first as they met through church. They became friends and Bob would even come to their house to hang out with Zach, which he later found was actually to secretly see Rachel. They kept their relationship a secret for 4 years, and then finally revealed their relationship to Zach. Zach was furious and was completely unaccepting of their relationship. He felt betrayed and hurt that they had been sneaking around behind their back and because of the age difference as she was only 18 when they started dating. To make matters worse, whenever they were around him they would be all over each other making him even angrier.  Zach finally started coming around to the idea around the same time that him and I started dating. Fast forward 3 years and now Zach and Bob have repaired their friendship, as Bob and Rachel are getting married and Zach has come to terms that this is the best thing for their family dynamic and he appreciates how well Bob treats Rachel. Their parents love Bob as well and see him as their own son. I cant help but feel a little strange about the whole situation. I cant help feel weird that they started dating when she was only 18 but likely were talking/flirting when she was underage. It also bothers me that he used his friendship with Zach as a reason to see Rachel and come to their house. It makes me nervous about having him around my future kids. I've been wanting to have this conversation with Zach but I don't want to bring this up if its not valid.

db7pxkg0	Okay so the title is pretty self explanatory but here is some more in depth about the situation…   My two friends have been sleeping together for MONTHS and I only recently found out. The problem is my one friend has a girlfriend, who he has told us tons of stories about her being super emotionally abusive and talking shit. I’ve always urged him to break things off but he’s told me before he feels like he needs her in a way, because he claims she saved him?   I have heard some things she’s said to him and witnessed some very weird interactions, but other than that he’s very hot cold about her. My other friend has always expressed their feelings of wanting to sleep with him, but he has always just kind of brushed it off.   When I found out I almost went ahead and told his girlfriend, but my dad and some mutual friends urged me not to get involved. I’ve since, along with the friend who’s been sleeping with him, basically forced him to tell her but he says he can’t until he sees her. (We are in college and she’s back home in her senior year. We are freshman)  I feel bad for her and I want to tell her; but I only have these three friends and I’m scared to lose them from the single fact of it’s very hard for me to make friends period. So, WIBTA for telling his girlfriend myself? Or should I just leave it alone since it’s ‘none of my business’ ?  Also, I consider said cheating friend a brother to me and I have never condoned his actions.	1642988670.0	sba12l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba12l/wibta_for_telling_my_friends_gf_that_hes_cheating/	WIBTA for telling my friends gf that he’s cheating?
8q2xxu71	Hi all, I'm a bit confused by recent events. I (28M) recently did some electrical work for a couple that my wife (32F) has known as close family friends since she was little. They're close enough that my wife considers them an an aunt and uncle, and they're close enough as to have made our wedding cake for us.   For context, I work  full time as a firefighter and paramedic in a fairly high income area and make pretty good money. My wife, however, does something highly specialized and makes approximately 3x what I make.   I've helped this couple out with some electrical issues before and solved it for them without an issue. They asked me to install a charger for their newly purchased electric vehicle and I told them I'd be happy to do so.   I went and Installed the charger, and then checked to confirm that everything was working as it should which it was. They went to pay me for my work, and I told them to Instead of paying me for my labor, since we're just fine on money, to donate it to a charity that I travel to Haiti with to run Medical clinics (local charity that I'm not super comfortable sharing but will of asked), the Trevor project, or to one that matters to them.  I later received a message that they were mad that I not only refused the money, but suggested that they donate the money instead of keeping it or doing anything whatever they'd like with the funds that I refused.

dgl2jh65	I moved in with good friends in 2020 and got settled into a long lease. We're nearing end of year two and I'm leaving early.  My roommates are an unmarried couple (they are wives, for the lack of legal attachment) and it's not healthy for me anymore. I just got keys to a new place today, and my move I will be in the end of February/Beginning of March.  This would leave the roommate that makes 100kish a year to pay an extra 1400 or so dollars on the space after I move out. (Two months of rent, as I pay 600 + 100 utilities, a month.)  I want to preserve what's left of our friendship, and me moving out is actually therapist approved. Like, we're gonna have a good healthy discussion on how I can learn to leave situations before it gets to be a flight or fight response.   I hope me giving my thirty days doesn't mess up the end of the lease for them, but, also, that's not my issue of my housing there isn't in my best interest.

e8lbl857	Ok. Fist of all, this is not one situation. It's been an entire lifetime of this; so the post might be quite long.   Recently, I (16 M) have been getting thrashed (notice I don't say "discussing or arguing") by my mother. This discussions, from my point of view, are because she keeps being the same way as always, but now I can notice what's wrong with her raising. This because I've been having social studies subjects on my high school.   What does she does? Well, she lied about her life, asking for top grades while saying she was the perfect student with a scholarship of 90% on the best university of the country, both things because my dad did all her math homework from 9th grade till' the end of high school; and failing several times several subjects. She also said she started working to "be independant". She started working to pay her comeback exams an private lessons. She doesn't give a fuck about what we say, think or feel. We must say, think or feel what she says so we don't get in troubles. She takes away whatever she wants, whenever she wants and for how long she wants, even if we bought it with our money or she has to break promises and fail to her words to do it. She never respects deals, and does whatever she wants because "it's my house and you can get the fuck out if you don't like it". She invades our privacy, demanding to know all our passwords (including google accounts and cellphones). She monitorizes our online activity 24/7. She even kidnapped my Nintendo account and I can't have the password. When we "discuss", it's just a two hour long monologue of why she's right and we are all assholes. She swears at us and we can't even rise the volume or answer. After that, she's passive-agressive with us and then she acts as if nothing happens. We can never question whay she says because "I don't make mistakes, I'm 27 years older than you and I'm your mom. You must obey me" She has given everything material and her time, but not her emotions or person. This is a panoram of me and my brothers (14 M and 8 M). I've been starting thinking this is all wrong because of my social studies subjects. I've even visited a psicologist because of an incident in which, basicaly, she got mad at me for not being offended for what she says I must be offended; and she said, and I quote: "I can see you are quite fine. Your mother's the one who worries me". She was supposed to have a session with her, but we haven't know anything of that psicologist since then. She says not to "contaminate my brothers's minds with my red bullshit" when I tell that she is not what she says she is. I have been trying to resist, for the thre status quo's sake, and I am well known for being patient; but my patience has a limit and recently I've been  closer and closer to explode.   So, AITA for losing the respect towards her and tginking she has serios issues? P. D.: Feel free to ask more about the psicologist's incident or other similar situations.	1642988737.0	sba1wh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba1wh/aita_for_hating_my_mother/	AITA for hating my mother?
iyhfdxzb	I’m a 25f and my fiancé is 33m, we have a 2 year old son together and ever since he was born it’s been absolute hell from his mother.   My son was born a month before COVID hit and me being a new mother and a newborn baby didn’t really want to to travel a whole lot especially with not knowing what was happening with the pandemic and she got mad and lashed out on me , putting words in my mouth and guilting me into visiting her, which is a 2 hour drive away in the middle of winter, all out of her jealousy and needing my son to love her more then anyone else.   That happened a lot over the first year , and we had many spats and arguments. She even took it to the extent of being in a fight with my fiancé and her daughter, which I wasn’t physically there for or involved in, in anyway and she texted me calling me every name in the book and being extremely crazy and horrible towards me. I held that for a month before my fiancé decided we made our point and we went back to a normal.   Fast forward another year and we’re out for a visit over a weekend, she was doing a lot I didn’t agree with, she would give my son her phone and put it on a stand right in front of his face and she’d have him there for hours if we’d leave her alone. She wouldn’t cut up his fruit which especially grapes have to be cut but she treats him like he’s 5 and at this point he wasn’t even 2. She would give us ultimatums with our own son, and she tries to act like what we say doesn’t matter. She doesn’t let us parent our own child and I finally had enough and told her to stop or we walked.   He response to that was I’m every name in the book, she’s taking me to court, over what I’m still not sure about, she shit talks me to everyone she knows, she makes me look like the bad person and still has yet to admit she’s done anything wrong.   I refuse to speak to her and my son hasn’t seen her in over a month because of her actions. She’s 50 years old and is trying to act like the victim because she’s mad that we called her out and had a week long argument over her issues.

32wtrkjj	So before the night we fought our relationship is already going downhill and anytime I will be bursting because of the things that he was doing. So basically my mom caught him on the act of texting his mistress and she also discovered they had a child and it was hidden to us for 4 years. Another thing was he told my youngest brother who was 13yrs old at that time that he had a child with his mistress and told to not tell us. So after that, we didn't know that my brother have this heavy burden that he was carrying for 3yrs on the time my mom caught him. Now the night that we fought, he was getting mad at me for not doing things the way he wants it because he can't accept that my method is easier and he doesn't wanna do it coz of his pride. So basically he threw a bag at my face and that was the time I burst out. I yelled a lot and told him that he is a closed minded person and he can't accept that people who are younger than him is right and he's wrong. He rebutted with "I'm older than you and I know what's right and wrong so you should respect me." Then I told asked that if he did know what's right and wrong then why did he cheat on my mom. He said it's for us and he's doing it to earn money. The thing is even though he did that to earn money, he doesn't even give us any support for our finances and my mom is the only who supported us for 12 whole years since the time he went to a different place to "work". Then I told him that if that's his reason for cheating, then why was my mom able to take care of us for 12 whole years by herself by selling fruits and veggies in the market. Am I the asshole for telling him that I don't treat him as my father anymore and that I don't want him in my life because of how fucked up he is? I told this to some of our relatives and told me that I was lucky to have a father because they didn't. Like honey, I rather not have a father than have that kind of father. And also that night he almost killed me, my mom just stopped him so I'm alive and suffering.	1642989040.0	sba5np	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba5np/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_father_and_reproaching/	AITA for getting mad at my father and reproaching him for cheating on my mom
iy8nm1ac	First off, I can't believe it worked out as perfectly as it did, and I giggle every time I think about it. Bear with me here.  So, I'm on the way back from a lunch meeting with a client and out of nowhere my stomach decides that it's time to "take care of some business". It was pretty insistent. I locate a convenience store, make haste to the bathroom(single occupancy). Hell breaks loose in there, and in the middle of it someone starts banging on the door loudly telling me to hurry up. Takes me a few minutes to finish up and before I can this guy starts going crazy outside calling me names and that he can't wait. I finally wrap up and realize I used the last of the toilet paper that was in there. This makes me grin, considering the person waiting and how they are acting towards me.  I leave the bathroom and the guy is staring daggers as he pushes past me to get inside. Now that I'm free, I roam the store looking for a candy bar or something and on the way to the candy aisle my eyes happen across a wonderous sight: one single roll of toilet paper for sale. Instantly I know what I'm going to try and do, although something inside is telling me the store has to have some put away somewhere for their own use. I went for it anyways, bought the TP and a candy on my way to the door I hear the most wonderous sound: the guy in the bathroom cracks the door and yells for the worker to get some toilet paper. I laugh and head outside.  Not twenty seconds later as I'm getting in my car the attendant bursts out the door yelling for me to stop, that I bought the last roll. Internally I'm ecstatic. I tell the worker "Sorry, I need some for home", and proceed to leave.  When I get home that evening I tell my wife the story and she is mortified. She tells me I'm a petty asshole and should be ashamed of myself. At the time it felt great, but now I'm wondering.

azffa60b	Over the years, I have bottled up every time my grandma has hurt me verbally and emotionally. It started when I was 15 when she came into the US. My parents divorced shortly after and we had to live with grandma. Although me and my brother were super disciplined, she still had to add in her own discipline for some reason. She even once said she didn’t like my brother and me very much back then. Now, 11 years later, I still wonder if she loves me like she says she does. She has made me sick with the flu and states that her flu isn’t contagious. She has used me as an emotional punching bag when she went under chemotherapy, which I totally understand because chemo is so bad. But why me? I didn’t do anything wrong that time. I was there to support her. Other people would make her mad and she would throw her anger on me. She is cancer free now. She would use very bad words in her language back then. I was only about 16 and it has been etched in my mind ever since. I can’t erase every hurtful encounter I have had with her. No matter how hard I try. It’s driving me insane. She’s super lenient with my younger cousins, but I’m older and she should also be kind and lenient with my brother and me too. Age shouldn’t matter with kindness and with being a good grandma. Yet she uses their age as an excuse  ( they are 5), which I get but, she needs to be nice to me too. Now she’s living with us temporarily until we find her a home. I talked to her today and said “you know, when you say you love me, I don’t believe you because the words you used against me and how you treated me were so hurtful.” And she said “I don’t know why you don’t believe that I love you, but I do very much.” She also told me that she will work on her personality. She will do her best. She said “I know I’m crazy, but I will do my best to work on this.” The thing that confuses me is that she has knit for me and it took her months, has cooked for us many times because my mom asks and loves her cooking, and has been there if I was ever having an emotional breakdown. She was also concerned if I was ever seriously sick. And was there in serious times. Why does the past haunt me so much? Why do I only see the bad in her? It’s so hard for me to get over. I’m trying so much. What would you do in this situation? Have you been through something similar?

ikkq35iu	Sadly my fiancè was tragically killed early last year. It was something that no one saw coming and something I still am trying to grieve/recover from. Fast forward to a week ago and my exMIL begged me to call her. I couldn't due to some extenuating circumstances out of my control. So she messaged me a bunch of messages saying how she's devastated as she isn't entitled to any of my deceased partners death benefit/super and that I get all of it. At this point I wasn't aware that I was entitled to anything and received no notification. She begged me to give her half even though I had no idea what was happening regarding the outcome. I kept messages brief and to the point after which she started abusing me. It got to the point that I actually thought i blocked her on everything but on my deceased partners birthday I received a horrible txt stating things like "I hope you choke on every dollar" and "that you had something to do with his death"  and more.  It left me quite angry and shaken. I had contemplated giving her some of the money and now after everything she's said/done to me I'm not so sure.

3pdhiq6i	I'm not sure when Subway started asking for tips on their credit card machines, but I always think it's ridiculous any time I see it. I don't have a problem with them leaving out a tip cup for spare change but the fact that they have the option show up on their credit card machine suggests that Subway expects you to tip. Subway is the only fast food restaurant that I have seen actually ask for tips.    A friend told me that you should tip Subway workers because of the customer service you get when they make your sub. But how is that really any different from customizing a burger at McDonald's?  I do recognize that as long as tipping is a custom, it's kind of an asshole move not to tip. But I just cannot justify tipping at Subway when you're not expected to tip at any other fast food restaurant.

iyig5h9r	My cousin (24F) has an unwanted pregnancy right now, and I’ve been encouraging her to get an abortion, but her and her family are very religious, and I’m not getting through to her.  Three years ago, she had another unwanted pregnancy. She became depressed, constantly drank every day while pregnant, and almost never went in for checkups or took her prenatal vitamins. The kid is in foster care right now, and he was born with severe cognitive impairments and physical issues.  My cousin is also drinking during this pregnancy, so when it’s born and goes into foster care, it’s unlikely to get adopted if it has intellectual and physical disabilities. I said if she won’t get an abortion, at least let me pay for her vitamins and proper food and drink so this one comes out healthy. Then it will have a chance at adoption.  She told me not to tell her what to do with her pregnancy, and her side of the family is harassing me for not minding my business. They also believe disabled children are an extra special gift from God and that if God decides a child will be born disabled, nothing the mother does can change that.	1642991278.0	sbawo8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbawo8/aita_for_saying_if_my_cousin_decides_to_keep_her/	AITA for saying if my cousin decides to keep her pregnancy, I’ll pay for her vitamins/food/drink?
g6xkiepw	I (15f) am dating my boyfriend of two years (16m). I notice that I get really happy when we aren’t together and I like the feeling of missing him and not being around him all the time. I have really bad anxiety, depression and a low social energy and can’t hang out or talk 24/7. I enjoy going periods of time without talking to him and then seeing him after a while. I find it’s good for my mental health so we don’t fight as much and I don’t feel smothered or claustrophobic. I recently told this to my boyfriend and asked for a week of space and he said it was selfish because he hates missing me and started complaining about me as a girlfriend. Saying things about my anxiety and how I always get what I want in our relationship.

iyj4yno1	So I [34m] and my wife [33f] have a kid [12f]. She’s recently started experiencing puberty, if you catch my drift, and has “really bad” cramps. My wife was going to a party with her friends tonight, and because daughter is having that time of the month, suggested she stay home (daughter spent pretty much all of the day lazing around in bed and using her period as an excuse when I told her to do simple chores like taking the trash out and cleaning up around the house). I said daughter’s been sitting around all day, and it’ll be good for her to get out of the house and be distracted so she’ll stop whining. Wife and daughter disagreed, but I put my foot down - I wanted a night without my wife to relax and I thought it would be good for daughter to actually do something. I said I wouldn’t babysit, but wife just blew up and yelled at me, then left without daughter. Daughter is currently still holed up in her room, claiming she has cramps, but wife hasn’t texted me all night and I’m starting to wonder if I might have been too assertive.

iwbf9aup	(Throwaway so my friend can’t see this post because he follows my account)  I (21M) got a friend (23M) who has a friend (24M) who collects NFTs and my friend decided to have us all hang out at his place. Now call me old fashioned but I just don’t understand the hype. Why should I spend digital money on stupid monkey drawings when I could just screenshot or save as? Maybe y’all can answer this in the comments.  Anyways, I thought it was stupid but I decided to be a decent person and just respect it. My friend introduced me to Mr. NFT and we hung out. He kept bragging about his NFTs the whole time and that us “boomers” (I’m not joking he literally said this and he’s he oldest person in the situation) need to invest in crypto and buy some NFTs or some shit.  I’d understand it if he wanted to talk about NFTs. That’s fine, but he kept bragging and shoving his stupid NFTs.  I politely told him to not do that. He didn’t like that though and started arguing with me about how NFTs are the future, it’s important that I listen to him, and if I don’t I’ll regret it. He called me a broke loser who’s gonna get laughed at in the future due to me not investing in crypto and buying NFTs.  At this point I got pissed and told him to fuck off. My friend tried to step in but he failed to. I told Mr. NFT that I don’t care about his stupid monkey drawings and that if I wanted them so bad I could screenshot them.  This enraged Mr. NFT further and he started hurling insults at me and he said that the blockchain doesn’t lie and that screenshotting them doesn’t mean I own them. Its like he was quoting that “you think it’s funny to take screenshots of people’s NFTs, huh?” copypasta.  I left my friend’s house and went home. He called me saying “I’m an asshole who ruined the night and can’t respect other people’s hobbies”.  I think I was in the right but my friend and Mr. NFT disagree with me. I’ve come here to get an unbiased third person perspective on the matter.	1642992005.0	sbb51t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbb51t/aita_for_getting_angry_at_an_nft_collector_after/	AITA for getting angry at an NFT collector after he kept bragging about his NFTs?
iwhp30k4	I (20F) first met Kyle (20M) when we were 15 and we started dating at 17 in senior high. He was a player and I don't know why I went out with him in the first place given his bad reputation but I was naive and thought maybe he'd change for me.  After graduation I left home for university in another city while he went to the one in our hometown. And that's when he took his game to a whole new level. His excuses were always "you're not here and I felt alone" or "all my friends had their girls over and I felt left out" or "I was only playing with her. I have no feelings for her" or "It's your fault you wanted to go that far for uni." Those were his exact words.  Let's just say it was a really toxic relationship. My depression and anxiety skyrocket. I couldn't eat well, couldn't sleep, lost a lot of weight, couldn't bring myself to get out of bed and go to class and I ended up failing few of my classes.  He started drinking more and even resort to drugs as a coping mechanism.  Anyway, I finally ended the relationship with him and a week later I heard he was dating the girl (let's call her D, 17F) he'd told me not to worry about. Turns out he was going out with her way back while we were still together.  I moved on and  started focusing on myself. It is what it is.  Until earlier this year he DM'd me on one of my social media accounts saying how much he misses me and still thinks about me. I left his messages on seen. He does it again the second, third and on the fourth time he sends me a message and I quote "Stop being a little sensitive bitch. You should be grateful I made you stronger. And if you're one of the few reasons that make me happy in life then you or anyone have no right to take that away from me. I don't understand. You were impatient and didn't give me enough time to change."  That pissed me off and I snapped. I told him he broke me and left me bleeding and I had to pick up all my broken pieces and put them together all on my own so he doesn't get the credit for making me stronger. I did that myself. I also told him I gave him almost 2 years of my life and that's more than enough time for him to change and it's so wrong on so many levels that he has a gf and he's still talking to me.  After this I blocked him on all my social medias and changed my number.   A few days ago, his sister DM'd me on one of my socials and told me Kyle's been drinking a lot and pushed everyone away after what I said to him and that I'm an oversensitive asshole for doing that to him. She also said what I did was rude and I overreacted for something I could've easily gotten over.  So Reddit, do your thing and tell me if I'm the asshole for telling the truth and cutting him off. Did I overreact and made a big deal out of it?	1642992176.0	sbb7a6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbb7a6/aita_for_telling_my_ex_the_truth_and_blocking_him/	AITA for telling my ex the truth and blocking him after what he said to me?
iyk0e3ud	My sister (24F) has always been a progressive woman. She was the leader of our school’s women’s group and was instrumental in changing some of their outdated uniform policies. When I (26F) graduated, I got a scholarship to the local university to study arts and communications. After I finished, I got a job at a marketing firm and met my now husband David (28M). David works in an engineering firm and we both hit it off. After a few years of dating and cohabiting, David and I got married last year. We are now looking to save for a house. David found a position at a larger firm that brings a significant boost to his salary but requires a bit more in hours and commuting. The jump in salary is more than my full salary but would mean that he would need someone to pick up some of his current household responsibilities.  David and I both had a chat and fully agreed that it would be best for our marriage if I could move to part time work, and pick up a bit more household chores, so that David can avoid burning out with his new job. This would only be temporary: until we get enough to buy a house, then I would get to go back to full time and David would try to find a position that has less responsibilities and stress. I stress that this was my decision. I wasn’t manipulated or pressured into making this decision. David and I have both come to this agreement and are happy that the sacrifices we will each make will be beneficial in the long run.  Think you can see where this is going. My little sister has been furious with me and says that David is now going to treat me like a 50s housewife. We were having a family dinner with David and my sister was making comments all night. Thing like:  “How does it feel to achieve peak toxic masculinity?”  “OP you do know that its possible to divorce people who manipulate you right?.”  <David gathers dishes and clears table, taking dishes to sink> “Is that the last time you will step foot in a kitchen?”  David told me he was feeling really uncomfortable. The last straw was when a domestic violence ad came on TV and my sister opened her mouth after looking at David with a smug look. I told her that she was being a benevolent sexist by assuming I was manipulated and pressured by David to move part time. That it was infantilising and eroding my agency to assume I can’t make decisions for myself. I told her that he wasn’t allowed at our apartment until she apologises to both David and myself. She told me to go F myself and that if looking out for women (and her sister) is sexist then so be it.

7miabfgo	I (22f) have been with my bf (20m) for a little over a year, recently we got into an argument. For context my bf has a bed wetting issue. This has happened many times at my place and each time it does I rent a steam cleaner and deep clean my mattress (I have an expensive mattress to help elevate my scoliosis pain).   A few nights ago he came over when I had work the next day. We had a great evening and then went to bed. When I woke up I was soaked in his piss. I was disgusted. I took a shower and asked him if he would take care of it this time since I had to go, he said “I will, you don’t have to worry about it.” So I thanked him and left. I got home and went to my room to get changed. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the smell, it smelled like piss and bleach. I looked at my mattress and saw a towel laying on top of it and the sheets bunched up on the floor. This guy took the sheets off, threw them on the floor, poured bleach all over my mattress and laid a towel on top of it.   My mattress was destroyed. I was infuriated. After I calmed down I called him and told him “you owe me a new mattress”  he said “no it’s fine, that’s how I clean mine” I told him “this is not fine. I can’t even sleep on this. Do you know how expensive this thing was?” he said “okay I’ll replace your mattress, but I’m not getting one that expensive” I told him “I need the same one I had or I am going to be in constant pain” he told me to “suck it up and stop acting like a baby” I saw red. I said “IM acting like a baby? I have caught you picking your nose and eating it, I have cleaned your piss out of my mattress at least a dozen times, and the ONE time I ask you to do it you put in absolutely no effort and destroy my mattress in the process. Now you won’t even buy a replacement even though you can afford one? You are disgusting and childish.” Then hung up. The next day I tried calling him a couple times but didn’t get a response. Yesterday he texted me and said that he won’t talk to me again unless I give him an apology. Idk what to do.

ix3eydk6	 Apologies for my English, it is not my first language. I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for nearly 2 years. He has been diagnosed with general anxiety. In the past, two separate ex-girlfriends cheated on him and would stay overnight at his flat less often during this time. So, he has a lot of anxiety around me leaving his flat at night. I usually stay with him 2 nights/week and I enjoy it very much because we get on and his room is a lot bigger and more comfortable than mine.   He invited me to stay over last night before I left for a week-long work trip but two days ago, I was feeling unwell and told him I didn’t want to get him sick. He said he doesn’t mind and would like to take care of me and help me get better ASAP. Although I was feeling lousy last night, I managed to get to sleep. Around 2 am, I felt ill and noticed that I was coughing up bloody mucus. I freaked out and tried to wake my boyfriend but quickly stopped because I realized he had an early start at work. He’s also a very heavy sleeper so it would’ve taken quite a bit of effort to wake him. I decided to drive myself to A&E but wanted to let him know where I was in case he woke up before I got back. So, I wrote him a note, texted him and left him a voicemail to cover my bases.   Before I got back to the flat, he had texted me to tell me how badly I had triggered his anxiety and called me thoughtless and cruel. He then accused me of cheating on him because 2 am was a “booty call hour”. I sent him a Snapchat of me in A&E and he apologized but said he was still upset with me for not waking him up and sending him into a panic. He told me that his flatmates agreed with him and that I of all people should know that it would upset him because I know his history. I feel like I did everything I could to reduce his anxiety and care about his general wellbeing (not going to work today feeling like death). I also feel like I have been unkind because my boyfriend has ghosted me which is very unlike him.

iyk0vlgy	I(34f) have a 4yo daughter, my husband passed away in January of last year, at the time I was 3 months pregnant and I miscarried shortly after I passed.   We had got pregnant using ivf as my husband was diagnosed with testicular cancer 3 years ago. We both really wanted to give our daughter a sibling as I had been an only child and felt very lonely growing up while my husband had 2 brothers that he was very close to.   I feel like I'm finally ready emotionally to try another round of ivf using some of the remaining sperm but when I discussed this with my inlaws over Christmas I met some unexpected resistance. My MIL went positively ballistic at me, screaming that I was being disrespectful and that no child born after my husband's death would ever be recognized as their grandchild. She kicked my daughter and I out of their home and has refused to speak to me since. My FIL reached out to apologise but also one of my BILs reached out to tell me using the sperm in storage would be inappropriate and insensitive to the family.

I don’t have any specific requirements, I just look up the RRP of each item and if it’s brand new elsewhere for cheaper I’ll slip in the “isn’t this item $200 at Kmart? See link below” or “I’m pretty sure these are less than $50. See eBay link of cheaper item”. Sometimes if it’s an older person I’ll avoid it, just giving them the benefit of the doubt.

iyjui79c	Would I be the asshole for trying to reach out to my half sibling...  Hi I'm 19 and female and here is a little background on my family dynamic. My mom had me in her 20s, but my biological dad (we will call him Bob) was never involved in my life. I've never met him, and I don't really plan on it. I used to be close to Bob's parents, but they aren't involved in my life anymore, and I only talk to his brother who I love and am glad is in my life.   I had found out that Bob had a son when I was 8 and never thought much of it when I was young, and at the time I found out his son was two I think. Recently the idea of wanting to reach out and know my half sibling has been dawning on me a lot, but I don't know what to do or even if it is right for me too.  My half brother would be in his teens now, and I have no idea if he even knows the idea of me. I also don't know if it would be right of me to reach out. I want to do this for myself because I believe that I deserve to be close with my half siblings. I know it my be selfish of me but I'm also tired of feeling like I can't be apart of his life because Bob was an asshole and chose not be involved in my life. I don't know what to do and I don't want to be more of a burden in that family.   On top of that I don't know how Bob's son would react. I don't want him to hate me but I don't want to miss out on his life anymore. Yet my other fear is that I will ruin his relationship with my dad, or cause drama. There are so many flip sides to this but I just need advice and guidance.	1642993227.0	sbbja1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbja1/wibta_wanting_to_reach_out_to_my_half_siblings/	WIBTA: wanting to reach out to my half siblings
5940jxqi	I (F21) work for a small company as an accounting assistant, and primarily report to S (F46), the main accountant. Usually when I am absent, like twice before (once due to my school and once due to a family medical emergency), I would firstly email the HR, cc S, then a separate email to S.  My mistake was emailing the HR, and i completely forgetting to cc and email S separately. Prior to this I had the task of scanning/renaming/attaching the invoices of the previous and current fiscal year (about 5 months worth of invoices).   I go to work the following Monday to find out how she basically used the whole weekend to scan/rename/attach and file back the invoices. I felt bad as that was quite the lot, and I had already done half of it. She never informed me about anything of urgency, not on Monday or the previous Thursday. When I asked her why,she lashed out on me saying that I "never" inform her when I'm absent, and that she got super upset so she went ahead and did everything. Then she refused to delegate any tasks here. I can't help but feel guilty, I felt so overwhelmed too as I was looking to have a relatively pleasant day as the following day is  my birthday.

h1a3l0nq	My fiancé (M52) and I (F51) have been dating for five years and are getting married soon.  I have two children (F31 and M23).  My fiancé has three children (F28, M26 and F24).    I have been the target of a number of negative social media post from my fiancés oldest daughter’s husband.  He has also referred to my fiancé as either the “maintenance man” or “father-in-law” (literally in quotes).  I rented a house to him and his wife for 3 years.  The problems came on year 3 when he decided he didn’t want to pay the agreed upon monthly rent.  I ended up selling the house because I did not want a house to be a problem between my fiancé and his kids, or me and them for that matter.  The house cause so many hard feelings that we did not see them for about 6 months.  That changed on July 4th, when we reached out an invited them for a family gathering.  Apparently shortly after, future SIL went on social media with another smear campaign.   The latest was a post accusing me of telling him that he was “letting himself go after marriage” at our family gathering. In his post, he discusses his struggle with having a low opinion about himself and a feeling of unworthiness as a result of my comment.  His parting paragraph said, “just know [my name], if you ever read this, comments like this make you a terrible person and you are no family of mine”.  To be honest, I don’t read his social media post, so I did not see this.  Unfortunately, he reached out to my daughter asking for a kennel for a puppy, my daughter went on his page expecting to see pictures of a puppy and instead found his public post about me.  I learned of the post from her. Before a lot of comments are made, my daughter did not tell me in any way to cause harm but more in an effort to address a problem.  If there is a problem, she would like to see it sorted out before a vacation (we are taking everyone on a family vac to Disney) or a wedding.  Unfortunately, when I discussed it with my fiancé, it began a huge argument.  We were supposed to have lunch with future SIL and DIL to “get surprised” by the new puppy and instead I stayed home.  My fiancé feels that I am starting drama and acting childish because I said, “I’ve had enough”.  AITA?   Also, I was not asking to address this issue at lunch because I wouldn’t have wanted to ruin the surprise of the puppy.  But I did want it address soon and more importantly, I did want my fiancé to at least understand why this might be upsetting to me and figure out a way together to address whatever the problem with SIL is.  Just to clarify, I did not say what I am being accused of saying.  It is not in my nature to body shame or say things that make other people feel bad about themselves.  I have no reason to do that and simply wouldn’t.  On the other hand, I am not perfect and if I had said something that upset anyone, letting me know would have been sufficient for me to apologize.  Whether I did say something offensive or not, I would have apologized for the good of the future family.	1642993747.0	sbbpj3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbpj3/aita_for_deciding_enough_is_enough_when_it_comes/	AITA for deciding enough is enough when it comes to my fiancé’s SIL’s behavior towards me?
9sjo9ngs	I (16M) have been struggling with seeing my dad (36M), this isn't due to distance or work but mainly due to his blatant disrespect and homophobia towards me.  This all started over a year ago when I came out to him as gay, up until that point we had a close relationship, we would talk and we would hang out together, go out fishing and doing other fun things, these past few months he's been getting worse and worse, he keeps making comments about me and yells at me a lot when I disagree with him.  Up until the other day, I had it so then he couldn't see my Instagram story, on my Instagram I was pretty much just sort of talking about respect and how parents should respect their children, needless to say, my dad asked me who I was talking about and I said him, he got pretty angry at me and asked me when he had disrespected me, I pretty much told him that he should think about it and went back to ignoring his messages (which was rude of me and I am an ass for doing that but I was pretty sick of him).  Today I posted another thing on my story about how often when people want to be treated with respect, they either mean that they want to be treated like they are the authority or that they want to be treated like a person and whole bunch of other things, my dad saw it and blew me up with a phone call about how he was the authority and how I don't deserve respect until I become and adult, I grew sick of him, told him that sure I am a child but I still deserve to be respected.  After, I told my mum to expect him to blow up our phones and mum read out messages he had sent to her after our first disagreement told me that I can stop going to his house on the weekends if I need to and I'm tempted to but I'm just wondering if I would be the asshole if I did?	1642993708.0	sbbp3b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbp3b/wibta_if_i_didnt_want_to_see_my_dad_anymore/	WIBTA if i didn't want to see my dad anymore?
4imywfdy	Alright, I’ve been debating this in my head the past couple days because it could have legal consequence, but I have a friend who’s married and was very pro science / open-minded before she married her husband. She was one of my closest friends too. Even before the pandemic, though, the guy is/was sort of one of those alt-right people (not as far gone as say, Milo Yiannopoulos), but now he posts anti-vaccine stuff on Facebook and then captions the images “really makes you think🤔” and other cliched phrases.   They’re both unvaxxed (whatever)… but recently he got them both *fake* vaccine cards so they can go to bars and stuff. I know for a fact they are fake as he told me directly. I believe where he works you have to have proof of vaccination, but Would I Be The Asshole if I called his place of work anonymously and told them to look into his proof of vaccine status a bit more closely?   I don’t want to tell my friend I’d be doing this, as she may hate if she knew, but I don’t think it’s fair to unvaxxed/vaxxed alike.	1642993469.0	sbbmcl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbmcl/wibta_if_i_reported_a_friends_vaccine_card_as_a/	WIBTA if I reported a “friend’s” vaccine card as a fake to their employer?
iyl147ik	I f32 has never had a relationship with my father who's 49. He left me and my mother when I was 9 and I hadn't started talking to him until 2021. He always had a pretty good paying job so with the amount he had to pay in child support I never went without. Anyway, like I said me and my father got back in contact in 2021 when I reached out to him on Facebook. He apologized and in the end, I forgave him for closure. We eventually started talking and meeting up and he mentioned he was married and he had 2 younger kids. I was hurt but I was glad he got himself together so my younger siblings could have a present father. We arranged for last week for me to meet them since we were fairly busy in 2021.    I got to his house and it was a beautiful home story home and it was really well taken care of. When I went up to the door a young lady opened the door. I thought it was maybe my half-sister but that didn't add up because im fully white and she was fully black so maybe I thought she just had her mom's complexion or she was my stepsister. The lady welcomed me in and introduced me by her name and stated that she was my father's wife. I was really concerned because she looked really young but alot of my friends who are fully black still look like they are in high school so I thought that was it. She went back in the kitchen to finish cooking while my father introduced me to my younger sister who is 5 and my younger brother who is 2. They were really adorable! Anyway, we finally sat down a ate and we were having a great conversation. I asked them how they and how long they have been together so I could know her age without asking. She told me they met at my father's workplace when she was 18 and they have been together for 11 years. This means she's 29 and my father is 20 years older than her which disgusts me.

17i2vv	My flat mate messaged last night at 6pm that he was coming back to the flat with his girlfriend and friends to carry on having drinks on our roof.  The problem is our place isn’t big and you can still hear people on the roof. Also I have to wake up at 5:30 for work so I need to sleep early.  My flat mate apologized for bringing people over as he said it wasn’t his idea without me even saying anything at this point. So I asked him why bring them over and told him that I would appreciate if he asked rather than telling me he’s bringing people round especially since I have work early and he knows that.  Things got heated as he was drunk and said I had the chance to say no, but I told him he didn’t ask and told me they were coming round and sent a video of them in a taxi on the way over so I thought it was awkward to say no if they were already on the way. I told him that there are 3 people on the lease so it would be nice to ask me and my flat mate, but he said he lives here and can do what he wants.   I also brought up that this isn’t the first time this has happened since him and his girlfriend once woke me up at 1am on a week day while they were drinking and talking really loud in the living room. I let them go on for an hour until they heard me get out of bed and was about to come out and ask them to keep it down. His response to this was that he was drunk and it was their anniversary, but I said it was lack of respect for my boundaries and it was 1am and I wouldn’t do this to him. His response was that let’s find out when I do it to him because it should be fine but I said I would never do that to him.  I also don’t get on with his girlfriend as she was telling me and my housemate to go upstairs and chill with them whilst preventing us from watching TV.  I probably would’ve not as minded if it was a Friday or Saturday night but would prefer if he did ask, however I was annoyed it was a Sunday night and he knows I have work but also his response to everything.	1642994807.0	sbc2gv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbc2gv/aita_for_asking_my_flat_mate_to_let_me_know_when/	AITA for asking my flat mate to let me know when he has friends over
iykp3x0o	Preface: I was like 18 or 19 and got stupid drunk with my friend and her bf came over and we all ended up having a threesome. Fast forward, I’m currently 24 and my current bf is 25. I had previously mentioned the occasion to him several times, names included. I moved states a few years ago and my bf came with me to visit my hometown and we ended up visiting that friend and her bf (same dude, they’re still together).   Now, 7 months after visiting my hometown, the subject gets brought up again about the threesome and the names are mentioned once again. For some reason, he was absolutely shocked that I had brought him around them even though she is one of my best friends and is now furious because he was in the same room as other people I had slept with. I was upset because I had told him of the incident several times before and also the names but he said he didn’t remember their names and didn’t connect it to the story. Had he ever said he would be uncomfortable with the situation, I wouldn’t have brought him around them, but given he didn’t connect the dots he didn’t say anything at the time of heading to visit them.   Am I the asshole?	1642995006.0	sbc4tn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbc4tn/aita_for_bringing_my_bf_around_my_friend_and_her/	AITA for bringing my bf around my friend and her bf whom I had a 3way with
121io0o4	My roommate has a habit of talking to me all the time. I don't like this because even though I like talking to him too much of a good thing is a bad thing. Today he came home and was talking to me though my door from the table. I gave him some short answers to signal I was busy and didn't wanna talk but he kept asking me questions and saying non important small talk like he searching for things to say. Mostly about things we should do together later that week. Eventually I responded to a question about something unrelated in an annoyed tone and he said "are you sure you don't just wanna go without me" and I said "Anon when my door is closed that usually signifies I don't wanna talk or am working. I will come out when I wanna talk." he said "oh okay sorry" and I said "but yes I'll go with you"   AMITA for calling him out on this?

I said I’d be so down since she’s my bestfriend and pretty much sisters at this point but it would just be us until our S/O get a job to also move in with us.

cl0frb4g	So my fiancé works every Monday-Friday. I’m a stay at home mom and like to work every Friday and Saturday as a bartender just to make some extra cash (I struggle being at home constantly and I enjoy making extra money) well my fiancé watches our son. My fiancé pays all of the bills except for a few of mine that I take care of with the cash I make. But we’ve been getting into fights lately because when he gets home (usually it’s later in the day) he either goes straight to the gym, or stays home and usually refuses to help with the house chores (even on his days off) If I ask him to change the babies diaper or just to take the dog out it’s a “no, because I pay for all the bills.” And honestly it’s been upsetting me a lot. I never wanted to be a stay at home mom, but because I’m just a bartender and because of covid we’d keep our little one out of daycare and have me watch him. A part of me knows I’m crappy at being a ‘stay at home mom’ because I struggle to keep up on laundry, I’m not a great cook (but I’m getting better) and the house isn’t usually spotless when he comes home and maybe that’s why he feels that he doesn’t need to help because I’m not holding up my end of the deal?

iyly8mzs	 OK it’s petty but the basic question is: do you have to replace a shared food before you use the last of it, or is it ok to replace soon after using the last?  My partner (32) and I (31) have lived together for a year. We share most groceries, but rarely eat together because of different schedules & preferences. Many meals we just fend for ourselves with what’s in the kitchen unless I cook for us both.  It’s free rein on all our staples we buy regularly – bread, eggs, yogurt, milk, cereal, cheese, butter etc. We ask each other before using something non-staple that the other bought.  Some staples are more ‘him’ foods, some are more ‘me’. He eats cereal every day at breakfast. I eat it once in a blue moon. I never let us run out of yogurt, because it’s my go to snack, and I usually buy more before we run out because of that.   Other things he will eat daily for a while and then completely stop eating for weeks, leaving the rest to go off.  We live 2 minutes from a shop so one of us is there every day. Whoever wants something pops to the shop and asks the other if they want anything. I check the staples before I go and normally grab anything he or i might need by next day. He does not check before going, so unless I remember to tell him, he will only get what he specifically went for.   I don’t mind if this means we run out of something basic I want, because the shop is 2 minutes away. And I would never use the last of something I know he eats every day, or that he will def want before I next go to the shop, like cereal.  My partner has started making pointed remarks if I use the last of something before getting more. Say there’s two pieces of bread, and he hasn’t used any bread for a week and it’s going stale, and I make a lunch sandwich, and he shops that night.   Or it’s late after the shop has closed and I have a midnight snack of yogurt (he has yogurt maybe once every few months), he doesn't like it even if I went to the shop next morning and got more before he even ate.   I think if he had a look before he went he would see what we’re low on that he might want before it runs out, as I do. I also don’t see the point in *neither* of us getting to have what is in the house if the shop is closed. The bread/yogurt just sits there uselessly and no one can have a full serve. If I have an inkling he *might* want something, I’ll ask. But if I know he’s had dinner and it’s something he rarely eats, I don’t ask if he wants it. Especially if it’s the things that I *always* make sure I have on hand for myself.   He thinks that just generally, you should never use up the last serve before replacing, even if he didn’t want to eat it between when I used it and when I replaced it. Just on principle, in case. I’d be more willing to entertain this if he checked what we need before shopping. But I also think it's unnecessary, especially if it’s ‘me’ foods that I am the main one eating/buying.	1642995983.0	sbcgy1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcgy1/aita_do_you_have_to_replace_food_before_you_use/	AITA?

iyllk0pp	I (34f) recently got married to Tom (fake name) (32m) and the wedding was a disaster thanks to his mother. Before we get into what she did, a bit of background might be useful. She's never liked me from the day we met. She was drunk out of her mind the second I met her and she ended the night by throwing a wineglass at me and calling me a whore. She's under the impression that Tom's ex Sarah (fake name) (27f) is the one for Tom and that I "stole him from her by shaking my tits at him." She keyed my car twice, ran me off the road once when she was drunk, and has done various other things to be as horrible as she can. Tom has begged me to please be understanding with her, and said that after the wedding, we'll just move. His job is going to require for him to move a few states away in a few months, so we're waiting for that. I've obliged till the events about to be mentioned.   On to our wedding day. Despite both Tom and myself deciding to exclude his mother from the wedding and not telling her where it was held at, she somehow found out. What she did was something straight out of a horror movie. She showed up drunk again in a Jeep, ran down the aisle just after we had finished our vows, screaming about how I'm stealing her son from her and Sarah, and I don't deserve him. She was quickly removed from the wedding tent by her husband. After she was forcibly removed from the tent, she decided the best course of action was to climb back into her Jeep and ram through the tent, taking out the expensive cake, all of the tables with the presents on them, and narrowly missing my brother Jack (fake name) who was officiating. To say I was livid would be an understatement.   How I might be the asshole: Tom's mother worked a high-paying job and needless to say, she is accustomed to a certain level of luxury. However, it turns out that, though she has a lot of things in her life that are good, there's one thing that's not. Her brother is in a vegetative state due to a horrible accident and she pays a lot of money trying to get him better. They were very close as kids and to be honest, according to Tom around the time he was in the accident is when she started acting like this. She was saving up money for a procedure that had a chance of bringing him out of this, according to her. In a fit of rage, I called her workplace and informed her supervisor exactly what she had done. He was speechless, and said she was done with their company. The thing is, I wasn't aware of her brother, let alone that she was paying for his treatments. Now everyone in her family is calling me a monster, and even some of my own family are saying I need to do something to fix what I've caused. Tom's the only one who's told me I'm justified but to be perfectly honest, I feel like a monster. I've cost her the ability to care for her brother and I can't imagine life without my brother. Am I the asshole?	1642996832.0	sbcr7w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcr7w/aita_for_essentially_ruining_my_mils_life_over_my/	AITA for essentially ruining my MIL's life over my wedding disaster?
60r8sv7t	 Hi. So, I'm in high school and I live with my parents. (I also do other things but not relevant things.)  One of my school friends is bisexual and he came out to his parents a few weeks ago. They were less than accepting, and they have become more and more hostile toward him since he told them. About a week ago, they started getting physical with him. He told me in school that he doesn't feel safe in his house anymore and that he's going to try to find somewhere to stay. I offered to let him stay in my house over the weekend since my parents would be away, and he seemed pretty happy about it. He said that in that time he could talk to his cousin (who's in his 20s and rents alone) about trying to move in with him.  He ended up staying over on Friday and Saturday night, but my parents (dad and stepmom) arrived back at the house before he left Sunday morning (today). They are both super accepting of LGBTQ+ people but they were really angry that I had let him stay in the house, especially without asking first. The reason I didn't ask was because they would have said no and done something to stop me. My stepmom was very worried about Covid, even though he tested negative on Thursday afternoon. My dad was just angry that I had betrayed their trust. They agreed not to tell my friend's parents but they did give me some punishments like early curfew, no candies or desserts, no jam sessions (I'm a jazz musician and that's one of the things I enjoy doing a lot), etc., all for four weeks.  I'm regretting what I did but at the same time I still feel justified to an extent. I wanted to protect him from his parents, and I don't think anyone else would have done that. I'm not sure to what extent I did the right thing and to what extent I'm in the wrong. I think now that I should have asked them first, but again I know they would have said no and they would have stopped me. AITA and what should I have done differently?	1642996921.0	sbcsfa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcsfa/aita_for_letting_a_friend_stay_in_my_house_for/	AITA for letting a friend stay in my house for the weekend to escape from his parents?
iymtjf58	I was complaining to my brother about being single and he told me (straight female) that he'd match me up with guys in my age range. He assured me that they'd be men I had never met before so no awkwardness or anything like that, basically blind dates.  Not long after our conversation, he called me and said that he found a friend of a friend who was single.  I said sure to meeting him, and I met him today. I was shocked to find out that it was a dude I had met before, in a club I used to belong to but stopped attending recently because of more pressing obligations in life and to also avoid seeing him because I had a crush on him but didn't feel he liked me back (he's extremely popular with women).  It was extremely awkward at first and I tried to not blush too hard or stammer. It actually ended up being fun and he said that he wanted a second date with me.   After the date, I called my brother and said that we agreed to *blind dates* and my brother laughed and said that he purposely set us up because the dude from the club told a mutual friend of his and my brother that he liked me but that my sarcastic personality scared him too much for him to approach me.   I told my brother I was never going to let him play matchmaker again.	1642997310.0	sbcwly	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcwly/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_he_did_a/	AITA for telling my brother that he did a terrible job?
9y79gpw7	He is smart and passionate about what he does, but he can really get on my (senior) nerves. In a group chat with a club that I founded, he would berate other members and me for not using his conventions and for being, in his words, 'retarded'. I don't mind that word being tossed around, but there comes a point where I've had enough and I feel a line must be drawn. Today he accidentally leaked his IP address in a post, that also was directed towards how bad my skills were, and I told him to cover up his IP. He then went on a tirade addressing how he did not care that his IP was leaked and he finished it up with a nice, 'You are retarded'. Having already given him a warning in the past for interfering with another member and telling him how terrible Java was, I gave him a timeout today (discord). In the private timeout message, I made it exceedingly clear this was his final chance to behave respectfully, however I also threw in very questionable language like 'socially abhorrent, least likable, etc.'. I was fuming and I've had enough, because on top of having to run this club of 20+ members, I had to finish up 2 more college apps, and a load of homework. Now, reflecting on how I dealt with this situation, I feel conflicted as I did rub a huge amount of salt into an area he knows he has to work on, yet I also felt a clear line was drawn and he would not cross it in the future.

impveswb	Ok so I am a junior in a college prep academy. I spent about 100$ of food at Walmart and put them back in my dorm room. My roommate let’s call him Sam asked if he could eat some I said sure.  About a week later I was quarantined with Covid, before I was quarantined I had 3 boxes of pop tarts, 2 bags of popcorn, Chicken biscuits, Cosmic Brownies, Oreos and much more.  When I came back from quarantine I looked in my dorm room and basically all my food was eaten except the oreoes. I was furious because the amount of money I spent. I confronted Sam and asked him why he ate all my food and he said “Because you said I can eat it”. Things got pretty heated between us and we got in a big fight because he thinks he was allowed to eat all my food when I was sick which cost 100$+ and i obviously was furious that he would eat all of it.

iyj1v6ha	At my university (19F), it’s extremely unusual to find students who plan to go into the military upon graduation. I believe 1.6% of students are in ROTC, so just a few dozen of our undergraduates. So whenever people meet students in ROTC, they’re usually fascinated and inquisitive about it.  I was talking to a guy (19M) on the floor above me, who is going into the military after graduating. He told me he doesn’t plan on making it his career, and he’s only going to be in a few years. So I said “Oh, is it because they’re paying for your college?” And he said no, they’re not. It has nothing to do with that. And I said “Oh, so if it’s not about money and it’s not going to be your career, why are you going into the military?”  And he said he wants to go to war because it makes him feel alive. He was involved in a conflict between government and citizens in a country in unrest where his family is from in high school. And I said “Wouldn’t it be bad for the country to go to war?” He said he doesn’t want the country to go to war, but he personally wants the opportunity to be in combat. He said he’s envious of a guy he knows, who was deployed to Syria, and he wants to do something like that.  I kept asking questions, and he got mad and said I’m rude.	1642996988.0	sbct6f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbct6f/aita_for_asking_a_kid_about_his_motivations_for/	AITA for asking a kid about his motivations for wanting to join the military?
iyk3c14b	**tldr;** I've been in a relationship that's been on-again-off-again. Recently we decided to give it another try, and my partner became very hurt and accused me of lying when she learned I hadn't shared that I had slept with a friend.  I was in a relationship for about six months until my partner and I decided that she needed some space at that point in her life to explore other relationships and find her way in life. This was difficult for me, but I couldn't deny that this was what she felt she needed, and so we parted ways for the timing being.  Some months later, we saw each other again and she told me that she loved me and wanted to try a relationship again. I was very happy to hear this and we started seeing each other again.  In the interim, I had made a friend with whom there was some sexual and romantic tension. Her and I spoke openly about this tension, but we were both cautious and not committed to exploring it. We spent some time traveling together as friends, and ultimately decided not to pursue anything more than that. However, on one occasion early on we had made out, and later we slept together once. After this, we grew more distant and didn't have much contact.  When my partner expressed that she wanted to rekindle our relationship, we talked a lot about many things, but I didn't say much about this particular relationship. It wasn't on my mind, and it didn't seem important to talk about.  Later on, it turned out that this friend would be at a party I was invited to, and so I went and also shared that I would be seeing her. When my partner learned about this, she became very suspicious and upset. We spoke about it at the time and in that conversation I was legitimately confused about what was upsetting her, insisted that we were friends, and didn't mention that we had made out or slept together.  Later on, when asked, I did say that we had slept together and she became very hurt and accused me of lying.  Looking back, it seems like I just had a huge blindspot. I couldn't see why my partner felt jealous, and it didn't occur to me that the fact that we had kissed or slept together was relevant to mention. However, I'm also not sure that I was lying, because I had no intention to deceive.  When I put myself in my partner's shoes initially, I couldn't see how this would hurt her. During the time that we were apart, she also saw various people that she is still in contact with and it wasn't important to me that she shared details about those relationships without being prompted.  However, I've since learned that this can be very important to people.  My partner still feels like I've lied and that trust is broken in our relationship, and she gets angry when I express that I didn't see her point of view at the time.  It seems that in order to repair trust, it's important for me to admit and own that I lied by omission, but I'm not certain I can do that without lying.	1642995989.0	sbch0w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbch0w/aita_for_not_telling_my_partner_details_about_an/	AITA for not telling my partner details about an almost-romance?
1le91b6	  I 40m and considering leaving my wife 39f of almost 12 years. We started dating 20 years ago, there were 3 breaks during the first 5 years of our relationship.   15 years ago my wife and I were not together. I dated a girl for a month or so. It was every romance movie or novel in one. We were electric together. Butterflies every time we kissed, shivers when we touched. Sex was 100x better than any other. I still play it in my head. She always said it was a Scorpio Pisces thing. For 15 years I thought about her. Every time I hear a sexy or passionate song I’d think about her moving to it, not my wife. I love my wife dearly but this girl was my one that got away.   Present day, my wife and I have been married almost 12 years. We have a 9 years old son. The last 2 years our relationship has completely deteriorated. We don’t fight, but we’re basically roommates. We rarely even share a bed much less touch each other. There are no outward signs of a strained marriage though.   A chance encounter a few weeks ago led to the old girlfriend and I texting/talking then going to lunch. My wife knows!! All of those feelings are still there. We only hugged one another, but the feelings are there. All of them. Assume the impossible, and her and I are crazy similar and she feels the same way about me.   I know my wife TRULY loves me, and will want to try and work it out. AITA if I don’t give her a chance?  Also, a divorce would be pretty clean cut. Assets and custody would be easy decisions.	1642997489.0	sbcywh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcywh/wibta_if_i_left_my_wife_seemingly_out_of_the_blue/	WIBTA If I left my wife seemingly out of the blue.
bg0wuyif	Sorry if this is formatted weirdly, i’m on my phone.  Hi i’m (16nb) and a few weeks ago me and my friends did secret santa. We used a website so we could make a wishlist to help our people out. I got my person and got as much stuff off their wishlist as i could, but thats not the point.  So on my wishlist I had a lot of things, so my secret Santa would have a variety of things to choose from. A few were expensive, but not more than 45 bucks. Most items were less than the maximum ( 25 dollars. But the expensive items were added before the person holding the secret Santa told us.) and just incase the person couldn’t get any of these items I added soda and candy that they could get at a store nearby.  So here comes the secret Santa day, we have everyone close their eyes and call out a name and they get their gift. And when they open it they guess who their person is. It was fun, but when comes my  gift I open it. I don’t know what i was expecting but it was two things not on my list. I wouldn’t be mad if it was someone in the group i was closer to. But it was the girl who i never shared a word with. I smiled and thanked her. But i was kind of disappointed. I got a long sleeve shirt that wasn’t my style, and had a weird ugly design, and was a gross color of pink. I also got a mug that said the least funny thing ever. I didn’t want to be mad because she barely knows me. But somehow she got the two things i wouldn’t like. Because of sensory issues i can’t wear long sleeve’s especially ones with that type of cloth. I also hate mugs because i can’t see the drink inside, and i always think i’m gonna drink up something bad.   My other friends don’t think i’m the ah, but it’s been eating me up inside for a long time. I feel so bad. So aita? Sorry if this makes no sense, i’m sleep deprived lol.  Tldr: secret santa got me gifts that weren’t on my wishlist and unluckily for them they were two of my least favorite items.	1642997525.0	sbcz9e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcz9e/aita_for_not_appreciating_my_secret_santa_gift/	AITA for not appreciating my secret santa gift?
2k132p	So I have two cats who I rescued from a shelter, and even though they aren’t biologically related, I do still consider them sisters. They’ve always been calm and good-mannered, but they have lately been clawing up my carpet, urinating on furniture, and doing other things that I cannot keep up with. I have had them for a little over a year, and I consider them my children.   My mother lives on a farm with a lot of cats and kittens. I told her I was worried I couldn’t financially provide for them anymore, and that I was tired of them destroying things. I have only spanked my cat one time when she ran away, and I immediately regretted it. My mom said she could take them in, but I’m still worried. Since she lives on a farm, I feel that I’m sentencing them to sure death.   I told her that *if* I sent them to live with her, I didn’t want to know if they died. I know the younger one will thrive being an outdoor cat, so I’m not worried. But the older one, she is extremely nervous when I’m not around or when she isn’t in the house. I’m afraid for them both, obviously, but more for the black cat.  I’m sorry that my thoughts seem to be everywhere, but it’s a big decision and I’m nervous and don’t know what to do. WIBTA if I did send them with my mother? I don’t think so because they would have food, safety, and friends 24/7, but then I do because I’m essentially giving my children away.	1642997813.0	sbd2c5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbd2c5/wibta_if_i_gave_my_cats_to_my_mother/	WIBTA If I gave my cats to my mother?
iyljbd6c	One of my old middle school classmates organized a little gathering for all old classmates. Idk how it works in other places, but in my school we had more or less the same classmates from 3 to about 12 years old so we remember these people pretty well, even though we had split paths over a decade ago.  The gathering was last week and it was nice to catch up with some old friends. But there was an incident with a girl, A. A used to be "the weird kid". Think of the weird kid cliche, that was A. Teachers liked her because she was quiet, but she also did weird things, like bring stuffed animals to school that she'd pretend to feed at recess, use her kid scissors to cut her fingernails in class, talk to herself while gesticulating a lot while pacing around the playground. One time she said she wouldn't be able to make it to a party because she usually got sick that day, which was a very weird excuse. Her hygiene was bad too. She was harmless, but overall a very weird kid. We were around 8-10 years old, so we weren't very nice to her because she made us uncomfortable. She did have a few friends that she played with every day. A eventually changed schools before we finished middle school.  A was at the gathering. She still acts a bit awkwardly, but she talked with everyone else pretty normally, it was a bit surprising to see her act like a normal, even likeable person.  Idk who brought it up or how because I was late to the conversation, but she acknowledged that she used to be weird and do weird things, and that it was normal that we naturally rejected her. She said she has got better now. She wasn't talking to a person but to a small group, so I decided to join in. Someone commented on how everyone felt weird around her, but even though she kept saying how our behavior towards her was normal given the way she acted, she never apologized for making us uncomfortable. So eventually I suggested she apologized for creating those uncomfortable situations. She said it wasn't her fault that she was that way, she started trying to explain herself saying due to her situation she was mostly isolated, and that's the reason she acted that way. She refused to give more details about the situation in question, so I insisted until she eventually did say sorry for making us feel bad.  A was pretty quiet for the rest of the gathering and left early. Some people confronted me about making her apologize, saying she was right and it wasn't her fault that she was like that, and that it was unnecessary to make her feel bad about it so many years later. I don't agree, I think that even if it wasn't her fault, she was weird by choice, because she was the one who refused to learn how normal people act. She did see a whole class of normal kids every day for hours. And about it not being her fault, well life isn't fair and people have to apologize for past actions.	1642997745.0	sbd1m9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbd1m9/aita_for_demanding_an_old_classmate_apologize_for/	AITA for demanding an old classmate apologize for making us uncomfortable?
iylrh9f1	My girlfriend and I have dated since October. A few days ago, I got a pretty harrowing phone call from my ex, who I dated for several years through high school and college, telling me that she told her boyfriend she wanted to break up with him, because of how verbally abusive he was, he got physical. She asked me to come over.  So, I go to her apartment and it's all torn up. She was crying, obviously very traumatized. I didn't know what else to do in that moment so I told her to pack what she could and that she was going to come stay with me. She was thankful and I felt like it was the right thing to do. I just wanted to get her out of that apartment, make her feel safe.  We get back to my apartment, set her in my room, I'm taking the pull out couch for the time being. I see I missed a call from my girl. I call her back, tell her what happened. Rather than be understanding, my girlfriend fixates on " ex girlfriend staying in my apartment".  I tell my girl she's not seeing the big picture at all. This is not some sleazy " lets have an affair right out in the open" this is me helping a very good friend of mine in a time of need. She said it'd " better be all thats going on".

f6f1iv79	I am a 46 year old mother. I have a husband and 3 children, the husband is 48, the children range from 10 - 19. The other day, we went to a candy store and each selected a candy, with the expectation that we would all share the candy. I saw a candy from my childhood and selected it for myself knowing I would not have to share, since it was anise flavored. Anise tastes and smells very similar to black licorice, and I know they all HATE black licorice, but I love it. I still expected them to share thier candy with me and said they were welcome to try mine. In fact I offered many times, even reminding them that it wasn't licorice. They declined, as expected, because they did not like the smell.

I recommend her to search on linkedin though because that's what I do (I don't search on another website as I'm currently not on job search, I am a student but I am actively applying part-time in linkedin)  I always hoping the best for her but I don't think this is realistic, she is having a hard time finding job in our country let alone overseas.

During the phone interview for one job the guy told me that the position isn’t remote. I told him the job listing said it was remote and if it wasn’t I wouldn’t have even applied. He apologized for the “misunderstanding” and asked me if I wanted to continue with the interview and I said no. He then said “how do you expect anyone to hire you with that level of entitlement to work from home? You would be compensated to work from the office and you’re local so I’m not sure what the issue is”.

iymbjb4b	Me (26F) and my now fiancé (26M) got engaged after a 5 year relationship and I was very excited to jump right into wedding planning. Shortly after this we received news that his grandpa (E) (main role model in his life) was diagnosed with a terminal cancer. This were devastating news for the entire family, E was the main pillar of his family so we made life changing decisions in order to move close to his family (from across country) in order to help however we could. For the next 6 months all wedding plans are definitely put on hold as his grandma and mom want part on the planing but don’t have the bandwidth with everything going on with the main man in their lives dying of cancer, we all knew what the outcome of his deseas was going to be but looking back, the family was in major denial, with this in mind, we proposed having a small ceremony in his house so E could be present for his grandson’s wedding (this was very important for my fiancé and he will carry it with him forever), that idea was discussed among themselves and ultimately E said to not worry about it. Sadly, E passed away 2 months ago and the family is absolutely devastated which is the least to say. During a family diner, the wedding topic came up where we learned the family now expect us to wait 1 year for mourning period. We are very anxious to start a family which we don’t want to do before being married because of different logistics. I also understand that it takes 6-12months to plan a wedding, reason for which I want to start the planing process at the very least, the issue is his family want to be involved but they are in so much pain they are not ready to even think about this and I don’t know how to approach them. There has already been some conflict and talks behind my back (nothing against my character but enough to make me realized I offended/hurt them) because me and my mom bought a dress without involving his mom in the process, our families live in different states, me and my mom went wedding shopping as a holiday gift from her when I went to visit. I have a great relationship with his family and wouldn’t want that to change. My fiancé has had my back the entire time but I really don’t want to create conflict with his family or unnecessary pain during such difficult time. How should I approach the situation? I feel like an AH for trying to push forward with the wedding during this time, my fiancé wants the wedding too but I’m afraid to be disrespectful to his family. We really don’t want to wait so long before starting a family.

i6vnrw88	First off, Throwaway account, my girlfriend and my friends know my main.  &#x200B;  I 20F been friends with my 2 best friends 19M and 20M (Who I'll call Matt and Claus, respectively.) for more than 10+ years, we've been through thick and thin and I love them both to death, we all started hanging out because we shared the love for Pokémon and to this day we still do, obsessively. Matt always updates me in pokémon media while me and Claus have been pokémon rivals for as long as we had our first pokémon games. (I won a battle against him for the first time in our friendship last year and I almost cried, seriously.)  &#x200B;  With the new pokémon game coming out in 4 days, I decided that I'm gonna buy a switch lite for Claus, as much as I also love Matt, Claus is more of a video game person, is more into Pok´´emon and we've been comparing our game journeys for years, this is the first pokémon game I've bought since 2014 and I really want to share this experience with someone who has also not played one of the mainline games for years too. Plus he's the only one who gives me birthday gifts, albeit not compared to the price of a switch, still manage to give me the most amazing things for my birthday.  &#x200B;  The issue is; this might go terribly for Matt, I don't want to make him feel left out or that I don't care about him, he's always been very needy and jealous so I know this is going to hurt him. I can't hide from him that I gave Claus a switch because he knows Claus never had the financial stability for a switch (hence why he could never buy the other pokémon games), gets no allowance and his job doesn't pay enough. Even if I gave it on his birthday, he'd still get jealous because well, no one on our friends group gives birthday gifts due to not having money.   &#x200B;  Second, I don't know how his girlfriend will react. He has dated multiple women in the past who were... not so thrilled about me, I've never met any of them but they all seemed to hate any female friends of his and especially me, even though I'm a lesbian, dating, and see him as my brother. The girl he's currently dating seems an amazing person, really, she's the first girlfriend of his that I met, she's super cool and also into gaming, I've gifted her a few games so she could play with us on our gaming nights and everything went well, still, I have this nagging fear that she'll react badly.  &#x200B;  I could just not give him the switch, and you'll be right! But again, I want to have this experience with him again, I feel like it'd be nice playing a pokémon game we dreamed of when we were 12 years old actually being reality and I miss when we would sit together at my garden just showing off our new pokémons and battling. And no, I don't have the money for 2 nintendo switches.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: Want to give my childhood best friend a nintendo switch so we can relive our childhood memories about pokémon, scared that this might be an asshole move to his girlfriend and my other best friend.	1642998715.0	sbdceb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbdceb/wibta_for_giving_my_friend_a_nintendo_switch/	WIBTA For giving my friend a nintendo Switch?
hqnzg801	Before my husband and I started dating, he bought a home for himself at the hard 'suggestion' of his parents and sisters. He has never lived there in the over two years he's owned the place and only just finished decorating it. There is no furniture, no ac, etc..  Skip forward to now, we both live in my apartment which I get for free as part of my job.  In an effort to make himself a more desirable hire, he took some time from work to study and get a certification. I was all for this and during those months I paid EVERYTHING. I paid food, outings, his mortgage, his property management fees, his decoration fees. It adds up to dipping into my savings every month plus my full paycheck. I did this for about three or four months and didn't complain as he was bettering himself.  It was starting to wear on me though. I am a foreigner living in his country. I will NEVER be able to put my name on his home, I would NEVER get my money back on anything I spent for the apartment because I am foreign. We will also never live in that apartment as we're moving to a different city and then our plan from there is to move somewhere warm. We have no plans to return here and he is against ever renting out the apartment to offset some costs.  That is money that is gone forever. And that was fine. Mostly.  Now, his testing and all that ended a month or so ago and he's just now back to working and he needed money. I gave it to him, but it was clear I was not very happy about it. I didn't say anything, but I must have made a face because he asked me about it and I was honest--I don't like paying towards something that I can never see a return on and/or will never actually use.   He got pretty angry, saying I was humiliating him and what else could he do? We weren't in front of anyone so I don't think I was humiliating him, so much as his pride was hurt. I try to tell him that for me, the apartment is worthless and a drain on resources. I have no problem helping him with it, but I would like it if he can take over the payments soon as, again, the apartment is literally like an anchor for me, it just holds me down. It's eating up my whole paycheck plus my savings.   My husband has taken this to mean we are not a couple. I understand where he's coming from in that he needs help and I am willing to help, but he seems to want me to be happy about it, which I won't be.

y5orlv0	My dad has a rescue dog that he loves very dearly (more than he loves many humans).  We don’t know his history but it’s likely he was abused at some point, leading to outbursts of anxiety and, unfortunately, aggression.  This dog has developed an extensive bite history in the 3 years we’ve had him. Notably, he has caused permanent nerve damage to my mom (bumped into him in the kitchen), hospitalized my older sister for several days (unprovoked, petting in a normal situation), scarred my dad’s hand (grabbed his collar when he lunged at someone), and taken the lives of several squirrels, birds and lizards. Today I became the latest in his line of victims (he has nipped me before but not seriously), for trying to pet him as I would any other day, while he was laying on the carpet awake and alert. Perhaps what made me so mad is the way my dad reacted to it, rather than apologizing or asking if I was okay, he immediately started yelling at me, asking why the hell i would touch the dog (this dog gets petted every single day and usually loves it). The bite is deep and ugly and I will be going to urgent care tomorrow.  In all the other urgent care visits, no one has made a report against the dog, because A) we “know” the dog, and B) my dad is so devoted to that dog it would probably destroy our family dynamic. But I’ve about had it. My dad is not a bad dog owner and it’s not the dog’s fault he is the way he is, but he’s a dangerous dog. Who will it be next time? Because there WILL be a next time. Will it be a kid, a neighbor, another unwitting victim? The dog is always a potential threat and it sucks but that’s the way it is.

8tmv4po3	I am (18M) and still with my parents obviously but my grandma has terminal cancer and wishes she can spend her last few days with family. That is very cute and thoughtful and stuff but my dad (51M) came into my room the other day and announced to my brothers and I that my grandma (70F) would be staying with us. I explained that I can see the reason why but all my 3 other siblings are 15, 12 and 10. Nobody at that age deserves to find their dead grandma and be traumatized for the rest of their life just because she wants to die with family. Why do we deserve to watch her die? Now I know I may sound like the asshole but hear me out. My dad would tell stories about how my grandma would leave him for a week at a time to go basically clubbing, do drugs and have sex. He never said it directly but it’s pretty obvious. She would cook a big pot of beans and would make that as their food for the week and leave. My dad and his brothers would have to look in the trash for food and ask friends for school lunch. He would do this from elementary school until high school. Then he was put in an adoption home because of how bad she was toward him. But yet he’s all like “No matter what family is family”. I understand that’s his mom and all but she only started going to church to redeem herself I guess and to be a new woman. This story is probably all over the place but basically the drugs she did messed with her mind and now she whispers to herself and she’s really weak because of the chemotherapy and she needs people to change her diapers and people need to bathe her. She wouldn’t do much but just be a burden honestly. I don’t like her because of the way she was to my dad and I don’t think religion changes anything she did in the past. My dad has made me feel really guilty, ignorant and ungrateful in a way and idk how to feel about all this.

5aqrmq4v	No, I haven't stopped him but let me explain. I (f22) met my boyfriend after coming out of a bad relationship. I hadn't felt that type of click in a long time. When we finally moved in together he would spend all day on his computer, even when we would got down to his parents he wouldn't spend any time with them, he just wanted to be online.   We've been living together two years now and he elects to not spend any time with me at all, in fact he demands for things to be done and if they're not up to his standard, throws a tantrum. It just makes me feel a but like a toy because the only time he wishes to spend time is when he's eating dinner. I've had the conversation with him so many times and while he says he'll change he doesn't. I've moved country for him, I've left everything I know and I just feel hurt and lost as he acts like he doesn't care.   Last week I gave him an ultimatum, it's either he cuts down on game time I'm gone. I was told I was being manipulative but I don't think I am. I've tried going out of the way to organise things that I know he likes and I've even taught myself how to play some games but he's no interest.

ne1b0m4	So my wife and I have a terrible relationship. One of the key reasons being is that she has a terrible self centered, Immature, huff and puff and be loud and gaslight kind of attitude. She's belittling, obstinate and intentionally ignorant to the point where even if she's wrong about something will argue semantics until she literally has nothing else she can grasp for and at the end of it all "I don't wanna talk about this shit anymore, leave me alone." Then try to bring the topic up another way to argue her point or get what she wants. It has even led to me having to almost fight strangers on several occasions because of a small issue being blown out of proportion by her extreme 0-150 attitude and the tone of her voice. (Walmart being accused of cutting In line almost got my ass kicked, Being asked to move out of someone's parking spot where we live almost got my ass beat, Her allegedly rear ending someone then running away and leaving car on to run to our apartment, she was next door, because she started yelling at the lady so home girl was gonna beat her ass until I got in the middle. All just within 5 months)  Tonight when I told her I was sick of the attitude all the time and the petty arguments she responds with "Well ill never *not* be Autistic"  She acknowledges the behavior is awful but claims it's because she's Autistic, which she is.  Am I the Asshole for saying that I understand she's Autistic but she's using that as Justification for having a bad attitude all the time?   I feel morally fucked for even thinking that as I've got issues of my own (Manic Depressive, Bipolar and Severe Anxiety) and would feel shitty if someone downplayed my problems.

desume7o	I (M29) have recently been diagnosed with sleep apnea after many back and forth sleep studies. I literally can't help my snoring. I've tried cheaper sleep aids that could maybe keep my mouth shut while sleeping and none of it has worked. Currently a CPAP machine is far too expensive to afford right now, even though I'm saving up for it. I've offered to sleep on the couch and my wife (F25) tells me not to because I had a pretty major surgery a couple years ago and the couch would aggravate my condition. Not sure if it's worth mentioning, but she snores loudly as well, yet not once have I brought this up as an issue to her. I love her and understand she can't help it either.   This morning I was feeling super sick because I'd just gotten a b##ster sh#t and generally don't take them well, so I was having chills and pretty severe hot/cold flashes as well as shortness of breath. I had just finished taking care of and doting on her after her sh#t a few days prior, but because I was in rough shape and was still snoring, she was getting mad at me before leaving for work (as I have the next few days off) and I passed out while she was grilling me for snoring. I woke up to her being gone.   She came home from work 3 hours after her shift finished, took a shower, wouldn't even look at me and told me not to talk to her. She didn't even put her wedding ring back on. She then started looking at hotel rooms on her phone, told me to stop talking to her, packed a bag and said she was going to leave for a "few days" and "didn't know when she would be back".   She's gone now. It's 3am on my birthday and I have no idea if I'll see her again.

iwrl0w91	So basically my friends and I were walking off the campus of our school and were making jokes about Christianity because we all grew up with bad experiences in the church. This girl heard a joke I made and walked right in and said that I shouldn’t make jokes like that. Now she wasn’t angry that the joke was about Christianity she was angry that I was making a joke about a specific experience I had and that I shouldn’t say things like that because I don’t know what other people have gone through. I don’t know why but this really got to me. I believe I said something along the lines of “okay laughter lieutenant go peeping Tom on someone else’s conversation” which she didn’t take very well. She said that I was insensitive to the people around me and that I could really trigger someone. I then told her that there was a lot of chatter happening and my friends and I weren’t talking very loud (which is true we weren’t talking louder than anyone else in the area) and if she was choosing to eavesdrop I can’t stop her but I will not be censoring myself or my personal coping mechanisms, which in this case is humor, to adhere to her royal nosiness.

i15n43pf	I am a freshman in college and have been living with my roommate this year. She is super sweet and we are close friends but she does a lot of stuff that I don’t like. She will leave our dorm door open when she needs to go to the bathroom or somewhere on our floor (far from us and sometimes in the morning when I’m sleeping it’s loud), she sings and FaceTimes regularly very loud, eats loudly while im sleeping (I wake up to her chewing idk how it’s possible), amongst other things. She gets on my nerves regularly, but I’m honestly not sure if it’s just because I find it hard to live with someone. I feel like I would want to hang out with her more if we weren’t roommates, yet we never fight or anything. I am very close to three girls who want me to room with them next year, and while my roommate is in our friend group, she’s not as close with them as I am. She doesn’t like going out at all like we do, but she hangs out with us in other ways which are still fun. Rooms come in 4s so I would room with them or with her and two random people. I feel badly because I know she expects us to room together and she really doesn’t have that many other friends, but I don’t know if I can handle a whole other year with her. I wouldn’t mind rooming with her so maybe I should just suck it up, and I feel like I am being unreasonable and selfish. We’ve already kind of talked about it and when I mentioned living with other people she said she thought we were living together next year and has no one else to live with. Those who have been in college, is it worth being her roommate not to hurt her feelings and leave her without a roommate?	1643001530.0	sbe7au	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbe7au/wibta_for_not_rooming_with_my_roommate_again_next/	WIBTA for not rooming with my roommate again next year???
2munyry6	OK, this might seem silly to some people but I \[19F\] keep second-guessing myself.   Basically, I have been friends with (let's call her Ella) for 1-2 years. We didn't go to the same high school but we had some mutual friends. I wouldn't call us close friends, but I don't mind having a coffee with her or catching up casually. However, I'm not sure Ella sees our friendship this way.   Ella seems to think we are BFFs. Like living in each other's pockets, sleeping bag buddies, conjoined twins BFFs. At first, I didn't really mind it, since she can think what she likes, but the last 6-10 months I've felt super overwhelmed. She's (borderline...) obsessed with me. She messages me every 3-7 days asking to hang out and I keep refusing because I don't want to. When I do hang out with her I feel overwhelmed and kinda weird tbh.   It's gotten to the point that my friends have noticed it and if we run into each other on a night out, they'll create a diversion to let me get away (e.g. "Oh, \_\_\_\_ needs to go to the bathroom sorry \[my name\] can you come with us?).   I know some people who knew her from high school and they say that she was like this too and caused a lot of drama by basically forcing people to be her best friend.  I don't understand where this came from because every time we hang out all we do is talk about people we've hooked up with, which doesn't really constitute as bestie-ship for me.   There was also a time when she was obsessed with a mutual friends boyfriend and basically wouldn't be opposed to making a move on him if the opportunity arose. It made me really uncomfortable.  I feel really bad, she told me I'm her 'whole world'. I just don't want to stress myself out with dodging her when I'm going through my own personal things and stressed with life anyways.  I've tried to soft ghost her, like telling her I can't go out and not replying to her messages on time but I really don't think she's getting the message.   WIBTA if I end this friendship? And how?	1643001287.0	sbe4v8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbe4v8/wibta_if_i_endghost_this_friendship/	WIBTA if I end/ghost this friendship?
hdehi556	I (23F) and my ex (29M) just recently just broke up, due to the timing. He told me “we don’t work” and that “I can’t do this anymore” but in my eyes we were perfectly fine. Just after a week of us breaking up he got with someone new, Riah.   Of course I was hurt by this and started looking over our entire relationship of 2 years, seeing if I failed. While doing so I remembered one time when he came to me and told me about his new friend who was a girl, it didn’t bother me because I trusted him. Though I never met her he spoke very highly of her.   I didn’t take this as a red flag because I wanted him to have friends and I didn’t want to be “that girl” another time I remembered was he and I were supposed to go out to dinner so I showed up at the restaurant hoping to meet him there but 2 hours had past and he wasn’t there I got worried and checked his location to see he had turned it off (which he never does) I of course didn’t confront him about this the next day when he told me his mom had a stroke and was in the hospital.   Thinking back these should have been red flags because his mom as far as I new was fine until that night. Well around December 16th is when he and I broke up and 6 days after that I get a phone call from my friend telling me to check instagram.   I look and the first thing I see is my ex with another girl so of course I broke down and cried for hours stalking there page for days (yes I was that girl) I started noticing some of the things they posted were similar to the things he and I did like once he took me ice skating and took her ice skating, he gave me a silver heart necklace and her a gold heart necklace… these didn’t bother me much but I lost my mind when I saw what she posted on her story “just ate at this wonderful place” and of course it was my favorite restaurant “Olive Garden” (yes I’m very aware of how stupid that sounds) I got very angry and dmed her on impulse saying “does he call you queen to?” She replied asking who I was and I told her she said he does and I told her that he called me that too  I then told her he took me ice skating at the same place he took her, I told her about the restaurant and the necklace and she told me he was planning on buying her a car which he told me right before we broke up.   She stopped replying and a week and a half later my phone is blowing up with messages from him saying I was an asshole for even talking to her because she said that she wanted a break from him I proceeded to apologize because breaking them up wasn’t the goal I let my emotions get the best of me but I didn’t apologize for telling the truth because he was reusing all of the things we did but now I feel like I should tell her to get back with him because I could be wrong  So aita??	1643002048.0	sbed1z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbed1z/aita_for_telling_his_new_gf_he_did_the_same_with/	AITA for telling his new gf he did the same with me??
22d7hxsn	For context I work at a hotel. We have a "room box" where each room has there own little file thing in which the information of who is staying there and the rate at which they are paying for a room. All of the information is on the paper in said file for each individual room. On the right hand side of the form is the rate information which we use to do our rate checks. So when I was first hired I was trained that after we folded form in half we would place it so that the header logo would be facing left and so that when we would go through the box to do a rate check we could see the rate and confirm that it was correct based on the form we print for those checks. Everything was good and it satisfied my OCD aspect that things should face the same direction when it came to filing or in a cash drawer. As of a few months back my boss resigned and they hired a new person which is fine and I absolutely love my new boss to bits. But ever since she was hired when I go to do my rate check the forms are all lopsided or facing the wrong direction. Come to find out its her placing them in all wrong saying it shouldnt matter what way they go in. I have gone through and fixed the forms by hand multiple times and come back the next day to find them all sorts of messed up. Generally the way the were the day previous as if I didn't fix them at all. I have posted on the Crew app where we all communicate multiple times stating that the way I was trained to do it was the most effective way to do the rate check. I've been disregarded and it almost seems to me that they are deliberately trying to annoy me by putting them in the wrong way.

g92rct9t	Hi, I 22 female have been friends with my best friends also 22 f (we'll name her Julie) and 21 male (we'll name him Luke) for 5-6 years. I was always closer to Julie and Luke separately but the two of them didn't start becoming close til this year. Back story on Luke; Luke has a problem with staying single for longer than a month which is something both myself and Julie (recently) have spoken to him about on a daily basis. Luke recently came out of an on again off again toxic relationship with this girl (Sydney). As I said Julie and Luke only recently started becoming friends because I recommend Julie to work with Luke at his old high school. Syd and Luke hadn't spoken in two months after their last argument and about a week before the situation, he saw her at the high school's event that he was hosting and completely simped for her again. Julie and I told him that for the benefit of himself should remove him from the toxic relationship. They have been working together since September 2021. During this time all three of us were hanging out, a friendship dynamic. Neither myself nor Julie had an interest in Luke and vice versa. After the event, we all hung out again and then went through our normal week, had dinner a couple times, and came over to my house. Throughout the 5 months of us being friends did either of them disclose to me that feelings were being developed (totally in their right) Jumping forward to the incident. I hadn't heard from them this past weekend and thought nothing of it as they worked together and figured that was the case. Boy was I wrong! I was told on Sunday by Julie through TEXT MESSAGE that they had hooked up. Normally I wouldn't be pissed off at this type of stuff, we're all adults. The issue I had with it was neither of them said anything or hinted that something might have happened on Friday before it happened. Remember the Luke problem with jumping from relationship to relationship. In this case Luke had dated one of my good friends (Cassie). When he dated Cassie, it was also an on and off relationship, broke up with Cassie, started dating Sydney, cheated on Sydney w/Cassie by having hooked up w/ her, ghosting her and going back to Sydney. Morally I couldn’t hook up nor date one of my friends' ex's no matter how long it has been since they've dated or if me and that friend are still talking. I forgot to mention, Cassie is also friends with Julie and Julie used to babysit Cassie's twin little brothers. Throughout the time Julie was babysitting, she knew of Luke ghosting Cassie after having hooked up with her. Back to my situation. I truly felt that how I was told was wrong. I felt betrayed within the dynamic of our friendship and frankly disrespected that they didn't tell me in person. Now I know what I said in those text messages and I stand by what I said because that is how I truly felt in the moment when I received those messages and I can't lie and say I was sorry for how I felt.	1643001324.0	sbe5az	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbe5az/aita_for_my_reaction/	AITA for my reaction
iyou6jrr	I (24f) live in Minnesota and am a college student. My mom always insists that I carry a can of pepper spray in case I need to defend myself there, even though I never had to, possibly until the day I did.  A few days ago, I was bussing home from college when a homeless person walked up to me and asked me if I could spare some change. I didn't have much money for myself, as well as the fact that I don't pay with change, instead a debit card, so I said no, sorry, and walked away. The man then said "whatever Scrooge McN*gger."  I looked at him in shock and walked back to him and asked what his problem was, then he kept insulting me and saying other racist stuff. Worried he was gonna try and mug me, I grabbed out my pepper spray and pelted him in the face with it. He immediately started coughing and fell to the ground, so I went straight home after.  I spoke to my mom about it, but she tells me that I while that guy shouldn't have said that stuff to me, I was too excessive, saying he was probably not going I mug me, and should've walked away. I was just scared since he was saying all that bad shit, and wasn't sure what he was gonna do.

hnvowp2e	I (19f) have a bf (19m) that got a minor concussion playing broomball. If you don’t know what it is look it up. Basically running in ice. I also struggle with a lot of thoughts about him dying or getting hurt so this does not help the issue at hand. It wasn’t to bad but we spend 5 hours or so in the ER just to make sure. The doctor ordered him to rest and avoid doing things that used a thought of thinking and any physical activity.   He got the concussion about 5-6 days ago. Within those days he kept promising me things like “I’ll tell the professors I have a concussion and that doing lots of work might be hard” or “ok I won’t play hard core valorant games” (this game is something he takes seriously and plays a lot, which I play with him here and there). Guess what? He doesn’t do that. He keeps pushing himself and saying he’s well rested but when I asked if his head hurts and brushes it off and says a little but not to worry.   Fast forward yesterday night I got visibly upset how he kept doing that and he promised to day all of Sunday off from gaming and anything else. Guess what again? Found him playing the game. Now this is minor ik, but it’s the fact that he’s been making promises and just breaking them.   I finally said enough is enough and that if he doesn’t take the next three days off of gaming and physical activity, then I’ll lose part of my trust in him and be really hurt. He felt really bad and said this time he won’t do anything other then school work for the next three days.   Now I’m worried I was too harsh on him, but he needs to fully rest and makes sure he is fully ok before he goes and plays broomball again or skis.   So AITAH?	1643002497.0	sbei2c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbei2c/aitah_for_forcing_my_bf_to_rest_for_3_days_bc_of/	AITAH For forcing my bf to rest for 3 days bc of an injury or else he risks my trust in him
465zu0dd	 I can't go into explicit detail because most likely they have reddit, but I'm torn.  So I (18NB), was part of a friend group with my current best friend 'Sam'(17NB) and their ex 'Mark' (17). Over covid I didn't keep contact with either really, as I wasn't particularly close to them yet. When the school year came back around, Sam and I got really close, and I found out Sam and Mark had broken up. They were still friends, albeit drifting but it wasn't my business.   At some point before my 18th birthday, Mark and I hooked up, with Sam's knowledge and approval. It was my first time, and it sucked ass, we didn't do it again.  Mark had also been telling us about the 'person they were in love with that didn't love them back'. Sam didn't give any sympathy, I thought nothing of it and offered a little support.  Not long after that, I started joining  in a new friend group because I wanted people to smoke with, since Sam doesn't smoke. Sam does know them and has spent time with this group while at school, but never on their own outside of classes. I wouldn't say I'm close to most of them, but I can talk comfortably.   Regardless, after hanging with them a couple times, a few of them ask if I'm friends with Mark. At this point we hadn't really spoken a ton, so I said kinda, not really. They then revealed that Mark had made some pretty gross comments to them, and revealed a lot of sexual stuff to the two of them (17NB and 17M). They were pretty uncomfortable, and have just been avoiding Mark since.   I told Sam about it, and they also revealed Mark had literally drooled over another mutual friend, and also apparently watched one of the previous friends through a window. All this was just... not pleasant to associate with, so I stopped talking to Mark, and Sam kept distancing from him too.  Recently, after a class involving Mark, Sam pulled me aside and said they needed to tell me something about Mark. Without going into specifics, Mark had 'fallen in love' with a 13-14 year old, who they had a family relationship with, but no blood.   Mark told the kid about their feelings, got rejected, and this was the person they'd been telling us about for months. Sam had found out early into the school year, but had no clue so they hid it because Mark begged them to. After getting told no, Mark told his therapist and was 'working on it', according to Sam.   Needless to say, I was disgusted when I found out. I want to tell the people who already knew Mark was predatory and creepy (without revealing the identity of the kid) but I feel like people should know that Mark isn't just some helpless shy person who nobody talks to, but someone who really is super predatory to people their own age, and younger too.  I feel like Mark would probably try and claim we were making up rumors, and possibly cause a lot of issues for Sam, the kid, and the other people Mark has harassed if it becomes like a big thing.   So WIBTA for exposing a predator?	1643002267.0	sbefl8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbefl8/wibta_for_exposing_a_predator/	WIBTA for exposing a predator?
59kmdrdm	WIBTA if I didn't help my sister with her PHD to be petty? To keep this short (I'll add context if anyone needs it) but basically I ("c" 19 studying design so I have Ps knowledge) have 2 sisters and recently had a big argument with my sister "A" (early 20's). The argument was with my sister "A" and so I thought it was cool with sis "B" (late 20's) cause she never said anything to me.  Anyways day after another of me not talking to sister "A" (I sleep separately cause I need space to work in), sister "B" was ignoring me (which is usual of her she usually doesn't talk to me a-lot cause we don't see each-other and other reasons related to her (she usually is either in work or in her room), anyhow she kept ignoring me so I didn't notice anything until she sent me a message asking sth from me with in a rude way so I just didn't respond and did it anyways I let it go but I figured sis "A" prolly told a twisted version of what happened to sis "B" and sis "B" is hating me for it or sth without asking me about my version of the story.  I'm already in my finals and stressed enough to a point of me returning to doing things to myself and stuff of that kind. Anyhow I needed someone to help me with sth for a final project which basically woulda taken 4 mins max of that person sitting and holding sth so I can take a video of it without even showing their face. so since me and sis "A" are not talking (per her request), I sent sis "B" a message and asked her to help me, she obv saw it cause I heard her and sis A laughing and stuff and she is usually on her phone, she didn't respond tho so a few hours go by and me telling myself she will see it or sth, I go to her and ask if she can help me, she doesn't look at me and tells me "when I have time C" so I just take it as is and do it myself which took me hours and a lot of fails to get it somewhat right alone.  I just decide to ignore both of them because I am already in a bad place mentally and stressed and I don't need this. about a week goes by and a few minutes ago sister "B" sent me " C hru, can you help me with sth in photoshop that has to do with my PHD" I don't respond then immediately like a min later she sends *sends me pics and description of what she wants* "Tell me if you can help me please!" and I don't respond.  given that I have a final exam tomorrow and am currently cramming for it and honestly I wanna ignore her like she did to me cause all my life people have only come to me when they needed sth and now my family is doing the same and I honestly am done.  and yes I'm 19 and we all live together cause culture. also sorry if I said sth wrong English isn't my first language.  WIBTA if I ignored her and kept studying it's already stressing me out I Can't focus.  tldr; my sister who ignore me for no reason didn't wanna help me with my final project in uni then comes asking me to help her with her PHD.	1643002692.0	sbek0e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbek0e/wibta_if_i_didnt_help_my_sister_with_her_phd/	WIBTA if I didn't help my sister with her PHD because she ignors me unless she wants something
a7t5x3jk	I (f16) have recently found out my best friend is dating a creep. It started a few months ago when they had a thing but it quickly ended when he hurt her really bad and she was extremley depressed. She constantly told me how, much she hated him and how she is disgusted by him. Last week she let him drive her home when I told her I would do it. I asked her why she was letting a creep drive her home when I am totally willing to drive her home. She replied to me saying it was more convenient for him to drive her home, when in reality him and me live about the same distance away from her house.   I was extremely p*ssed off at her as I had told her before how uncomfortable I was with her being around him. I told her many times I am not comfortable being friends with someone who is also friends with someone like that. And she said okay. I ended up bawling in the parking lot and had to calm myself down before leaving. I got home and told my mom everything which took nearly an hour. Then the next day she pretended nothing happened and it went on this way for a few more days.   On Friday I decided to hand write an entire essay for her explaining why she shouldn't be associating with him because he has hurt her, and many many others. It is Sunday as I am writing this, and she never officially replied to my letter. The guy called me last night at 1am, and I haven't texted him since August. I thought it was either for what is happening or because he will do that and just call people randomly. So I texted him and asked him why. He then went on to say how I was "manipulating her" and that it wasn't gonna affect our relationship if they dated. (Which it clearly did before they were even dating) He then proceeded to (and I quote) call me a "fat a**" and "[he] didn't care more about me than a crumb on the floor"   I told him how she has told me multiple times she feels uncomfortable around him and feels disgusted by him. Then he replied with "obviously not if we are dating." And I felt the blood drain from my face. Was my best friend truly dating an actual creep? I confronted her immediately and she confirmed it. At this point I genuinely felt like throwing up. She continuously apologized but I did not buy it. She showed me by having no problem dating him she does not care about what he has done.   I told her how I was absolutely done this time, as I have told her a multitude of times, sent her about 3 literal essays now, about how he is a genuine disgusting person. I cannot do it anymore. I truly am not okay with this. So, AITA for cutting my ties with her for dating a creep?

iyo50j95	Sorry, I couldn't think of a better heading that wasn't too much of a mouthful. Anyway, here's the backstory. My (F22) childhood bestfriend (M23) Ed started dating a girl, Lucy, a few years ago. They dated for over 2 years but had some major issues that couldn't be resolved. One of the big issues was that Lucy had huge trust issues and was basically paranoid that Ed was cheating on her with me. Obviously, Ed and I were always close but we didn't have romantic feelings for eachother and Ed NEVER cheated. Lucy was really manipulative and asked Ed to stop sleeping over at my house, didn't like us talking or spending time alone and she would always get upset and jealous when we all spent time together.  At the time and now, Ed was my closest friend and so Lucy's "boundaries" took a huge toll on our friendship.  At the same time, Lucy and I actually became pretty close friends because we're really similar and enjoy doing the same things.  Ed broke up with Lucy about a year ago because of a bunch of issues in the relationship. A few months later, Ed and I realised that we were in love and decided to get engaged and married! Even though we didn't have feelings for eachother whilst Ed was dating Lucy, Lucy has accused Ed of cheating on her and won't answer my texts and has blocked me on social media. She's has also made some pretty horrible accusations which she's used to justify why she's so upset but I think she's lying and just being manipulative. Am I in the wrong for getting married? I feel like Lucy is being really unfair and that our relationship is none of her business since they broke up. I can understand Lucy being upset still, but some of our mutual friends have also cut Ed and I off and didn't come to the wedding because of things Lucy has said which was really upsetting.	1643003172.0	sbep5y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbep5y/aita_for_marrying_my_bestfiend/	AITA for marrying my bestfiend?
1sm18gyt	It's their daughters birthday, and he lives across the country. But here's some back story, tl;dr he scolded her for being with me without asking him permission and left my dog in a cage for 24 hours.  We moved in together around July, and shortly thereafter he came here to "pack his stuff and get closure" after their split. It had been awhile, and he had already moved across the country. Well, I worked 2 hours away at the time (we moved closer to my work when her lease was up, since mine had just ended) and when she picked him up from the airport, he yelled at her for being with me because she "didn't ask permission" and then had her drive around with him for almost 24 hours, meaning my dog who was at the apartment at the time because my lease had just ended was stuck in the cage the entire time I was at work. That would have been all well and good, except for the fact that he told her that he's uncomfortable having me in the apartment. The apartment that is where I now live. The apartment that has my dog, my clothes, my work clothes, my shower stuff, and the roof over my head. And she told him alright and I wasn't able to go home. For a WEEK! She left the apartment for that week and we got a hotel, but I was very unhappy and very uncomfortable with the situation and told her I don't ever want him staying with us. Now he's coming for their daughters birthday, refuses to get a hotel, and she told him without talking to me that he can stay with us for a few days. We got in a massive fight and I feel like an ass, but want other opinions.	1643003362.0	sber36	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sber36/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriends_ex_husband/	AITA for not wanting my girlfriends ex husband staying with us?
94k40f6f	Let me say this now, I have many Transgender friends who I fiercely support and respect their chosen names and pronouns. I would never purposefully misgender them.  It is important to note Bully and I were both born female. (I will refer to them as ‘Bully’) And Bully would eventually use He/They pronouns, so I will use ‘they.’  It started in the third grade, Bully was in my class. I’m not entirely sure why Bully chose me to be their target, I definitely remember us not liking each other, but in the 4th-grade things got terrible.  We were in the same class again and in the same girl scout troop. Since I didn’t have a friend in the troop I was often paired with Bully.  They would purposefully make up lies to get me in trouble with the teachers and my troop leader.  They pushed me off the swings. Teased me. Called me names. Pulled my hair.  This continued through elementary school and into middle school.  In the seventh grade, while I was at the lunch table, Bully came up behind me, threw me to the floor, knocked my backpack off the table. And sat in my chair.  I picked up my things and ate lunch crying alone at another table.  That same year Bully began spreading rumors about me.  They convinced my friends to turn against me and kick me out of the group.  My friends lied to my face to get rid of me.  I will say, looking back, those kids were not good friends. And because I left the group I found my best friends. But it still hurt.  By the time High school rolled around, I rarely saw Bully. They were in and out of ISS and we didn’t have any classes together.  I had almost forgotten what it felt like to have to worry that Bully was around.  Till Junior year came, Bully returned with a new haircut. New clothes. New name. New gender.   I honestly avoided Bully like the plague. I never wanted to interact with them. I didn’t want to give them a chance, to either reconcile or prove that they never changed.  Whenever Bully was brought up in conversation, I used their dead name. I couldn’t bring myself to accept Bully.  I remember thinking, “They showed no respect to me all those years. Why should I give it to them now?”  Now My childhood bully and I have both graduated from High school and I haven’t seen them since.  Whenever I think about Bully, I’m upset. Not just for the years of shit they gave me, but how it still impacts me today. The utter guilt I feel misgendering Bully, but also the relief I get too.  All this makes me feel horrible because of the amazing transgender friends I have. I’d be so mad if someone purposely misgendered them and used their “dead name.”  But on the other hand, While looking back through my yearbooks, as soon as I saw their face, my stomach dropped. Even typing out ‘He’ in reference to Bully made me feel ill.  It’s like my own selfish-childlike desire to get back at them. It doesn’t feel right to misgender them, but it also doesn’t feel right that they can change after all the shit they put me through.	1643003419.0	sberpb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sberpb/aita_for_refusing_to_use_my_childhood_bullys_new/	AITA for refusing to use my childhood bully’s new pronouns and name?
e2nve8sd	I have a friend (let’s call her Jill) who is travelling and asked to stay with me for a bit as she was passing through where I live, I said she could stay and offered for her to come camping as I already had that planned. Jill came camping with me, my partner and a couple of other friends. Jill and my other friend (let’s call him Bob) ended up getting pretty friendly, and around 2am decided to go for a walk together, as we are in tents you could hear them chatting about what to take and Jill offered to take one of the blankets we had lent to them to use to lay on (bear in mind, where we were camping was a muddy, foresty type of place).   First thing that annoyed me was Jill offering to use the blanket with Bob when it wasn’t hers to give AND Bob had all of his own camping gear, I asked if they could leave it as I didn’t want my stuff dirty or ruined. An hour later (3am) they come back from the walk and decide to have s3x in the tent we let Jill borrow, less than 1 metre from me and my partners tent, my partner heard everything. (he is too polite to say anything and I was asleep so didn’t hear it myself). They got everything we lent dirty after coming back muddy from the walk, all while Bob has his own tent, blankets etc.   They offered to clean the stuff, but I personally found it disrespectful for them to have s3x right next to us at 3am and mess up our stuff (that was all only used once so basically new) I would prefer to just replace it all ($150 worth). I’m very protective of my property and would never do that with anyone else’s especially when I voiced before they left that I didn’t want them to get my stuff dirty. So I just want to know if I’m the asshole if I ask them to pay for replacing the stuff?	1643003611.0	sbetyg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbetyg/aita_for_asking_my_friends_to_replace_all_the/	AITA for asking my friends to replace all the camping stuff I let them use.
iymvsfrz	I am am posting on mobile so bear with me. It’s also kind of long.   My friend, “Susie” (f20) and I (f20) have been friends for almost 8 years now and I know she isn’t the best at things that require responsibility. By responsibility I mean she’d say she’d do something, never do it and instead do something that’s similar and pretend that it’s the same. ( that’s a different story)  About 2 years ago, she got (bought) a beautiful, pure bred Siberian husky. This was around the time she was still living with her parent and didn’t have a job. I lived in a different state when she got the dog, “Ava” so I didn’t get to meet her till was almost a year old.  Now , I don’t know a lot about dogs but i know enough to get me by. I know that if a husky is bored they will chew anything and everything and I know they shed like no tomorrow.  Anyway I moved back to the same state she lived in and we decided that we should get an apartment together. (Big mistake. Still part of the different story)  I also don’t know if I made it clear that I am not a dog person. I prefer cats over dogs. (I don’t hate dogs so don’t come at me.) I think dogs are a major responsibility. And if someone adopts buys or has a dog they are expected to make sacrifices from their daily lives. Which I don’t think Susie understood And definitely never did.  Here are some examples  Of why I didn’t think she made a good dog mom.  1. She let Ava out in the backyard maybe once a day twice if the dog was lucky When we moved in together she didn’t have a stable job so I never understood why the dog didn’t get let  out more. I also only found out that the dog wasn’t being let out more only because I caught Ava  peeing and pooping in our hallway multiple times. Susie tried to blame it on my cat, my male one. I have two. (I did try to take proper precautions with the litter box like never letting the dog near it. But I don’t think Susie ever understood that a dog and a cat cannot always be best friends And constantly let Ava get in my cats business) 2. She fed the dog maybe once a day. I don’t know how much huskies are supposed to eat a day , but I figured more than once. (Haha brain power) 3. Whenever the husky would chew up her clothes or blankets or anything like that she would lock her up in her  crate  There’s more but I think you guys get the gist of it. Here’s where I am ta, we got into a heated argument because I had an early class and didn’t meet her on time and in the middle of it I told her that she needs to take better care of her dog. I am aware I probably took it too far. I apologized later for saying it in the middle of a heated argument, but I didn’t apologize for saying it all together.  We no longer live together. For different reasons, And now the dog has a huge field to run around in. I  did tell her why I thought she wasn’t a good dog mom but I still kind of feel like the TA because I’ve never had a dog personally.	1643003902.0	sbewov	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbewov/aita_because_i_told_my_friend_she_is_a_bad_dog_mom/	AITA because I told my friend she is a bad dog mom?

9tjgegek	I (32f) married my husband (48m) about 2 years ago. We have a 1 y/o son together. He has two daughters from his previous marriage 17 and 13. Me, my son and husband live together but the daughters come over to our house often- they are very close to hubby. I have a good relationship with them, but i don’t see myself as a mother to them. Their mother and my husband got divorced about 3 years ago. We met only after the divorce. I’m always posting picture of my son and my husband on social media. I once posted a picture of my son with his dad on Father’s Day. Another time, I posted a picture of the 3 of us with the caption “Family.” My husband noticed this and asked me why I would caption the picture as “family” when his daughters aren’t in the picture. He accused me of trying to sideline his daughters and making  it seem to others that it’s just the 3 of us. I absolutely don’t hate the girls but my son is the most important to me, and I feel like the daughters should be celebrated by their mother who is alive and well.	1643004663.0	sbf56j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbf56j/aita_for_not_including_my_husbands_children_in/	AITA for not including my husbands children in our family photo?
a6iqxvyp	This has happened at least 2 times in the past. The first time was when I was in high school. My parents & I decided to get some coffee after a church service one Sunday. The second time was when I was about 24 & I went to the same place to get my mother & I a coffee to appreciate & enjoy the day.    The second time, I suddenly had a funny notion when I shook her drink, some type of Americana, & felt something almost rub around the inside of the cup. I decided to be a slight investigator & go back to my house first to check out what it was inside the drink. I drank most of the Americana assuming it was actually, most likely in my head. Little did I know it remember from almost 10 years before; that this was a poor, neurotic, & absolutely psychotic treatment from a barista of the worst absolute kind; possibly because the cashier did not enjoy the thought of being showed up my mother's quick wit, or friendly discussion of whose name to put the ticket under: "Jules."    This happened again today I almost feel certain of. I went to the same coffee shop as I usually do; where they have never been rude to me, or seemed suspicious in any kind of manner. I ordered my regular drink, a 16oz Vanilla Frappe, & with the slip of the tongue accidentally mentioned the word caramel.   The lady rang in the charge for a 20oz drink; where I said nothing, paid for it, left a $1 tip, & walked outside to enjoy a quick cigarette before I walked back in to check if my drink was ready.   Being a café, you might get the hint of propensity to avoid the coffee lovers natural enemy, pretentiousness, while still remaining a calming sometimes casual & sometimes business kind of setting.    I feel the baristas need for doing such a terrible & heinous kind of act was her inability to shake off her own sense of entitlement of thinking to herself that she, the barista, could've come up with the actual word she was trying to think of to replace the word "favorite," describing her fanaticism of the artist "Jewel."   The barista became the one to come off as not only obviously over the line & pretentious; but also a complete psychopath.   Long story short;   This coffee shop should be closed down, if not charges pressed against anyone who was involved.	1643003792.0	sbevnr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbevnr/aita_for_possibly_going_into_some_kind_of_mental/	AITA for possibly going into some kind of mental "shock" when a local coffee shop put a wad of coffee grounds in the bottom of a coffee cup ordered by my mother, thinking it was a donut, resulting in her taking a bite out of it; instead of helping my dad stand up to the shop in saying something?
1zu08pp6	So my partner and I have been dating for like 1 1/2- 2 years and we have lived together almost that whole time. He moved in when his  apartment lease was up (for context)  Lately we have been having arguments because I feel like he gaslights me, controls me, and invalidates how I feel. I am 28 and he is 35, I am an army vet with a background in EMS (paramedic) and computer networking, he is an electrical engineer. I have told him that I feel like he thinks I’m stupid or not as educated as him because of his view points and comments he will make to me and sometimes (not all of the time) he will tell me I’m too sensitive or I’m just not the same person as when he met me. I’ve had to start recording our conversations or write things down because he changes his mind on things or says I threatened or acted a certain way and I don’t want him to go to the police or tell friends lies. When I have tried breaking up with him he refuses it and won’t even leave(again it’s my house) instead told me I’m materialist and I value the house and my own opinion versus him. When he has been caught in several lies which broke the rules and boundaries HE set in our relationship he was mad at me more for snooping or figuring out that he was caught in a lie. I tell him he might as well tell the truth because I’ve been around enough people to know when something is wrong. Instead he likes to point out that I’m either bi-polar or OCD or something versus accept the fact that maybe he is the problem. He will twist things around to make it seem like even though he said something to me that starts a fight because I don’t drop in and have a better Attitude quickly after the fight that I must just hate him and want to argue all day. I tell him maybe we aren’t comparable anymore and he just says I have a bad character and that I’ll never be happy and how he thinks I’m impulsive and wrong for thinking that way but he won’t leave me or go to therapy with me which I’ve asked him several times to do. It’s starting to effect me daily and I definitely don’t have the same feelings for him anymore and when I voice these to him it usually gets spun onto me and how I am the problem and I don’t appreciate him. I’m not sure at this point what to do because he invalidates me constantly and at times makes me so upset that I’ll loose my temper and yell at him to either leave me alone, to fuck off, or that I’m leaving the house because he simple won’t stop repeating the same thing over in an argument.   Sorry this is such a long post, I’m sure I’m missed some details and I’d be glad to input more if needed.

a1plagl8	So I have been friends with someone since high school and well we have had lots of ups and downs. But in 2020, it took a toll for the worse. It started off with a party where I was drunk and that particular person was sober. I had 2 other friends who were sober that were helping me but this friend was messing with me and doing stuff like asking me how many fingers am I holding to intentionally mess with me. I confronted them next day and they said it was my fault for getting drunk.  Then, a few months later, they keep making fun of my grades which I have explained multiple times in the past is sensitive to me because it's something I am passionate about, and it's something my parents always stress about. I talk to them about it then they stop for a few months. But then one day when I am not reading their chat, my group chat was talking about grades and I was the only one not there. I see unsent messages from them followed by "I'm hiding the evidence now." All my other friends said to stop talking about people behind their backs so I knew it was about me and I confronted the person, but they said "stop arguing with me, I didn't say anything" even though everyone else vouched for me. We stopped talking for a few days, then I reached out and tried to explain my perspective to them but they were not understanding. Plus they were lying. First, they said that they didn't say anything and after I told them that everyone said they did, they said they were just giving me constructive criticism (even though I wasn't there) and they kept changing the story. I just let it go, and for the next few days, they kept indirectly attacking me in our group chat just by making fun of people who like the type of music I do, the type of movies I watch, the program I am studying and just judged everything I do indirectly. Eventually, it stopped, but just this week, it started again, so I just told them I can't do this anymore and I don't want them speaking to me. That and I blocked them off all social media platforms. Am I wrong for doing this?	1643005164.0	sbfaam	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfaam/aita_for_leaving_an_old_friend_who_was_constantly/	AITA for leaving an old friend who was constantly hurting me?
7p6rxkio	I (20F) and J (23M) met on Facebook dating. He told me he thought I was pretty and the regular compliments. It was when on New Year’s Eve he showed up at my job with his sister when I never told him where I worked. ( but I work in retail so I didn’t think much about it at the time). Later that night he started texting me how beautiful I looked in the dress I was wearing , then he started describing my looks, likewise my make up, the shoes I was wearing and my hair. The comment that got to me most was when I asked him why was he saying all this and he “Cause you’re my type and I want you” that did  rubbed me the wrong way but I did let it go. A few weeks of getting to know each other passed by and led us up to this moment where out of the blue he told me “I go to your Instagram all the time and you are the most distinctive, beautiful, free spirited, beautiful soul young women I’ve ever met in my life. “ , you turn me on”. And “ seeing you the time you wore that nude colored silk dress to work when I was with my sister, I was like yeah she’s the one. It just so happened that I matched with you on something cause I was feeling you. “ and really did rub me the wrong way because I have told him multiple times I’m not interested in him and I told him once again, and he said “I want a future, to grow and develop, to eventually be your best friend and even more. But I have to get to know you first. I liked what I saw, then I matched with you. It’s a sign. Im just following through cause I didn’t talk to you at work, and because it feels so right. I’m very interested in you. “ so I left him on read and he finally snapped and said “that’s fine too fuck you” and I told him “I’m sorry I’m not into weird mfs like you” then he literally apologized called me a bitch again then blocked me .

imgsziwn	Hi, I'm applying to a school I really want to go too. But in the process, I need to write a 3-page script and storyboard it. When coming up with ideas, I used a recent personal experience that I shall now tell you about.  My mom, 35 is currently seeing someone, she goes out to see them on the weekends. I at first did not like this, but later grew to accept this. On Friday, she didn't come home from right away and didn't tell me she went to hang out with him till I called her to see what she is doing.  We had plans for the day, so I was upset. I wrote the script about the situation but exaggerated it, making it seem deeper than it really was. Flash forward to today, mom asked me about what my script was about. I told her it was about a girl who got rain checked from her mom, who went out to hang out with her bf instead. Mom said, "Is this about what happened on Friday?" I panicked and said no, it was about a chicken and a pig instead. She laughed, then said, "I would be heartbroken if you really wrote about that instead."  I now feel really bad. The script is finalized, and it is too late now to change the concept.

6xqdafmy	A couple weeks ago my friend told us that the guy she’d been seeing (exclusively for the last 8 months) hooked up with another girl when they went out to a party together and she went home early. She said that this event (him cheating on her) was the catalyst for the two of them starting to officially date.   I used to have a relationship with him (years ago and I’ve been dating my current partner for the past 2.5 years), and had experienced something similar during our relationship. I also know he’s cheated on three other exes. Politely, I said to my friend “I don’t want to make you uncomfortable but I feel you should know this” and briefly explained the past. I also mentioned that this was the past and to take it with a grain of salt because people can change. * Two of our other close friends were there and I assumed they already knew some of this (they did) but in hindsight I think I should have pulled her aside privately.    I told her this because I care and I don’t want to see her be hurt further. She told her (now) boyfriend that I said this and he came after me saying that I was disgusting for doing this and to basically shove it.   If I were in her situation and my friend knew all this and didn’t tell me I would want to know which is why I shared the info with her. It wasn’t to be malicious or come between them. I spoke to her and she said that her and I are all good but it’s between me and him. Basically I am wondering if i’m the asshole for saying something?	1643005930.0	sbfih7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfih7/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_her_boyfriend_has/	AITA for telling my friend that her boyfriend has a history of cheating
9maavtuv	In early Oct I (34F) started seeing H (24M). We’re both military and lived in the same accommodation block, things started out casual but became a very regular thing and we agreed in Nov that this wasn’t just a fling. I was seeing how things went with the age difference but it honestly felt good. I got posted out to a new unit at Christmas and we talked about seeing how things went long distance. Over New Year he came to stay with me for a couple of days in an Airbnb, I blurted out during an intimate moment that I loved him. He said he loved me too. FFWD to last weekend. For some reason (intuition?) I looked up a girl who was tagged in some old pics on FB. I’d once seen a message from her appear on his phone with lots of hearts. He said she was a friend like a sister and v affectionate. When I looked on her FB it was obvious they were a long term, long distance couple. I messaged her to ask if she was H’s boyfriend. She said she was. I told her I’d been seeing him since Oct and I didn’t know about her. I apologised and left it at that. I sent him the screenshot and said we were done. Since then I’ve been pretty devastated. Talking to mutual friends, none of them knew about this GF. He’d never invited her to come up for work parties or even spoken about her. Last night I looked on her socials (torturing myself?). She blocked me on FB but there’s other accounts. She clearly believes I’m some jealous b trying to break up her and H.  The thing is, though, I am jealous and want to break them up. I don’t think he deserves either of us. I haven’t and won’t reach out to her again though, but IATA, right?	1643005712.0	sbffya	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbffya/aita_for_being_jealous/	AITA for being jealous?
iyq83so4	This is actually on behalf of my 13 year old daughter.   We were at the store and I was checking out some clothes that me and my daughter just shopped for. One of the clothes didn’t have a price tag so the cashier asked if my daughter  could go to the help desk and get that done.   From where I was in the checkout line I could see her clearly and she was never out of my eyeline.   I WOULD NOT BE MENTIONING RACE HERE IF I DID NOT THING IT WAS IMPORTANT    Two middle aged black women were in the line before her. A counter opened up but my daughter (brown 13 year old girl) noticed that they didn’t move forward.   So she politely said ‘ excuse me I think there is a free sales executive at the counter’  The two women turned around and according to my daughter said ‘We don’t move forward unless they call us up’  My daughter did not realize this and said ‘oh sorry I don’t know that’.   However she said they quietly muttered ‘ these ratchet ass brown kids’  She got quite upset and even cried a bit  Was it that wrong to have told them to move forward?	1643006136.0	sbfklf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfklf/aita_for_trying_to_get_the_line_moving/	AITA for trying to get the line moving
g8xgpkw9	English is not my first language so I apologize  on advance I (21 f) have a very complicated relationship with my mom (50 f). The latest issue is that she got a bf which we (my siblings and I) despite -that’s another story- and she hangs out with him 4 days weekly, leaving me and my older sister to take care of the household chores, my teenage brother (he has some anger issues and need to be watched) and my 2 dogs. She also spends our father’s money (he gives her x amount of money that’s supposed to be for us) on gifts for her bf. It’s usually small random things, like shoes or towels, maybe bedsheets but recently she bought him a 6k (my country’s currency) gift. They have been “dating” for maybe 5 months now.  Now the problem starts when she tells me that she bought a bd gift for me, a 1k candle set.  I don’t like candles, never used one, it’s like 40c degrees here, why would anyone use a candle? For her bd we gave her an all paid trip to another country. She gave me candles. While I don’t think it’s about the money, knowing that she spent 6 times more on her bf made me angry, also bc the gift she gave him was more personal than mine, and it wasn’t for any special occasion. It feels like she cares more about him than about me/us. I was pissed. I felt like I wasn’t appreciated.  I want to cry, but I also don’t want to be spoiled. I know I shouldn’t judge gifts, and I should be happy she got me something (she usually doesn’t get me anything, not since I was 15) I know it’s not about the present itself but more about the thought that matters , but that’s the thing: I don’t think she even thought ab it. So I can’t help to feel like this. She doesn’t know I’m mad but I just can’t even talk to her.  Pd: money is not a problem, my father pays for 100% everything.  Pd2: I know I am a grownup, I still feel unappreciated. And I could move out but I don’t trust her with the dogs and she won’t let me take them with me.

I recently moved across the country making it a long distance relationship, and leaving him in our hometown with his roomate, and his girlfriend who he hates. Everyday we talk about how much he hates her and wishes she would go home, seeing as it wasn’t discussed with him that she would be living there and he’s very upset about it. Today he called Saying he’s considering moving out, which deep down I know he’s not going to, so I continued the conversation making jokes about making a TikTok with her about not moving out and trying to brainstorm ways to get her out of the house. Keep in mind we talk about this everyday, and today he blew up saying that he “likes me but all I talk about is sex and TikTok”. Obviously that hurt my feelings, and I promptly hung up on him. He texted me an apology almost right away after, but it’s not the first time he’s said something rude like that, and I’ve told him multiple times that words are important to me. I make sure that I think about and mean what I say before I say it, and he argues that he didn’t mean it and just said it out of anger.

46qrp42n	I'm a college student at UCLA and I currently live in a dorm with an international student from China. She just moved to the states this year to start her education here. However, I have misophonia, and when she eats, she smacks her lips really loud and chews with her mouth open. I can hear her chewing sounds from across the room, and it drives me crazy. It's so loud that as I'd walk out of the room, I'd stare at her while eating, and she chews in a way that looks like a llama. The food is visible in her mouth as she's eating and she slushes it around with her saliva while eating it. The smacking sound is coming from her lips touching each other, then letting go, and so forth.  I get really upset with her and there were times when I've glared at her, thought about yelling at her to just "SHUT THE FUCK UP!" I'm afraid to say anything because I don't wanna come across as a racist. I'm a WASP, and that's why I have been a bit worried about saying anything. I had to go on Google to look up if it's Chinese culture to chew with your mouth open and smack your lips, and people from China would say no. I also talked to my friend about this, who's American of 1st generation Chinese descent through both of her parents, and she said it's rude to have food showing in your mouth while eating.	1643006850.0	sbfrs9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfrs9/wibta_if_i_tell_my_chinese_roommate_to_be_quiet/	WIBTA if I tell my Chinese roommate to be quiet (i.e. not smacking lips or slurping) while eating?
iyqmlsco	My parents are divorced and are both remarried. My father had gotten me an oculus for Christmas. I spent the weekend at his house and everything was fine. I had to go back to my mothers house because of school. I returned the next weekend. I noticed the box was not where I left it, the settings had been changed, the oculus and the controllers were not in correctly and had looked like it had been stuffed in there, new apps had been downloaded. I asked who had touched it and why they hadn’t asked me first. He said my step sister  (23) and her fiancé (24) came over and had used it.  My father step mother and my sister and her fiancé has never used an oculus before or a vr headset. They don’t know how to work it. I was annoyed by this but shrugged it off. Then when I went to play with it the images were blocky and blurry. I restarted the headset and everything went back to normal. I went to download a game my storage was full. I had to delete all the games they had downloaded. I didn’t want to be rude so I didn’t want to say anything. Later on when I was on the couch my father had came and told me that my uncle (49) and cousin (M 22) where gonna be in town this week and they wanted to try my headset. They also don’t know how to function it. Nobody on my dads side has played with an oculus before and want to experience it.

88pvg75j	I (20f) didn’t know a good enough title but some back story. I’m not a gamer girl. I play strictly platform games and league of legends. Mainly games on switch or my computer. I’m not good at first person shooters at all and it shows. Recently my boyfriend (21m) has tried to get me to learn his favorite game, Destiny 2. Here’s the thing, I know next to nothing about the game. The way he explained it didn’t make sense and when I tried to play on my own, I immediately got shipped off somewhere and put into some type of shooting raid thing. I have no idea why it did that. So I was upset when I tried to explain what happened and none of his friends nor he could tell me what or why that happened. He played it as a joke but that didn’t calm my feelings. And then my bf told me that I wasn’t good enough to raid with them that night. Which I get, but how am I supposed to get better? He then insisted on giving me his extra Xbox to take back with college but hasn’t played destiny with me at all. When he gave it to me I said “if you do not play destiny with me, I won’t play it at all.”  He invited me to a raid today and was surprised that I wasn’t a higher level which I then recited my exact words. I was also upset at that point because he never explained that I should get the Xbox app, which I didn’t know existed because my mic on my headset is busted. When I finally got the app to work and we got into a raid, everyone ran off leaving me behind. My bf said that their names would always be on the screen so I can follow but theirs disappeared as they had traveled too far. I was upset because I had no idea where I was going and even though his friends said that they also didn’t know where they were going it was clear that they knew.  So we got into the raid and I sat there hiding the entire time. I didn’t do anything the entire raid. And since we started so late we didn’t finish. I was overwhelmed and really upset at that point but I just brushed it off when talking to his friends but as soon as I got off of voice chat. I started tearing up at how upset I was. Maybe it’s my period but afterwards, my bf told me that he won’t play destiny with me if he knew I wouldn’t play. I said that I would play but he has to play with me, not leave me behind in the dust to try to catch up. He got upset with me and said that he won’t play any destiny with me then. I want to play but I’m not good enough nor do I know enough about the game to do anything. I don’t really have an interest in playing the game but I’m trying.

iyraw4zu	Throwaway since my bf uses reddit and knows my account  &#x200B;  I (27F) have been in a relationship with a guy (24M) for about two years now and we live together, he has been addicted   to gaming ever since we met, he has gone through loud, and I mean LOUD all-nighters, screaming at his team-mates etc. I sleep with headphones on to listen to calm and relaxing music since it helps with my insomnia so I haven't been bothered by his all-night gaming experience.  But recently my pair of headphones wore out and i haven't been able to buy new ones due to events i cannot mention, i asked my bf for his pair but he said he needed to use them so instead i just tried to sleep without headphones temporarily, which caused some major problems since i could hear him game at night which was extremely annoying, i told him to turn it down which he did but it was still loud, he doesn't even use his headphones, he has speakers blasting game sounds through the house. but i still tried to ignore it since he has his own free will and i can't do much about it.  the all-nighters kept increasing and became more and more disturbing, so much more that he ended up getting fired for missing too many shifts, and asked me to cover the house expenses while he tries to find another job, i complied but he hasn't been looking for jobs at all, he's just been gaming 24/7 and talking to random people in game, so i snapped and told him "maybe if you got off your gaming setup for once and tried to lead a proper social life then you probably wouldn't have gotten fired". He got extremely defensive and told me that i can't tell him what to do and stormed out with some of his handheld consoles and hasn't came back yet.  &#x200B;  After reflecting i feel a bit asshole-ish but i think he was clearly in the wrong, then again maybe it's something i don't understand, so reddit, AITA?	1643008135.0	sbg4c8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg4c8/aita_for_calling_my_bf_out_on_his_gaming_addiction/	AITA for calling my bf out on his gaming addiction
54185fbq	I will not say what country I am in because that will cause unwanted controversy.  My school basically did one of those silly activities about who we want to respect. A lot of people said "the scientists that are creating the vaccine," or "the doctors who are helping covid patients," and stuff like that, but I said, "the military that protects our country."   I also respected the doctors, but I genuinely respect military personnel more than the scientists. Most (not all) scientists probably grew up rich and had the materials needed to get that job. Being a scientist, while it is hard, I think is way less hard than working for the military. You need to be brave, courageous, and if you are in the military, you probably didn't have the best background.  I said this to my friends and I'm told that I "value professional killers over professional saviors." I disagree.

iyselm8w	I female, found out my dad had nudes on his phone when I was just 7 years old. I was to scared to tell anyone and worried about what would happen in me and my sisters life too. I eventually told my sister a week ago and she ended up accidentally telling my mum. My mum had already known it was going on but she said she wouldn't tell him straight away that I found out because both my mum and my sister thought he wasn't mentally stable enough. They said I was being unreasonable for wanting to tell my dad what the pictures on his phone had caused me from a very young age. I had insomnia and depression but I was too young to know what it was. My mum had also told him to stop previously but he didn't. They both told me that I cant hate him completely because he is my dad but, it caused me so much trouble and stress.

For context, my dad has a history of anger issues and blows things out of porpotion when talking to his family. My uncle got covid and we would be staying at his house. My dad gave me my brother and mom (parents are divorced) the option to go stay at my uncles, stay in a hotel or not go at all.   The funeral and uncle are in Wisconsin for covid context. I wasn't comfortable flying and staying there so I said no I wanted to stay home. My dad flipped out and started comparing me going to school and going to the funeral is no different. I didn't want to go in the first place but he'd already booked the flight.   My grandmother wasn't a great person and made racist and transphobic comments towards me. Im adopted multiracial and trans ftm. My dad hasnt spoken to me in a week and I have family members calling me saying Im selfish and should have sucked it up and gone because its important to my dad. I feel im an asshole because it really would have meant a lot to him if Id gone.	1643009857.0	sbgkk1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbgkk1/aita_for_not_going_to_my_grandmothers_funeral/	AITA For not going to my grandmothers funeral
39p317zi	Hello guys,   I have a girlfriend and we had an argument about a state university tradition. The tradition is this:  At the first snow of the year, the whole men dorm in the campus (only the students of that university) goes to in front of girls dorm (no dress code but some of them half naked etc.) and block their way and scream/cheer ask for girls panties and bras. And some of the girls send their stuffs. And the guys are collecting them as loot and turning back to their own dorm.   I'm saying that i accept this is stupid but also fun entertainment for a state university and there is nothing wrong with this. She's telling that this is unacceptable in anyway and blaming me about supporting sexual harassment.

iys54le1	I (23F) have been dating my boyfriend Jake (22M) for nearly 2years.   For a little bit of backstory; my boyfriend Jake, myself and Abby (20F) worked together and were all close friends. When Jake and I began talking more romantically Abby was our biggest supporter. After a few months of dating, Jake started to get mad at me over small petty things and I couldn't figure out why. Needless to say, after we sat down and had a proper discussion we discovered Abby had been telling us both lies in order to get in the middle of our relationship. She proceeded to tell me that she had decided she could only be friends with one of us and would rather be with Jake and didn't want to have anything to do with me. Jake told her that he wasn't going to choose her over me and we both cut her out of our lives.  In the following months Abby reported me to the managers at our work for blatant lies telling them that I was stealing, "making out with Jake in the stockroom", and numerous other petty things. This continued for MONTHS. I would go home after work crying to my boyfriend about how hard she was making my life and how people would come up to me asking why I would say such horrible things only to find out she was making up things to isolate me. She would also make sure that whenever Jake was in the breakroom she would make comments about me or digs about how I'm a shitty girlfriend. The final piece that broke me was finding out that she had sent him an inappropriate photo and trying to get him to break up with me. He told her he wasn't interested and blocked her.  Though a few months ago my boyfriend went away for a week to work. On the first day, I got a text saying he had decided to message Abby. When I got upset and asked why he simply said "about her sick father. Surely you won't get mad about that". We hadn't had anything to do with her in a long time and I wasn't sure why he suddenly decided to message her out of the blue. When he got back we sat down to talk and it turns out her best friend messaged him saying how much Abby missed him and how she wasn't very happy at the moment and could use a "friend" to talk to. I told him I understood he was trying to be a good person but asked if I could read the messages as we've had issues in the past with him lying and hiding things from me. He proceeded to tell me he only spoke over Snapchat and then blocked her as soon as he got back home. He "couldn't" for the life of him remember the specifics of anything they spoke about. And I was being overdramatic and selfish for getting upset when his initial intention was simply to check up on a good friend. I understand that if they just spoke about her dad then that's not bad but he was gone for a whole week and they spoke every day and it stopped as soon as he got home. I just am struggling to understand how she only needs support for a week and then nothing as soon as his girlfriend is around.

enfrv5s8	   My mum has been sick and basically cannot absorb iron. Everyone keeps telling her to eat beetroot and liver, but it does absolutely nothing for her. Her feet, eyelids, and hands are extremely pale. The Dr said she may be losing blood internally (menopause so no period) so they did a few tests including a colonoscopy.  The morning of the colonoscopy, my dad comes into my room, after dropping my mum off at the hospital, to complain - he basically says this:" I don't feel sorry for your mother because she sleeps until 12 pm and only eats 1 meal a day, she just needs to suck it up and eat more beetroot and liver and eventually her body will be forced to absorb it. I am 55 and I am perfectly healthy (he is obese and borderline diabetic). I will give you MY report about what is wrong with your mother, she doesn't need the doctor, she needs to follow my recommendations, I will send you my report on WhatsApp."  So I said, "dad that is not the way the body works, mum has had a stressful life and we shouldn't take our health for granted, who knows where our health could be by year-end? Also, you're not that healthy."  Then he gets defensive: "You picked on me eating Aromat (ONCE, I just said dad you should cut down the Aromat because this is not good for you, yet at every single meal he tells me I need to stop eating cheese and salt and hides the salt away from me) but I am 55 and I am so healthy and fit."  So I said, "Dad, I am too busy for this, I have a lot of work I need to get done and this is not a conversation I want to be having."  He walked away whilst saying: "Fine, I won't give you my report then!"  And has basically been extremely sour and salty with me since last week Tuesday. Literally ignoring me at mealtimes and to greet me, he whistles.  The other day I was in a meeting and he walked into my room, instead of checking if I was in a meeting or not, he whistles at me. It was very embarrassing!  He also told my mother that I have a big mouth. I did not want to entertain his terrible behavior, now he is being so icey with me, I am not sure if I am TA. He knows that I have been so busy at work and he just walks into my room to come and talk shit, it pisses me off and then to top it off he says that office workers work way more than he does, and while "some people" are working, he gets to rest and relax - yet these "some people" have been helping him pay bills when his business isn't going well.  Now I am being Icey right back!	1643010865.0	sbgu9i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbgu9i/aita_for_shutting_my_dad_down/	AITA for shutting my dad down?
8ox1xxvq	My partner (24M) and I (24NB) had a long talk about my pronouns being important to me and how it was starting to bother me that he didn't respect them. That I understood that before I didn't bother correcting him because I wasn't sure he'd be a long term partner and at the time of us meeting it was still fairly new to me as well. I have come to realize that I prefer They/Them, but he still refers and sees me as female or his girlfriend. I brought it up because I didn't want it to be a sources of stress within our relationship and he got upset and thought that it automatically meant I wanted to be a boy and that he was worried that down the line I would no longer fit his sexual preference. I got upset and tried to explain that it didn't mean I wanted to be a man that I literally just wanted him to use the correct pronouns and refer to me in a gender neutral sense like using words like significant other, spouse, partner, or even by name. He refuses to do that and it still bothers me to this day, but I dont know how to talk about it without him getting confused and discrediting my identity. [It also just bothers me because it's not something I just made up and began doing after we started dating. When we met on my dating profile it had They/Them and I said it a couple times, but wasn't aggressive in correcting them so its not technically "new information"]	1643011533.0	sbh0o2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbh0o2/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_spouse/	AITA for being upset with my spouse

bi2g5u6p	Basically what the title says, two days ago I found out my mom is going to be leaving for Somalia(where we’re from) for 4 months. Her argument is a different tribe is running the government and her tribe is supposed to be running it so she wants to take it back and MP position.  I overheard her talking to my brother about how she has her ticket booked for February and she’ll be gone for four months. When I asked her when she was going to tell me that she was leaving she said I was going to tell you when I was about to leave and I casually brought up how my grad is in May and she told me she would be back May 21.  And when I brought up the fact that my grad was May 16 and asked her if she was seriously going to miss it all she did was shrug her shoulders and say you didn’t tell me the date. She knew my grad was in May and I didn’t realize I had to inform her because I assumed she’d be attending but I guess I was wrong my birthday is in March my 18th she’s already missed 8 of my birthdays, and is now about to miss one of the biggest ones.  I have seven older siblings so my mom’s already experienced everything with them that when it comes to me she doesn’t really care that much and it’s so frustrating because I try to build relationship with her because we don’t have a good relationship and she just turns around and does stuff like this all the time makes me wonder why I even try. My parents are divorced we don’t keep in contact with my dad so she would be the only parent attending but now I guess it’s going to be no parent.

3igqw4yw	I (26f) am considering giving my husband (27m) an ultimatum. He unexpectedly quit his job in retail about 8 months ago and has made almost no effort to apply for another job in these past few months. I know working in retail can be a nightmare, so I don’t blame him at all for leaving his job. But he’s been sitting at home playing video games almost all day every day since the day he quit his job. He does put in some effort  to cleaning up around our apartment, but video games and occasional cleaning are all that he does.  He says that he hasn’t applied to many jobs because 1) he doesn’t know what kind of job he wants (what kind of field, type of job, etc.) and 2) he doesn’t want to start from the bottom and work his way up in the field that he chooses. I’ve had plenty of discussions with him where I’ve encouraged him to do some soul searching and seriously think of what he wants to do for work, as well as tried to help him realize that  he’s going to have to start at more of an entry level position based on his level of education and experience (high school dimpling plus a few years do retail and restaurant experience). But at the end of the day, he doesn’t seem to want to listen to me. He wants a career now where he gets paid a solid income, but he hasn’t chosen which field of work yet.   We are dependent on my income alone to get by. I make slightly above minimum wage and we live in one of the most expensive cities in the United States. We are really struggling financially and are slowly drowning in debt. When I bring this up to him usually turns it around and say something like, “don’t worry, it could be a lot worse.” He always boasts about how he has a stress-free life of no work, no school (he dropped out of college because he couldn’t choose a major- a pattern of indecisiveness here), and how he’s “just chilling.” I’ve brought this up to him several times and he always “we’ll be fine” and “at least we have each other.”  I married this man “for richer or for poorer.” I truly love him but the lack of willingness to help us financially has become almost too much to handle. Part of me believe that he’s using me for my money, as well as for my kindness. I’m poor, but at this point, I feel more like a sugar momma than a wife. He knows I’ll do anything for him and I feel that he’s taking advantage of that.  I need him to get a job and I’m considering giving him an ultimatum- he has until the one year mark of quitting his job to find a new job for the sake of generating reliable income for us. This means he has 4 months to get a job. If not, I am seriously considering asking him to move back in with his parents.   tl;dr- aita for considering giving my husband an ultimatum for refusing to get a job after one year?	1643012532.0	sbha0t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbha0t/aita_for_wanting_to_give_my_husband_an_ultimatum/	AITA for wanting to give my husband an ultimatum for refusing to get a job?
iurl4pkc	For Christmas I got an Xbox One because our Xbox 360 decided to die on us and also because my friend got a PS4 and we were unable to play online together anymore.  I will say I'm not on it as often as my brother. I really only use it for YouTube and other videos streaming platforms but I do play Minecraft and Skyrim with friends. My brother downloaded fortnite so that he could play with a few of his friends but I also started playing it because one of my friends wanted me to try it out and despite hesitation it's not that bad of the game- I avoided it like the plague because I didn't want to deal with a bunch of squeaky voiced prepubescent boys lol.  Well since I've gotten it I probably played on it a total of 10 times, most the time I play at night because my brother is on it after he gets home from school. During the day I mostly use it for music and stuff while I clean and do house chores.  Well last night my friend wanted to play Minecraft and when I hopped on I didn't find Minecraft, so I was scrolling through and I also couldn't find Skyrim for some reason. I went to the game store and checked it out it said they were uninstalled so somebody uninstalled them.  At some point between Friday and Sunday my brother had uninstalled Minecraft and Skyrim, I was upset obviously and may have said a few things. He deleted them because there wasn't enough space and he really wanted a few more games, he already has more than five games on there that are entirely his that I do not touch.  I called my brother an ass and that he had no right to delete two of the only games I play. I told him he isn't allowed to touch the Xbox ever again and if he does I'm breaking his fingers (I'd actually never harm my brother).  He called me a fat bitch for trying to tell him what he can and can't do. He said that I'm never even on the Xbox so it's not like I was playing them anyway. I told him the only time that I play is at night or when you're at school because he's always on it when he's home.  My mom tried to intervene but it was more like she was trying to get the argument to stop while also making my brother seem like he wasn't in the wrong. She agreed with my brother that I can't tell him what to do and that what he did was okay because I'm never on the Xbox.   I left it there and I'm typing this from a friend's house now.  Would I be the asshole if I delete a few of my brothers games off of my Xbox.	1643012750.0	sbhbuw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhbuw/wibta_if_i_deleted_a_few_of_his_games/	WIBTA if I deleted a few of his games?
iyu773w1	I recently got an email from a private parking lot informing me I have a 3 year old parking ticket I didn't pay. Apparently I overstayed or something and I owe them a few hundred dollars. I had no idea wtf they were talking about so I looked it up and it was next to some convention center in Vancouver. I went to a convention there 3 years ago so it must've been from that. I'm back home in Idaho. I looked further into it and parking ticket scams are actually a big deal in Canada and I saw a documentary on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and there were lots of private parking lots scamming people with similar stuff. There was one guy in particular who got fined for something 2 years ago and they threatened him with legal action so he paid. An actual Canadian lawyer chimed in and said the company was just bluffing and couldn't actually bring him to court.   Obviously I don't need to pay this and they can't do shit since i'm not in Canada so I responded back with "I am not paying, piss off" they responded back threatening me with legal action.  I responded back to their threatening legal with "suck my dick, come to my potato farm in Idaho scumbags and collect".   They emailed me again saying they'd be bringing me to court and some collection agencies will come after me. I ignored it. They then sent me an email saying they mailed me shit to my house, the address they put wasn't my address but another man who has the same name as me and lives in the same city. We often get each other's mail.   I contacted him and he said he was also in Canada around that same time though none of us recall this parking lot so at this point I don't even know if they're after me or him. They called me and someone said "hello is this Mr (redacted)" I said yes and she said "hi so we've been in contact about your unpaid parking fee. So you actually owe us about 650 dollars because of the late fees racked up---" I cut her off and said "you fucking cunt, I have told you people to stop contacting me. I am not paying your fucking fine DO NOT EVER contact me again or I will come back to Vancouver and I will personally cover your offices with chicken shit" I hung up and blocked her number.  I havn't heard back from them yet.	1643012926.0	sbhd91	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhd91/aita_for_not_paying_a_3_year_old_parking_ticket/	AITA for not paying a 3 year old parking ticket?
b2jku9zf	Backstory: my partner and I split for a brief period and got back together. Since then most of his family decided they don't like me (fine). Anyway I'm friends with my partner's brothers ex. Bro and ex have baby together but separated. Baby daddy seeing someone new but friend didn't know. I found out two weeks ago but had a suspicion beforehand as another close friend if mine said she seen something. Anyway, my partner didn't want me to tell my friend because it's his brother and he didn't want out situation to get worse I did say I couldn't in good conscience lie to my friend. My friend has hoped they would get back together and told me they went on a night out together last week and he stayed the night (nothing happened between them but they slept in the same bed together). Told her there and then. Now his family say that I was being a shit stirrer and had absolutely no right to tell her as it wasn't my place, I took his right away to tell her... bearing in mind he has been seeing his new muse for months and also knew that a close friend of mine knew... So it was only a matter of time really before it all came out but still he didn't tell her but now apparently I do not realise the consequences of my actions and the repercussions of telling my friend and how this affects their entire family. No one is talking about his actions tho apparently it's all my fault... The only alternative I could think of was to call him and tell him to tell her but given that no one in the family like or speak to me, I didn't see that as an option. So...

iytvv72g	I'm a college student and I met this guy who's studying abroad here for a year. We met in December 2021 and started talking over the holidays and have continued talking. It's mostly friendly, but he's always teased me about random things.   I once remember that I told him I wanted to grab some ice cream that was started in his home country and he laughed and asked if I was asking him on a date. I also randomly mentioned that since I'm 5'4, I'd date anyone 5'5 or taller and he said, "You know, I'm 5'5."   He's also stayed up late to talk to me about my mental health issues and stuff like that.  I kind of like him and want to tell him how I feel, but he's told me that he doesn't really want to date people who live here as he'll be gone in a year, although he's said that he wants to move here permanently in a few years.

iytvtpta	Ok so listen, i know this sounds bad, but hear me out. I (M, 19) was chilling with my pal let's call him "Brandon" for anonymous reasons and he was talking about his dairy and how important it is to him. I shrugged it off and eventually he left the room. I decided I was a little bit curious and looked around for this supposed "diary" and I found it. It was a pink and sparkley journal- which I found odd at first but it's 2021 so I don't judge. I flipped through the first few pages, nothing special just about his life and I found this page dedicated to this girl, let's call her "Tracy" (F, 26)for anon reasons. The whole page was talking about how she was the most beautiful girl he had ever seen- yadda yadda yadda. I knew that Tracy was in our discord server, made for friends. I opened my phone and took photos of the pages. once I went home I sent them to the server. I of course being the nice guy I am, explained how creepy the pages were. He was talking about her CONSTANTLY and I found that quite weird. The server got mad at me (I don't know why lol) and said I was invading his privacy and being judgemental. Tracy said I was being a dick and I get it but they were low-key overreacting. I had the right to read it, it's public property. She wanted me kicked from the server and the photos deleted, in anger at the moment, I threatened to leak their addresses, and then I exposed all of the pages in the diary. He wasn't active at the time, I checked. After this whole ordeal I got kicked and multiple messages saying how I was disrespectful. Both Brandon and Tracy totally freaked out, blocked me on everything, and won’t talk to me, which is fair, ig but still.

arfwq8gb	So I (F21) reported my sister (F31) for stealing.  The issue may seem minor to outsiders so Im going to try to explain in details, back stories and such. Sorry for grammatik errors, english is not my main.   Me and my Sister had no-contact pretend-to-not exist type of relationship for the past 3-4 years. I hasnt always been this bad bud started to go down hill when I moved in with her and her boyfriend at 17 years of age.  As long as l can remember ive always had Depression, PTSD and social anxiety because of severe childhood trauma- so the minor things could trigger me as loud bangs, someone raising a hand n thought they would hit me, and such. So for years I didnt go to school, I just hid in my bed, never walked out if I wasnt certain everyone was asleep.  And this was the reason why my mom thought it would be good for me to move in with my sister- and it worked for awhile. I started to feel better but quickly tombled down again. I was very difficult to live with, i know this,  and ive tried and struggled to function normally outside of my home. But when I lived there... I wasnt allowed to be me.  I was forced to become a vegan, otherwise i would be kicked out. I got yelled at if I bought the wrong gifts. I got yelled at for ruining their wedding because I bought a new airfryer to 'em.  I bought my own beds I wasnt allowed to get, "cuz I left them at their home so the beds belong to them"   I dont know what its called in english but as I turned 18, I recieved money from my childhood trauma person, not the person persay but like the goverment?? But I wasnt allowed to have that kind of money of my Sister so she had them til 2021, when I was going to move in with my boyfriend. I asked for my money so I had the possibility to buy us some furniture, but she wouldnt. She said I needed to write HER  a list of things I was going to buy with my money, before she transfer. I got mad, because we had the apartment, to move in we needed to pay for the deposition (?) + first month of the rent which was 1000$ each.  The situation at hand that happened 2 days ago. We have a messenger group with the siblings and mom, sister posted a picture of mugs that I got from my grandpa (motherside) that I got when I tyrned 18. Mugs that are very sentimental to me, as it was like my first "adult" gift. And for the past 4 years, Ive wanted those mugs back but been difficult to reach out as these days, my Sister gives me so much anxiety and dread. I tried to make on of my older brothers to ask for the mugs but they denied . So I asked,  2 days ago, about the mugs.   Oh... she gave rhem away to a workfriend of hers, and wouldnt give me the name. I told her it wasnt hers to give away and should tell her workfriend it was a misunderstanding, and the mugs was mine.  But she wouldnt listen,  so I reported her for stealing.  So.

iyuo24v1	My Norwegian bf says I am racist but I am white myself so I don't think he is right. I decided to post here to find out.  I met my bf online and moved here to be with him last year but so far I haven't made any friends.  People don't smile at me on the street and I think they don't like foreigners.  Yesterday I told my bf I was really happy because finally someone smiled at me when I was ice skating but that in general Norwegians and unfriendly and unwelcoming.  My boyfriend said I am racist and that I should have made more of an effort and that I can't make friends sitting at home all day.

iyu16t7v	I (39f) am a single mother with a daughter we'll call her Beth (18f). We lived together after her father has exhibited... concerning behavior. My ex husband Rick (43m) has always wanted to get back into Beth's life. I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but he's been pestering me about it. I've expressed the idea to Beth, she opposed. But Rick keeps reassuring that he is a changed man with changed morals. He even bought her a car.  I invited Rick into our home, without Beth's knowledge. I didn't expect her to come home so early, but apparently she had a half day at school. She was outraged, complaining about why I'm "opening up my legs" to Rick and accused me of being a whore. She's very upset because of Rick's behavior. I showed her the new car. She ended up rejecting, spitting on it, and opposing Rick at every situation. Rick decided that we needed to talk at the dinner table. We did.   Rick explained how much he's changed and he had another gift for Beth, something he saved for her 16 years ago. He goes to his car and brings out something large. He suddenly turns off the lights only to reveal Beth being dicked down by a large vibrator. She loved every second of it and thought it felt good. Then Rick made me give her a rim job and forcibly puke all over her ass. Then Rick made me lick the puke out of her ass alongside her shit in her asshole. Then he shoved his cock into my throat and I sucked all of his babies out.  Then me and Beth made out while Rick fucks me in the ass, while fucking Beth with a vibrator in her ass. Then we both sucked his cock like lollipops. Cum was all over our faces. Then he shoved his dick into our eyeballs, until blood is all over us and gunk of flesh. Then he opened Beth's brain, killing her, and sticking his dick inside it. He fucked her brain in and out. Then he made me eat her brain. We threw her dead body in the trashcan where Rick ended up fucking her deceased pussy. Then Rick made me fuck my dog.

7jxw347o	Context - My girlfriend is going on a trip for 10 days this Friday. I asked her last week if we could go on a date night before she left. I asked her about this more than 10 days prior to her trip, to which she responded with "Yeah let's see, I'll try", so I asked her to scratch it since I understand she might have errands to run. But now she tells me she is planning a night out this week with the exact same friends she is going on the trip with. I'm a lil upset about this since all I asked for was 2 hours of her time this week before she goes away for 10 days. What's beyond me is that she has no problem spending an entire night with the exact same people she is going to be with for the next 10 days.   Before you all give your opinions, I should specify that she did not say no when I asked her for a date night, but the tone with which she said she'll try made it sound like she wasn't very enthusiastic about the idea.	1643014839.0	sbhubw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhubw/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_girlfriend_for_having/	AITA for being upset at my girlfriend for having a sleepover at her friends.
a0k1c7j6	It's been bugging me for a while and I can't tell if my feelings are reasonable. So I've this friend who I considered by closest and best friend. We've talked pretty much every day day for some time and share everything. And I've made it perfectly known how much I value this friendship and consider him my best friend. To me a 'best friend' felt like a very valuable relationship and something to cherish.  A while ago he started talking and spending a lot of time with another new friend. That's completely fine, we both have multiple friends so absolutely no problem there. When it started to become a little annoying is when in a lot of situations or discussions he started putting this new guy at the same level as me. But alright fine, that's still just me being annoyed for no real reason and being insecure. I can understand when it's just me being petty.   Then it gets worse. In some conversations or another I think jokingly brought up me being his best friend. To which his reply basically was "I don't have best friends, to me all friends are equal and I treat everyone equally". What the fuck does that mean? All friends are equal? Then a friend you made a week ago is equal to our friendship? Why did I invest so much time and effort in this friendship then? If everyone is equal then there was no point in caring so much about you, go find some new replacement since it's all the same to you.  To which he basically claimed that my mindset is toxic. That it's just me being insecure and I'm the only one whose creating a problem. Which I can agree to SOME extent, but I think those were some people valid human feelings which he refused to handle properly. I'm not asking him to not talk to someone else, of course not. Just that he makes an effort to show him he values this friendship as much as me. His complete refusal to understand my feelings annoyed me to no end.   Now the event that broke it for me. I found out that he's been complaining to that other guy about me complaining about being his friend. Now to me that's just a straight up asshole move. I had told him about my issues with his behavior in private, to someone I had considered my closest friend for a while. To go complain about that to literally the person that started this entire issue is just a straight up breach of privacy.  His argument? 'I've been complaining about that person behind his back as well so it's only fair he knows it'. Yeah I've been doing that so I can communicate to my 'best friend' my feelings so we can work it out. Not so he can run and complain about it to someone else. It's like his arguments are technically correct on paper but that's not how it works lol. That's not how emotions works!   Am I just insecure and petty and made an issue out of nothing? Or were my feelings reasonable and I had valid reasons to feel frustrated by his attitude?	1643014847.0	sbhufs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhufs/aita_for_feeling_frustrated_about_how_my_friend/	AITA for feeling frustrated about how my friend views our friendship?
ixhr12i4	I (21f) am at a loss for what to do. My SO (22m) and I are constantly fighting about the state of our apartment. Some background, I will completely clean a room, say the kitchen, only to find that later in the day, the kitchen counter is covered in garbage, food, and dirty dishes. He will not empty his old food into the garbage or use the garbage disposal. Instead, he leaves the food in the bowl or plate and will put it on the counter next to the sink.  We have talked about how he treats our apartment and how I try to keep up with the cleaning, but nothing changes. He also has a habit of telling me he will take care of something (his dishes, garbage etc.) but will not do it. I often wait days and sometimes have waited weeks, before I go ahead and take care of that. This results in him getting upset and yelling at me because he was going to do it and I did not give him a chance to. I feel like I'm an asshole for not giving him a chance to take care of things himself.

4tbm1kv0	Me, W14 and my ex M16 have “dated” on and off for the past 3 years. This is kinda hard to explain but i’ll do my best haha. Basically we’ve like each other for 4 years now, and we have “dated” on and off for the past 3 years. I say “dated” because it was strictly and online relationship as he would not hang out in person. He had said through this entire relationship that we could not hang out due to the age gap, which i always thought was fair enough. PS, we on and off talk when we are not dating if that makes sense. In december we weren’t talking that much and I was hanging out with some of his friends. They had told me that he has meet someone (His friends do not know about our relationship due to the age gap) and obviously I was intrigued and asked who. They told me it was a girl that was two years younger than him (my age) after I heard this I was confused because he said we couldn’t hang out bc of our age. After talking to his friends a bit more I found out that my ex has been hanging out with her for the past week one on one. (I have to mention that this girl is one of his friends friends, she is from out of town and his friend brought her over) I was very confused at this because I was wondering what his friend was doing during this time. It turns out that My ex completely ditched his friend to hang out with this girl. Once i found out this information i messaged my ex asking about it. (we weren’t on good terms as he had ghosted me) I asked him about this girl and said “So what’s up with (her name). I don’t understand why you are hanging out with her when she is the same age as me and you said that was the reason we couldn’t hang out” and also to mention that he obviously is intrested in her. He replied with “the age wasn’t the only reason that we couldn’t hang out” I said “what was it then.” He continued on to say “We couldn’t hang out bc I told everyone that i would never date you. But that was before I was interested” I am obviously distraught at this because he had told me he loved me. And also to preface he would’ve told people this 4 years ago. So it’s not like they would remember. But I honestly don’t know how to feel because during the whole time during the relationship it was very off and on at some points, then at other points it was the best thing i’ve ever felt. I feel like I am the asshole because i made a big deal out of it but then again he also dropped me for another girl without telling me ( we always end up talking again at some point so I would’ve liked to know that he found someone else) . And just for some more context, as I said this girl is from out of town, and she only came over because of a my exes friend, so he will never see her again. So i’m confused as to who is the asshole? I’m sorry if this is hard to understand but i’m just not sure how to explain it. I did have to summarise this as well bc this is hard to explain as it happened a few weeks ago.	1643014770.0	sbhtf2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhtf2/wibta_or_my_ex_a_patchy_relationship/	WIBTA or my ex?

iytfx0jf	Basically there is this tournament thats held monthly and I cheated in it. The tournament is a battle royale game and I had two teammates. It consists of 3 players on each team and it was last one standing wins. So before the tournament started, I got messaged by one of the other teams asking to indirectly team on someone. I took up the offer (with my team also agreeing to it) and ended up doing decent.  All's well that ends well right?  So, a few months passed and then the day came. Someone got evidence of our chat history and is now in the process of exposing us. I told my teammates that we were gonna get exposed and I was ready for the consequences. However, my teammates started saying stuff like "if anything happens we can just let jake (me) take the blame" Is it greedy of me for wanting my teammates to also take the blame? We've been friends for two years and I felt really betrayed after realizing that's how they think. I get that its better for one person taking the blame but they decided that I would take the blame without even saying anything to me.

iyvqdn84	so i (19M) am sexually seeing a girl (19F), we are thinking of taking it further into a relationship. we both agree on this, however i told her that i wanted to talk to her.  she asked what's up, and i said it flat out, we need a serious convo. That i have an ''inner darkness'' about me. She didn't understand what i meant, basically this is what it is - everyone thinks i'm a good guy, and i am usually nice to most people, but that shouldn't mean that people should underestimate me or try to walk all over me.  She said she doesn't walk over me and i said i know that, i said i'm just reassuring we, once we start dating, if any guy tries to do anything bad to her, that they will have to deal with me, and that i can be scary when i'm serious, so i said to her just make sure there's not any guys who try to take advantage of her, because she's friends with some quite aggressive douchey guys. Some of these guys will call me weak or try to show their dominance or talk shit. I told her that these guys who touch her ass "jokingly" will have to stop or they'll have to deal with me and they don't want to deal with me.   she seemed confused, but said ok. I told her again that my ''inner darkness'', as i like to call it, is something that is with me. On the outside, i'm a good guy but when i want, i can be a real mean bastard. she seemed confused as to what i meant, now she told her friends i was saying weird shit and one of them called me asshole.

7au86zd3	Sorry if this intro is too long but I feel that this decision needs a lot of context.  My (56F) mother and I (17F) have always had a pretty rocky relationship. She has displayed favoritism for my sister (21F) and treated me pretty unfairly. She used to yell at me all the time, now it is less frequent, but things often get tense. She can also be very controlling and uptight. I know these issues are a result of her anger issues and anxiety but it makes being around her difficult. To be honest, I love her, but I don't like her very much. I have never really forgiven her for the way she treated me throughout my life (my father and my partner (18M) both agree it was emotional abuse). Even though we have both made an effort to improve our relationship, it is still unpleasant for me to be around her.   Despite all of this, I am very kind to her. I almost never yell at her even if she is yelling at me, I never express my dislike for her in any way, and I make an effort to keep our relationship good and let her in to my life. I spend a lot of time either in my room or at my partner's house because I don't like spending time with her. She has requested that we have dinner and hang out one night a week, which I agreed to because I don't want to make her sad.   During holidays I am always invited to my partner's house, as I am very close with his family, but per my mother's requests I spend all the important time (Thanksgiving dinner, Christmas eve/day, etc.) and any other time she wants for holiday related activities with my family. My mom really enjoys the holidays and we have a few family traditions that we do during the weeks leading up to Christmas. I would really rather spend the time with my partner's family. We get along much better and I have more fun and never feel uncomfortable. I am often uncomfortable with my family. But, I care about my mom, and I don't want her to be sad, so I do what she asks.  After I graduate this year I will be heading to a 4 year university. I am really looking forward to moving out of my mother's house. I am seriously considering spending the holidays with my partner's family, as they have made it clear I am always welcome to stay with them and they would love to have me there. My holidays would definitely be more enjoyable if I did that. I would probably still live with my mom during the summer.  I'm not sure how this decision would go over with my mom. She will definitely be very sad, and probably get mad at me as well. I'm afraid that she may try to punish me or force me to stay, but I don't know how likely that is, she isn't totally evil.  I really don't want to hurt her feelings but I also want to have a chance to really enjoy my holidays.

iyv3agu8	My (40f) son Matt (18m) lives with me. His father is not in his life. He left when Matt was 12. Ever since, Matt has become reckless. Failing grades, going out drinking, etc. His curfew was 12am, but now because of his behavior, I am changing it to 9pm. I know he's 18, but he still lives under MY house. Until he can get a place of his own, he needs to obey my rules.   Thing is, Matt didn't take kindly to this. He's started opposing me in almost every way, such as starting parties once I'm gone or calling my cuss words. I confronted him as to why hates his mother so much, to the point where I cried. He dried my tears and said he's a monster and probably needs therapy. I told him he's my beautiful boy and I love him. For some reason, he took me to his room to show me something.  From that point on, he slowly unzips his pants and shoes his 9 inch cock in front of me. I haven't seen his cock since he was a 10-year-old boy. I didn't realize it became that big. Then, he tied my wrists and dicked me down on his bed. He fucked my pussy until his cum was all over it. He shoved his big dick in my mouth until it was down my throat until I gagged and puked all over it. He licked my puke off and stuck his fingers in my ass.   He fucks my armpit and cums on it, licking the cum off my armpit. Then he tossed my salad and licked my leftover shit (I just pooped an hour before this and forgot to wipe) and kisses me afterwards. He fucked my eyeball until blood leaked on his cock and now I'm blind. He fucked my ear too. Stuck his cock inside it and now his manhood is full of earwax. A week later he gave me STDs and cancer.

dyok37p8	Throw away account for privacy. I’m going to try and explain both sides as best as I can. I absolutely love giving/making people gifts. It’s pretty much my love language. It brings me insane amounts of joy to be able to give someone something. Anyways, my husband is the only one that works. I actually work with him, but more as a helper because he’s technically self employed so I just help him because we enjoy working together and spending time together. But he is the only one that gets paid. So he will from time to time give me money that I’m allowed to spend on anything I want. No rules on what I can use that money for. Or so I thought. Today we went somewhere together and we saw these super cool shirts and I really wanted to gift him one. Well, I have a bit of money saved up so I made it clear to him that I really wanted to use my money to gift him one of the shirts. He said he appreciated the thought, but we didn’t have the money to buy the shirt. (We’re currently in debt and don’t have much in our account) The shirt was about $60. But I assured him that he didn’t need to worry because I wanted to use my own money that I’ve been saving up to buy him the shirt. He kept declining saying that it’s okay he doesn’t need another shirt. Finally, I got exhausted trying to reason with him. So I stopped trying and told him I was ready to leave. Side note: giving gifts to him has ALWAYS been hard for me, even when we aren’t in debt and have plenty of money. He never wants to accept any gifts especially ones that may be a little more expensive. So anyways we left and he could tell I was frustrated. His side of the story is that the shirt was too expensive (it was a shirt from Disneyland so yeah it was definitely overpriced) and that I should use my money on myself instead of constantly trying to buy him gifts. He also feels like if I’m just going to spend the money he gives me on gifts for him, he would rather I use it on groceries or getting needed maintenance done on our car. But I’m frustrated because it’s supposed to be my money and yet I feel as though I can’t spend it on a single gift for him. And I get the greatest joy from gift giving. So we’ve been irritated at each other. He understands where I’m coming from but he also wishes that I would use that money on myself or just keep saving it up. I see that he’s worried about money but at the same time I’ve been saving that money for months so that I could get him a gift eventually and for him to turn down a gift really hurts me.

29rib1ij	This winter semester was my first university semester and about a week ago I failed one of my exams. I'm retaking it in two days and even if i fail it again I can retake it one last time before I would have to retake the class next winter semester. My grandmother heard from my mom that I failed and today I get a call from her to inform me that everything was already arranged for me to start tutoring lessons and she just needs to go over with me when and where these lessons will take place and she wants to do that in person. This was my first time hearing about this but I came over to her place and as soon as she started talking i stopped her and asked her why she didn't ask me first whether tutoring is what I want. Because it's not. She was clearly shocked and started talking about how she just wants the best for me and was sure I would agree. After this I told her that whatever she thinks is best for me doesn't matter if it doesn't meet with what I want to do and she should've at least asked me. Then we talked for a bit and came to the conclusion that I won't be taking any lessons and i left. Later today my mom told me that she was told by grandma that I was being quite rude and disrespectful today and I got a lecture about it.

iyw5x3el	Someone got me and my friend a bunch of tickets for some concert that had a bunch of rappers or hip hop people come over from the US. I havn't heard of any of them so IDK if they're that famous or not, but I don't listen to rap music anyways. I think my friend's girlfriend pickpocketed the tickets from a scalper or he left his bag somewhere, I can't remember.  Anyways we're at the event and someone is drunk and throws an empty beer can on stage. I'm pretty sure that's normal at an event like this. I think some girl threw her bra at the dude. He just stops in the middle of the song and says some stupid shit like "Yo I'm from America, whenever someone throws something on stage it freaks us out because we think we're getting shot at, I don't know what its like in (our country) but if you do it again I will leave"  He continues singing and people throw shit again. I think probably 1/3 of the people there or meaybe even 1/2 dont speak English or didn't care. He stops and screams and he talks in a weird accent or dialect we don't undersatnd. Why do black people in America sound differently, they're hard for us to understand sometimes. He just cursed a lot and left outside. I remember him specifically saying "you all some stupid ass niggas fuck you rude asses"  I thought it would be funny as he's already triggered to throw some more beer cans up. So me and my friend threw like 10 beer cans on stage. He turned around and said "fuck you bitches" after I did that. I have never seen anyone so upset anymore. If this got posted on youtube please tell me and post the link in the comments, i searched and couldn't find it.  Anyways my girlfriend is pissed at me saying she really liked his voice nad blamed me for making him leave. He already decided to leave so i don't think its my fault and that guy is just a whiny baby, nobody else acted like him during the event. The next guy was performing and someone threw a beer can at him, it was near his leg so he kicked it in the air and went up. It was pretty funny. The next guys were chill, i remember one of the rappers told the guy to come on stage who was throwing beer at him. He came on stage and was so drunk he fell back into the crowd. Another dude came up and didn't understand anything because he doens't know enlgish and just said curse words,pulled out a knife and put it in the rappers hand and he then went back into teh crowd.   So yeah I think my girlfriend shouldn't be mad at me, everyine knwos people get drunk at concerts and he was just a whiny bitch who talks about how "hardcore" and "street tough" he is but can't handel a few beer cans.	1643017387.0	sbihe6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbihe6/aita_we_at_a_concert_caused_a_rapper_to_rage_quit/	AITA we at a concert caused a rapper to rage quit?
iyv67xzi	I know people will say this is a troll but it’s really not and there’s some backstory behind this.   I (m29) and my wife (f27) decided to get a German shepherd puppy and got him today, now she wants to name him adolf after the dictator. She is from Croatia and we live in the United States currently. She wants to name him adolf because the dog is German, but I tried to convince her that it is not acceptable here in the United States. I keep trying but she will never even consider naming him anything else, and I spent hours making a list of German dog names. I really don’t want to be “that guy” with a German shepherd named adolf and a blonde European wife when I’m going to the vet or walking the dog in the neighborhood. She told her parents it’s name is adolf and now it’s pretty much solidified and no going back according to her. I know people are probably like: WTF? Clearly you’re NTA, but she kind of convinced me I might be.  She is Croatian and she accused me of being insensitive to her culture by not letting her name the dog adolf as Croatians played a part in ww2 and many worked for the German side. Her great grandfather was a pretty prominent Croatian leader supporting Germans, and he even has his own Wikipedia page. She says that I am disrespecting her and her heritage. Idk how things like this are in Croatia but in the United States I assumed these things are seen as horrible so I tried to get the dogs name changed.

65147	I lean towards having anxious tendencies when I'm with an avoidant partner. I've learned that if I just get some reassurance before he just disappears off the face of the planet for a few days I can better cope and not send myself into a sprial of negative thoughs. This usually happens once a month when he needs to take a break, most of the time it comes from having a disagreement turn into an argument. Throughout this process I have learned for myself what I need to do to feel ok during this time. For me, I feel as though I'm being rejected. I've identified some things that would help me out to feel safe and secure while still giving him the space he desires. I have suggested that he can pick from these things to give me some reassurance before taking that time, sending something during the time away, writing a note to me during the time away, telling me how he feels about us before he leaves, or telling me things he's written in the gratitude journal we have to write positive things about each other.   He did this to me again this past weekend. It wasn't the normal we had an disagreement that lead to an argument. We had had a serious conversation during the week about my need for security and why I don't have that. At the time it felt very loving and understanding. I have no clue if he need to take a break because of this conversation, all of the other factors in his life or a combination of the two. All I know is this causes a huge amount of internal distress for me. It feels like a breakup that comes out of left field but at this point it's a cycle. I'm just asking for a bid for connection before being forced into no communication.

iyw21j16	I (20F) am currently dating 20M. We’ve been together for almost a year now and things are going great. However, there’s a huge dilemma. The decision on what I should do is pretty divided between my friends, which is why I’m posting it here.    Last month, my boyfriend took me to meet his family. Specifically his dad and sister. I was in absolute shock when I saw his dad. My boyfriend’s dad and I use to have a “friendly” relationship. It lasted for less than a few months and fizzled out before I met my bf. I want to disclose I had NO IDEA that was his dad. I would have never gotten into this relationship if I knew. His dad and I both pretended we had no clue who each were, but later that night (when we all left) he texted me and was pissed beyond belief. He thinks I did this on purpose to get back at him (100% not true, I’m the one who ended things in the first place anyways) and demanded I tell his son. I refused.  I don’t want to ruin my relationship over a fling that was so long ago. His dad and I no have feelings for each other at all.   A handful of my friends think I owe my boyfriend and should tell him, while others agree with me that my past “relationship???” is my business. I do feel guilty though and wonder am I an asshole for refusing to tell him..	1643017987.0	sbimk9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbimk9/aita_for_refusing_to_disclose_details_about_a/	AITA for refusing to disclose details about a past relationship?

Conditions at her home are not ideal financially not emotionally.  So other than her college fee and other big expenses, I have been catering to her. She didn't ask me but it was clear that she does not have money other than to eat 2 meals a day. I am not rich or have extra money but enough to manage both of us by making some sacrifices. Back in college we went to few romantic trips here and there where I financed for both of us. Cut to now, we are out of college with entry level jobs, living together. This week she is going on a trip with some of her friends and she didn't invite me. I am also not feeling good about her one friend who has been hitting on her since forever.

iyva0y0u	This happened a several years ago when my ex(f), her new boyfriend(m) and I(m) were around 21 or 22. My GF and I broke up, but we remained friends and played D&D together on a weekly basis. Several months after our break up I found out she had started dating this other guy who I knew from a local game shop. Everyone considered him a jerk on a good day and he had even bragged to me about several concerning aspects of his past relationships to the point I was a little concerned for her saftey. I was worried about her, but as her ex I felt like I was the last person who should be giving her relationship advice and it was honestly giving me alot of anxiety and depression. I didn't say anything to her and shortly after I found out I decided to just dustance myself from them and even left the weekly D&D game which ended since I organized and ran the game. She knew why I was distancing myself, but I didn't tell her any of the specifics. Ending the D&D game hurt my ex because she liked being friends and really enjoyed our game. A little while ago my ex and I started talking again and she broke up with the other guy, but we have avoided talking about that relationship.	1643018376.0	sbipqf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbipqf/aita_for_wanting_to_warn_my_ex_about_a_creep/	AITA for wanting to warn my ex about a creep
arfwq8gb	So I (F21) reported my sister (F31) for stealing.  The issue may seem minor to outsiders so Im going to try to explain in details, back stories and such. Sorry for grammatik errors, english is not my main.   Me and my Sister had no-contact pretend-to-not exist type of relationship for the past 3-4 years. I hasnt always been this bad bud started to go down hill when I moved in with her and her boyfriend at 17 years of age.  As long as l can remember ive always had Depression, PTSD and social anxiety because of severe childhood trauma- so the minor things could trigger me as loud bangs, someone raising a hand n thought they would hit me, and such. So for years I didnt go to school, I just hid in my bed, never walked out if I wasnt certain everyone was asleep.  And this was the reason why my mom thought it would be good for me to move in with my sister- and it worked for awhile. I started to feel better but quickly tombled down again. I was very difficult to live with, i know this,  and ive tried and struggled to function normally outside of my home. But when I lived there... I wasnt allowed to be me.  I was forced to become a vegan, otherwise i would be kicked out. I got yelled at if I bought the wrong gifts. I got yelled at for ruining their wedding because I bought a new airfryer to 'em.  I bought my own beds I wasnt allowed to get, "cuz I left them at their home so the beds belong to them"   I dont know what its called in english but as I turned 18, I recieved money from my childhood trauma person, not the person persay but like the goverment?? But I wasnt allowed to have that kind of money of my Sister so she had them til 2021, when I was going to move in with my boyfriend. I asked for my money so I had the possibility to buy us some furniture, but she wouldnt. She said I needed to write HER  a list of things I was going to buy with my money, before she transfer. I got mad, because we had the apartment, to move in we needed to pay for the deposition (?) + first month of the rent which was 1000$ each.  The situation at hand that happened 2 days ago. We have a messenger group with the siblings and mom, sister posted a picture of mugs that I got from my grandpa (motherside) that I got when I tyrned 18. Mugs that are very sentimental to me, as it was like my first "adult" gift. And for the past 4 years, Ive wanted those mugs back but been difficult to reach out as these days, my Sister gives me so much anxiety and dread. I tried to make on of my older brothers to ask for the mugs but they denied . So I asked,  2 days ago, about the mugs.   Oh... she gave rhem away to a workfriend of hers, and wouldnt give me the name. I told her it wasnt hers to give away and should tell her workfriend it was a misunderstanding, and the mugs was mine.  But she wouldnt listen,  so I reported her for stealing.  So.

g23b3p7v	Apologies in advance for my English level. I'm living in the middle of Europe in the country with Slavonic language (Poland), so my grammar may be off. Also this may be a little chaotic since it's my first time posting and I don't know which facts may be relevant for you to understand our situation.  I'm (23f) living with my husband A (26m) and last night my brother J (16m) "run from home". My dad (50m) called me, and said that thay argued badly - despite my questioning,  dad didn't want to tell me what happened,  just said they needed break from each other. J had already packed his bag and planned to go alone by train (I live 500 km away from them), but they didn't approve of that so they are willing to drive him all the way here if I agree to shelter him for a while (he has winter break, so no schooling issues rn). It wasn't news to me as I portray our parents as toxic and dangerous to our mental health, because of things they did to us, so I didn't hesitate for a moment. J then texted me saying "I'm comming to your city, please don't call as I am not in environment in which I can safely speak", and when I asked him what the hell happened there, he told me, that two days ago when my mom picked him up from a friend, she smelled something of him that reminded her of cannabis (she smoked it couple times before as adult when it wasn't legal yet). When they went home, they argued, grounded him and left conversation. The thing is, J said he never smoked anything (not weed, not cigarettes, not even vapes), his friend had vape liquids smelling like musk when J was at his place, and despite all explanations they didn't believe.   Edit: I don't really know how to navigate here since it's my first time posting and there was something about character limits. I wan to try if posting rest of my story below will be visible since idk how this works.   Some of you may wonder why I believe J over our parents in this,  when I might be wrong. The thing is, my bro came to me over year ago when he first started drinking alcohol. He confessed, I listened, voiced my concerns about his age and never scolded him about it. The reason he got himself a drink then was because of our parents, and how our mother (47f) said J is a piece of 💩, no one cares about her and how cruel everyone is to her at her work. You get the picture. That's one reason why I believe J would talk to me if he did smoke, another - I'm the only person in our family who never tried any substances and Idon'tjudge if anyone does. I don't smoke, don't do drugs, hell I have never drank a sip of alcohol willingly - I only once got a sip at 12 at the party when my mothers and mine glasses were switched, but even then I ran to the bathroom and spilled it out with disgust. This happens everytime, even with chocolates with little alcohol, and everyone knows it well. In addition me and my husband have agreement in whitch when he wants to get himself a drink we kiss beforehand so I dont get the taste of it, and I don't "demand a kiss later", he can drink all he wants and even then I get to have some additional affection so both of us are satisfied. Anyway, back to the topic. The next day (yesterday) when J thought they had given up scolding him about it, they went off the rail. They demanded confession for over 3 hours of argument to the point that J considered consequences of making false confession just to get them to stop. Then he told them just to test him if they wanna see for themselves. They agreed and dad drove to pharmacy to get fast spit test. But behold - then they said " he didn't want to take test, because he peed just before dad got it home". This argument is inconsistent since they went to get him (I repeat) a saliva test for this exact reason! That was the last straw for my little brother, he felt abandoned, betrayed and abused, so decided to come to me, and all of that I learned from him through texts. Lile I said earlier, my parents decided to drive him to me for 5 hours, but when they all got here at 10 pm, my parents decided to come back home immediately without any explenation of the situation to me or my husband, and just threw some money on the counter for essentials for J. I decided to play dumb and asked them what had happened and just to stay for 10 minutes to explain and deescalate situation. All they said is that my dad has work the next day at 8 am and he needs to go back (they would be at home at 3am so he would crush a nap before work) his work is not strict, he could easily start it at 10 am as he had done already multiple times, but they used it as excuse to get back anyway. They also told us not not to be such AH since they are emotional now and we don't understand how it affects their feelings, and we can't demand explanation on the spot since it's not our business. The thing is, we went back home 2 days ago, we were at my FIL funeral since he suddenly died last monday. It crushed me and my husband badly, and they know it since all 3 of them attended funeral on friday. Even considering this they still consider me an AH since J preferred to run to me rather than stay with them. They cursed me out, got dressed and left spending less than 5 minutes at our place, but then called me demanding apologies for literally keeping them here. I remind you that they are full grown adults and noone was holding them here, so they freely could leave anytime and that's what they ultimately did. I am crushed for what my brother had to go through, for my grieving husband who didn't have time nor to rest nor to properly adress his feelings about his deceased father, and lastly I'm crushed for myself since I feel helpless about ever having normal relations in my family.	1643018535.0	sbiro1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbiro1/aita_for_sheltering_my_brother_because_our/	AITA for sheltering my brother because our parents thought he smoked weed?

Her and I both grew up in toxic family environments, and I don't want our children to experience the same thing.  I just want to do what's right by my children.

ht4lq4fx	I (23)f have always disliked it when my boyfriend (22)m helps people that aren't exactly in need. I feel like as if he's being taken advantage of. Examples being: deciding to take his friend's mother to her dentist appointment which I do not understand why she needs to be accompanied at all or if she does then she's married and has a son in college that could accompany her. They don't own a car and neither does my boyfriend so I'm not seeing the need for him to go. He says it's because his friend which is overseas (her other son) asked him to.   Another being, a female patient of a friend of ours (we're both dentistry students) had a problem with her bridge which she should've discussed with our friend who's done the bridge. She instead called my boyfriend to complain that she didn't like our friend and found her to be cold. Neither did she like the other dentist she was suggested she could see because she found him "cold" as well and hard to talk with. She didn't inform them of her problem she instead called my boyfriend to complain and ask him if he could instead check the problem for her. Which I understand but why must he entertain her calls every time she decides to complain about a medical procedure at another dentist. I don't find it professional at all.  He'll do all sorts of odds favors like buying groceries for his mom's neighbours (them being married and well able to this task) one time a neighbour called him to literally ask him to take her Sim card out of her phone. You're 45, how do you not know how to do that?  He's faithful. He's never given me a reason to doubt him so I'm not jealous exactly. It's hard to describe but I simply don't see the good in the deeds he's doing. The ones he's helping aren't orphaned, they aren't young and they aren't disabled. Deciding to stay with your cousin that you aren't close with at her place alone until late at night because she's scared of staying alone, isn't a good deed when she's 25 and engaged just because she sounded pitiful and asked you to.  It makes me feel extremely insecure when I feel like I'm being treated just like everyone else he meets in his life. AITA for asking him to not help unless the person actually needs it? I've discussed how I felt about this and he told me he's free to do as he sees fits and blocked me.	1643019440.0	sbizpg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbizpg/aita_for_disliking_it_when_my_boyfriend_helps/	AITA for disliking it when my boyfriend helps people?

He hates white men because he feels they’re all racist, and they’re all assholes and supremacists and entitled, and that he “went through so much shit“ with them. I told him he could not group a whole race into one stereotype. When I disagreed with him too hard, he would question if I was a “white worshipper” myself. I would constantly yell at him about it, and he told me it’s one thing he could not change.   He said he had no ill will towards the Asian women, but he just hated the men in the relationship with them. He told me that he never expected me to change my opinion on it, and he never meant to project it on me. He also told me that he understood my opposing opinion but he just wanted me to accept him for who he was. He said that he accepted all of the things he didn’t agree with me about, so he wished for the same from me.

iju4ium6	A few days before I'd finally had enough and decided to leave, my dad got a call from his sister asking him to drive her to her brother in law's house (pretentiously ignoring the fact that her 3 kids are home and can definitely spare some time), despite knowing that my dad had recently gone through a cataract surgery. Not wanting to leave them hanging, I offered to drive them myself since my dad couldn't. They filled my head with bs about how I shouldn't have dressed so fancily since I was going to the countryside and that they don't have any pimps there compared to the village I come from (my uncle said, since wearing shorts, a t-shirt too many sizes large and heels is such indecent behavior).   Later that day, my mom and aunt were picking flowers, and I was left in the kitchen with my dad, uncle and his brother. The TV was showing some Covid-related footage which ended up with my uncle being, as always, a know-it-all. I don't remember everything in my furious haze, but he mentioned something about some brain dead child hearing everything people around him said (it was about some devastating news) and waking up asking about that same thing eventually. I explained how that wasn't possible and was surprised with a response along the lines of "How did you get into medical school when you're so stupid? Did you show forbidden skin to pass? If you got a scholarship by selling your body, my daughter could've owned the world." I remember saying something I'm not proud of, something not necessarily wrong but definitely controversial, in the sense that it has been the root of discord within my cousin's head.  To elaborate their inconsideration, I'm going to relatate a story from before I moved to Korea. I have done figure skating simce I was a kid, and when I was ~12 my coach passed. We were in the middle of a tournament, but we changed my routine to commemorate my coach's memory. I fell during my performance and got silver, causing me to cry thinking I dissapointed my late coach and these people's response was just condescending laughter and Eastern European tough love along with a "Aww, she cries?!".  Associated with this particular story is another piece of a big trauma puzzle. I got traumatic spondylosisthiesis at 13, which eventually developed into sciatica and that's when I stopped doing figure skating.  When we were over at their place one day, they started emptying the pantry and were taking huge pickled jars from the underground pantry to the kitchen. I was just standing there, radiating with pain, and my aunt said "Why are you so lazy? Your cousin is half your size and yet she's helping and you're doing nothing to help.", to which the cousin did nothing but laugh and pass me a jar.    The times they've insulted me (be it directly or indirectly) are endless but these are just a few of the more ridiculous ones.

c6hjnqfo	I'm dyslexic and on mobile  This happened before Covid.  Info The co-worker who's tyre I changed was the office crush for every man in the office who wasn't attached or gay. She is a lovely woman inside and out of the story we are going to call her Abby.    It was the office Christmas party, the party was at a pub in a questionable area. Through out the night Abby got hit on and, anyone who wasn't trying to sleep with her could tell she was uncomfortable, so my boyfriend and I kinda became her buffer for the night. When the party was over and headed to the carpark we found that Abby's tyre was flat (nail in it) and of course all guys were offering to take Abby home, and/or wait with her for the tow truck again anyone can tell that she was not comfortable with those options. I told Abby to open the boot and, I would put the spare on that should get her home, and that's what I did. I didn't think anything of this until Monday morning when one of the guys approach me in the break room to say that I emasculated them. When asked how I emasculated them  he replied " someone like you shouldn't know how to change tyres"   Me "I'm the son of a mechanic. why won't I know how to change tyres"  Him "you know what I mean"  Me "are you saying that gay men can't change tyres?" I did say this loudly so others could hear.  Him "no no that's not what I'm saying it's just that-"  Me I cut him off " if you were emasculated by me changing a tyre, then learn to change a bloody tyre"  And I walked off.  This came up at a dinner party and my BIL said that I was kinda and ass for playing the gay card and that he'd feel emasculated if he was in the guys shoes and I was a cockblock.

iywlsgse	I (24F) have always struggled with making friends. This changed during my years in university where I became close with 3 other girls: Maria, Kate and Lisa.   After graduation, we managed to remain in the same area. Around this time, Maria also introduced us to some of her friends: John, David and Peter. A couple of months passed and one weekend I was spending the night at John’s and David’s place because my car broke down. John made a move on me but I turned him down and he accepted it. The next time we all hung out, Maria noticed that things were a bit awkward and she pulled me aside to ask about it. I told her about him coming on to me but said things were ok. A couple of weeks later I started to notice that I hadn’t been invited to anything lately, which seemed weird given that Kate’s birthday was coming up and she’d been talking for weeks about how to celebrate. I asked Maria, she hadn’t heard anything either. Then I asked Lisa. Lisa went very quiet. Then she told me that Kate had already had her party and that she didn’t invite me or Maria. I was shocked. People can grow apart but it seemed so sudden, up until a few weeks ago everything had been fine.  I decided to send Kate a message, telling her that I knew about the party. I asked if I’d done something, if so what, and said that while I don’t think she hurt me intentionally I did feel excluded. I was hoping for an explanation, and maybe that she’d say it hadn’t been intentional and that she didn’t mean to hurt my feelings. At worst, I thought she’d just ignore me. What I got was so much worse. She told me that she’d had her party at John and David’s apartment and that she didn’t want me to be in their place because it would be rude to them. She said we didn’t have anything in common, she needed to prioritize what people to spend time with and so on. She ended it by saying that she’d love to come spend time at my grandparent’s lake house.  I didn’t respond. She just gave me bad excuses and if she doesn’t want to spend time with me then why should I invite her? A couple of days later Lisa contacted me in a panic. Kate had worked out that Lisa told me about the party and started giving Lisa shit for it. I really didn’t mean for Lisa to get in trouble, but I didn’t pressure her into telling me. Lisa is now terrified that she’ll lose Kate, Maria and me. She’s begging us to move on so the group can stick together but I’m hesitant. I’ll spend time with Lisa and Maria, and if I’m invited to a gathering where Kate is I probably won’t say no but I don’t want to invite her myself nor do I want to act like we’re all still best buddies.	1643022864.0	sbjvkm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbjvkm/aita_for_breaking_up_the_friend_group/	AITA for breaking up the friend group?
fn339k74	This is my first post and I’m not an English native speaker so please excuse me for any mistakes.  Me (f25) and my bf (m24) have been in a relationship for almost 4 years. Around 2 years ago he had to enlist to the military and the strict rules of the military & Covid restrictions didn‘t allow us to meet eachother ever since he enlisted. I have always been heads over heels with him and he felt the same. He‘s the man I‘ve seen myself marrying in the future.  Anyway, few months before getting discharged from the military he broke up with me. He was in a terrible mental state because of the military and was overwhelmed with all the anxiety & stress he felt because we were not able to meet eachother. (His division is known for being one of the worst and most mentally and physically draining) I tried to convince him to stick through it till the end since only few months were left until we can see eachother but he didn‘t change his mind. I was devastated. I could not focus on anything, I even took the week off from work. After that I seeked comfort by going out, drinking lots of alcohol and met another guy. We agreed on being friends with benefits and met a few times.   Few weeks ago my now ex texted me that he‘s gonna get discharged from the military soon and he‘d like to meet up. We set a date and he came over. He stayed with me for a couple of days, then visited his family for a few days and came back to my place again. I did mention to him that I casually met someoneelse lately, but that there were no feelings involved. He did feel kinda sad but he did not blame me, because after all we were broken up. Anyway, We live like a couple even though we‘re technically still broken up. During the time he spends at my place, he does not let me lift a finger. He does the cleaning, the cooking, takes care of me, he even did my nails. He even closes my jacket for me, helps me put on my stockings or shoes because the nails he did for me break off so easily. When we eat together he always lets me have the most delicious parts of the food. What I‘m trying to say is that he treats me with so much love and care, I feel truly happy when he is here. He has always treated me like this, ever since we started dating.  Well, today because of a health condition I have, he asked me when my last visit at the hospital was. We were checking the calendar on my phone to see when my last appointment was. While checking he saw that I had a calendar entry with the friends with benefits guy two days before my now ex came to visit me for the first time after his military service. He suddenly got quiet and is currently outside, taking a walk.  I feel like I‘m TA for meeting that dude two days before meeting my loved one. I feel like I fucked up, but in my defence back then I thought my ex would just visit me to say his final goodbye and thought meeting that other dude would distract me from getting my hopes up. Turns out he‘s still madly in love with me and just as I always have been  with him.

58tr8li0	So, they might see this, might not, don’t really care. Essentially, I got a dm late at night, accusing me of breaking relationships and causing rifts. I hadn’t done anything of the sort and was very confused, of course. When I asked further I was told that because I was worried and asked our mutuals if these people were okay, that somehow resulted in rifts in their relationships because now these mutual were also worried . I was then accused of ignoring boundaries that I had never been told in the first place(that’s not me being ignorant, I would’ve abided if they had asked). I know I’m not perfect but like, am I the asshole here?	1643023183.0	sbjykd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbjykd/aita_for_asking_mutuals_if_my_friends_were_okay/	AITA for asking mutuals if my friends were okay?
iyygqo0d	My house was hit by a hurricane that left totally ruined. The house was unlivable so me and my family when to go stay at my grandmothers sister while we were finding somewhere to stay. We own 5 dogs and we couldn’t afford to have someone take care of them so my aunt agreed to take care of them, she soon found 6 dogs (plus my aunt’s dog) was to hard to handle so my older brother and my dad went and stayed at my aunts house to help take care of the dogs while me and my grandmother stayed the house we were in already. The days after that my birthday came up I got 200$ from my dad, my dad also gave my older brother 300$ on the same day. My dad never came to see me at all neither did I get a cake  and I didn’t even get to see or talk to my friends. My older brothers birthday was not to long ago (me, my dad, and my older brother are now living in a camper, my grandma stayed with her sister) he got to hang out with his friends, got gifts, saw his family, and got a cake. It felt so unfair that my brother got all this and I didn’t. When I told my dad how u felt on the situation he got mad that I wasn’t happy for my brother and how I couldn’t understand that it was not my brothers day not mine.

8wsdemco	I (29 F) introduced my friend (28 F) to my recently divorced friend (45 M) who was cheated on for months by his ex-wife, and my friend (30 F).   After their (45 M and 30 F) separation and finding out the story from both sides, I found myself naturally siding with my friend (45 M), due our morals and values lining up. I do not condone cheating and she (30 F) has openly shown to be hungry for money in the divorce and seeking hundreds of thousands of dollars after cheating on him (45 M) for months with another married man and being only married to my friend (45 M) for one year. Seeing my friend (45 M) absolutely devastated and asking me to help him move on and find someone else, I introduced him to my friend (28 F) who lives out of town. They talked through text and next thing I knew, he was flying her out into the city. He set up his guest room for her and the next day, his ex wife (30 F) comes in unannounced and throws a rage fit. She blames me for not telling her about my friend (28 F) staying over and claims that she is using her stuff, which isn’t true according to her ex (45 M). She has since removed me from all social media. Am I the asshole for having set up my friends?	1643024334.0	sbk9t5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbk9t5/aita_for_setting_my_friends_up/	AITA for setting my friends up?
iyzaeenf	Ok so I previously posted the entire conversation but it was removed becuase it was too long, i guess you can go through my post history and go see it if you're interested. I'll try my best to summarize it accurately and fairly.   We were discussing legal issues and she said any court case is winnable and I said that is defeintely not true and if we look at some scumbag like Nichоlas Сruz, no laywer could pull that off and get him away scott free, the best that any laywer could do is have him avoid the maximun sentence. I argued that some court cases are very politically charged and it doens't matter what is right or how things are supposed to be done, the case will be pretty much guilty.   She disagreed and said how courts should be and how its the lawyers job to prove he's not mentally stable and should receive treatment. I told her that's not going to happen, no way a laywer could do that for some of these cases and there'd be riots for some of these people if that happened so no court would allow it. She siad how courts should be and I told her she's thinking of this too idealistically and not realisitcally  and she said well why do you think you know better than me. She's currently studying law, but in a different country so she's never heard of the cases we were talking about. She then said I was mansplaining it. I told her I'm sorry (this happened inbetween first and second post) and that I didn't mean to upset her and I really like her and dont want to fuck this up and that im not disagreeing with her because she's a woman, i have the same types of conversations with male friends who would probably agree more on her side.

ip14603n	So for some backstory, I 23M was severely bullied in school, and it was pretty bad, I did the bare minimum to get my HSC, and I just stopped interacting with the outside world, and essentially lived like a NEET. I was deathly afraid of people because I thought they were all bullies, I think my mum let me stay because she felt sorry for me from 17-20 I lived inside the house hardly ever leaving. But one day, my mum just told me that I have 3 weeks to get a job and move out, I didn't want to be homeless so I panicked and half-assed a resume, and spam applied for every job I could think of.   I got a job working as a clerk at a hospital, and the job pays alright, but I still have another part-time job where I also work at a testing clinic. Anyways, I've also enrolled in vocational training to become a nurse, and I hope to move on to a bachelor's degree. In addition to all this, I'm barely making ends meet at the moment, I have to skip meals sometimes to pay rent since the city I live in is very expensive. The worst part is I have housemates too, my mother asked me if I was coming to the family gathering on the 26th, and since that day is a public holiday, I took a shift so I could get penalty rates.   I told my mum that I couldn't since I was working, she got angry at me and said that I never come to family events anymore and that I'm always working. And she didn't see me on Christmas since I was working then too, then she said asked if I think I'm too good for them or something. I was pretty mad at this point, and I told her It was her fault because she kicked me out, and I need to work on holidays to have 3 meals a day because she kicked me out at a time when house prices have skyrocketed. She said I was a lazy ungrateful asshole, AITA?	1643026116.0	sbkrzu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbkrzu/aita_for_telling_my_mum_its_her_fault_i_cant_go/	AITA for telling my mum It's her fault I can't go to family events?
dtlohwmd	Ive previously tried posting this but it was removed so here we go again :)  Like a lot of high schools, students started a Diversity Equity and Inclusion Instagram where students and alumni can share experiences where they didn’t experience DEI at my school.   Well, one post was centered around an alumna’s experience with teacher I have “Mr. A”. Mr. A said something about the students mom relating to race. It was wrong. It was in 2016.   Would IBTA if I tell him this morning that this was posted, just so he has a heads up if any students bring it to him and so he has the chance to address to his classes? I would just say “look, this was posted and I wanted you to know”  Im afraid I would be because it may not be my place, he may not want to be reminded of the incident, and he may be upset.   Although I don’t agree with the action he did in the post, it was 6 years ago, and since I’ve been at the school he’s been nothing my kind and actively work to make other students comfortable.   I also want to mention that I am of the same ethnicity that the alumn in question was, but I’m not sure if he knows this.	1643026454.0	sbkvj4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbkvj4/wibta_of_i_tell_my_teacher_someone_posted_about/	WIBTA of I tell my teacher someone posted about him on our DEI Instagram?
haa8tpee	((I just realized that I already do sound like an AH so just to give some background about our unconventional family: My dad is a sexist, "supposed hyper Christian", racist, narcissist who, in our youth, would only push the house chores on to us girls; leaving my brother with little to no responsibility on the house. In fairness, we all had horrible experiences with him (dad). But my brother usually has it a bit easier.  Because we're an Asian family (sadly, we live in the Philippines), it's always customary to ask for permission to go out from our dad only, our mom would agree but he has the final say (usually, it's the mother in most households tho).   My brother would ask to go out with friends and he would get approval. But us girls would get the lecture of what to wear, who to meet, where, when, what time home, how to go home? Until the questions just keeps repeating itself until my dad thinks of a way to not make us go. Basically, he tires us until we don't feel like going anymore. Unless he's included, no questions asked.  So yes, my sister's and I have barely gone out of the house besides for school and work)).  My (23F) brother (26M) was telling me that he was going to celebrate a friend's birthday. I keep my answers short and concise the whole time he kept telling me about his friend, why they're going there, and adding that they met recently around the time of his birthday too.  I was super annoyed and bitter that he would keep telling me about all that with the knowledge that our sisters and I have not been able to go out of the house for leisure.   I was getting more frustrated hearing more about how he was going out and I kept giving very "unlike me" answers like "mhm" or "ohh". After some more talking, he eventually dropped it but kept talking to me about something related to that friend of his.   With all considered, would I have been the arse hole? I didn't snap at him or anything but I was already considering it so, if ever something similar arises, maybe I can put my foot down if ever.  Very first post btw so idk if there's a format or something.	1643026538.0	sbkwcp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbkwcp/wibtah_if_i_snapped_at_my_brother_for_telling_me/	WIBTAH if I snapped at my brother for telling me that he was going out with friends?
cxcyug8f	Throwaway • on mobile   I (21F) am pregnant due to a medical mistake (my psychiatrist neglected to mention my antipsychotics would cancel out my birth control). While I never wanted kids, I attend therapy, accepted my child and remind myself he is not to blame.  My baby daddy (24M) wasn’t exactly happy and I didn’t blame him; he had just left a 6 year relationship and we had a weekend fling. I told him I wouldn’t pressure him into being a father and I wouldn’t press for child support (he doesn’t make a lot so it’s kinda moot, plus my current partner is well off enough to care for both me and my child).   I keep him updated on a regular basis and he’s been helpful in medical choices. He’s even allowed to be a dad later on in life when he gets his act together and if he chooses to.  Now here’s the problem. My family has no idea who he is, but assume he’s a deadbeat since he’s not physically here (we live in different states 2300 miles away) and doesn’t pay anything. I’ve said multiple times since that I watched families fall apart due to someone being pressured into being a parent. But apparently that’s “not a good enough reason and he shouldn’t escape responsibility.”   So AITA for not making my baby daddy pay child support?? Also, I’m standing firm in this decision regardless.	1643026028.0	sbkr6u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbkr6u/aita_for_not_putting_my_baby_daddy_on_child/	AITA for not putting my baby daddy on child support?
607rxad	TL;DR- I nag my bf because he's rude and messy in my house that he pays nothing for, but he says all problems would be fixed if I stop the nagging. Am at my wits' end.    Hi, my bf(27M) and I (27F) are really struggling right now because I am constantly nagging him. I feel that because his actions effect *every* part of my life and I'm super struggling because of him, I'm well within my rights to go on at him about things. Here is a list of a few things I nag him about:  He makes a huge mess and leaves it all in the room I live in. I pay hardly any rent because I'm with family but he pays none, and his mess includes old food and dirty underwear/socks.  He won't wash. He works 2 jobs and his feet absolutely reek, makes me sick. The rest of him is pretty ripe too, leaves my bedsheets smelling nasty. He even left a halo of like... hair grease? On my wall. I try to keep on top of things but I'm really mentally ill and it's hard.  He refuses to put his phone on silent at night. It takes me hours to get to sleep and back to sleep, he already snores like a foghorn so I barely sleep anyway but I will check verbally that his phone is on silent and he will lie to my face and say yes and then be angry that I'm annoyed when it wakes me up at 3am. (This happens often)   He's currently homeless and it's cold so I'm doing my best to host him 3/4 nights a week but one of his jobs is at a pub and he's a severe alcoholic. He keeps driving back here drunk at 1am and then keeping me up for an hour at least and pretending he's had nothing to drink. Let alone the fact that my elderly relatives are being exposed to illnesses because of his job.   I'm not very well mentally and my issues have taken a nose dive since he fell on hard times and I've had to help him out. He owes me like £1500 now, I have really tried to help as much as I can but he dismisses my suggestions and just seems to take? I feel like I have no control over my life.   Anyway according to him all our problems are because I relentlessly nag him. That's it. I find this to be a ridiculous suggestion but he seems SURE he is right.   So, Am I the Asshole reddit? :( I will accept it 100% if I am. I never wanted to grow into this naggy, mean woman.

7p6rxkio	I (20F) and J (23M) met online . When we matched He told me he thought I was pretty and the other regular compliments, so I didn’t think much of it. I started getting weird vibes from him on New Year’s Eve, when he showed up at my job with his sister when I never told him where I worked. ( but I work in a pretty big retail company so I didn’t think much of it at the time). Later that night he started texting me how beautiful I looked in the dress I was wearing , then he started describing my looks, likewise my make up and the color scheme I used, the shoes I was wearing and my hair and how I had it styled. The comment that got to me most that day was when I asked him why was he saying all this and he said,  “Cause you’re my type and I want you” that did rubbed me the wrong way but I did let it go. A few weeks of us getting to know each other passed by and led us up to this moment today,  where out of the blue he told me “I go to your Instagram all the time and you are the most distinctive, beautiful, free spirited, beautiful soul young women I’ve ever met in my life.”And “ seeing you the time you wore that nude colored silk dress to work when I was with my sister, I was like yeah she’s the one. It just so happened that I matched with you on something cause I was feeling you. “ his comments did rub me the wrong way because, in the past when we started “talking” I have told him multiple times I’m not interested in him and likewise today I told him once again, “I’m sorry I’m just not interested” and he said “I want a future, to grow and develop, to eventually be your best friend and even more. But I have to get to know you more first. I liked what I saw, then I matched with you. It’s a sign. Im just following through cause I didn’t talk to you at work, and because it feels so right. I’m very interested in you.”  I left him on read after that and he finally snapped and said “that’s fine too f- you” then he said “you will regret this you will come begging for me and I won’t have you?????” and I told him “I’m sorry I’m not into weird mfs like you” then he literally apologized called me a b*tch then blocked me .

bmsw2d5x	I frequent a lot of facebook groups for rehoming/ rescuing/ fostering cats and dogs and as of lately I’ve noticed a trend. A lot of people bully others.   Definitely not the majority but something like 50-100 people gang up on owners trying to re-home a pet. I saw a post of a lady that said she had cancer, was single and lived abroad (no family) and due to how sick she has gotten she is no longer able to take care of her large breed dog. She added the usual stuff, she requires screening of everyone that is interested, home inspection, disclaimer dog will be given with an adoption contract and it will be spade.  The majority of comments were calling her ‘a horrible human being’. Calling her names, saying there is karma and it was in the form of cancer??? I was totally disgusted. Mostly middle-aged women saying pets are children and ‘would you give up your kid?’.   Group is huge and unless there are explicit words moderators usually stay out of it. I commented under several of these comments defending the poor woman, more or less saying they are overreacting and saying it is despicable to say she got cancer because she is willing to adopt out an animal.  To my freaking surprise I got banned for being aggressive? What the heck? AITA? Am I missing something?

bibw8pxz	I was really hungry on my way home and picked up a Cornish pasty (it's like a hot pocket maybe?). It was wrapped in a paper bag and warm.  I had to run to not miss my train so instead of eating on the platform I ate on the train. I am aware that some smells of foods can be obnoxious to people so I just took a few bites and closed up the paper bag in-between chewing.   A few minutes later a man nearby gave me the most disgusted look and was being passive aggressive to me by slamming the window open. (All the other windows were open already). The train was not packed, I was sitting on my own and next to a window.  Instead of apologising I continued eating and laughed at him for not speaking up and just passive aggressive. This angered him more and he got off the next stop.

iz0ha5n5	I know for a fact I sound like an AH on the title alone. But these boundaries were drawn up prior to him moving in with me (the bed part). I grew up in severe poverty with a mother who liked dogs more than kids so she had at least 6 dogs at a time. She wouldnt make her dogs sleep on the floor so usually I had at least 3 dogs in my bed and I never slept (twin bed). Therefore, now I refuse to let a dog sleep in my bed. Hard limit for me and I will never change my view on it. Especially where this dog climbed in to bed with us one night after I was already asleep and laid directly on top of me. So no. Not only that but before moving in with me she slept on her bed on the floor no issues but since moving in my BF gets irritated that I wont let her on the bed. I dont see why it was okay for her to sleep on the floor at his place but not mine. But either way, I dont ever allow it.  In the argument of bringing her outside- as of yesterday I told him I was done doing it. So she is a big dog- some sort of Great Dane mix- and my BF lived on a farm before moving in with me so he never leash trained her. I live in a fairly populated city. This is more people, more traffic, more chaos than this dog has ever dealt with. I get overwhelmed so I cant imagine how she feels. I also am pretty certain this is why she literally sends me flying because she gets jumpy and runs super fast while I have the leash. I'm only 113lbs, 5'1". This dog stands up to my rib cage. There is literally no man handling this animal on a leash. But I tried anyways because my BF works until midnight and usually sleeps until noon. But yesterday when I brought the dog out not only did her leash cut in to my hand because she yanked so hard that it broke the leash, but also when she did this I fell hard and landed directly on my hip. I now have an entirely bruised hip (no exaggeration) and it hurts to walk because it feels like I'm being stabbed in the upper side ass cheek.   So yesterday I limped back upstairs, let the dog inside and immediately she ran for my bed and got under the covers with my BF, who lifted the blankets to let her in. I told her no, made her get on the floor and told him that for starters, he was going to stop pushing my boundaries with the bed issue because it was starting to really piss me off (he only just moved in a month ago and it's been an issue several times) and two, I wasnt bringing this dog out anymore because I'm down right sick of coming back injured and her not listening to commands because of his lack of training. He says I'm a dick about the bed because its "her house too" and I immediately piped up and told him to sleep in the guest room then with the dog, which made him stop. But then he told me that I should just be getting used to bringing this dog out and getting hurt and that I need to toughen up because I knew what I was getting in to (bold faced lie- I had no idea how hard this was because she was never on a leash at his place and she legally has to be here).

cvs08wrx	A little back story I have a very diverse friend group and we all (for the most part) have different beliefs one of my friends is a very well off 21 year old Canadian with a very strong affinity for Stalin we will call him M. The other is a very shy girl with a very soft voice who is very open to anything in the friend group we will call her C. I am strongly opposed to communism because I have many friends who lived in Cuba and have heard the horror stories... But let's get into the AITA. Last night I held a charity drive for saint Jude's where we raised over one thousand dollars for kids with cancer when we made the $500 dollar mark C said she would be reading a bed time story for the stream because we all love her voice. When it came time to select a book I suggested where the wild things are, and M suggested The first 3 pages of the communist manifesto... I have always been strongly opposed to communism and he knows this, when I said no and tried to shut it down he made a big deal about it so C felt like she should to keep the peace but then M was upset muted him on my stream because THEY WERE TAKING TURNS READING IT AFTER I ASKED THEM NOT TO. Not only was it not C reading a "bedtime" story but the goal for the donation had nothing to do with him. Looking back it could be me being close minded, but my beliefs are my beliefs and communism has no place in a charity driven stream.	1643030330.0	sbm189	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbm189/aita_for_getting_upset_that_my_friends_were/	AITA for getting upset that my friends were reading the communist manifesto on my charity stream.
iz20g0ez	To be clear about two things, my mom has plenty of money and a present could be something homemade or even a meal.  My mom and my wife have always had issues largely in part to how cold and rude my mom is. I didn’t pick up on a lot of it at first because it’s how I was raised and what I thought was normal. My in laws are the total opposite and treat me like their own son in terms of gifts and attention and I find myself embarrassed when my mom will hardly speak to my wife.  My wife’s birthday is coming up and she’s brought up in the past that my mom snubs it. I reached out to my mom and explained that it’s toxic that she acts like my wife doesn’t exist and I need her to acknowledge her birthday with some sort of gift or gesture. My mom said that’s weird and she shouldn’t be obligated to. I told her how much she is embarrassing me and my mom asked if she could just stop acknowledging mine. I got annoyed and told her that some things you just do because of social obligation or maybe because you love your son. She said she had to think about it.  She texted me that she thought about it and she isn’t willing to do more than text happy birthday and it’s weird because they don’t have that relationship.	1643031136.0	sbmarn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmarn/aita_for_expecting_my_mom_to_get_my_wife_a/	AITA for expecting my mom to get my wife a birthday present?
dy5ofdiy	Please excuse the clickbaity title. It's how it's being framed to me and what I'm worried I did, but I don't see it that way? I'll appreciate clarity here. I'll fudge specifics, but this is the gist:  Ex (32 M), let's call him Rocky, and me (33,F) had been together almost two years, long distance (but we'd met plenty before) when he completely checked out from stressful stuff happening in my life and took a joking approach to it. That's alright as unexpected stressors had come up.  But when he started being jokey and avoidant nonstop, instead of setting boundaries. I'd beg him to communicate clearly and he'd just put on voices and say "funny" crap. I asked Rocky with all words if sex now made him uncomfortable and why and he said no. Insisted.  I felt very rejected and the feather on the camel's back was when I, after a serious talk about how his "jokes" were affecting my mental health, sent him a nude (with consent) and he replied "lol, imagine a person beating a drum on those tiddlywinks lololol" - no I'm not making this up.  I broke up with him over it and am being painted a villain now, but it just felt insulting?!	1643031259.0	sbmc3c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmc3c/aita_for_blowing_up_on_him_for_sex/	AITA for blowing up on him for sex?

9bp76bdg	I’ve been seeing this guy for a little over 2 months. I’d been funding pretty much all of our nights together. Buying him groceries, some of which we cooked together but most were just for him, buying alc and drugs so we could get lit, meals, uber eats, and paying over $50 in transportation to come see him every time, he has never once come to see me but I never thought anything of it. I thought “Well he offers me a safe space that I could get away to” and justified the fact that he never came to me with the fact that I live with my parents and rather go to him anyway. But over time resentment started to build the more money I would spend on things we’d do together. I started to realize a bunch of things that I didn’t like, like he tends to be greedy with food. I’m the type of person to offer the bigger slice of pizza, but he’s the type of person to just take it even if he didn’t buy the pizza. Once I was eating some of his cereal out the box and he literally told me “Okay, only one more handful”, but then tried to play it off like he was joking once he saw that I was annoyed by his stinginess. Sometimes he says things that he doesn’t mean, like once I was confiding in him about how toxic home is and he said “I’d move you out myself if I have to” but last week I literally moved out of my parent’s house and he didn’t offer to let me stay with him and was acting super weird about me being at his house, like he was scared I would try to move in but those were never my intentions and I’ve been staying with my sister. Overall I noticed that he has a negative way of thinking, in any situation he always assumes the worst is going to happen. That being said, this leads me to the title of the post.   Last night we went out for dinner, but the whole entire evening he was in a pouty, upset mood because his winter break is ending and he has to resume classes today. I kept asking him what’s wrong and eventually I got very frustrated with him at the table, pretty much telling him that he’s negative, and he doesn’t know what he has or how good his life is. Because while he has a place to call his own, i’m struggling to find one, while he works remotely and can still make rent, the jobs I qualify for require physical labor and I still wouldn’t meet the income requirements for an apartment (he told me he could try to refer me for his job but never did), while he’s attending one of the top 10 colleges in the country with a lucrative major, I struggle to attend school because it’s always been hard for me to function like others. He threatens “I’m bouta leave”, so I collect my stuff and tell him “Don’t ever threaten to walk out on me, I’ll leave first” and I walked out. I feel like an accumulation of everything I mentioned above (and more but would have turned this post into a thesis) made me react that way.

iwpn7fkr	I was chatting to a girl for a few years now but we haven’t seen eachother in person (only on ft) as i have moved to another country and i couldn’t go see her because she was a few hundred miles away from me and i didn’t have a car at that time. I started working in a place in that other country and got promoted pretty fast to a better position that required more responsibility and communication between myself and other people/companies. After about 4 months in that position, things got stressful and tiring mentally for me as i am young and i don’t have a lot of work experience. The girl that i mentioned above got Co.vid and on one of the days while she was sick i got home from work, still stressing, trying to get stuff right and done. She told me she was feeling bad and i asked her what’s wrong, to which she replied “it’s from Co.vid” and i went “oh, shit. I forgot” and then a big fight started with her telling me that i don’t care about her and i’ve been manipulative (she has trust issues) the whole time and i had planned all along to hurt her. The fight ended up with me blocked on every socials, phone number, everything. It’s been almost a year and i feel like it happened yesterday, i’m still trying to find a way to fix this.

cxu4vc5z	So my father and step mother have four dogs. They have a senior dog who is amazing and very kind, a puppy who is sweet and playful, and then two Rottweilers. I want to preface this by saying I am not scared of dogs - I fully believe that all dogs can be good dogs, no matter the breed, it just depends on how they are raised. But these two Rottweilers have bit me, multiple times, drawing blood through my clothes and leaving scars. They have also bit my husband multiple times and various other people who have entered the house. I’m very cautious on how I enter, I respect dogs and their space, but these two dogs just attack on sight no matter how someone enters the home. I finally refused to enter the home unless the two Rotties are locked in their cage. I don’t like having to force them in a cage but I’m honestly scared of getting bit again. The last bite was the worst one.   Fast forward to a week ago - I announced with my husband that I was pregnant to my dad and step mom. They were excited, normal future grandparent stuff, and then mentioned they can’t wait to watch our baby over at their house. I kind of laughed and said, “Oh, not with the Rottweilers here.”  They both got very serious and said, “Well, they’re great with kids. They’re notorious family dogs.” My husband and I both decided not to press the issue at the moment - especially because I’m still newly pregnant - but we both agreed no baby at their house without the dogs locked up and us present. This is not to say they can’t see their grandchild - but not alone at their home.   Listen, I know first time parents are sometimes overprotective and a bit helicopter-y. I’m willing to hear different opinions before pushing the boundary with my family. My parents have had my niece over and the dogs didn’t bite her (they did get into a dog fight near her, however, and my father had to pull the baby away, actually getting bit himself in the process) but I’m simply not willing to take the risk. Am I the asshole for refusing my parents the ability to watch their grandchild solo because of their aggressive dogs?	1643032853.0	sbmv6y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmv6y/aita_for_not_wanting_my_child_to_stay_with_my/	AITA for not wanting my child to stay with my parents who own “biting” dogs?
iz2wg6rx	I f20 has been dating my boyfriend who's 21 since the beginning of junior year. We have taken long breaks in between because of him being unfaithful but I feel this we are doing perfectly fine. My boyfriend's roommate has recently moved out and he has been looking for a roommate so I bought up me moving so we can live together but he said no right away because he wants a separate space from me if we do break up. I was a little hurt he was planning for when we broke up but I got over it and started helping. About a month ago he bought up my ex-boyfriend Alissa living with him since he was almost the deadline and she made enough to stay there. I immediately said no because I didn't feel comfortable with letting someone who wronged me live with my boyfriend. He was pissed off and we haven't really spoken until I went to his apartment to visit him because I missed him and he was helping Alissa move her things in. She looked completely different from when we were freshmen so I barely recognized her until he told me that she was now living with him. I am hurt because he knew how I felt about this and he did it anyway. I communicated this to him and he said she was his only choice and if I feel uncomfortable then I should break up with him. He said those words like it was nothing so I left the apartment and sent him an apology and he only responded with a thumbs up.	1643033078.0	sbmy4h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmy4h/aita_for_being_upset_at_my_boyfriend_for_letting/	AITA for being upset at my boyfriend for letting my ex-bestfriend live with him?

40ks4b07	So I (31F) work in a restaurant that was well renowned before the panini. We had tons of awards, a vast wine selection, and generally was really, really hard to get into to work (I tried multiple times when I had friends working there). The past two years have been really rough on the restaurants quality of service, they basically lowered themselves to a pizza/burger joint for tourists bc the business travelers they depended on were staying home.  So when I got this job initially I was really excited to have it get back to its former glory. The drink menu was basically equivalant to a dive bar, and no one really cared about steps of service. It took a few months but we finally started having enough staff in the kitchen and got a Sous chef again, as well as getting rid of the worst servers and hiring new ones.  So I took the initiative to craft a new drink menu (I have craft bartending experience and genuinely enjoy making amazing drinks) and I started learning more about wine and doing wine tastings. Not one of the other girls offered to help, or had any interest whatsoever, I just try to learn as much as I can to be the best that I can be.  Lately my direct supervisor has been basically 100% avoiding me, won't answer questions, hasn't helped when she was always there before etc. I just found out yesterday that apparently, they all complained and accused me of being "the favorite" when:  A) any of them could have easily helped/made their own drinks (and I would have happily helped)  B) Not one person expressed any interest in doing wine tastings and left it all up to my manager.  So now I'm basically being punished, even though not ONE of the other girls had any interest in doing these things, and I'm being ostracized from everything because.... I took initiative? I care about my job?   I'm just waiting it out until the pool bar opens so I can GTFO and not have to work with any of them for 6 months, but I feel like I should bring my concerns to the GM. We are not going to be able to bring the restaurant back to where it was if we continue to allow this kind of attitude to reign supreme. I could just work at the pool bar and not work the restaurant in the off season but I really love this job and I don't want to have to do that.

iz2cc243	I(30M) and my fiance(32F) have been searching for a new apartment since last year. My fiance wants to be closer to her family and hates the commute from the apartment. Another issue is no animals are allowed. My brother(34M) passed away November 2021 and we adopted his dog" Doug". Doug is a 4 year-old husky mix and very well-behaved dog. My brother and I were very close and I promised to take care of Doug if anything ever happened.   My fiance found an apartment that was close to her family and was close to our jobs. The rent was a little cheaper and had more room. The issue I have with it is that animals under 40lbs are only welcome. Doug is heavier than 40lbs and I am not looking to rehome him. My fiance scheduled a tour of the apartment and had her parents meet us there. When the tour was finished, my fiance and her parents were talking about the apartment and when we plan on moving in. I told them that I wanted to keep looking and find a place that does not have a restriction on animals. I added in that rehoming Doug was not an option.   My fiance did not take my response well and got angry that I was willing to give up a nice apartment for an animal. Her parents think I am being unreasonable and should look at rehoming options.

f9b9fe0t	I (f18) have always had a rocky relationship with my mum (41). She didn’t raise me so we weren’t particularly close as I grew up with my grandparents. I moved in with her at 12 after being mentally and physically (at one point) abused by my father when I was 8-12. My mum and I had always gotten into little petty arguments, most of which was just her letting her anger out on me or my brothers in my younger teen years.   I’d always been an independent child, minding my own business and getting out of people’s way. But she usually sought out to argue with me when I’m just chilling on my bed. These arguments usually came from her being angry when I messed up which often escalates to her screaming at me and only ends with me crying. Sometimes she’d insult me and would call me “the spawn of satan” when I’d try to defend myself and she’d generally just be guilt tripping me, gaslighting me during every argument. This contributed a lot to my deteriorating mental health and was diagnosed with depression at 17.   However the situation did get better when was 17 and a half. We were arguing less, talking more; just getting along a lot better generally. But when I entered my last year of high school; which i currently am in now, she became stricter with rules and kept pressuring me about my studies. Totally reasonable as my grades had been lagging behind due to my deteriorating mental health.   But the pressure got to me and I felt suffocated by how much my mum had been monitoring me (like where i was going, who with, why and general nosiness). This has gotten me to the point where I would have mental breakdowns almost every night so I tried to talk to her about it. She refused to listen to me and kept screaming at “the devil inside of me” to get out. At this point I was just in too much disbelief to keep defending myself and eventually just packed my stuff to leave. When I did try to leave, she blocked my way and I tried to walk past her which led to her pushing me back. I ended up pushing her back as a reflex which led to her dragging me back to my room by my hair, repeatedly throwing a table at me, my bags and hitting me.   That night, i had messaged my brother to come pick me up and I never spoke to her ever since. She messaged me the next morning trying to explain why she behaved that way and said she hopes that we (my brothers and I) could forgive her. My friend’s mum and my boyfriend have both been suggesting I talk to my mum again, but after what I had to go through with my dad, I don’t want to stay where I’m afraid again. So AITA for refusing to talk to my mum?	1643034244.0	sbncjf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbncjf/aita_for_refusing_to_talk_to_my_mum/	AITA for refusing to talk to my mum?

It’s extremely irritating. At least get good at your job if you’re gonna shell out the effort to be a public nuisance.  I said “f*** you” to a moderator because of their middle school bully behavior, suddenly “my account has been banned for 3 days on the grounds of harrassment”. These unpaid wimps couldn’t take one curse word (on the internet especially, which isn’t a real place) and now I suddenly don’t have the right to speak.

iz2safl0	My sister, Toni, and my partner, Emma, used to get along well. Then a lot of family drama happened (my parents started the whole thing, we no longer speak to them). Toni blamed Emma for things that weren't true. She also decided to punish Emma and as a result deeply upset our kids. Things were patched up for the most part. Word count limits how much I can add here but Toni was unfair to Emma.  Now Emma tolerates Toni for lack of better word. Emma doesn't hate anyone, it's not in her nature, but she doesn't make an effort with Toni. She doesn't trust Toni either. She is fine with Toni visiting. We really only see Toni two or three times a year and hear from her on birthdays and big holidays. Toni is also child free. I don't know how Toni feels about Emma.   A while ago, Toni had some concerns about "behavior" my daughter was showing. My daughter copied her older cousin and called herself a word she thought meant cute. We told Toni everything was fine. Toni also sent articles to Emma about how to talk to teen girls when they're insecure. Emma said it was just another sign Toni hasn't really changed but she wasn't upset.  This Christmas, Toni got Emma a book on overcoming body image issues. Emma started laughing as soon as she opened it. She said "wow Toni is bold!" I saw the book and immediately felt angry. I'm not only mad on Emma's behalf, I'm upset that Toni would think so little of our parenting.   I also think even if this has nothing to do with our daughter, it doesn't make sense of Emma. Emma is stunning. I'm not just saying that as the person who loves her. I mean really she is gorgeous. I know some people who are good looking have hang ups about body image but Emma doesn't. Even if this gift was for Emma, it's still feels wrong.  I want to confront Toni. Emma told me it's completely up to me. She still is laughing about it. Most of her friends and family are mad on her behalf, like me. She says she can't be offended by anything Toni does. She appreciates that I'm on her side and supports my decision no matter what. I want to be a good partner, but I don't want to start any unnecessary drama. There is also a chance Toni did mean well and was just bad at expressing it properly. Regardless of her intentions, I want to confront her on it.	1643035117.0	sbnnb2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnnb2/wibta_for_telling_my_sister_her_christmas_gift/	WIBTA for telling my sister her Christmas gift wasn't okay?

il2okuib	Throwaway for obvious reasons below.  I (24f) and my cousin (28m) have always wanted to write a book together, it's always been a shared passion of ours and since we've been best friends our whole lives we work brilliantly together. Quite some time ago we developed an idea to write a very dramatic story loosely based on my other cousin (28m) and his very turbulent and soap opera worthy relationship with his on again, off again girlfriend (27f), which resulted in 2 kids and a very popular gossip topic in our extended family. They also both had kids with other partners and have cheated on eachother constantly. We often exchanged ideas of storylines and basically already wrote a story in our minds, but always carefully excluded details that might suggest any connection to the real people, keeping the real events only as rough guidelines for story progression.   Recently however (about two months ago) we were shocked by the news that the girl tragically passed away, after she lost her kids due to mental health problems and rumoured heavy drug and alcohol use. We were all very sad and heartbroken, losing a life at such a young age is always a tragedy.  My cousin and I now have doubts about writing that book, even though we never planned on revealing the real people behind the inspiration and probably never even stating it's based on real events. The rough draft we designed is already so different from the real thing that nobody who knew them could possibly guess, but we still feel we might disrespect the memory of her, even if we would be the only two people to know it's based on her life.  So, would we be assholes to "exploit" her heartbreaking life story to write a very loosely based novel?	1643035904.0	sbnxia	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnxia/wibta_if_i_wrote_a_book_based_on_a_life_of_an/	WIBTA if I wrote a book based on a life of an aquaintance who recently passed away?

A couple of weeks ago, they broke up. I’m not exactly sure what happened but I suspect it involved cheating. All I know is that it was pretty brutal. But, I haven’t finished the show yet and am still using that account.   Yesterday my sister came over for the first time since they broke, and the show was paused in the living room.

iyv8sj6q	For reference my (24F) family is all sorts of messed up. I have one full-sister and four half-siblings as both my biological parents remarried soon after their divorce when I was 7.  My mom moved me and her 600miles away and made it extremely hard for my dad to see me. I was young and malleable and even if he got me on a weekend here and there I was constantly crying and screaming (turns out my dad had an out-of-wedlock kid and my mom told me my dad just really wanted a boy and now he no longer loved me or wanted me around). She also told me my step-mom would try to leave me at a foster home if I was ever left alone with her. So yeah, my dad gave up after an year. He told me I can still go, I just needed to call him or my sister (she was a teenager and chose to stay with him).  My mother was great at putting crap in my head after that, vilifying both my dad and sister. She’d constantly come up with sh*t about both of them and if I dared question anything she’d say she was my only option or it was a foster home. There were lots of other despicable things that she did and said, but I’d need to write a book to properly document the abuse.  When I turned 16 I went to a kid’s and women’s shelter that specialized in abuse (my friend’s mom took me in). I spent there 6 months going to therapy while still living with my mom (they agreed not to contact her). I was diagnosed with depression, explosive behaviors and was told I am being emotionally abused. I was encouraged to get my father involved as I was still underage and I called him and my sister. My sister lived near by and took me in. My mom only said -“Don’t come back when she kicks you to the curb.” and changed the door locks the next day.  My maternal grandma has been fighting me on this for years. She says I over-reacted, that my mom was just strict and I was a moody teenager. I’ve always tried to excuse her behavior as 90% of the time we do get along nicely. I visit her and she is always excited and happy to see me. We fight about my mom maybe 3-4times a year.  This Christmas though, she told me I was gonna wake up one day and realize my life was meaningless without my mom in it and she said ‘I wish you one day have a daughter so you can see how ungrateful you and your sister are.’ (Please keep in mind here it’s ‘she said, I said’. My mom was great at keeping the abuse away from our extended family).  I just stopped picking up the phone after. I am too tired. My cousin said today, grandma called me horrible and despicable for not calling her anymore. AITA? I feel guilty but I can’t anymore. I am still in therapy for all the crap my mom did to me.	1643036544.0	sbo5pd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbo5pd/aita_for_not_speaking_with_my_grandma_anymore/	AITA for not speaking with my grandma anymore?
iz4kt2jp	I'm 28F and recently I became a single mom. I was with my 3 children's father for 11 years. Two years ago my hormones or something just royally fucked up and I became insanely depressed and it destroyed every relationship I had- including my relationship with my ex. At the end of the day, I dont blame him for leaving. There was no intimacy, I was tired all the time, the house became a mess, I lost my job.. you get the point. Therapy just didnt help me at all. So he left me in August and met someone new a couple weeks later. She is really nice and really good to my kids. It fucking hurts but she is a rock star and I'm happy for my ex. Coparenting has been great. But when the kids leave and I know they are with their dad and his new girlfriend.. the amount of pain I feel is indescribable. I'm getting better now, though I wont say it's easier. But going to the gym and forcing myself to get tasks done has helped because at least I feel accomplished, you know?  My mothers friend Tina is a 52 year old single mother but her kids are grown. Her youngest is 25 and has been out of the house since he was 17. Hes my best friend. She made the choice to become single. Not trying to take away from it but it was her choice and it was after her kids left the home. She just doesnt like men. She admits it. Absolutely hates men and they are only good for making babies, in her eyes. So she left as soon as her kids were out of the house and claims it to be the best decision she ever made. I was at my moms this past weekend while my babies were with their dad and Tina swings by. I was in full hysterics because it was just a bad weekend and my mom was holding me on the couch like a child. I cant remember how it got brought up but Tina was just acting super dismissive of me and then made the comment "I'm a single mom too. It's not that hard."   I snapped. I said something to the affect of "You're children have been out of your house for years now so you dont have the responsibilities of chasing around children all day long and literally never did. It was also your choice to leave your children's father because you hate men, remember? Best decision you ever made right?" Not word for word obviously. She immediately became wildly offended and said that I was trying to take away from her hardship by making out like she didnt have it rough and that I was just lashing out at her because I cant handle my "stupid fucking emotions" like a normal person.

ddourvba	This happened earlier summer. So I’m in a friend group of about 5 girls not including myself. We’re all either 18 or 19. It’s relevant to the story that only 3 of us are “skinny” and the other 3 are bigger girls. Now the other two skinny girls don’t have abs or anything and I’m pretty sure it’s just genetics bc they eat like pigs sometimes (me included lol) Recently I’ve gotten into working out. Not anything super major (I’m too scared to go to the gym). I’ve done a few of Chloe Tings challenges and it’s rewarded me with a body I’m actually proud of. I don’t quite have washboard abs but they’re definitely defined. My friend has a birthday in June and a pool so a lot of the times we like to swim for her birthday party/get together. I never told my friends that I was working out or that I had gotten abs since i didn’t think that was something you just tell people. This is where all hell breaks loose.  So we get there and give our birthday wishes. As we get ready to dive into the pool one of the skinny friends makes a comment on my abs. I told her that I had gotten into exercising and was very proud of my results. She praised me on it and started asking me what I did and what I ate, etc. I noticed the other girls were really quiet but I didn’t really question it because I was still answering my friends questions.  Later after we left my other skinny friend (I know this is a bad way to describe them but it’s easier than coming up w fake names) texted me telling me what an AH I was to “brag” about my body and that the other girls were uncomfortable and self conscious of their own bodies. They all thought that since it was my other friends (one of the bigger girls) birthday, I stole the spotlight from her. She said I should’ve worn something more conservative (granted I was wearing this really cute bikini). I explained that stealing the spotlight was never my intention and that i didn’t even bring up anything about my abs it was our other friend. Needless to say there was an argument  and ended with me saying that just bc some of our friends were insecure doesn’t mean that I need to cater to their insecurities and cover myself up.  So she spilled all that to the girls and they blew me off and ignored me. We’ve since hung out again but this is a sore topic that I don’t dare bring up. Thinking back maybe I was the AH for not covering up and being more considerate of my friend	1643037415.0	sbogik	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbogik/aita_for_bragging_about_my_body/	AITA for “bragging” about my body?
gywww	I (32 M) have been friends with T (32 M) since the third grade. From first concerts to the death of parents/friends, we have been through quite a bit together. I believe that is why I am taking the following deceit so hard.   Three years ago, I had broken up with a long-term girlfriend. We were renting a house together and there was still two months left on the lease. As such, we decided to cohabitate to avoid incurring any early termination fees.   Fast forward to this past weekend, I find out through the grapevine (another mutual friend of ours) that T had slept with my ex sometime during that two month interlude before I moved out. As I truthfully did not have many positive feelings for her after we split, I am not necessarily upset about the act itself. But to do it without either telling me first or even after feels like a slap in the face.   I have been basically ignoring him for the past few days since finding out and am debating the best course of action.

f5ol7aki	 My sister (18) has always been the kind of odd one out with our siblings in the sense that she never really makes an effort to talk to sit with everyone else at home as she’s always in her room upstairs. So recently she’s been constantly arguing and fighting with my mum over things my mum hasn’t even done. She keeps blaming my mum for everything that goes wrong with her and for the sake of keeping the peace I didn’t step in and try to defend my mum because I knew it would only get my sister to kick off all over again. So a couple of nights ago my sister physically hit and bit my mum so hard that she has bruises on her body. (And I am a Muslim btw, the reason I mention this is because all Muslims know about how important a mother is in the eyes of God, so my disbelief and shock that she did that was astronomical.) My sister left the house for a couple of nights and I swore I wouldn’t talk to her for doing that to our mum and that if she ever came back I would be no sister of hers. So today she came back to talk to my mum and my mum is happily forgiving her as if nothing happened. And she (mum) is saying that if I’m not the one who got hit by my sister I’m not the one who has a say over whether I forgive her or not. So AITA for not wanting to forgive my sister even though I technically didn’t get hit, because it’s something I wouldn’t forgive anyone for doing to my mum stranger or sister?  I might be the asshole because I am now the reason there is some tension left at home and she didn’t hit me (Btw I am 22F).	1643037535.0	sboi0o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sboi0o/aita_for_not_wanting_to_forgive_my_sister_for/	AITA for not wanting to forgive my sister for hitting our mother?
iz3dwhlz	I was watching some YouTube videos, and i came across a video about how being poor can be more expensive, things like food, housing is more expensive for poor people. So I began brainstorming how to save money   One of several ideas I though was to arrange a carpool with someone with similar commute and take turns driving, we'd spend half variable expensescompared to driving our own respective cars  At work I talked to some coworkers, and most weren't interested with my arrangements. One person, before I even described any arrangement told me they were having a hard time for unexpected expenses. So I thought this would be perfect, I explained my deal and they said "I charge $17 an hour. And I thought to myself, yeah no, that wouldn't save me money. So I declined. And they said "you want me to work for you for free? You're trying to exploit me"  I said ok "I'll pay you but you have to pay me for the effort I put in". And that person insisted that I was trying to exploit them. I though to myself "fk it" and I walked away   Like 4 days later that person's misfortuned was brought back up in our lunch break. And some coworkers expressed compassion. I didn't, I told people the conversation I had with that person and then a sht storm broke out in an argument.   There was like 20 people. All but two were against me. The people against me said, things like   You have to pay people for work, welcome to capitalism, you have to pay people with money or it's exploitation, people aren't obligated to be in service for you for free. If there was no character limit, and I had perfect memory, I could list dozens of other things they said. Even though they agreed that I was "trying to exploit" they contradicted themselves, some said the deal is decent but my intentions is to exploit, others said thay not paying people with money is exploitation   I thought it was laughable, they sarcastically said welcome to capitalism, when I'm the one doing financially ok, and the other person isn't. They acted like it was a L for me to reject the deal and a W for the other person that I walked away from  The two people backing me up said: this is called barter, it's mutually beneficial.  Money is a medium of exchange. This will solve both problems   But we were outnumbered   Two weeks later that person stopped coming in to work. And we didn't know why, the company knew but not us. The arrangement topic was brought up, and I asked those people against me, what could I have done then? They said "not exploit, you could've give that person free money, or given them info on government assistance."  I'm thinking to myself LOOOL.

il2okuib	Throwaway for obvious reasons below.  I (24f) and my cousin (28m) have always wanted to write a book together, it's always been a shared passion of ours and since we've been best friends our whole lives we work brilliantly together. Quite some time ago we developed an idea to write a very dramatic story loosely based on my other cousin (28m) and his very turbulent and soap opera worthy relationship with his on again, off again girlfriend (27f), which resulted in 2 kids and a very popular gossip topic in our extended family. They also both had kids with other partners and have cheated on eachother constantly. We often exchanged ideas of storylines and basically already wrote a story in our minds, but always carefully excluded details that might suggest any connection to the real people, keeping the real events only as rough guidelines for story progression.   Recently however (about two months ago) we were shocked by the news that the girl tragically passed away, after she lost her kids due to mental health problems and rumoured heavy drug and alcohol use. We were all very sad and heartbroken, losing a life at such a young age is always a tragedy.  My cousin and I now have doubts about writing that book, even though we never planned on revealing the real people behind the inspiration and probably never even stating it's based on real events. The rough draft we designed is already so different from the real thing that nobody who knew them could possibly guess, but we still feel we might disrespect the memory of her, even if we would be the only two people to know it's based on her life.  Why we think we may be assholes: We would be "exploiting" a very real and tragic life story of a person we knew, even though nobody would ever know. As someone who considered her a friend some years ago before all the drama, I'm really conflicted about it and I feel like I'm somehow disrespecting her. I do want to go ahead and write the story, as it's basically already written in my mind, but I don't want to look back at it in a few years and realize I've exploited her tragic REAL life for my own gain.	1643038601.0	sbovl7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbovl7/wibta_if_i_wrote_a_book_based_on_a_life_of_an/	WIBTA if I wrote a book based on a life of an aquaintance who recently passed away?
b6jm36gs	OK so back in July, a couple from my (M 16) school had sex outside of my house in broad daylight. Let's call them E (F 16/17) and B (M 16/17). I saw them (of course) and they knew I saw them. Of course I tell my best friend, G (F 17) about the whole thing. I brush it off.  Then in November, E confronts me as I'm getting off the school bus. She tells me that G is her neighbor, and she's nervous that her mom is gonna find out.

6lof7ylu	I've been out of the dating game for close to a year now and I've just now been actively entering the dating life again. A few years ago I met "let's call her Jane." Jane has a great personality. I love being around her and her two young girls. We talked everyday but then out of the blue she ghosts me and starts dating a guy "let's call him Patrick." Well she broke up with him because he's all types of... Something. We reconnect and she tells me that she's sorry for everyone that we should reconnect. We stayed up all night texting like nothing changed.    While that's going on I've been talking to another girl "let's call her Doe." Doe is nice and we have a ton in common. We've recently went on a date. I've made it clear to Doe that I'm still talking to other people and I'm not really ready to settle down yet which she understands. "I've been burnt before and I have trouble truly commiting"    Deep down though I feel like I'm holding out hope that things progress more with Jane and we pick up where we left off. The thing is though is that I'm afraid to open myself back up with her because I feel like she'll pick up and run off again. Doe on the other hand wants to commit. She wants to settle down. I've never been in this situation before and I don't want any parties to be hurt. Doe has stated she's willing to wait as long as it takes for me to decide what I want to do. Jane on the other hand seems like she doesn't know what she wants.	1643039013.0	sbp0w1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbp0w1/aita_for_having_someone_wait_to_date_me/	AITA for having someone wait to date me?
7yjnejl1	I (14 M) I know quite young, had cussed out a Karen who was being blatantly racist.  I had grown up in a home where I take bullshit from no one, especially against racism being Jamaican-Canadian and all. So one day I decided to go to the park and relax and enjoy the sun because for the past couple of days it's snowy and cold. So I go and sit on the swing, staring into space not having a care in the world.  a couple of minutes go by and some lady and her kid start approaching. I'm not too good with social interactions so I usually feel embarrassed just even saying hello so I ignored her. Thinking she was gonna sit on the bench and watch her kid play. But boy I was wrong she came up to the swing and started snapping at me, which already is extremely disrespectful. I ignored her thinking she was talking to her kid but then she started shouting  "excuse me um excuse me" confused and annoyed I stopped swinging and asked her if she needed anything. And I kid you not she asked me if I could get off the swing so her son could have it, despite there being other swings 3 in fact. So I politely told her no because there are other swings for him.   And her child started crying when I wouldn't get up. You could argue that I should be the bigger person which I was about to but what she said shook me. "Ugh, I can't stand you, people, always so rude and ignorant." I had to take a double-take to process that she just said that to me.  I looked her dead in the eyes and said excuse me shocked and confused. "You people?" I said quite loudly "Look lady I don't know who the fuck you are or who you might think you might be, but that shit will not slide with me!" I yelled and I went off on her and said some things that I can't say on here.  After I went off on her she had the audacity to look shocked as if nobody ever stood up to her.   I left with flipping her off and infuriated that can't have one good day I stormed inside. And told my mom everything. A bit shocked but proud she gave me a high five and told me I handled the situation well.  But she also said you could have been a bit less rude because the things I said were kinda messed up. I agree but I was still pissed at the situation I got annoyed and asked her if she would do the same thing in my shoes. Then finally cooling down I forgot about it until I remembered it out of blue and decided to post it here.

4qq28on5	I (23 F) have been having a lot of stomach problems for well over a year. Sometimes they’re mild annoyances, sometimes they’re pretty scary and debilitating and I haven’t been able to discover a clear cause.   For the last three days, my stomach has been hugely bloated, easily twice it’s normal size. I’ve been experiencing pain in my abdomen and constant nausea that’s making it hard to eat or even drink water.  I normally try not to talk about my stomach issues with my friends because half the time I feel like it’s all I talk about. It’s just become a very big part of my life since it became bad— I went VERY SUDDENLY from 0 issues to having a bad gallbladder, celiac disease, lactose intolerance, and surely some other problems my doctors and I haven’t been able to work out yet. When I talk about these problems,  I feel like broken record and my friends seem sick of hearing about it because they don’t normally say much.  However, yesterday, after three days of discomfort and an inflated stomach, my nervousness got the better of me and I started texting them to ask what I should do. To illustrate how bloated I was (because it was truly alarming to me and I wanted advice on if I should seek some medical attention over it), I sent a photo in front of my mirror with my stomach out. I called it “not a pretty picture,” because, well, it doesn’t feel good to send pictures of your distended stomach to anyone.  The group chat instantly gets very quiet. Now, both of my friends are heavier than me. I’m relatively average-sized, on the heavier side of things according to my BMI. One of my friends is a mom who has given birth before, the other has struggled with her weight all her life. I realize what I said might have sounded insensitive, so I emphasized that this is twice the size of my stomach normally and I’m very uncomfortable and nervous about this sudden change in condition.  I sent a bunch of messages seeking advice (I was truly scared) and they only replied a few times. They told me to go to the doctor and then stopped replying at all.  At the time I was really upset my best friends wouldn’t offer any more support when I was crying and panicking, but I was also afraid I’d offended them, so the whole exchange went very poorly. This morning I’m monitoring my symptoms and deciding if I should brave a doctor visit after all, but the exchange still leaves sort of a sour taste in my mouth. I’m not sure how to feel.

8l9oc62f	I (18F) am a college student and the dorm I live in is basically a space heater. No matter the time of year, the lounge room is always muggy and my dorm room is so hot that I am up most nights sweating or undressing articles of clothing to sleep comfortably. I want to move to a new dorm so I’m not constantly having this problem (no matter what temp we have it turned to for heating/cooling it’s still always very warm in the room/dormhall.)

4f3vg8yz	My dad is your stereotypical narcissist. He can do no wrong, he is manipulative, and he is controlling. Growing up, we were very close. As I got older, I started to realize that the relationship was not healthy (I often felt like I was playing the role of the parent while he threw his temper tantrums). I moved out of state and it really helped my mental health. He still feels like we have a very close relationship, meanwhile I feel overwhelmed and anxious leading up to any visits with him and my step-mom.  Now I am married with a 9 month old baby plus another on the way and my dad and step-mom relocated and live about three hours away. We also have two dogs which they do not allow at their house (which is fine - their house, their rules), but boarding them frequently can become pretty expensive.   They make us feel like we should come visit them more often, but I feel like I am pregnant, have a child under one, and end up having to pay to board our dogs just so we can go visit them overnight. If we make any mention of just visiting and NOT staying the night, I get guilt tripped about how they really would like to spend more time with us and would like us to stay, so we always do.  Meanwhile, they are retired. They don’t mind making a round trip in one day, or coming and leaving early the next day.   My dad will always make remarks about “other family members” such as: “we go visit XYZ all the time, which is two hours away, but they never offer to come to us. So I feel like screw them then, I’m not going to visit them anymore since they don’t make the same effort.” I don’t know if I’m over-reacting, but I definitely feel like he’s insinuating the same thing about me.  I want to allow them to see my kids as much as possible, so I do my best. But I feel like they don’t understand that 3 hours when you’re in your third trimester is a long trip. Nor do they realize how much shit goes into lugging a 9 month old baby there for an overnight stay. Not to mention, it takes up our whole weekend when they don’t have to worry about going to work on Monday. Plus, add the 100+ dollars we pay to board the dogs and the whole idea of visiting just turns into a chore.   My husband’s parents always offer to make the similar trip to us because they understand that it’s a lot more for us to travel than it is for them. Even when we offer, they say let us come to you to save you the money and headache of not being in your own space with the baby.   But I begin to wonder if I’m the one in the wrong for thinking visiting my dad is a “chore.”  AITA for feeling like they shouldn’t expect us to visit so often (it shouldn’t be expected to be 50/50) and that they should offer to come here more if they want to see us/the baby?	1643039867.0	sbpcgc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpcgc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_visit_my_narcissistic/	AITA for not wanting to visit my narcissistic father?
is6aw7lv	Hi everyone, please don’t mind my bad English.. Names are changed.  For context: My mother supposedly passed while giving birth to me and my father abandoned when I(21M) was 6. He wasn’t really that abusive, often beating me up but i think he was more clumsy with people than anything, didn’t know how to handle me (i was a pretty weird and lonely kid)  I grew up in a lot of terrible places and only a teacher helped me a lot (buying me food, school supplies etc) and encouraged me to study. I gave my all in school and got a very good college, and actually working a lot for my degree on my own. I’m actually alone and i have only a cat for real friend and family.  Thing is, I recently(maybe a month ago rn) learned my father’s death, I wasn’t sad or relieved or anything, but long story short he gave me all his inheritance (a lot of money and a house).  But there is the problem, he had a new family (2 step brothers and 2 step sisters) with another woman(she is french). And they contacted me to discuss about this. As they are actually living in the house. I agreed to meet them and everything was nice. I felt like i had a family for the first time in my life, and i always wanted to have sinlings. The woman (let’s call her Jane) was really nice with me, said things like I could come anytime i want, get dinner with them, be part of the family. I agreed to let them stay in the house(they told me they were here for like 15 years) for free, and to give them all of the money my « father » gave me, since i didn’t want that dirty money in the first place.   One day, my youngest half sister, Claire (a little 8 years old angel) asked me if i wanted to be put in the whatsapp family group, I almost cried at this proposition tbh and said yes. The exact same day at the afternoon i saw a message in french (i will put it on my profile ) of Jane, calling me a dumb pigeon, naive and easy to « manipulate » and one of my half bro and sis (the two older twin) agreeing with her. They didn’t know i was in the group and i was just speechless. Just message that i wanted them gone in a month from the house and that i will give them nothing, and left the group.  I have now my mail and call box full of calls and messages on how i am horrible to put an entire family in the street by their family and them, on how they are sorry and everything to make me guilty. Jane even called me crying, telling she didn’t mean it and that it is because of her grief.  I have to admit that doing this make me absolutely guilty, and i kinda feel like the asshole here(even more for the little ones). But I’m starting to feel pretty devastated by all this…Maybe I should not be this harsh and mean ?

4a658p1n	My three year old is blonde and blue eyed and a bundle of energy. Like most people she's currently in love with the Disney movie Encanto, which is a beautiful celebration of Colombian culture. She is usually very much a tomboy but S she fell in love with the amazing music of Encanto she insists she wants to wear a dress to "dance like Encanto" and it's adorable. She jumps and dances and has a blast in an old Frozen dress she never wore before, but she says is right because it's long?   So my question, my mom in her giddiness that my girl is getting into dress up, bought her a dress like Mirabel in the movie and plans to give it to her so she can dance like Encanto at their house.  Given the woke world we live it where people say Moana costumes on kids are cultural appropriation, do I need to be concerned about offending people by letting her wear this dress? Am I allowing my girl to be offensive by wearing it? Should I just return the gift and have her stay in her frozen dress? Genuinely concerned because I don't feel little kids playing dress up is offensive but it isn't really my call to make as a white person what is offensive.	1643040096.0	sbpft3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpft3/wibta_if_i_let_my_daughter_wear_an_encanto_dress/	WIBTA if I let my daughter wear an Encanto dress?
iz6g5w65	I (34M) regularly snore and it can wake up my wife once or twice a night if she's not wearing earplugs. If she wears earplugs to sleep it's fine, but she doesn't like to do this because she says she cannot hear if our toddler (2.5M) has woken up or needs help at night. (FWIW he has never needed help at night, except for once when he got his leg stuck in the crib and definitely yelled loud enough to wake both of us up immediately, earplugs or not.)  I recently had surgery to help fix my snoring, but I am not yet fully recovered from it (takes 2 weeks) and it's actually made the snoring worse as I'm really congested while I heal from the surgery. As I have been recovering, my wife has been really annoyed with my sniffling, shooting me annoyed looks and putting in earplugs when we're just reading in bed. The other night before bed she seemed really annoyed and I asked her what was up and she unloaded on me about how she can't be empathetic about my sniffling and snoring while I'm recovering because it's disruptive to her sleep, and how she's frustrated that I'm so hard to sleep with.  I pretty much lost it at this, because I generally feel like crap right now (super congested and generally tired), and I got this surgery in order to fix my snoring in the first place at my wife's urging, and now after I got the surgery she's annoyed at me for something that I can't control, which was done (at least partially) for her benefit in the first place. She seems to think that this is a reasonable thing to be frustrated about and I should be doing more to help her sleep better, or should just not sniffle while I'm around her while I'm recovering. I really can’t believe not just the lack of patience but the apparent disgust with how i sound while I am trying to recover from a surgery that I got in the first place to try to make this problem improve.  Am I the asshole?	1643040348.0	sbpj69	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpj69/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_wife_32f_for_being/	AITA for getting mad at my wife (32F) for being insensitive about my snoring?

is6aw7lv	Hi everyone, please don’t mind my bad English.. Names are changed.  For context: My mother supposedly passed while giving birth to me and my father abandoned when I(21M) was 6. He wasn’t really that abusive, often beating me up but i think he was more clumsy with people than anything, didn’t know how to handle me (i was a pretty weird and lonely kid)  I grew up in a lot of terrible places and only a teacher helped me a lot (buying me food, school supplies etc) and encouraged me to study. I gave my all in school and got a very good college, and actually working a lot for my degree on my own. I’m actually alone and i have only a cat for real friend and family.  Thing is, I recently(maybe a month ago rn) learned my father’s death, I wasn’t sad or relieved or anything, but long story short he gave me all his inheritance (a lot of money and a house).  But there is the problem, he had a new family (2 step brothers and 2 step sisters) with another woman(she is french). And they contacted me to discuss about this. As they are actually living in the house. I agreed to meet them and everything was nice. I felt like i had a family for the first time in my life, and i always wanted to have sinlings. The woman (let’s call her Jane) was really nice with me, said things like I could come anytime i want, get dinner with them, be part of the family. I agreed to let them stay in the house(they told me they were here for like 15 years) for free, and to give them all of the money my « father » gave me, since i didn’t want that dirty money in the first place.

mfxzj	I have a good friend of mine whom I really enjoy spending time with. However, I find his boyfriend extremely irritating. I personally don't even understand WHY they're a couple because they honestly don't look like they should belong together at all, but whatever, their decision, I don't have a say in this and that's OK.  The actual issue comes from the fact that his boyfriend is EXTREMELY clingy and paranoid and won't let him hang out with ANYBODY without him being around as well. In other words, not a single time was I able to chill with my friend without his boyfriend being around. And it's not just with me, he does that with anybody.  Heck, he's accompanied him to events related to stuff he doesn't actually enjoy. Which made things very awkward for eveybody once he obviously acted bored out of his mind.  This would be annoying with someone I didn't dislike but made SO MUCH worse by the fact that I can spend AT BEST an hour around that guy before I have to make up some excuse to leave.  Would it make me an asshole if I \*ACTUALLY\* asked my friend to hang out with me without his BF? Or made it clear that I'd like to enjoy time with him without his boyfriend shadowing us?	1643041106.0	sbptiv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbptiv/wibta_for_asking_my_friend_to_hang_out_with_me/	WIBTA for asking my friend to hang out with me without his BF around?
iz78x0f0	I'm not sure about the etiquette for this and my coworker's reaction has me feeling like an asshole so I'm posting here.  One of my coworkers and I have been working together on a project and she often mentions her boyfriend.  Last week she mentioned to me that she actually moved here from Germany to be with her boyfriend.  I thought it was pretty neat and I asked her how they met.  She got upset and said that I shouldn't be asking her personal questions in the office and that this is sexual harassment.  I thought it was ok to ask a follow up question (I didn't think it through too much honestly) because she talks a lot about her boyfriend, like how they are going to Malaga for his birthday in March and she tells me when they have date night and all the stuff she does with him.  I definitely didn't mean it in a flirty way, in fact I'm a straight woman who's committed to her husband and kids and I would be wary of dating in the office anyways.  I am just wondering if I was out of line here and if so, should I just ignore her when she brings up her boyfriend? I'm not sure what the right thing to do is here.	1643041229.0	sbpv9g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpv9g/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_how_she_met_her/	AITA for asking my coworker how she met her boyfriend?
4pfoupic	Little bit of backstory: My family have never showed an interest in my life until the day I got engaged. I am the youngest of my family and the last to be married of the grandchildren. I definitely feel like the black sheep of my family.   I (25F) will be marrying my best friend in August of this year. My family has been wanting to get involved with planning the bachelorette party. However, they want to have the party out of state since my MOH wouldn’t be able to attend both the party and the wedding (since it would happen within the same month). Well, my fiancé wanted to have a combined party since none of his wedding party are in the same state. His party is spread out across the country. My family is against him coming and constantly tell him to have his own party with his wedding party. The thing is, my family just wants to take me out drinking and I don’t really drink alcohol at all. They got mad that he wanted to go and kept telling him no over and over, but then asked me afterwards about my opinion about specific things. Would I be an asshole if I told them that I would rather save money and have a combined party with my fiancé?	1643041566.0	sbpzt7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpzt7/wibtah_if_i_ask_my_family_for_a_combined_bachelor/	WIBTAH If I ask my family for a combined Bachelor/ Bachelorette Party
iz6w8iz0	AITA for accusing my husband of cheating with someone he’s never met in person? I 28f and my husband 30m have had this argument over this person he talks to almost daily. She lives over 500 miles away and in the 2 years in talking to her they have never met. At first I thought it was an innocent friendship, supporting each other through relationship problems. Then I started to notice he was constantly talking about her and her kids, lots of FaceTiming, and he would get mad if I happened to look at his phone if he was messaging her. Things took a sharp turn down hill when he suggested we join a fetish website and become polyamorous. At first I was not into it but after him asking everyday I finally caved in and said okay. He immediately starts looking at girls on the website and the first person he looks up is the girl who he’s been talking to and shows me all her naked pictures. I felt really uneasy and kinda just pushed the feeling down thinking I was being insecure. Fast forward a couple of months and things have gone down hill more, we barley have sex, he goes off fishing and working in his workshop a lot and blames it on me for not being a b***h, even though he was saying how it makes him feel good to be able to work with his hands. He is constantly asking if we can add another person to our relationship, and he mentions her a few times saying that we could take care of all the kids together and all the benefits  of adding her into the mix. I agree and not even 1 minute after I agree he is texting her to ask her to be in our relationship. He even says “yes, I can’t wait to please her, she’s so kinky.” After he said that every red flag in the book goes off and I immediately shut it down, telling him that what he just said was messed up, I can’t do polyamory, that it’s like he is already In love with her ( which he has since admitted it true) and the obvious that he is cheating. He comes back at me saying that what he said about pleasing her was a joke, that I am being insecure, and that how can he cheat on me with someone he has never met in person. I ask him not to mention her again and to either stop talking to her OR to tone down the conversation, in which his response was h*ll no he will not be doing any of those things and that I was over reacting. It’s been about 5 months since that conversation and he still talks to her daily, sends her and her children money and stuff they need and has even been planning going on an alone vacation to see them. (We have never been on a family vacation before) He keeps holding what I said over my head now, telling me I am being abusive for not letting him have friends and being a bitch when I get irritated that he is literally constantly talking about her… AITA or am I just over reacting? I seriously am not sure of anything anymore….	1643041714.0	sbq1pw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbq1pw/aita_for_accusing_my_so_of_cheating_with_his_best/	AITA for accusing my s/o of cheating with his best friend.
6bmguemp	My friend (28M) is an artist. He's really great at it too. I (30F) and a writer. Not published, but I've been writing long enough that I'd consider myself a decent writer.   So for his project he's almost done with he has a story to go along with the artwork. Since writing's my bailiwick and he offered to pay me. I knew he needed help and that it was going to be rough and need a lot of polishing, but I didn't anticipate it would be as much of a headache as it was.   I don't want to be too mean because I love him with all my heart, but my 9-year-old nephew's written things that are more legible. I sifted through over 15 pages, editing, tweaking and, just trying to figure out what the hell he was trying to say. He changed from first person to third person POV at least 30 times, he didn't use ANY quotation marks in about 10,000 words. Honestly, if I didn't love him like a brother I would have told him to fuck off and get someone else to edit it for him because there's no amount of money he could give me to make me go through that again. I consider myself to be pretty fast at editing. For my own writing, for example, I  can edit and rework 10,000 words in maybe an hour give or take if it needs work. I spent over *ten* hours working on his story.  The story itself I think is pretty cute now that I've performed a literal miracle and made it legible. I was asked to edit a story and instead, I took a tangled mess and basically rewrote it for him. I didn't even tell him that 'editing' his story literally made me want to put a gun in my mouth rather than edit another goddamn thing again in my life.   Now it's been a month or two since I finished fixing his story and he's saying he wants me to go through it and read it with him to make sure everything sounds alright. Also, he's added more things he wants me to review. I told him that there are programs that will read a document out loud as an alternative because I'm *not* going to read it to him. I understand that he's dyslexic so he has issues reading, but I'm not doing that. And I glanced at what he added and it seems like what he'd added is relatively more manageable, but after reviewing about a page of it I'm already burned out from it. I know I said I'd help, but I have my own writing that I'm working on and the prospect of having to work on this AGAIN legitimately makes me want to jump in front of a train.  On top of that, I have yet to be paid. I haven't told him yet that I don't want to do anymore it or that if I'm expected to do it I'm *not* doing it for free. If I'm being paid like an editor he'd owe me a load of money. It's been ages and I haven't even brought up the fact that I worked my ass off and I hated working on his story and, unfortunately, at this point despite how much I love him I simply do not give a fuck. Am I the asshole for not wanting to honor this stupid commitment anymore?	1643042383.0	sbqaja	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqaja/aita_if_i_dont_finish_editing_my_friends_story/	AITA if I don't finish editing my friends' story after I told him I would?
dipj7we9	My husband is constantly taking things to work that are mine and ruining them. We’ve been married for almost 3 years and even though we’ve addressed why it’s important to treat each other’s things with respect, he still takes items that are mine and returns them in bad condition. Example, I have a protein shaker bottle that I specifically bought for me to use. It’s bright green and pink. I couldn’t find it and automatically knew my husband took it. He finally brought it back, rancid, from being used and sitting in the back of his car for a week. If you’ve ever done this, you know how rotten that smell is.   So now, from being consistently burned from him using and abusing my stuff (never asks to borrow it either, just takes it off to work), I won’t let him use anything that is mine. I refused to let him borrow my cooler and he took it to work anyways stating “I wasn’t going to buy another cooler just because you won’t let me use yours”. I was livid.   It’s mainly coffee containers and Tupperware that he does this with. He tosses them in his car and let’s them rot to a point that I’ve just started tossing them. It’s not like he doesn’t have his own containers to use- he just tosses everything into the back of his nasty car and then won’t have any to use so he takes mine. It’s unhygienic and immature. His argument is that we shouldn’t have things that are “ours” - we share household items. I agree to a certain extent, but when he’s taking my “Best Mom Ever” mug to work, it is clearly my mug. Or when he takes mugs my family bought me as presents, and ruins them, it makes me enraged.   Bottom line: AITA for being upset with my husband and refusing to let him borrow things that were mine before marriage or that were purchased for me because of his track record of ruining them?	1643042634.0	sbqdxw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqdxw/aita_for_not_allowing_my_husband_to_use_items/	AITA for not allowing my Husband to use items that are mine?

Let me explain, my father and stepmom has been together since 2017 and has been married since 2019, my stepmom was really nice to me when they got together and after they married but once I met my Fiancé in March 2020, she changed! She give me the cold shoulder, she always bites my head off, she Huffs and puffs when I come into the room or when I talk to my father, I've heard her talk about me on the phone with her mother and she rolls her eyes everytime I talk.  Its gotten to the point that my Fiancé has noticed, family friends have noticed, and my father has noticed tiny things but every time I talk to my father he gives me excuses saying "shes just sick, she can't breathe well." Or "she's upset with someone else." Or my favorite "its the steroids from the sickness she's having." Like father, she does this when she's not sick! She does this every day! And of course I've tried to even talk to her but she ignores me or gets rude with me.  My bio mother, sister and Fiancé thinks she hates me, and honestly I think so too.  But my step siblings and some family friends think I'm an butthole because I think she hates me.   My father on the other hand is in the neutral zone.   So am I the butthole for even thinking it?	1643043207.0	sbqlsu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqlsu/aita_for_thinking_my_stepmom_hates_me/	AITA for thinking my stepmom hates me?
iyy14swn	I (19f) suffer from a number of mental illnesses, but the worst one is my MDD (Maladaptive Daydream Disorder). It's a nightmare. I cannot do anything without disassociating. I will sit for 6 straight hours in my own head. One time I picked so deeply into my skin that I now have thick scars all over my fingers and my grip strength is fucked in my left hand. The same on my lips. All from dissociating and daydreaming. I don't even feel it until I get snapped out and my fingers look like I've rubbed strawberry juice on a cut hotdog (I'm sorry for that visual). It fucks with my sleep schedule and I cannot do anything without brown noise to block out my thoughts. In short, it's not something anyone wants and I cannot stop.   I found out that my cousin (17f) heard about it on tiktok (because of course she did) and went online to ask how to start 'MDDing'. In her own words, she wants to 'become so immersed, she can sit for 24 hours and daydream'. For reference, when I did that at my worst point, I was so sick I could barely function. I didn't eat, sleep or pee because of it. It was literally like a horror movie where I would sit on my bed and scribble what I was daydreaming about on paper whilst being totally out of it.  When I found out, I messaged her and said we need to talk. I had a serious talk with her and said that what she's doing is fucked up. She tried to double down and say it's 'just daydreaming' but I explained what I did in my first paragraph.   A few hours later, I get a text from my aunt who is super mad at me for having this talk with my cousin. She said it's not my place to talk to her about that sort of thing, and how she was just having 'innocent fun'. My mom agrees with her sister and said that I should have brought it up to my aunt if I was that worried.

52x7hw2s	Hey redditors, first post ever, so sorry if I am unclear or something. I don’t usually talk about this stuff, but here I am. I a  I am Junior in high school , (16m) and met this girl in English. Keep in mind, I’ve never actually dated anyone. We hit it off, and went on a date. At this point neither of us had asked each other out, so I have no idea what to talk about. We bowl, and talk a little bit, but it’s not super fun. I shrug it off, and assume it’s simply because we haven’t asked each other out or whatever. Later in the week, I ask her out, but over text. Again, don’t bully me for it, I’m new to this. She says yes. We then start talking more and more, and I realize I can’t do a relationship at the moment. She was clingy and a drama queen, and I was busy. My swimming season was ramping up, and I’m in the middle of testing ADHD medication. I also had started prioritizing my grades over life, because I so desperately wanted to boost them. So, at some point, after me texting her goodnight, she texts me asking  “Do you like me”  I responded with “Yes, I wouldn’t have asked you out if I didn’t like you, I’ve just been busy” She responded with  “We’re dating??” HUH!? WHAT!? WHAT THE HELL!?  So things are awkward for like 2 weeks, we don’t really talk, then we agree on just being friends. Now, a week after that, she texts me, saying “How’s my handsome man doing” So what the hell! So I have to tell her, that I really can’t do a on off relationship, my mental health can’t take it, I’m sorry, you deserve better, so I can’t do this. Now we don’t look at each other.  Am I the Asshole??	1643043619.0	sbqrp2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqrp2/aita_for_this_relationship/	AITA for this relationship?

6688hdix	I recently got married. I was planning on having 8 bridesmaids, one of which was a dear friend of mine of almost a decade. This friend had a boyfriend who I never particularly liked, but I was outwardly supportive of their relationship since I never really had too much reason to dislike him, more.of a gut thing. However, about 2 months before my wedding, I found out that this boyfriend had committed a very serious offense against my friend AND against the law.  Once we learned of this, my fiance and I had lots of serious discussions about whether we felt comfortable having this man at our wedding (as a plus one). We waited to find out if there was going to be jail time, or if my friend wanted to break it off. When it was clear neither was happening, I gently broke it to my friend that her man was NOT welcome at the wedding. It really hurt her, and they both begged us to reconsider. When we did not, my friend ended up backing out of the wedding completely under the reason of "where my boyfriend is not welcome, I won't be". This REALLY hurt me, since I thought she would understand our reasons. She has since completely cut me out of her life without letting me talk to her, I begged her to meet up so we could talk like adults, and she said there was nothing to talk about, that she refused to be friends with someone who didn't support all her choices. This whole thing really hurt me and left me questioning whether I made the right decision in this. Should I have just let the man come to my wedding to avoid all the drama?	1643044151.0	sbqzd6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqzd6/aita_for_uninviting_my_best_friends_so_to_my/	AITA for uninviting my best friends SO to my wedding?
gv7wd8by	So, this guy started out as my friend almost two and a half years ago. We hit it off really well and immediately got closer, eventually hanging out every day and sharing everything with another. We were inseparable, always playing games, sending each other memes, having fun. He said he had a crush on me like 10 months ago and we dated from July 2021-Jan 2022.   I have a lot of trouble talking about my deeper/darker emotions/situations. I actually didn’t even know I was capable of feeling this upset till what he put me through.   So he broke up with me three weeks ago because he thought we argued too much, which used to never happen. He took a week long break then said he wants to go back to being friends. We hung out as friends a couple times and all was well, till there was this random ghosting that lasted three days.   I mentioned to him it seems like there’s distance between us and he got EXTREMELY angry, saying “why do you feel like telling me this?” And making the issue much bigger than it was. He said “there’s no point in bringing that up” and saying it “emotionally drains him” I kid you not when I say I reassured him 500 times it isn’t meant to be a fight or drama and I wasn’t angry or upset when I said that, I just wanted to make sure everything was cool between us.   He refused to answer the question and kept going on and on about how “every time” we talk, I bring up the conflict. I said that isn’t true and named four times during the last week or so we had a good time and didn’t talk about that and also told him I’m not bringing up what broke us up, I’m talking about the last three days and wanna know if he’s doing alright. He kept repeating himself very rudely and not listening to me which made me feel minimized and antagonized.   I told him communication is a vital part of all relationships, even friendships, and if you wanna go back to being close friends we need to communicate. This is not the first time he’s done this, as after our breakup we had another fight like this where he got angry and defensive whenever I tried to talk about my feelings, pinning the blame on me saying im being too negative and draining him when I was in a very vulnerable place since he’d just broken up with me and wasn’t saying anything hurtful or rude.   This time around, he said “we’re never talking again, and I MEAN it” then deleted me as a friend on everything and left all of our mutual communities so I never contact him again. All because I said “hey things seem a little distant.” I don’t understand.   All he does is play League of Legends for 15 hours a day. I just never knew the person who used to be so loving and caring towards me could turn this cold hearted and unmovable. I felt like walking on eggshells every time I mentioned anything about my feelings because this same thing would erupt. He Literally cut me out of his life and spat on me because I wanted to know if he’s okay. AITA for trying to communicate the way I did?	1643044833.0	sbr902	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbr902/aita_for_trying_to_communicate_with_my_ex/	AITA for trying to communicate with my ex boyfriend?
gmqzdmfp	*sorry if there are any misspellings/grammar errors, I'm Dutch so English isn't my native language   I (26f) haven't been in touch with my dad (63m) since November 2021.   Backstory: my parents got divorced when I was 8 because dad cheated. He used to be my BFF but after the divorce he dropped me as if I was contagious because he was too busy chasing his *ehem* male appendage. When I was around 12 dust started to settle and he thought he could continue where he left off. I was four years older now and at the dawn of puberty.   My dad has always been a guy of extremes where his opinions were concerned. Example: when I was a kid my dad used to vote Left. Also he renounced the church. Fast forward to 2021: he hates immigrants(which is ironic, my stepmother is from Serbia), is a devout Christian. He now votes as Right as you can get. Dad never takes me serious. My opinions don't matter because he has the years and the experience, or so he claims.  Whenever I talk back to him because I think he is wrong, he talks me down and plays the victim. In his eyes I'm still that 12 year old girl.  He talks down to my mother who has done everything she could after he left us, working through three burn-outs all so she could provide for me. Let me be clear: we might not always see eye to eye but my mom is a damn fine lady.   Over the summer of 2021 he'd send me articles on a daily basis about Antivaxx propaganda. He would try to shove it down my throat and sold it as if it were the one and only truth. (To be clear, I am not Antivaxx, but I don't have a problem with people who are. You do you, idgaf.) I was getting sick of this daily harassment, I put up with it because he's still my father.  One day he started talking that 'he wouldn't bow for this devilish regime' and 'he would probably be put in a camp and thus part of the Final Solution'  This is where I thought he overstepped and I drew a hard line. You DO NOT compare Covid to WOII (for those that don't know, the Final Solution was the last wave of  extermination of all remaining Jews in the concentration camps)  I was baffled, I asked what was wrong with him for making that comparison and talking casually about it. He claimed he didn't know why I was so angry, but I know he knew. He's not dumb, he just acts like it.  I told him I was done. Asked him if he could go back to just being my dad instead of this pushy Antivaxx evangelist. That was too much to ask, told me I shouldn't talk back and he was just trying to keep me 'on edge', and if I couldn't act 'normal' (aka comply with him) he would break all contact with me.  These past few weeks he's been trying to get in touch with me, bordering on desperate. But I refuse to answer his messages/calls. He got what he wished for and tbh I can't say that I miss him.   Oh, he still sends me those articles 🤷🏼‍♀️  AITA?	1643045723.0	sbrlhg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrlhg/aita_for_not_having_any_form_of_contact_with_my/	AITA for not having any form of contact with my dad
8e4uerqg	This started about 5 years back. My (32F) friend was getting married and she asked me (29F hobby seamstress) to make her wedding dress. She sent me inspiration from other wedding gowns she liked and loved the design I made. She agreed with the conditions and price and she signed off the contract.  It took a year but her dress was finished. Before I could text her to get one last fitting in, she texts me first. Her wedding is **OFF**! She didn't give me the deets other than her fiancee was a "bastard". I asked her if she still wanted her dress and a partial refund (I can't return the materials), all of which she said "No, I don't care what you do with it all! Keep the fucking money and burn the dress for all I care!"  Just to be safe, I hung onto the dress for about a year and a half in case she changed her mind. In fact, I occasionally asked her if she was sure she didn't want the dress. She in turn snapped at me and told me to "shut up about the stupid dress! I don't want it!" So I gave it to a relative whose daughter was getting married and needed a dress.  Fast forward to this year, she rekindled things with her fiancee and the wedding is back on. She asked me where her dress was and I told her I don't have it anymore. She demanded to know where it was and I told her it went to France for my relative's daughter's wedding. She was ***pissed***.   She cussed me out, called me awful names, threatened me with lawsuits, all because she said she didn't want her wedding dress back that she didn't even want anymore.  I reminded her with screenshots that she confirmed multiple times that she didn't want the dress anymore along with her signature on the legally binding contract. She tried taking the issue to paypal but even paypal said "too late, too bad". She was so mad, she just ended our friendship right then and there.  So I'm curious, am I the asshole in this situation? Because I honestly do feel bad that her wedding is now delayed because of me.	1643046510.0	sbrwcz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrwcz/aita_for_giving_away_my_friends_new_wedding_dress/	AITA for giving away my friend's new wedding dress?
iyselm8w	I (12F) found out my dad( 50M) had nudes on his phone when I was just 7 years old. I was in a friend's house and had to keep a straight face infront of everyone when I saw it. I was scared to tell anyone what happened and was worried about what would happen in me and my sister's (19F) life too. I eventually told my sister 1 week ago after one of the worst birthdays in my life because I was secretly crying on and off after I decide to tell her from worry. We planned to collect evidence and show my mum but my sister had already accidentally told her one day when I was at school. My mum told her she already knows and told us she would tell my dad but she wouldn't say it straight away that I found out  because both she and my sister thinks he's not mentally stable enough to hear it. They said I was being unreasonable for wanting to tell what the pictures on his phone has caused me from a very young age. I know some of you may think this isn't such a big deal as he is an adult but my mum had previously told him to stop and we also live in a cultural community where anything like this and even divorce would bring shame on your entire family even if it was with consent. So for reasons like this, this gave me severe insomnia and depression especially as I couldnt talk to anyone about it for 5 years. However I was too young to know what it was. They both said that I can't hate him completely because he is my dad but he has caused me more pain that any other feeling.

iz89jdul	I (26F) got married almost 1 year ago. Me and my (soon to be ex) husband met in high school, went to the same university until I transferred to the US. We were both popular (for different reasons), and I was close with his friends, though not with him.   A year and a half ago, I came back to SK on a business trip (?) and we met again. We started dating like 2 days later, and got married 8 months along.   A month and a half into our marriage, he came to me proposing a 3some with some hot coworker of his. I have never felt good enough for him (considering he was famous for his looks and all-rounded talents and I, for my brain) and I am not necessarily sexually experienced since I was in a serious relationship from 16 to 21 and after that, I was juggling a double major and a job, so I never really had the time (until I started my residency, but that was short-lived and very particular for the field). That being said, I ended up agreeing (not verbally, but I guess I never said "no" either), and days later, I returned from work to find him and his coworker drinking wine on the couch. I denied joining them (drinking, that is) and we quickly got down to... business. Not even 2 minutes later, I started feeling disgusted and dejected, and escaped to the bathroom while they continued. After they finished, they kissed for like 10 minutes and he walked her to the door (where they spent 20 minutes gently kissing, as well).   The next morning, I guess he was too inebriated to remember me crying and throwing up in his bathroom (complimented me for the night prior) and suggested swinging with his other coworker. Once again, I didn't really say anything, but once the day came I went to his coworker's place and his wife went to my husband's. We did nothing but kiss for like 5 minutes and I found the guilt so repulsive I had to leave. I went home and heard my husband and the woman moaning and whatnot, along with him telling her things I felt were reserved for me, and I decided I couldn't handle all that then. I wrote him a note and left.   A month after, I found out I was pregnant. He eventually found me through a detective and we had a talk about how I cannot be with him because he makes me feel too insecure (generally) and that I felt blinding jealousy and sorrow when, not even 2 months into our marriage (<1 year into our relationship), he felt the need to be with other women. He said he only wanted to help me experience those things. We ended up having sex that same day, but denied rekindling. He was about to leave when he heard our son cry.    I fear that my son is gonna live precariously because of my decisions. I never saw myself as a mother, and being a doctor has always been my dream, so within such a demanding field I'm not sure about how I'm gonna be able to raise him. I also don't believe I could handle it if my son ever preferred his dad, considering how much I want to hate him - so I guess I'm a hypocrite.

duvhwok9	(English is not my first language so I'm sorry if there is grammatical errors)  I (21f) have a twin sister and we still live together with my mom. We normally get along except for a few times when we fight (normal siblings stuff ig).   Here's some backstory: I have been in a depressive episode for a few days now and normally when I am in those everything bothers me and I can get angry very easy. This something I have tried to work on because I don't like how it affects my relationship with my family and friends but it's been hard and I know it isn't an excuse.  Also my sister and I don't like avocado (Ik shocking) so we normally try to avoid it or give it to my mom.  Now to the actual story: Yesterday I was angry at everything and everyone especially because my package that I ordered came wrong (I know it's silly but still) and my mom made me go pick up the food but when I tried to tell her if she could do something for me while I was doing picking up the food she said no because "it was to complicated and she didn't feel like it" and I got annoyed because of that. I picked up the food plus the thing I told my mom to do (it took me like 15 minutes to do anyway and it wasn't that complicated) so I was annoyed. I arrived to my house and sat to eat with my mom and sister.   When we sat down, we made some small talk about the package while I was saying that i'm going to return it. I also have to say that my phone was near me but I wasn't using it and then out of nowhere my sister grabbed it. I hate when people use my phone without permission so I told her to give it back,  she ignored me and continued looking at my phone, I told her again and she still ignored me. It wasn't until my mom told her to give it back that she gave it to me. Then I started talking again about the package and my sister started imitating me, I got annoyed at this and because I had some avocado in my food and was giving it to my mom, I decided that the next piece of avocado I find I was going to give it to my sister. I put the piece of avocado in my sister's plate and she flipped out saying that I was "rude" and I shouldn't be playing with food. I got mad at her saying that she was the rude one and went to my room.   Now that I'm calm, I started to feel bad about the whole situation.   So, Am I the asshole for putting avocado in my sister's food?	1643047639.0	sbscik	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbscik/aita_for_putting_avocado_in_my_sisters_food/	AITA for putting avocado in my sister's food?
aty636wm	I (28F) have wavy/curly red hair. I frequently get comments on it. Sometimes it's a genuine comment and other times it's creepy.   Today I was in the grocery store when I see a man in his 40s or 50s staring at me. I was walking fast to get in and get out. I made eye contact for just a bit too long and he says, "Hi. I like the color of your hair." I look away, say nothing, and keep walking. He went about his business. Now I'm overthinking it. Maybe I'm the asshole here.

3b7hooql	So, I (17F) have been dating my boyfriend (18M) for 5 months and he doesn't have a good relationship with his mom. And about 2 months into our relationship she pulled me aside one day to talk to me. She started out by telling me not to tell my boyfriend about the conversation and proceeded to ask me if I was on birth control, at the time I wasn't, and I told her I wasn't but I had plans to get an IUD she gave me a bit of a judgy look and explained to me why she doesn't like IUD's. She also proceeded to tell me how she's prolife and if I got pregnant she would essentially pressure me into keeping the kid and she could take care of it if I needed her to so that I could go to college. The conversation pretty much ended there because my boyfriend came upstairs.  I was telling some of my friends about the conversation and how I hadn't told my boyfriend about it because I know he would probably react poorly and they said it was the right choice. However, that conversation has been on my mind so much recently because I feel it's something he should know but I don't want his relationship with his mom to be damaged further.

iz9svkzq	So I met my husband as a one night stand.  My boyfriend at the time (completely unreliable) kept on insisting I go to 5 a side ladies soccer training at work. He had loads of hobbies and think he thought I should have one too. I eventually broke up with him as I was sick of his various awful ways, but I met my now husband at leaving drinks for one of the team’s players (she was going travelling with now husbands friend).. it was two weeks after I broke up W loser boyfriend and I only knew the person leaving the team because he’d insisted I stick at playing soccer. I was 31 and thought probably I’d never meet anyone in time to have children tbh, having just come out of a 5 year relationship. But after a drunken fun night out, we started dating. It went slowly at first. 14 yrs later we are still happy together and have 3 kids. I never would have guessed that was on the horizon that evening when I went out for drinks. I just went because I was at a loose end.  The thing is, I don't want to tell my sons that my husband and I were just fuckbuddies and eventually we got into a relationship.  But I always tell my sons how important honesty and transparency are.  WIBTA if I tell them "after a drunken fun night out, we started dating" and skip over the sex part, and make it sound like we just hung out at the pub and then we decided to date straightaway?	1643048438.0	sbsnnu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbsnnu/aita_if_i_dont_tell_my_sons_the_full_truth_of_how/	AITA if I don't tell my sons the full truth of how I met their father until they're older?

iy9qhg5p	I (29F) have been married to my husband (44M) for three years.  We had dated for just over two years before marrying. We had a brief conversation about how many partners the other had a few months after we had started dating. This was after we had slept together a handful of times.   I said my specific number-which was 3. He gave a vague answer about how it’s more than that but nothing that he felt was too risky.  Anyways, fast forward to today. I’m now pregnant with our first.  My OB did all the standard STI tests which she said was routine for when you’re pregnant.  It included gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, hepatitis, syphillis, and herpes. All were negative.   Anyways I was anxious about the testing before they came back. It made me remember that conversation we had when we were early in our relationship. I ended up asking my husband for his specific number before the test-hoping it was a low number that would assuage my nervousness. He confessed that he had slept with 47 women before me. But that once he met me he knew I was the one who he wanted to settle down with and since he had sown his wild oats he was ready to move on to a different phase of life.  Anyways I yelled at him for his past behavior putting me and our baby at risk. I feel like that maybe was an irrational thought though and I kind of feel bad for saying it. He wasn’t apologetic for his past and just said that I was being irrational and that the past was irrelevant. Anyways, should I apologize to him?

izbj68b8	I work in Tech and have a group of friends/colleagues that host a poker game, it is not anything serious. It is just at a friend's house we all drink and have a good time playing. No one here is a pro or anything but there are a lot of smart guys that do play and are pretty good. We talk about life career, investment stuff, dating etc.      I have a friend call her Rachael (not her real name). We were talking about sports for networking and how I think gold was super popular for that, but for me if anything I just play poker with the guys. She asks me a bit about our games and then she insists that I come. Now, Rachael is smart too, she is in tech as well, but she doesn't know poker, she thinks its all about tells and behavior. I told her that it was a bad idea, that she should look up some videos before. She then tells me she has played plenty with her family.     And that me not letting her come, shows that I am gatekeeping my social network, and the fact that this poker group is all men is already problematic with how men are in tech. I was like okay okay, don't blame me if you lose your money...      She comes in and only brings $400 for two buy ins. But quickly blows through that asks me for cash and she venmos me. Then loses another $800. Gets angry and calls an Uber home. She said that guys kept bullying her by raising her... And I was like, I told you thats the difference between your family games and these ones. She is angry, and now views me and my friends as assholes. That them raising her bets etc. wasn't good poker play but them bullying the only woman in the home game, so she wouldn't come back.

76ga3dou	OK so I(25f) wanted to check myself before I start acting like a crazy toxic person. My boyfriend(23m) has had a girl best friend since they were in high school. I am super supportive of this and believe that you don't dictate the other relationships your partner has, regardless of gender.   Recently, however, I learned he failed to disclose to me when we started dating that he was sexually involved with her in the past and even lost his virginity to her. We both disclosed our sexual histories early on and he failed to bring her up. Now I am feeling like he was dishonest especially since it's a girl he talks to daily and hangs out with, without me.  I don't even really mind that they had a sexual relationship; I feel like he was blatantly dishonest with me when disclosing the nature of their relationship and I should have been told upfront that while they are friends now, they used to date and had sex in the past. Am I being crazy for being upset with him about this? I haven't brought it up to him because I don't know how and not sound possessive.   I don't want to tell him not to talk to her anymore because I know their friendship is important to him, but the fact that he hid their past makes me uncomfortable.

iwx5oi4l	boyfriend and i have been together almost 4 years. i had just turned 17 when we got together, was a virgin and had never even really kissed a guy. i was very awkward and shy as everything was so new to me. 4 months in, i found a message on his phone where one of his friends said he dreamt that my boyfriend had sex with a girl they went to high school with and his response was “fuck i wish.” there was also a website with naked girls he’d continuously look up that i didn’t mind at first but after that incident i didn’t feel comfortable anymore so i asked him to stop and he claimed that he did. these things obviously made me insecure and i will be the first to admit my own insecurities got the best of me quite often after this and i made mountains out of molehills fairly often. there were a few more things like this i found that were hurtful, but relatively harmless things that most people brush off as typical dude stuff. come 2021, our relationship was honestly about the best it had ever been. i wasn’t on edge constantly wondering what he was doing on his phone i had finally started to kinda feel like i could trust him which also meant i was getting less insecure. we found out i was pregnant in March and were super excited. the pregnancy went smoothly and i had very minimal thoughts of whether he’d still find me attractive bc like i said we were in such a good place and i hadn’t found anything else on his phone in such a long time. once i reached like 24 weeks he randomly decided it felt weird to have sex. "it's weird knowing our baby is right there" so we had sex maybe 4 times total from 24 weeks - after 6 week check up. i started to suspect he was doing something on his phone again but couldn't find anything so i requested to see his TikTok data. there i found several videos of half naked girls he was watching and not just watching things that popped up on his FYP, he was searching specific girls and trends of girls. i was obviously beyond hurt by this as it started right around the time he decided it was "weird" to have sex with me and had spent the past year and a half really convincing me he had stopped looking at those things. he apologized and said it was a bad habit he picked up while he was laid off from work and had nothing to do with me being pregnant but then brought up how i "never initiate sex". i told him i was an awkward virgin 17 year old when we first got together and right off the bat was hit with seeing how he wished he could fuck another girl so where the hell was i supposed to get the confidence to want to initiate sex, ESPECIALLY now after giving birth and seeing that he still 3 years later can't stop fantasizing about other girls i will never look like. he doesn't seem to understand where i'm coming from so i'd like to know if i make sense or if im just an asshole.	1643049681.0	sbt4sa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbt4sa/aita_for_never_really_initiating_sex/	AITA for never really initiating sex?
icby7c20	I had ordered an album from a small business in November of last year and was told that I’d receive the order by Christmas but I didn’t. I contacted the provider asking them for an update and they said they’ll deliver it to me by 20th January which was fine and I understood.   Then, I contacted them and they went MIA for a few days and then said that the order was already shipped and I would receive it if there weren’t any restrictions in my area (there aren’t). I said okay. But I haven’t received the order even today and continuously pestering the provider makes me feel somehow very guilty.   So, WIBTA if I asked them for a tracking update?

4o5f0d2z	AITA? My (27F) fiancé's (34M) sister (36F) is getting married soon. I received a group text last month about a group wedding dress shopping (dates/location etc). I agreed to attend, however, I never heard back again (the group chat was quet).   Long story short, I saw an online story of my future SIL and the girls from the chat being at the bridal boutique (her future MIL, SIL and friends where all there except me). The next day, I received a group text from her friend about a future bachelorette. The text mentioned among others: "SIL name here" would love the idea of a small bachelorette similar to her dress fitting and of course include '"my name here"". What does that mean???? My initial thought was sending a message to the group chat acting surprised that they went for the dress without letting me know so i can expose her for her behaviour   I want to clarify that I understand that a bride has the right to invite whoever she wants to her wedding-related activities and I would be totally cool If i was not included at all from the start, however, this hit different mainly because I was initially included and felt that they ended up arranging the whole thing behind my back . I do not know what to think or how to proceed. I have made many efforts all these years to develop a close relationship with my future SIL, and always had the best intentions, however, it looks to me that this is not mutual.

df57f9jx	My friend of 35 years and I were planning on going snowboarding on Friday.  He informed me this morning that his GF “isn’t too comfy with him taking a day trip with me” and suggested brunch instead.   I asked him whether he invited her and he said yes, but she couldn’t take the day off.   Is it wrong of me to tell him to go work out the ground rules first before we plan to do anything together?  I want things to work out for him but I’m also seriously annoyed at the same time.   Thanks for any perspective and advice.

iosaoly8	I was with my ex for 2 years but for context she’s always been ditsy. All of my friends and even I knew it. My mom was never fond of her but I looked past it. I really did love her, but recently she had been going crazy after she got kicked out of the house. She had been getting extremely wasted before going out, (as an 18 year old), and even doing some drugs. I had enough of it and I ended things. The next day I started a new relationship with a supervisor from work and it’s so refreshing. She’s smart, beautiful, and totally my type. It feels nice to have someone actually on my level. My ex has been sending me some crazy messages with how much she hates me because of it, how I never loved her, and how I turned my back on her. I don’t understand. I treated her so well when everyone else made fun of her for being dumb. I feel like I might be the AH since there’s only a one day gap between our relationships, but I’m also allowed to love who I want.

izceglqc	On mobile so sorry for the grammar.  This weekend my(24m) girlfriend(23f) and I agreed to go out on a date, we’re both budgeting so we agreed it will be 50/50. The day before our date I’m talking to my girlfriend as she leaves work and ask her where she’s headed, she told me she was headed home. Later during the call she tells me to tells me to hold up because someone is calling her but she accidentally doesn’t answer the call. The convo goes as follows.   Her: Heyyy Me: Hey *confused* Her: are you there already? Me: No im 20 away what about you? Her: I’m 30 away, I’ll be there soon. Me: what are you talking about?  She then realizes she never answered the phone and proceeded to tell me she was actually going out, but she told me she was going home because she had to stop at home before she went. I proceed to ask her who she’s going with and she lists random names of coworkers besides one (I’ve told her I don’t want her seeing this one coworker who I feel doesn’t have the best intentions due to previous encounters) and then I ask her if he’s going and she tells me that he is but she forgot to mention it. I was mad that she lied to me about going home but I was busy so we proceeded with our day. She tells me she’s going home at 5 so I call her at about 5:20 to check in and she calls me and tells me she’s about to leave and how she spent over $200. I’m confused but she hung up so I called her a hour later. She is still out I ask her if she’s going to stay out or going home but she tells me she’s leaving in 20 minutes. She ends up calling me back at 10pm telling me she’s on her way home and how she spent so much money because she went out to another place afterwards. So I proceed to tel her that she has to pay for the entire date the next date and she gets mad and tells me no. At this point I’m pissed because I’ve been going broke trying to maintain a relationship  taking her on dates and trips when I didn’t have a job and she doesn’t appreciate it regardless that she makes more money than I do. And I continue to yell about how she continuously lied to me through the entire night and went out with the guy I asked her not to see and she hung up on me and blocked my number. I called her about 85 times (which I admit is a little overboard) but I really needed to talk about what happened and she didn’t feel like it to so she blocked me. The next morning she tells me I’m being controlling and that she’s not my prisoner and that she needs a break from me because I’m acting crazy.   She continuously lied to me through the week leading to this (we had a double date this weekend but she cancelled because the other party supposedly went to Miami but I found out they didn’t)   I felt like I was owed an explanation but all she had to say is that it she technically didn’t lie because she was on her way home when I asked and she intended to leave when but then decided to stay.  Am I a crazy asshole for yelling and blowing up her phone?	1643050870.0	sbtl7r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtl7r/aita_for_spamming_my_girlfriends_phone/	AITA for spamming my girlfriends phone?
4bej44xg	I replied to a comment on a *South Park* video about the "Canadian alphabet" in which the original commenter said something about how Canadians pronounce the last letter as "zed" instead of the American "zee". He/she then stated that you could say "zed" at the end, but "zee" rhymes with "me" and "zed" doesn't. Then, a completely different user said that "zee" is supposed to rhyme with "me", so I replied to that person with, "Yes, we have already established that. You are redundant. We don't need you. Go talk a long walk off a short pier."  The user responded with "You need to chill the fuck out, dude," then, "Are you this trashy in real life because if you are then I can only imagine how many times you've been beaten up in public." I responded with, "Having a bad day?" and then (s)he said, "No, you're just being a twat for absolutely no reason," and then I'm like, "Whoa! Two replies! You must be really mad." He/she said, "You brought all of this on yourself, so don't act sarcastic towards me," and then I replied, "I'M being a twat? Ok, man, if you say so." Then, the user said, "YES, you ARE being a twat. How in the ultimate fuck can you not see that?" At this point, I'm getting concerned for this person, so I ask,"'Ultimate fuck'? You have some strange turns of phrase, and you are very angry. Have you calmed down yet? What's going on?"  About 24 hours later, this person doesn't say anything back, so I chose to get on his case even more by saying, "So that's it? A bunch of abuse then you just run away? Too big of a man to apologize? Sad." Then, (s)he replied with, " Are you seriously so desperate for attention that you feel the need to keep egging on someone over something that you yourself created? Have you ever heard the saying "if you have nothing nice to say, then don't say anything at all"? No, of course not, because if you did, you wouldn't have been an asshole in the first place. And you're implying that I should be the one apologizing? Do you really have nothing better to do on the internet than pick fights with people over nothing? THAT is what's sad." He/she followed that up with, " So that's it? A bunch of abuse and then you just run away? Too big of a wuss to admit that you were wrong and apologize? Pathetic." Then, "Still nothing?" and lastly " Hypocrite 😎👍."  So, AITA in this situation, and should I apologize to this person?	1643050768.0	sbtjnr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtjnr/aita_for_telling_another_youtube_user_to_take_a/	AITA for telling another YouTube user to "take a long walk off a short pier"?

We both put in our vacation request early enough to get it cleared, mine was put in about a month early which is reasonable with my company. My supervisor was acting very unsure about me getting that time off and had stated that the third was her birthday. Until then I didn't know when her birthday was. Then this morning she accused me of taking off those days to intentionally hurt her and I again reminded her that when I filled out the request that I didn't know that was her birthday.

is81thnr	I (female, 19) am an aspiring singer-songwriter who comes from a broken home. My dad is an adamant alcoholic, so I had been living with my mom until I moved out last year. When I was little, I was very interested in makeup, hair, and skincare, and my parents knew all about my former obsessions. A few years back, my father brought to my attention a prestigious 13 week (500 hour) beauty school course. He informed me that I should make sure this is what I want to do for a career if I wanted to attend because it would be very expensive for him. My mom would not fund it because she wanted me to become a stay-at-home mom rather than a girl boss. If we're being honest, I didn't want to be a professional makeup artist... I just love doing makeup on myself. But this seemed like a really fun opportunity for me so I assured him that I was going to become a beauty guru. Long story short, I had a great time doing 500 hours at beauty school, but I still knew inside that it was just a hobby and my real passion is music.   Fast forward a year to after I graduated high school. As I didn't live with my dad and never told him I didn't actually want to be a makeup artist, he assumed I would be going to college for it. My actual plans were to move to the big city with my (now ex) boyfriend Austen to try to get noticed by a record label. On a phone call, I lied to my dad saying that I needed help paying for college tuition when it was really just for rent. He said he'd be happy to help me pursue my dream and that made me feel bad so I only told him to send $200 a month rather than $250 (my ex-boyfriend would pay the rest, he was rich). Unfortunately, a few months ago my dad drove 12 hours to surprise me at college (I said I was at Columbia University which is half-true because I was accepted but didn't actually go), but he was told that no such individual as me lived on the campus. My dad called me and I had to tell him the truth. He screamed at me saying that he wasn't even done paying for half of beauty school yet and could barely afford his own rent (as he's retired). I really wanted to make things right, but I'm not doing great myself. I'm signed to a small indie record label, but my pay isn't enough to help any more than who I want it to help. I feel horrible for lying to him for so long, but I also feel like that's what he gets for breaking apart my family with alcohol in the first place. If anyone has any input on my situation, I'd appreciate it.	1643051354.0	sbtrwv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtrwv/aita_for_putting_my_father_in_debt/	AITA for putting my father in debt?
xk4b7	Recently had to miss a week of work due to a medical emergency. As I return, I have had to discuss my health issue with several of my coworkers, and it seems that all of them have been made aware in detail.   I have an inclination to be closed off, even antisocial, and I feel it’s a character trait I could stand to develop away from… but I’m having trouble figuring out if this is appropriate.   Am I being treated like family, or are my fundamental boundaries being trampled?

izecqnl5	So, this guy (21M) started out as my (23F) friend almost two and a half years ago. We hit it off really well and immediately got closer, eventually hanging out every day and sharing everything with one another. We were inseparable, always playing games, sending each other memes, having fun. He said he had a crush on me like 10 months ago and we dated from July 2021-Jan 2022.  I have a lot of trouble talking about my deeper/darker emotions/situations. I actually didn’t even know I was capable of feeling this upset till what he put me through.  So he broke up with me three weeks ago because he thought we argued too much, which used to never happen. He took a weeklong break then said he wants to go back to being friends. We hung out as friends a couple times and all was well, till there was this random ghosting that lasted three days.  I mentioned to him it seems like there’s distance between us and he got very angry, saying “why do you feel like telling me this?” He said “there’s no point in bringing that up” and saying it “emotionally drains him” I reassured him many times it isn’t meant to be a fight or drama and I wasn’t angry or upset when I said that; I just wanted to make sure everything was cool between us.  He refused to answer the question and kept going on and on about how “every time” we talk, I bring up the conflict. I said that isn’t true and named four times during the last week or so we had a good, fun time and didn’t talk about that and also told him I’m not bringing up what broke us up, I’m talking about the last three days from a friend-perspective and wanna know if he’s doing alright. He kept repeating himself and not listening to me which made me feel minimized and antagonized.  I told him communication is a vital part of all relationships, even friendships, and if you wanna go back to being close friends we need to communicate. This is not the first time he’s done this, as after our breakup we had another fight like this where he got angry and defensive whenever I tried to talk about my feelings, pinning the blame on me saying im being too negative and draining him when I was in a very vulnerable place since he’d just broken up with me.  This time around, he said “we’re never talking again, and I MEAN it” then deleted me as a friend on everything and left all of our mutual communities so I never contact him again. All because I said “hey things seem a little distant.” I don’t understand.  I felt like walking on eggshells every time I mentioned anything about my feelings because this same thing would happen - he'd say I'm draining his emotions, focusing too much on the negative, emotionally neglecting him, etc., instead of discussing anything. AITA for doing these things?

egjm8s9z	first time posting here! I’m F18. I do apologize for any grammer errors, on mobile  So a little background:  In 2016, my mom and I had a really bad fight and she beat me up, and I was covered in bruises everywhere. I ran out and got help, and then she went to jail. Since then she was not in my life.    My mom had started contacting me when I turned 18 in 2021, asking me to come see her. I ignored her calls, but eventually started talking to her, cause I was worried for her.   Now here’s why I’m asking:  So she asked me again last week to come visit her. I said no, then her friend, Nancy (not real name), called me, and begged me to go visit my mom, saying, “Your mom is alone and needs help with moving”, so I agreed and flew out the same week. This past Saturday.   I reached around 9:30pm. She picked me up and we head home.  Next morning (Sunday morning, so yesterday!) and I wake up around 9:30. After waking up, we start fighting. It’s pretty warm where she lives.  I’m wearing shorts and a top. She yells at me to go change. I asked why, she said “I don’t want to see your thighs, they’re fat”  I told her I was gonna go in the room but she said no. She follows me. I turn around and she shoved me, then I shove back, and then she calls me the N-word.   No one in our family is black, we’re all Asian.   She starts saying how I learned that from my black friends and that I’m a new york N-Word.  She starts hitting me and I hit her back and she backs off. She screamed that I’m a monster who has psychological issues.   She brings up what happened in 2016, and she said she doesn’t regret what she did to me, A CHILD at the time.  She bragged about having a clear conscious about the incident and said she didn’t do anything wrong because she has a clear conscious. I pointed it out how that’s really messed up for her to say that.   She said that I have a victim complex. I said “are you sure you’re not projecting your insecurities on me?”   And she left the room and started crying. She comes back with Nancy on the speaker, who says “Beta (it means child in an endearing way) we are just trying to help you, you have a lot of issues”   I told them “You can’t help a person who doesn’t want help. I came here to help her. I’m doing wonderful.”   I get my ticket to go home the same day and left. It wasn’t even a full day and I already left.   On my way to the airport, my mom texts me saying how I’m an untrained pet who needs training because my dad refuses to train me, and in that same paragraph she said that I’m a monster who has psychological problems and needs intervention.   All of this happened less than a day, and this weekend! Still mostly processing stuff, and still very shaken up from this but I’m typing this with a clear mind.

do42emzv	 This happened last night, and my family completely lost their minds at me about it. So here I am.  I take the bus to and from work (car got totalled about a month ago, still waiting on insurance to reimburse me so I can get a new one), and right now on public transit you have to social distance. This means limited seating.  At my job, I’m literally on my feet all day, and I work 10 hour shifts. It sucks but the pay is good, so I can deal, but after a long day, my feet are sore AF. I genuinely cherish the time I spend sitting on the bus ride home, knowing I have to walk another 15-20 minutes to my house from the bus stop. Which means more time on my feet.  So last night I’m on the bus, and a very heavily pregnant lady gets on. She looks around for a seat, only to find there are no available ones left. I’m the closest to her, so she starts giving me the imploring eyes. I had my headphones on and tried to pretend I couldn’t see her, but once she started talking to me it became inevitable.  I wasn’t rude or anything, I just told her no, I’ve had a long day and my feet are sore. I don’t want to give up my seat. She started crying about how she’s a pregnant single mom, and I told her I’m sorry, but that was her personal choice and she can’t expect other people to accommodate her life choices. We live in a state where birth control and abortions are free, so I don’t know why this should be my problem. It’s not my fault she decided to have a baby when she can’t afford a car.  After going back and forth for a bit, an old man finally shouted that I’m a “worthless punk” and offered his seat to the lady. He started ranting and raving about the “damn millennials” and I just looked the other way and pretended I didn’t hear it. As they were trading seats, the bus driver had to slam the brakes for whatever reason, and the pregnant lady and the old man both fell. They started yelling at me, calling me all sorts of nasty names, but I just looked the other way and ignored it.  When I got home and told my sister, she flipped the fuck out and went crying to our parents, who also chewed my ass out.

b0j9g59p	I have been in a happy and stable relationship for well over 10 years now. And like every other couple, we've had our ups and downs but I wouldn't trade my relationship for anything. I truly believe that I will spend the rest of my life with my partner. We love each other, and that's enough for me.   One of the only divisions that we have is marriage. She comes from a very traditional/conservative well-off family and, although her family likes me, they(herself included) are becoming increase desperate to see us engaged and to make our relationship "official" from a religious standpoint. I am not religious, but I do obviously respect that she is and this has never been a problem between us, util...  We both want kids, but she "refuses" to have them before marriage for religious reasons, but mostly because she would feel somewhat ashamed (According to her own words, she told me this) of walking down the isle pregnant or while already having a child.  I can somewhat understand the legal reasons behind marriage when a child is present. Both to protect the parent's and the child's rights. But I sincerely just don't get the institution of marriage outside of that, and I quite honestly fail to see the point of it. Don't get me wrong, like I said, I love her dearly, but I don't need a paper to confirm that, or any government, or religion. And although I've already said that I imagine myself spending the rest of my life with her, I have to be realistic and accept that I've already seen enough divorces in my life to know how nasty things can get really quickly, which is why I'm reluctant to sign a contract that doesn't add anything tangible to both of our lives.   Am I the asshole?	1643052915.0	sbudpj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbudpj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_married_before_having/	AITA for not wanting to get married before having kids?
iwvn37pz	My friend's (M20) ex-girlfriend (F18) was over and wanted to fool around but I (M20) wanted to make sure it was cool with my friend first so I gave him a call and he said they were seeing each other  I looked to her and she asserted that they werent even on speaking terms.   Then I start getting texts from him "Do they want to?" "Yeah" "then do whatever bro idc" "are you sure? I dont wanna hurt you" "Damage already done. Dont contact me again if you do anything *buddy*. They're clearly trying to hurt me are you fucking dumb?"  I assured him multiple times at this point that I was willing to sit on this and that I wouldnt want to if that was her intention but he stops responding.   He starts texting her, she fills me in because im suspicious. Lots of bargaining all of which met with varients of "no", didnt seem like she was trying to get him back and it didnt seem like they were "seeing each other". Couldnt see why they *would be*, in good conscious. As far as I knew he was in a happy new relationship at the time.  She begins to advocate for me saying "He hasnt done anything because he wanted to respect your feelings, your going to ruin your relationship if you keep acting like this" he says something along the lines of "idc, that *relationship* was on its way out anyway. Tell *OP* to expect a *message* from me later" and that was it  I understandably wasnt in the mood, anymore. My wiener was droopy and so was I. But she *was*, somehow? Started to feel their equivilent to blue ball pain, too. I can empathize. *Lent her a hand* 🙄  No holds barred on other forms of affection either. Liked the idea of trying it slow and casual with her. I found her attractive and enjoyed spending time with her. We were friends, before. So no, my penis didnt get any action if you think thats the leg I was walking on   Later my *male* friend and I were able to clear the air once his head, cooled. There was a whole series of misunderstandings, none really contribute to the moral scale, as they were all things I couldnt have known at the time. I apologized for hurting him, because Id never want that, but I didnt apologize for anything else.   Where I was standing from, I didnt see any reason not to? I was willing to take "no" for an answer from a friend. But he didnt seem like any friend of mine, anymore. From what I took to be a slew of lies, dishonesty, ultimatums, name calling, disconcern for me and threats. I can understand why hed be upset, but I think that could have been conveyed through a simple "please dont, it would hurt me" and I would like to beleive id respect it. I was ready for that before I called him. I dont think I was wrong to expect that since I had made it abundantly clear that we hadnt done anything and I didnt want to unless I knew it was cool with him.   But at the end of the day I intended to respect his feelings, but I didnt because I didnt find them *respectable*. But is *that* respectable?

7qwaq6u8	Im going to explain this long story shortly  I ( 19F) am sitting at karaoke night minding my own, three of my friends are in their car and my other friend is singing.   A guy comes up to me and sits across from me, he’s friends with my friend who’s singing. He’s trying to get to know me, I’m not interested at all. He starts to do the typical “I’m gonna start insulting you to make you vulnerable and make a move” thing.   For example: - “What is your hairline? Looks like Moses split it so Jesus could walk on it”  - “Is that a Naruto wallet? Oh my God you’re a weeb? EVERYBODY! This girls a weeaboo!”  - “Brown hair, blue eyes.. are you trying to look like Megan Fox? Not gonna work”   There was a lot more. Anyway, after deny after deny I was fed up and told him that he doesn’t have a chance because he’s a complete AH and frankly not attractive inside or out. He then asked me if he could sing me a song to get me to forgive him, which of course said absolutely not.   My buddy was finally done with his song, and my friends were coming back from the car, and while they were coming back to the table that’s when they saw me getting visibly angry about the disrespect this guy was giving me. I told him that I will never give a drug dealing, xan taking, disrespectful, and ugly person a chance ever. They were all confused and told me to take some breaths.   He then said, “Guys, I don’t even know why this chick is acting crazy, she was trying to get with me and I denied her and she took it super personally”   At this point I started yelling at him telling him to look in the mirror and look at me, the fact that he even thought I would give an ugly and rude boy a chance was laughable. I know I sound conceited, but I was very angry and felt horribly disrespected.  He kept saying “Oh, you think you are hurting my feelings? Too bad, fat girls don’t make me sad”. This is when my friends were catching on that I wasn’t crazy because I’m a petit girl with an athletic body.   I went to the bathroom to let my anger out by myself and when I came back he was kicked out because he had physically assaulted somebody and gave them a black eye. Apparently after I left he said “I’m so tired of crazy b*tches” and a witness said “You are the crazy one”.   So yea, I told my dad thinking he’d be proud of me for standing up for myself but he told me that I’m stupid and should have told the bartender. Also that due to my outburst I caused harm to to another person.

icq7fexh	I met my boyfriend about 3 years ago through my friend Karen who I will refer to as K and his brother Cameron who I will refer to as C (they are bf & gf). We ended up falling for each other and stayed together for half the year before he got deployed. We had a lot of problems with his ex before he left. She kept a picture of them as her cover photo on Facebook for over a year. We confronted her and she said because it was a good picture of her and refused to take it down or crop him out. We broke up for about two months during his deployment. While, we were broke up K became best friends with his ex. When my bf came back, every Sunday he would go to his brothers house and K would invite his ex over. K and the ex would get on FB and talk shit about me as well. Eventually, K and the ex had a falling out and quit being friends and started inviting me over. Time goes on and C paints my moms bathroom. He used old paint from a previous job to "help" me out on costs. He sent me an invoice for $600 for painting my moms bathroom. The paint started peeling off the walls as well. At first, my bf was upset and said C was charging me to much. His Dad told him that blood is thicker than water and I need to pay for the work that had been done. My bf then sided with his brother and dad. The same week he charged me this he sent an invoice to my boss for $800 for painting an ENTIRE HOME. Yet, I was in the wrong. C would continue to make rude comments to me. We recently went to a funeral for my bf's family member. We had plans to meet his brother at 11:45 to get to the funeral on time. I woke up super early to go to Walmart, fill the car up, and get ready. Our eta on maps was 11:47. At 11:20 C calls my bf asking when we were going to get there. He called their parents as well and they fussed at him. At this point, we were 10 min away and I got a text from K thanking me for ruining their entire day by being late. C called again and asked where we were. He told them we were 3 min away and he asked where C was. C said he was at the gas station. We kept driving and let them drive separate. We ended up arriving 20 minutes early (NOT CLOSE TO LATE). On Friday, I asked C for advice on what brand skill saw to get as a present for my bf. So I went to lowes and bought one. Fast forward to Monday on my bf's actual birthday. He opened his presents from me and proceeds to tell me that C had given him multiple skill saws. I told him I no longer wish to continue going over to C and K's home or communicate with them because this was the last straw for me. This kind of stuff has been going on for over a year at this point. Yet, every single time I am blamed as the bad person who is making brothers fight. Am I the asshole?	1643053084.0	sbug7u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbug7u/aita_for_not_wanting_to_talk_to_my_bfs_brother_gf/	AITA FOR NOT WANTING TO TALK TO MY BF'S BROTHER & GF
i3d145ll	Idk how i even feel about this. I finish work at 1;30 PM and i always call my boyfriend on the drive home- it’s 30 minutes and i get lonely. Today i had a really bad day at work and i called my boyfriend because i wanted to vent about it. He listened to me but seemed really uninterested and dismissive and when i stopped after only like five minutes to ask what was wrong, he told me that he was in class and really needed to go. I let him go obviously but i’m a little upset bc i had a bad day and i just wanted him to support me. It’s literally the first class of the semester, they’re probably just doing intro stuff anyway. Couldn’t he have let me just get my frustrations out before hanging up on me? So i called my friend and complained about it to him and he said that my boyfriend was being an ass and that it looked like he wasn’t prioritizing me. Am i being a buttface or should i be upset?	1643054399.0	sbuz07	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbuz07/aita_for_expecting_my_boyfriend_to_spend_time/	AITA for expecting my boyfriend to spend time with me?
92fenlxd	A few days before I'd finally had enough and decided to leave, my dad got a call from his sister asking him to drive her to her brother in law's house (pretentiously ignoring the fact that her 3 kids are home and can definitely spare some time), despite knowing that my dad had recently gone through a cataract surgery. Not wanting to leave them hanging, I offered to drive them myself since my dad couldn't. They filled my head with bs about how I shouldn't have dressed so fancily since I was going to the countryside and that they don't have any pimps there compared to the village I come from (my uncle said, since wearing shorts, a t-shirt too many sizes large and heels is such indecent behavior).  Later that day, my mom and aunt were picking flowers, and I was left in the kitchen with my dad, uncle and his brother. The TV was showing some Covid-related footage which ended up with my uncle being, as always, a know-it-all. I don't remember everything in my furious haze, but he mentioned something about some brain dead child hearing everything people around him said (it was about some devastating news) and waking up asking about that same thing eventually. I explained how that wasn't possible and was surprised with a response along the lines of "How did you get into medical school when you're so stupid? Did you show forbidden skin to pass? If you got a scholarship by selling your body, my daughter could've owned the world." I remember saying something I'm not proud of, something not necessarily wrong but definitely controversial, in the sense that it has been the root of discord within my cousin's head.  To elaborate their inconsideration, I'm going to recount a story from before I moved to Korea. I have done figure skating since I was a kid, and when I was ~12 my coach passed. We were in the middle of a tournament, but we changed my routine to commemorate my coach's memory. I fell during my performance and got silver, causing me to cry thinking I dissapointed my late coach and these people's response was just condescending laughter and Eastern European tough love along with a "Aww, she cries?!". Associated with this particular story is another piece of a big trauma puzzle. I got traumatic spondylosisthiesis at 13, which eventually developed into sciatica and that's when I stopped doing figure skating. When we were over at their place one day, they started emptying the pantry and were taking huge pickled jars from the cellar to the kitchen. I was just standing there, radiating with pain, and my aunt said "Why are you so lazy? Your cousin is half your size and yet she's helping and you're doing nothing to help.", to which the cousin did nothing but laugh and pass me a jar.   The times they've insulted me (be it directly or indirectly) are endless but these are just a few of the more ridiculous ones.

8qoe54hf	So, I don't exactly know how to start this, so I'm just gonna jump right into it.  Me (15m) and my uncle (58m) just got in a fight because I "gave attitude and yelled at him" for making jokes. He always makes jokes about disgusting things like touching my feet, pissing/shitting on my bed and a lot of disgusting stuff like that. Today I just got tired of it, so I got mad at him and, I admit I did yell a bit, but I was so angry because I ask him every single time he makes those jokes to stop but he doesn't. So I yelled at him and called him disgusting, now my mom is getting mad at me for getting mad because he was "just joking with me"  So, AITA?

drsroir9	This happened in 2018, but a friend recently mentioned this to me so now I'm wondering again if iatah  We were at university at the time (me f27 bf m28) and our landlord sold the house midterm, we had to quickly find a new place to move into. A friend of ours was in a similar situation and told us that he had a new place ready to move into and needed an extra two people-we moved in with him and his friend. We were so happy to have a place to move into, we volunteered to take the small room as a couple while the two larger rooms went to him and his friend, I was already paying for an internet contract that I moved to the house and continued to pay myself, I didn't ask for payment from anyone else as I still felt very thankful for the offer, I accept that no payment from anyone was my decision.  Our housemate would have lots of loud, out of control parties on the weekends, we were fine with this at first, as it was his place too but we specifically asked that on weekend prior to deadlines, there be no parties so we could concentrate on work. Towards the end of the year and our final deadline, we were working when suddenly 20+people entered the house, trashed the place and didn't leave until 6pm. I went into the kitchen at 6am to start cleaning up and there were a group of sketchy looking men (who I later learnt were "homeless men he'd invited off the street" holding my underwear (I was not made aware anyone would be coming around so they were hanging up to dry) and my roommate had left the building to who knows where leaving these people in our home. I don't wanna sound like a kill joy, but I felt very disrespected and honestly unsafe.  Our friend already had a job in his field and bragged about how he didn't need to do any work because he was already done with university, he never cleaned-I once left his dishes for 2 weeks to see if he'd clean them and didn't-to this day he still owes us money for bills we paid, we discussed the issues with him and he didn't care, said we should be grateful for a place to live. We moved out at the end of the year and I took my wifi router with me-he knew the date we were leaving and I assumed he knew that I would be taking all of my possessions with me. At this point he rarely came home and was living most of the time with a partner, so when I took the router, I didn't really think about thing of it, his friend had left and he was barely there and the University year was over. As soon as I left I received tons of nasty messages from him and his friends because I had taken the wifi router and left him with no wifi. (The tenancy was up in 2 weeks from when we left) I then had mutual friends tell me I was terrible to treat him that way as he "only had eyes for me" and was "waiting for me to break up with my boyfriend."

eqajblxi	 I'm new to living with partners and as I am disabled and can't work right now i am home the most often. I was also hospitalized recently for mental health issues and before my hospitalization I hadn't been doing well, more so in the weeks before but also over the past couple of years, and that is the state my partner knows me in (depressed unable to do many chores constantly tired ect.) During that time we moved in together and I never had the energy or motivation to build a routine, I am autistic so that basically means I got nothing done ever. Also during that time they were asking me to pitch in more and clean more because they work and I tried but wasn't very successful.  Now that I am out and on medication that works I am finally able to get a routine and settle in to our place that we have lived in for a year. Here's the issue, my partner has laid claim over dishes as a chore but rarely does them but I didn't want to fuck with their system of just putting stuff in the sink and doing it when they can, but now that I'm able to do household tasks i have taken over most of them  as when I'm not depressed I am a clean freak and like things a certain way that way usually being what is easiest for me to maintain while things being as clean as possible and as I'm home 24/7 I do all of the cleaning stuff throughout the day. Today is her first day off since I got back she started moving all the dishes that I was going to do today in the sink breaking my system and making it a sensory nightmare for me to fix as well as messing up my routine for the day. I asked if she was going to do dishes today and she said no I'm just tiding. I then explained to her the routine I have and that I am more than happy to do the dishes and keep the kitchen clean as well as cook and just asked that dishes don't get put in the sink but in the dishwasher and put next to the sink if they need to be handwashed so that I can do them one by one without filling the sink with wet food. She got weird and quiet after our discussion and now is angrily doing the dishes after telling me to get out of the kitchen. I have no idea what I did wrong when we talked I was on the verge of a melt down so I was probably harsher than necessary but I thought taking over the chores would make her happy as it removed tasks she needed to do on her days off but she has been mad at me for most of the day.

h4buv7wb	My wife (Asian) married a French guy when she was 26 and he was 23. They divorced after 3 years. The guy converted to her religion , got circumscribed and met her dad to ask her for her hand in marriage. They had a grand wedding and got lots of gifts from her dad. They however could not have kids. I met her a few years after the divorce when she was living on her own in the big city with a hard partying lifestyle. I was 24 and she was 31. We were into a casual relationship and she was pretty careless about contraception (ripping off my condom saying it doesnt feel good)    She thought she couldnt have children so why use condoms. Well guess what she got pregnant and we got married. We eloped at city hall. i did not change my religion and did not even meet her family. I moved to the US soon after for my Masters. It wasnt any fun trying to do a challenging masters with a baby at home.  Well whenever we had a fight she would always say my ex was so rich. He had nice cars. He changed religion. He learnt my language etc etc so I just started calling her Mrs XYZ where XYZ was her ex's surname.  Even today when she is being difficult I call her Mrs XYZ.

Students are inattentive or sick all the time and my colleagues are out and I'm often covering for them and doing extra work.

8pvnsh83	So I’m usually very good about making sure I have plenty of gas but I was distracted yesterday and when leaving work (where no one else was) I realized I had zero miles of driving range. I called my fiancé and asked if he thought I should try to drive to the gas station one mile away or if I should stay put.   My fiancé told me to try to make it to the gas station. I said “what if I don’t make it?“ and he said he would come help me if I didn’t make it.   Well clearly he thought I’d have no problem getting to the gas station but to my horror the car ran out of gas going up the hill right after pulling out of work. There is no shoulder on this road so there was nowhere to get out of the middle of the road.   I called my fiancé (I was mortified) and asked if he could come and help me/bring me some gas. We live 22 minutes away. Even though he had just told me he’d come help if I ran out of gas he said “you’re going to have to call triple A- I just started a fire (in our fireplace) and I can’t leave.   I was floored- I said “what? Really??”  Yup.   So I hung up and called my best friend who lives about 25 mins away. She immediately dropped everything and came with a gallon of gas to get me to the gas station. While I was talking to her my fiancé kept calling over and over again - I asked him to stop over text and explained that I was getting help.  Meanwhile I was slowly dying of embarrassment as cars passed me blocking the whole road.  I took my friend out to dinner to thank her for rescuing me- meanwhile my fiancé was furious that I ignored his phone calls  while I was trying to deal with my very immediate situation of blocking the road- and he can’t understand why I was so upset he didn’t come to help me. He keeps talking about the fire he had going as the clear reason he could not help - but if it was me I would have just put the fire out with a bowl of water and put our fireplace guard in front of it just in case some embers were still burning.   I would have dropped everything to come help him - and I knew my best friend would drop everything to help me- as I would do for her.   My feelings are so hurt- it just makes me wonder if marrying this guy is the right decision when I feel like my best friend is more of my ride or die then he is.   When I told him that he just got angry at me and told me what a bi$ch I am and told me to stop trying to make my bad decisions his fault.

izfxvmn6	I (F26) live with my husband (M33) who is our main source of income. He has a $91,000 salary which is decent to support the two of us, but his mother (F74) has bad health issues, and he often had to help pay for her various expenses. She didn't have health insurance, so my husband had to pay her hospital bills several times in the past couple years. She now lives in a retirement home which isn't too expensive, but all those hospital bills had put us in a bad place financially.  Working 10+ hours a day six days a week took a toll on my husband's mental health, and he started getting really angry with me all the time. I promised him I'd try to find a job that would pay enough so that we could pay off our debt and cut back his work hours. Now, I haven't ever had a *real* full-time job (I've lived with my husband for the past nine years and lived mostly off of his money), but I figured it was about time since I had obtained two degrees by 2020 and had just been living my life for the past year.   Back in November, I traveled 30 minutes away to interview for a job after going through a preliminary virtual interview. When I got there, the interviewer first commented about my baby and asked when I was due... except, I'm not pregnant. I am plus-sized and have been rudely asked "are you pregnant" multiple times, but this was the first time someone actually assumed so. I don't know why I did it, but I went along with it and said I was due in February, because I knew the whole interview would be really awkward if I acted offended. And then, almost the entire interview ended up being about how I'd be able to do the job while pregnant and how long I'd have maternity leave, etc. After a few minutes, I just couldn't handle making the lie last any longer in fear that it would affect my career if I got the job and were found out, so I just paused and told him I wasn't actually pregnant. I tried to explain to the interviewer how I felt offended but didn't want tension for the whole interview, but he just made me leave and I never heard back. My husband was extremely mad at me when I got home because I apparently "wasted the best opportunity of my life just because I'm insecure."

9e44kvbs	I (21F) live at my aunt's house along with my sister (23F). Every now and then my aunt's sister Brenda (48F) likes to visit my aunt. Last month she came home and made plans with my aunt to go to Costco. Now usually I would go with them if there was something important to buy like groceries but they were just going there to look at stuff for Brenda. I said I wouldn't join them as I wasn't really up for going out for no use and also that I had to study for my exams.  But Brenda took this personally and started ranting at me about how I don't want to spend time with her (she's not even my family and why would I spend time with her at Costco?), and how I'm too quiet and anti-social. She's called me anti-social several times before because I always have my headphones on. I wear the headphones because she is so loud, rude, and annoying and makes every single thing about her and I don't like to listen to what she says. She's basically a Karen. Now I've never taken this lightly and always get offended by what she says. I'm an introvert, I like to keep to myself and this is how I am, we can't all be loud and raging monsters but I never say all that out loud.  Later my aunt called me from Costco to ask if I wanted a slice of pizza. I was just about to say no when I heard Brenda say to my sister(who went with them) that 'if I wanted pizza I would have joined them'. I asked my sister to confirm if she said something like this and she said yes. I got pissed at the petty behavior and my sister said that this was nothing new as she had overheard Brenda talking sh\*t behind our back complaining about how rude and bitchy my sister was and how the both of us needs to fix our attitudes and that we don't need to be so uptight to my aunt.   Cut to about 2-3 weeks ago, Brenda had intense pain in her abdominal area, she did a couple of tests, and it was confirmed that she had cancer and had also spent a couple of nights in hospital.   A few days ago my sister went to visit her and told me that she'd become quiet and weak. I said I don't really care cause she's a bitch and deserves cancer and got what was coming to her and that I would also not care if she dies. I know cancer is devastating I lost a friend from cancer 4 years ago but for her to bully someone who's not even half her age, it is karma.

7z8j1laq	Backstory: All I wanted to do was watch American Horror Stories with my gf.   So gf's sister had drama going on. Enough drama that a fight was going to start. A small war if you will. Now the altercation is about wanting stuff back, a shirt spotted in a post on social media but that's not what they wanted. This group of girls wanted nothing but to throw hands. They pulled up, 5 bitches hop out screaming their heads off but this wasnt happy girl screams, no these were screams of war cries. "Come on bitch" or "let me run my one"  (what the fuck does that mean) There was ALOT of estrogen in the air. They called out their fights, told the rules like 1 minute fight, had a mediator. Ok run your fade. Two fights lasted around 3 minutes. Fights are over. I can watch my show. NO! They wanna keep talking shit saying they were not going to leave and break windows and they wanted to fight more. I had to do the whitest thing ever. I picked up my phone and yes, dialed 911. They called me a snitch 😥 and took off. I wanted to step back and call the authorities from the shadows but crazy gf starts walking into the street. Damn it. My presence with authorities had to be made, crazy ass women. As they dip I run after the car trying to get the plates. After 50 yards I give up. They speed through the neighborhood and take off. 911 is still in my ear and Mr. Ghetto Bird is looking as he flys over the house. 10 minutes later 5 squad cars roll up asking for info. Eventually go to bed without watching the rest of my show. AITA?	1643057249.0	sbw2eh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbw2eh/aita_for_calling_the_cops/	AITA for calling the cops?
8gwtmuxo	TLDR at the bottom. I'll try to keep this unbiased.  My ex(17M) and I(18F) broke up on mutual terms early November due to drama with his parents. It was the kind of breakup we both were anticipating for a few weeks. After the official cut I got on dating apps to help me realize we weren't together, a coworker told him, and he told me of his crush on a coworker of ours, call her A. He told A how he felt but that he wouldn't plan to ever act on it.   Since then we were still friendly, and we started with fwb. In that situation we'd go to movies together (not big since we all work at the movie theatre) and kept saying I love you and such. It got to the point where we talked about up wanting to be together again but then say "but we know it'd just cause more pain.” I thought we were basically together, just not allowed to say it.  One night we were talking like normal and he changed the subject to tell me that a couple hours ago A asked him to go for coffee. He asked me if I was okay with that but since I couldn't change anything with my answer I lied and said yes. In my eyes the situation looks like he was pretending to care about me so I'd please him on break until his crush was ready for him, and I asked a few times if he could give me a better point of view, and said that if that's the case I should tell people cause that's something I'd want to know if my friend did that. He couldn't answer and every time I was about to blow I'd ask the same question again, including asking if A knew what she'd done to me. Now both my ex and A have been twisting everything and saying I'm causing them pain on purpose and I apologized to them because they backed me into a (figurative) corner.  He made me promise after dating A that I'd not tell anyone including my friends about the fwb situation but I found out he's told my roommate even and when I was talking to a friend last night I realized he was isolating me (even if unintentionally) and when I confronted I said I'd tell people if it came up instead of lying for him anymore and he told a girl he knows I talk to to be prepared for me to lie about him, and likely told the same to other mutuals. I got fed up and texted A telling her to be careful because if he'd leave me for her like that and not be sorry, he's capable of doing the same to her. I told them both that she shouldn't have asked him out and he shouldn't have said yes if either of them respected me. After that conversation I removed her contact for my own mental health (they both know how bad it's been) and they both proceeded to block me on all social media.   AITA for my response to their actions?  TLDR: my ex and I were in a near relationship, he turns around within an hour of us saying ILY that he had a date, the new couple believes I'm out of line for being upset because we weren't technically together, we all yelled but I'm the only one that had any apologies to give	1643057249.0	sbw2el	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbw2el/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_ex_and_his_new_girl/	AITA for getting upset with my ex and his new girl?
94er7cyw	I met a man a few months ago and we went way for a weekend on Friday. In the hotel room we were having an amazing time talking and laughing and I had a few glasses (he didn't). I was laughing and letting my hair down when he looked behind me in surprise. I asked him what was wrong and he told me that he thought he had seen someone behind the couch. I get up! Check behind the couch and open all closets etc... He was very nonchalant about it all and asked me why I was concerned.... He told me that he sometimes sees ghosts and that he doesn't understand my reaction. I wanted to bolt then and there but we were in an isolated location.. He slept on the couch that night and we drove home the next day. Is this normal??? I've never known anyone who sees people who aren't there....

izgx7wur	I had the biggest crush on this guy for years.  I've been a part of this club for a while and he joined 5 years ago. I had a crush on him since the day I met him and when he first joined, but I was too nervous to take it further since it seemed like all the other single women that were his age, like me, liked him too.  I eventually quit my membership there because he stressed me out so much.  In fact, I was rude and sarcastic whenever he tried to talk to me. Today, I went on a date that my brother set up for me at this high-end restaurant and I was surprised that it turned out to be the guy from the organization. The same one I had a crush on for years and counting.  I asked my brother why he set me up with this dude and he was like "a mutual friend of this guy and mine told me that he liked you so I was like why not?"  I then got annoyed at my date for not telling me he liked me, which would have saved me stress.   Moreover, when I was in the club, he flirted and talked all the time with this woman named Ashley (fake name). She was beautiful, successful, warm, and outgoing and I had no idea he had a crush on me for that long when he only had eyes for Ashley and other women like her.  I want to ask him why he didn't date Ashley instead.	1643057760.0	sbw972	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbw972/wibta_for_asking_a_guy_why_he_didnt_date_someone/	WIBTA for asking a guy why he didn't date someone else instead?
973ii1f4	My husband and I bought a nice place in the country for our family, including a couple acres for our 2 elderly horses.   We currently rent a pasture and barn for them, and have been for several years.  The horses landlady let her adult son bring 2 horses he adopted for his adult daughter over on her property to live. At the time, my oldest horse had serious health issues and I refused to share the pasture with their horses, so they're kept in a very small pen near ours. I still wouldn't let them share a pasture with my horses even after my oldest one passed away from natural causes.   My husband agreed to feed them as long as they bought the feed (he's nicer than I am). So we have been taking care of them for free for the last 2 years,  and even buying feed several times a year when they ran out and they didn't bring any for a week. The cheapest feed possible and no, we didn't tell them we bought the food.   Now we're moving, their horses are NOT coming with us, and the horses landlady's neighbor is laying on a guilt trip on my husband and I because no one knows who will feed their poor animals when we leave.   I don't care who feeds them. They're not my horses, I'm tired of taking care of them, and the new house is an hour away from them. I suggested the neighbor who is worried about the feed them, and they laid a bigger guilt trip on my husband about it.	1643058254.0	sbwg0q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwg0q/aita_for_not_caring_if_the_landlords_sons_horses/	AITA for not caring if the landlords sons horses get fed or not?
izhio514	We have two sons who are 12 and 8. Our sitter has been with us for 4. He mainly worked with our eldest son, Ryan. Ryan was a bit of a hellraiser but puberty seems to have calmed him down to the point where he does not need a sitter.  Our sitter is mostly working with our youngest son, Simon. Simon is just a big loving marshmallow who never causes a fuss about anything. Our sitter even remarked how watching just Simon is the easiest job he's ever had.  I was thinking since we were paying our sitter $23 an hour to mostly keep Ryan from doing something stupid but all our sitter is doing is playing Legos and getting him to take a bath with Simon then that's like worth $18 an hour. Probably the hardest part of watching Simon is washing his hair.	1643058753.0	sbwmqi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwmqi/aita_for_wanting_to_cut_my_sitters_pay/	AITA for wanting to cut my sitter's pay?
izflad3r	A while ago, I (20F) took my dog to the park near our house like always. The park stretches out for miles and people will jog, picnic or bring their dogs/kids. There is a small enclosed dog park then beside it is a field where people let their dogs off leash. This was never a problem as police will walk through and never complain about off leash dogs so this became a regular. My dog is a pit, very friendly and I would never bring her in public if I knew she wasn’t friendly.   On this day, I brought my dog to the open field. there was small dogs around with their owners having picnics so I stuck to the corner of the field. She wasn’t interested in the small dogs and just ran in circles. After about 5 min, I was watching my dog smell grass when I noticed a lady a couple feet away from my dog screaming AHT AHT. This is actually a command I taught her when we go for walks and she sniffs things she not suppose to like trash, tossed food, etc so when I say it she knows to stop. When my dog heard, she instantly looked at the lady and stood there. I walked towards them asking if there was a problem but then she starts throwing water at my dog from a bottle. I recalled my dog and she ran towards me with her tail tucked and I demanded to know why she was throwing water. She had a boy with her, possibly her son, and her son explained that she doesnt like dogs and for me to leave. I explained LOOK there are lots of off leash dogs here so if you are afraid, you shouldn’t be here and please do not throw water at my dog b/c she was not interested in you until you started screaming. The lady instantly blew up and started saying curse words in Spanish (probably didn’t think I understand but I sure did). I yelled back that she didn’t belong here if she was afraid of dogs. That’s when she began throwing sticks off the ground at my dog who was right beside me bc I refused to leave. My dog got scared and started running in circles trying to dodge the sticks. Me and the lady ended up in a screaming match b/c she had no right to start throwing things at my dog who hasn’t bothered her. She called me a b***h in Spanish so I called her one in English. Then she threw water at me and I had the water bowl in hand so I tossed the water at her. Instantly, her son began recording and she stood there saying I thought I was all that walking around with a big butt (I do have a little body shape however I was wearing baggy sweats, dirty Uggs, and a XL sweater so the body comment was unnecessary) I put the leash on my dog and tried to leave but she followed me, throwing rocks at my dog while her son recorded. I stuck up my middle finger, told her to F off and went home. I told my family and they semi agreed with me but called me an AH for talking disrespectfully and for not calling the police to let them handle it. I live in a city as well that is considered low class so even if I was to call they would take about 3 hours to show if they even wanted to. So AITA for how I reacted?	1643058996.0	sbwq3n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwq3n/aita_for_yelling_at_a_lady_throwing_sticks_at_my/	AITA for yelling at a lady throwing sticks at my dog

During the beginning of the pandemic, my husband & I moved in with my grandmother. She had been diagnosed with dementia & couldn't take care of herself. It was a miserable situation for everyone involved.  As things became more unbearable my family proved to be deceitful, manipulative people & my husband became destructive, verbally abusive & dishonest. He started a serious new relationship online & claimed that it was my fault for "pushing him away" by choosing my family. That I should just be happy that he doesn't intend to leave me.That I only want to be monogamous because I am small & petty.

izhi05xc	I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. Before my current relationship I (22f) was in a long term relationship with my ex (19f) who we’ll call A. We were together since the 6th grade and had plans on getting married the year she turned twenty, sadly she pasted away in a fatal accident a month b4 her birthday. It took me so long to find the will to date again but after a lot of consideration i decided to get back out there. I found my now current partner (22f) who we’ll call D have been together for 1y and 1/2 now and she makes me very happy the happiest I’ve ever been awhile. However when we first started talking I explained what happened with A and explained that even though we could be together I would still refer to A as my girlfriend even though she was no longer with us. For me doing this makes me feel like she’s still here and like she never really left. For D however as off maybe 2 months ago has brought up that i should no longer refer to A as that bc “she’s dead and isn’t as important as me bc I’m alive” this tore me apart bc I do love D, however A and me and a bond that I’ll probably never get to have with anyone ever again and I just feel like D  will never understand that bc she doesn’t know what it’s like so tell me AITA?	1643059053.0	sbwqxu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwqxu/aita_for_calling_my_ex_gf_my_gf_while_being_with/	AITA for calling my ex gf my gf while being with my new gf
izghmee6	My gf and I stay in different cities and we haven't met each other for a long time, we were discussing when to meet and she said that she's so desperate to meet that she'll sponsor everything, I thought she was joking since we frequently make sugar mommy jokes since she's 3yrs older than me. We were discussing plans and I told her it would be cheaper for her to come to my city because I would be driving to hers and gas would be expensive and I have my home here so the cost of Hotel wouldn't be there as well. She said she'll sponsor the gas and since I thought she was joking I thought I'll go along with it and didn't say no to her. A few hours later she tell me that she has snapped out of it and won't sponsor anything and I was fine with that because I thought it was a joke and we had started planning and then she brought about the topic of sponsoring, so it wasn't anything new for me. She then said as to how it's my fault because i didn't say no her to for sponsoring and that I'm was being very problematic, and that she does not wish to meet me anymore.

We never really argue and we have love and support with each other.   Over the last year an a half I’ve tried hard to see her but everytime were due to meet she always makes an excuse not to see me. She uses her anxiety as her excuse. But never is willing to do anything about it. She refuses to call me and when ever I bring it up to her she tells me I’m overthinking and I need to calm down. We have gone nowhere in this relationship and living 2 hours away doesn’t help. I barely know anything about her and when I offered to do the journey for her instead witch I did worry about I told her how uncomfortable I felt considering she has a habit of not turning up when she’s supposed to. Having talked to her about this she got defensive and said I’m looking at it wrong. Other then her first name, she, favourite colour and the town she’s from I know nothing about her.

8u956zic	     Okay, so mandatory disclaimer of how I'm on mobile and yada-yada-ya.        Now, to start, I am polyamorous. Which means I am dating 4 people with all of their knowledge and consent. Two of my partners (one of which I've lived with for about almost 2 years), and I have been planning to move to another state for a while.   I will call them F (18f) (the one I've been living with) and E (26nb).  Well one of my other partners, who I will call P (23nb) was just told their roommate is leaving, and we were the first people they asked to stay with them because we all vibe well and they were planning on getting a house before 2024 anyways, so it would be a good temporary fix for all of us.       Now, F and P are both poly like I am and have multiple partners; however, E is monogamous, but still supports me and is learning to be okay with the fact I am poly (Disclaimer: they knew about my partners before we started dating and I always make sure to respect boundaries and we talk about their part in all of this a lot, I love all of them equally).  Now, F wasn't completely sure about moving with us into P's apartment because they are unable to get a job and have crippling anxiety, but today came back with the news that she is going to try it out and I'm really hyped because I will live with 3 out of 4 of my partners! (My 4th partner is unable to move but doesn't mind me living with everyone else because they will be free to come over often.) But when I told E, they seemed a bit upset. They see themselves as the 'new guy', and I kind of think they were hoping it would just be the 3 of us, me, E, and P.        We were all very open and planning to move in with all of us, but I can't help but feel that E was hoping F wouldn't move in so they could have me more to themselves.  I wonder if I'm the AH because I got excited when F told me she was going to try it out (if she gets too stressed she is welcome to move back in with her parents and everyone is okay with this).  I think that E believes I love F more than them and am happier that she is moving with us than I am about them.  I don't want to make anyone feel unwanted but I also don't want to exclude one partner for another.  To be fair, E and I will be sharing a bed while F has a futon to herself but E keeps trying to say "you've lived with her longer so you should have the bed".  None of my partners are dating each other so 3 to a bed could get uncomfortable.

izge6epz	I hate remote work sometimes and need to vent. I just got out of an uncomfortable, bordering on passive-aggressive interaction with a superior for asking them to reschedule a meeting.  My company's HQ is in California, which as you know makes their work hours late for just about everyone else. My team is aware I'm on a different timezone.  Last week I got an invite for a 7-9:30pm meeting tomorrow. I was overwhelmed that day and got a lot of invites, so it slipped by and I didn't realize this meeting was a bad time until today, when I was checking my calendar for the week. I asked for the meeting to be rescheduled 27 hours in advance, and apologized for not noticing it was a bad time earlier.  My coworker was upset I only let them know "last minute", and if I couldn't at all somehow join. I said I'm sorry but I really can't, and please going forward don't assume I'll be attending evening meetings, and that I mentioned before the latest I could be in a meeting was 7-8pm (end times). I then said I'd be happy to make an exception some other day, but I really can't make it on Tuesdays (that's when I'm attending classes for an MBA I'm paying for myself).  I was then called out for not blocking that time on my calendar as unavailable, and I shouldn't trust their memory and it's on me to prevent those miscommunications.  I accepted responsibility and blocked off those hours in my calendar so it doesn't happen again.  However, I'm still upset because I think I did let them know in advance (over 24h), and the meeting organizer should've been mindful of their immediate co-workers timezones when setting up a meeting. Also, nobody else has to block off their evenings on their calendar because it's never assumed they'll be attending such late calls.  A few points to add to my story:  \- They knew I'm unavailable on Tuesday evenings. I said so verbally multiple times, and even had to walk out of a meeting 2 weeks ago to attend class.  \- It's not part of the employee onboarding guide to block off evenings in their calendar, and nobody else does that.  \- They're very aware I'm on a timezone ahead of California, we've been working together 10 months.  \- I'm generally flexible with meeting times when needed, and will happily compromise to accomodate their later work hours. I also do block unavailable periods on my calendar if they're within work hours (say, a doctor appointment).  \- I really thought it was plenty obvious people aren't joining meetings 7-9pm and no extra communication was necessary about it.  \- Personally I always check timezones when scheduling meetings to make sure I'm not inviting people outside their 9-5. I expected the same courtesy back.  \- I'm a contractor on a fixed monthly fee and I'm not paid extra for working late.  TL/DR: Co-worker was inconsiderate of timezone differences, and invited me to a meeting very late for me and I couldn't make it. I asked to reschedule > 24h in advance but was called out for it.	1643060411.0	sbxbbs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxbbs/aita_for_rejecting_a_meeting_outside_my_work/	AITA for rejecting a meeting outside my work hours a day in advance?

efzfcmda	I’ve been with my husband for 7 years.  His mom and I were very close and got along great the first year we were dating.. at the time he was still living with her and after that year mark he moved out to his own apartment (he didn’t even move in with me, just got his own place).  No one could convince her that it was his own decision, she was for some reason dead set on it was me who forced him to “leave her” and ever since then I’ve been the girl who stole him away and she’s hated me for the last 6 years.  Anyway, one of her biggest sources of tension towards me is food.  I love to cook and my husband loves my cooking, and that makes my MIL insanely jealous.  This leads to her constantly making back handed comments towards me and criticizing everything she sees me make.  She lives about 25 minutes from us and she stops by about once a week to see our son.  For whatever reason the last few months when she comes by she brings a Tupperware of food she’s cooked for my husband.  She doesn’t even bring enough for me or even my son, only my husband.  And she makes comments like “you look like you need a good meal” or “I know you haven’t had the is as good since you left home”.  Just typical petty MIL shit.  Well for the last 6 years I’ve bit my tongue and tolerated her immature behavior for the sake of family cohesion.  But recently I cracked.  The last 3 times she’s brought food for my husband, he’ll say the next day that he’s about to heat it up.  Then I offer to heat it up for him and during that process I’ve added a ton of salt to it, like way too much.  I hand it to him to eat and each time he’s spat it out saying it’s inedible.  She was over our home yesterday and again had Tupperware in hand, this time he told her thanks but no thanks, and he didn’t particularly enjoy the recent things she’s brought.  You would’ve thought he just told her he has stage 4 cancer by the look on her face.  Honestly I felt amazing in that moment, like 6 years of bullying from her finally come to a point.  In all the years she’s targeted me I’ve never stooped to her level or done anything to retaliate.. and now looking back I feel kind of disappointed in myself.  The guilt is setting in and I’m contemplating telling my husband what I did.  But another side of me still feels justified.

iyfrhnqj	This probably sounds bad, and if I’m TA, I am fully willing to accept that. This whole situation was really confusing. It happened during last June, so it was pride month. Someone on Facebook was selling pride flag lawn signs for $15 dollars, and the money went to an LGBTQ charity. My dad (40s M) bought one of the signs. I knew that he had a purpose for it that wasn’t good.  My dad was laughing his ass off in the car, and I asked him what was so funny. He explained his “prank” to me. He said, “I bought one of those LABCXQ flags or whatever it’s called. We’re going to drive by J’s house because he’s on vacation, and stick it in his lawn. He’ll be horrified when he gets back because people are going to think that he’s gay.” J is my dad’s best friend. I (15 at the time) am a lesbian, but my dad does not know.  Obviously, I took issue with it. But I was very conflicted on whether or not I should say something. I’m afraid of seeming too “pro-gay” and making my dad suspicious. If he wasn’t suspicious, than he’d call me a woke liberal snowflake. So he stuck the sign in J’s lawn and I kept guard. He told me not to too obviously laugh, because the people in the neighborhood would stare and get suspicious.  I fake laughed in front of my dad, but I felt immense guilt after because I perpetuated the hateful “prank”. Which I could have prevented.	1643061815.0	sbxv9c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxv9c/aita_for_going_along_with_a_homophobic_prank/	AITA for going along with a homophobic prank?
58qfulke	Last night, my (26F) roommate (23M) had his girlfriend over. A little bit of background info: they fight. A LOT. Like they are broken up nearly once a month. She is also 4 months pregnant. She also does not live with us.   They got into another fight last night and usually I just tune it out as it's not my business. But they were fighting very loudly this time and I heard a loud sound and went out and my roommate was on the floor. She had pushed him onto the fireplace. I helped him and asked him if everything was alright. He says yes and goes outside. Shortly after, things settle down. I go into the kitchen to get a water bottle before bed and noticed my roommate laying on the couch, looking upset. He does have his own room and has never slept out there before. I asked what was wrong, and he told me that she kicked him out of his own roommate because she didn't want to sleep next to him as she was mad at him and she's pregnant so he needs to listen to her.   This upset me, even though I'm not particularly close to my roommate. This is where he lives, she doesn't. I banged on his door as she had locked it and told her to leave or I would call the cops. That it was bullshit that she kicked him from his own room and if she didn't wanna sleep next him, she could leave. She left but my roommate was upset and told me it wasn't my business. I do feel as if I didn't HAVE to intervene, but her having pushed him also really set me off.

c8me5ib9	My husband and I have been trying to concieve for years. We lost one baby 3 years ago during a very late term miscarriage. We were extremely excited when we found out we were pregnant again. We also were excited because my SIL and brother were also expecting a baby as well. They would grow up together. However, a few months into my pregnancy I had a miscarriage and was also told I had a rare auto immune disorder that makes my body think pregnancy is a virus and because of that conception and full term normally would be very hard if not impossible. I became extremely sad and depressed because of this to the point I started seeing a therapist about it. Two months after this my SIL and brother were throwing a baby shower/gender reveal party for her pregnancy. I wanted to be there for them but I just couldnt handle it. My husband felt the same way.  I told my brother that we would send a gift and that we loved them both but just couldnt handle it right now. My brother understood and said they would miss us.   The day of the baby shower  I get a call from my mom, dad, and sister all calling my husband and I selfish and a AH because we made their day about our miscarriage by refusing to show up. That we are being dramatic and hurtful.  They said I made my SIL sad and that she didn't understand why we weren't there. Now I'm feeling awful about not going.

6k6qshw7	I make animations and skits featuring popular characters from franchises that I really like, but they tend to also be extremely common for tweens and teens. So most of the people who wind up following me are younger people, which I never intentionally catered to but just so happens to pretty much always be the case, which is understandable because my content is usually pretty family friendly if not just a bit edgy sometimes (sometimes I do horror and gore but it's always censored to the degree that the app will let me). But theres never anything sexual or any jokes like that because I'm asexual and that crap honestly makes me extremely uncomfortable in general, so I shy away from it pretty incessantly even just for the media I consume. (Which now that I think about it might be why it's always so common with younger audiences). I mostly mean stuff like FNAF and undertale, they came out when I was in highschool but apparently a lot of teens find it rly nostalgic because they were quite young when it came out. Anyway, that's the lore of what I create.  My question is, is it assholish/weird that I sometimes interact with some of my fans? Like sometimes they post stuff that's funny so I follow and like their posts, or I'll send videos I find funny that's part of the same franchise because I assume theyd find it funny too. But most usually I follow people who are artists that I think have a lot of potential, and I like to try and boost their work when I see it, because if the people i looked up to when I was younger did that, I would've loved it. I just wonder with the age gap is that messed up?? Like should I just be completely ignoring the existence of these people outside of replying to comments on the videos I post? I'm not like a giant superstar, I have like 10k follows on tiktok and only like 5 people ever did I interact with independently of the comments section.  I don't DM people or really have full on conversations with any of them because that seems too personal (plus I'm an introvert and don't really enjoy one-on-one interaction anyway) but I do have a discord server linked that's an art community I made to encourage artists to create original content. I still really dont talk to anybody there outside of just trying to encourage their art, but still at the end of the day I am an absolute social moron and I'd have no idea one way or another if this is messed up or not because everyone always puts emphasis on creators being creepy predators but there's definitely more ways than that to be harmful to minors that arent sexual in nature and I want to be sure I'm not doing that.

izif6aww	Throwaway because my ex isn’t fully out yet and I don’t want to risk it.  I (27f) am in the process of separating from my wife (29mtf).  We were married for 2 years and together for 5. She only came out as trans early last year.  I initially tried to be okay with it and adapt, but unfortunately I’m just not into women, not even a little bit. Her femme presentation is a visceral turn off, it torpedoed our sex life, and as she continues to transition that’s going to get worse.  She started making a lot of comments about us being a lesbian couple and I just could not do it anymore. Fighting my orientation to be with someone is not what I signed on for and I felt pressured into finding her attractive still in order to make her happy.  I still love her as a person, but that’s not the relationship I want for myself.  I told her that we could stay married for long enough to do some of her planned major medical transitioning stuff while she’s on my insurance which would have taken about a year all told, but that we would need to make a plan for her to move out and start financially separating. We’ve always had separate accounts anyway. I told her that I would not put money towards her medical transition, but that I would help cover moving and set up expenses so she could find a safe place to live. She does make less than me and the house was mine before we married and is in my name, so I felt it was fair to help. I don’t want her to suffer, this is just unfortunate not something I’m angry about even though she’s really mad at me.  6 months later, she’s living with a friend but hasn’t made any moves to finish her medical transition in terms of scheduling top surgery and a facial procedure she wanted. I asked when this was planned because I want to file and get on with my life, she said she doesn’t have the money and asked me to pay for it. I said no, but that I would wait another 6 months as promised for her to figure out something before removing her from my insurance and filing the divorce.  She went ballistic, called me transphobic, and said that if I was just going to throw her away, I could at least help her and not make it worse.  At this point, I’ve had enough. I told her that she had months to sort herself out and had done nothing, so I was filing and removing her from my insurance in 3 months unless she could show me documentation of a scheduled procedure. Some mutual friends think she’s trying to take advantage of me, but her roommate (also trans) said that I would be preventing her from getting hormone therapy and general care as well since she’s a contractor and doesn’t have her own insurance and wants me to reconsider giving her another full year or just paying some of it. Some of her friends sent me nasty messages about me being transphobic. Her family is not supportive, so she’s on her own.  I know being trans can’t be easy, but I don’t feel like this is my problem to solve.	1643062513.0	sby4z0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sby4z0/aita_for_not_helping_trans_ex_through_transition/	AITA for not helping trans ex through transition?
izjqze2o	Hello! I am trying to see if I am in the wrong in this situation? A few  months ago I bought an Astroworld ticket from a friend. He only made me  pay $300 for the ticket to the festival. The guy I bought it from had  something come up on the weekend of the festival and was no longer able  to attend. He and his friends were posting everywhere trying to get  someone to buy the ticket from him so he would not waste his money.  Finally, they had texted me about it very last minute, and impulsively I  agreed. It seemed like it could be fun and that I would enjoy it. The  Airbnb that we would be staying at was already paid for by the guy I  bought the ticket from and the other friends going. I had asked from the  beginning if I had to pay anything for the Airbnb and put up money for  it and all of them told me no and that I did not have to worry about it  and that all I had to purchase from him was the ticket itself. Soon the  weekend of the festival came, and we went and y'all know how Astroworld  2021 ended. Everyone that attended the festival and bought a ticket got  full refunds. However, since I bought it from someone and not through  the festival website, I did not get the refund directly to my bank  account. I then texted the guy I bought the ticket from asking to get my  full refund of $300 back. He then went on to say it was fair of him to  only give me half of what I paid ($150) back. The reasoning's behind  this was because the festival got cut in half and went from a 2 day  event to a 1 day event. Another reason was because I never had to pay  for the Airbnb and this was his reimbursement for it. However, they had  told me I did not have to pay for the Airbnb from the start? Is it logical that I am now getting that taken from me? I had also not realized that Astroworld would be as crazy and intense as it got, and  that people would get their lives taken and the event get cut short. The guy I bought the ticket from is saying it isn't logical that I get my  full trip "paid for out of his pocket now". I do agree that my trip  shouldn't be paid for out of his pocket. However, he got his full refund  and if he wanted me to pay him for the Airbnb, shouldn't he have told  me this from the start? Am I overreacting to this situation? Should I get my full $300 back or only half of what I paid him for the ticket.	1643062515.0	sby4zv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sby4zv/aita_for_trying_to_get_my_full_refund_back/	AITA for trying to get my full refund back?
oue7qqr	My (F26) boyfriend (M26) and I have known each other since kindergarten. We have maintained our friendship our whole life. The pandemic put a lot of thing into perspective and we individually realized that we wanted to settle down. We also realized that we love each other - something I think we were in denial about for the sake of our friendship. We’ve been in a committed monogamous relationship for about a year and the relationship is wonderful. We’re planning to get engaged this year (ring is ordered).  I am a straight cis female and I’ve always had long term relationships. He’s cis male and has had one long term relationship with another cis female. Other than that he’s dated a lot and had fun (this is not a problem and we often talked about it a friends). The overwhelming majority has been women, but he’s physically been with men. In the past he said he’s open to the idea of a relationship with someone who’s transgender but it just never happened.  Naturally he has a higher voice and isn’t scared to embrace his feminine side. This has lead to a lot of people asking him, over his lifetime, if he was gay - even his mom. Maybe about every other month it somehow comes up and we talk about it but it doesn’t bother me. The idea is that he wants to put a label on himself - an identity. He has accepted and is secure with the idea that he’s attracted to other genders but he personally believes he prefers women overall.  Today, I don’t know what was different, but it came up and resulted in an argument. Maybe I didn’t realize that it bothered me. Specifically what triggered me was that he said “I don’t know if I’m gay or not.” As his friend I 100% support him if he’s bi or pansexual or gay. But as a girlfriend I don’t want to continue a relationship with, much less get engaged to, someone who might not be attracted to me. His counter argument was that he misspoke - he’s definitely into women and into me and most likely bi or pan - and that he’s only trying to figure out his label. I argued that it shouldn’t matter because he claims to want to be with me for the rest of our lives. Whatever he’s into, it should only matter if he looking for other sexual partners. If he’s on a journey finding himself that it’s okay but we shouldn’t continue what we’re doing until he knew for sure.  He assured me that he truly loves me and is excited to get married to me. He even apologized because he didn’t realize that since we got together no one asks him anymore. It was the years of micro aggressions that have made this a constant question in his mind. The argument is over, but I can’t help but feel bad. Being cis gendered and straight I’ve never had to struggle with these thoughts. I feel like he is entitled to have his identity and I took that away from him.

g3mtw4jq	I’m on an annual golf trip with a group of friends playing a premier course in North Carolina. Our foursome was all solid golfers (I was the worst with an 8 handicap) and we rented push carts to walk the course. Since it was our first time here we hired a Forecaddie through the course to help us find wayward shots, fix bunkers and what not to keep up pace of play. They are paid $140 per foursome and we finished our round in 4:15 (~$33/hr, which is more than what I make for reference). On top of the flat fee, a tip of $30 - $50 is expected per golfer. Well, our forecaddie had been at this course for less than 1 year so his green reads weren’t reliable, we lost 3 balls just off the fairway because he was too busy chatting/texting during our tee shots, didn’t carry our bags or anything since we had our own push carts, his best advice was to “just hit it in the middle”, and provided no added value whatsoever. At the end of the round my buddies gave me shit for not tipping the guy for (in my opinion) doing nothing.   Am I the asshole? Or was the lack of tip justified?  Further point of reference, we played another premier course the day before in which we had a great forecaddie who exceeded expectations and walked away with $50/player.	1643063363.0	sbygmo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbygmo/aita_for_not_tipping_our_forecaddie_due_to_piss/	AITA for not tipping our forecaddie due to piss poor performance?
6lihdccm	For context, I’m in high school. And if it were up to me, I would never take another vacation, this isn’t a “if I was going with my friends…”. I don’t like any aspect of vacations (except the company), I hate traveling, I get carsick, and I don’t see the appeal of new places. However, my family loves to take long and strenuous vacations and while I appreciate their attempts to show me the world (country) and culture me, two or three weeks camping up and down the west coast is a little exhausting, and in their defense I have never made my distaste clear in fear of hurting their feelings.  This year my dad gave me an option of saying no to a vacation, something he has never done before. He knows I have a lot going on and I’ve let him know of a slight distaste for vacations, due to the fact that I have a lot going on. I pointed out some of the reasons I wouldn’t want to go. One, I have a job, two actually that I work consistently through the school year and hoped to keep up during the summer to save up money for college and beyond, this could get me fired from both jobs and if not it would make me loose out on a lot of money. Two, I haven’t had a real summer since I was 13 my parents were very strict about covid and since the pandemic started I have seen my friends in person less times than I have fingers (literally six times since March 2020), I haven’t even had a birthday party for my 15th or 16th birthday, but with everything getting better I am hoping that I can have a real summer this year and I was hoping to make the best of it, cutting three weeks without my friends is a lot for my first real summer in years.  After hearing my opinions my dad got a bit angry, even though he had phrased it originally as a choice I could make he changed his mind telling me “he wanted to hear my opinion but the decision was still his”. I understand that it is disruptive that I don’t want to vacation, and they have made it clear that they won’t let me stay home alone for that period of time so I see how they wouldn’t want to miss out on their vacation. But I don’t understand why I was given a choice only for it to be taken away.   Now everything in my house is very tense right now and my mother is mad at me for ruining her vacation (even though my dad still hasn’t made up his mind about it yet). I tried to cave already and tell him we should just go but he sent me away and told me to come back when I mean it, and I have no idea what to do.

7ev0ul83	I feel terrible about this and am not sure if I made the right call. Since I was recently posting about an older issue, thought I’d ask about this one too. A little while, I came down with the flu. I was 100% confident it was the flu (i had been around someone who definitely had the flu and not the virus that shall not be named), but I contacted my doctor about it, as I needed to get tested for work, and they directed me to a walk up outdoor testing site since I didn’t have a car.  It was extremely icy out (we’d recently had snow), and I was pretty sick, but I had to go, so I walked. When I was waiting for a light a few blocks from the site, I was suddenly approached by an old lady. She asked me to help her across the street. She didn’t have a walker or anything, and I hadn’t been paying attention so I have no idea where she came from or how she got to me without help. She indicated that she wanted to hold onto my arm.   I told her I was fairly certain I had the flu (and was literally heading to test for the beer virus tho I had no reason to think I had it), and that I wasn’t comfortable being in close proximity. Recent events have made me a lot more aware of the fact that even the simple flu can be deadly for some. She seemed upset, didn’t seem to understand what I was saying (insisted she wasn’t sick) and indicated she needed to make it across the street to the bus stop and didn’t believe she could make it on her own. I looked around for someone else that could help, but it was freezing out and there was no one nearby. I told her that I was sorry, but I wasn’t comfortable touching her when I was symptomatic and pretty sick with the flu.   I’m not sure if she was hard of hearing or if maybe English wasn’t her first language, but she didn’t seem to understand and kept saying SHE wasn’t sick. I was running late for my appointment, and felt really uncomfortable exposing her to the flu when she didn’t seem to understand, so I finally left after apologizing again, and have felt horrible since. Did I do the right thing or AITA?	1643064219.0	sbysei	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbysei/aita_for_refusing_to_walk_an_old_lady_across_any/	AITA for refusing to walk an old lady across any icy street?
izktleix	For context, we are an OSDD-1B system of over 40, and the person we will be talking about is a DID system of over 200.  We (13) used to be friends with a DID system (14) from our school, and most of this situation takes place before the old host knew they were a part of a system. There are two alters in particular I’ll be talking about, A(F) and S(M) Back in around august, ex host was added to a group chat with a bunch of random people. They quickly became fond of one of them and they began talking. Soon, A revealed that they were a system, and ex host was cool with it. (Note that they were only now starting to question it if they were still a singlet.) after a while they met A2, in the system, which they started dating. It did not last long as ex host was extremely toxic. They broke up and stopped talking. After a few nights, C (one of our alters) had switched in that night. (C is now known as one of our emotional protectors. ) Ex host later switched in again.  Time went by, our alters dated some of theirs and broke up, by this point we had apologized so many times for what ex host has done to them. Despite the apologies, we soon stopped talking entirely. Time went by once more and we checked their tiktok account out of boredom. We found two videos, one saying we were playing victim and another fakeclaiming us saying we weren’t a system for only having introjects and our only trauma being “someone venting to us ONCE.” We confronted them, and another argument broke out. They did not take system accountability, and their excuse was complete amnesia between switches. They also mentioned that we always play victim. My question, do I have a right to be angry because they are in the wrong, or is it still our fault?	1643064283.0	sbyt8j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbyt8j/wibta_for_playing_victim/	WIBTA For “Playing Victim”?
iz628lzd	So I (16M) was having online classes with my camera turned off when I started hearing a little whistle from one of the students in the background that seemed very familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. The whistling stopped for a couple of minutes until I started hearing it again, and then I knew exactly what it was: it was the chorus of Dream's hit song 'Mask'. I immediately ripped off all my clothes and started furiously stroking my fully erect penis for a good 10 min, even sticking my Dream body pillow up my rectum, imagining that it was Daddy Dream penetrating me while whistling his hit song 'Mask'. It honestly were the greatest 10 minutes of my life, until my libido reached its climax and I let out a gigaload of cum for Daddy Dream that landed on the phone's screen and ended up turning on the mic and camera, and everyone stared horrified at me, screaming at the sight of my honest and earnest love expression to Dream. I was kicked out of the class by the dreamphobic teacher, and today the school principal called me and my parents to a meeting and told us that I may be expelled from the school, merely from expressing my gender and sexuality. What can I do about this?!?!? AITA expressing my gender and identity??!?

izkbxmp4	Our son just started middle school and isn't keen on being seen with either his mom or me. However, I agree to drop him off a couple of blocks from school on the condition that I get at least two hugs.   Before this, his mom and I would both see him off to school regardless of whoever has him (50/50 custody). He starts school 30 minutes earlier in middle school so sometimes she runs late.  So between our son not wanting to be seen with us and my ex struggling to see him because he starts school earlier, I stopped waiting for her. I give her a courtesy text that he's off to school and she'll complain that she was less than 10 minutes away. 10 minutes to her is like 30 minutes to me.  She is angry at me over this.	1643065311.0	sbz78e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbz78e/aita_for_telling_my_sons_mom_that_im_not_waiting/	AITA for telling my son's mom that I'm not waiting for her at his school?
izlyyncn	A few months ago, I (18) met a guy “Mike” (47) who I had sex with once, but we started to become more friendly with each other, so we decided not to have sex so that it wouldn’t turn into a romantic relationship. When we see each other, we cuddle sometimes, but that’s as intimate as we get. I don’t like the act of sex itself, but as of now it’s one of the only ways I know how to get positive attention, because I’m not really worth much as a person.   I met another guy “Rob” (37), who said he was interested in a friends with benefits situation with me. I agreed, saying I wasn’t looking to be in an exclusive relationship, and he said that he was fine with it as long as I was single. Considering I’m not dating anyone, and I hadn’t had sex in a few months before meeting Rob, I considered myself single and said I was without a second thought. We didn’t have sex the first time, but we did make out.   I didn’t really want to go back to Rob, but he said he wanted to see me, so I went back. I didn’t want to have sex but we did (I said yes the whole time, but I was lying about wanting it). Afterwards we talked about our sexual histories some and I decided to mention Mike as an “FWB”, despite not considering him that, in hopes that it would get Rob to not like me as much. He said “you have another FWB?” And I said “yes, is that alright with you?”. He said “well, I’d rather be the only person you’re sleeping with, but that isn’t something I can ask of you at this point”. I told him that Mike and I cuddled and kissed sometimes, but hadn’t had sex in a few months. The kissing bit was a lie; Mike and I had only cuddled the last few times I saw him when I said that, but I was hoping that by saying we kissed as well, Rob would back off of me a little bit. I asked if he felt like I’d lied to him by saying I was single, and he said “no, it sounds like you’re single to me. I just didn’t wanna be anyone’s side piece or help anyone cheat”.   So… I saw Ryan one more time, and we didn’t have sex, but he said he wouldn’t mind having me to himself. I realized he was probably looking for more than a FWB relationship at that point, but I didn’t want to say no to his face, so I said “maybe”. That was the last time I saw him in person. A week later, I saw Mike again, and for the first time in a long time, he and I made out. At that point, I decided it wouldn’t be ethical for me to continue seeing Rob, especially since I didn’t really want to see him again to begin with.   I texted Rob and told him I didn’t want to see him anymore. He seemed disappointed but it ended smoothly.   Did I do something wrong here? Did I lie by saying I was single? I wasn’t trying to be deceptive by saying that at all, I just didn’t think I’d needed to mention Mike to Rob because he wasn’t a sexual or romantic partner at the time.	1643065432.0	sbz8va	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbz8va/aita_did_i_lie_about_being_single/	AITA?

hf5o2rov	Ok so let me start by saying I (at the time 17M) was an adopted child with a long history of abuse, mental, sexual and physical (this is semi important later on.)  My stepfather (whom we will call B) and I started well I’d go to the gym and go shooting ect with him, when I had the energy things would go well and we would bond. B was an old school kind of man however who didn’t believe mental health was a huge issue, disregarding my trauma and my need to sometimes be alone encouraging me to try and play tough guy and hide my issues. This was a mistake. He slowly got more frustrated with my issues. Shouting at me, locking me out the house when I’d breakdown, degrade my sexuality and gender issues, body shame me(I struggle to gain weight at all) ect.  I got more frustrated and I once again brought it up to my mother. She must have had enough because she decided that he was in the right and I should try harder with him, try harder to be normal. This really got to me because that’s the one person I’d turn to for support and help when I needed it, especially because she’d been the only person who’d been semi understanding of my mental health issues. Anyway I got mad and an argument happened, I asked how she could put a man she’d known for 3 years before a boy she’d raised for 10 and he overheard this, storming out of the house after further arguing with me. He returned some hours later , me and my mother had made up since and I was going to apologise to him but I was instead greeted by him pointing a loading shotgun in my face. My mother did nothing to stop this, nor did she interrupt when I told him to blow my head off if it meant their problems would be solved.  B stormed out once more and my mother asked me to leave, calling me a psycho and asking why tf I would ask someone to blow my head off ect so I got a hotel for the night. The next day was my birthday so I tried to make contact with my mother and she assured me he’d calmed down and I could come home. She lied to me and once B returned home from work I was met with a barrage of insults and ended up in a physical alteration. I left home that night without so much as a goodbye. Obviously due to my age social picked me up and made my mother aware. She turned up and started spouting a speech about how ungrateful I was and how I should have sat there and allowed B to do what he felt was right. I told her I didn’t deserve to be treated that way and the threat of social services wouldn’t have been enough to stop me leaving a place I wasn’t welcome. She called me ungrateful and dramatic. I haven’t spoken to her much since (it’s been 6 years now) barring one forced convo when my ex was speaking with her and I was present and all of my old friend group believe I’m being petty whilst I believe I simply stood my ground and refused to be treated like garbage and my current friends tend to agree with me.

g3dr4bk8	I (13m) and my mom (30f) just had a fight because I asked her for a signature that I need for school. She told me she'll write my teacher an email, and I answered that this wasn't enough. She asked me if I really wanted to fight her now and be disrespectful even though I never was!  She told me to be a bit nice to her after her dad just had an heart attack, and whilst she is more stressed, I am too. I might fucking loose my second grandpa and I don't want another death.

f3bk1blb	Ok I’ve never posted on here before so forgive me. I need to get this off my chest and I need opinions from people who don’t know me.   I have this co worker at work who I really can’t stand. We used to get a long ok or so I thought.  During lockdown furlough happened and they were off for a long time. Ever since they’ve been back ( it’s been a year and a half now) I’ve found them to be overly rude and at times a straight up asshole. The first time I realised they didn’t like me when I overheard someone complaining that I and was unable to come to a party but it would have been nice to know earlier (bearing in mind they’d only sent the message the evening before and I hadn’t finalised my plans ,anyways that all got sorted). Anyways this lady let’s call her Kendra was like don’t even get me started on that one. Tbh she could have been talking about anything or anyone but my gut tells me it was me.    My main problem with her is that she’s lazy.  We work in the childcare profession. She doesn’t interact with the children at all, refuses to change nappies, tells children off for having accidents. She just sits or stands in the corner and watches them. She called them little SH’s ( that’s literally what’s she says) under her breath all the time.  She loves to control everything so the children spend a lot of time outside running off energy so that they can be quiet later! I have complained and challenged this multiple times. The problem is everyone else goes along with her or agrees with her. I feel like I’m the one in the wrong but would like some insight from people who don’t know me or Kendra. There’s more I could complain about but let me start here	1643065521.0	sbz9ys	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbz9ys/aitahi_think_i_hate_my_coworker/	AITAH-I think I hate my coworker
ive5mjou	Hi everyone, pardon my English as it’s not my first language !   I (27F) and my boyfriend (28M) have been together for a almost a year. We are long distant and live 2hours train from each other. I visit him every two to three weeks for around 5 days.  He doesn’t travel to me as he has a illness that cause vertigo (increased by stress) and he visited me only 2 times since we are together. I don’t mind at all but I live alone and he lives with his family (mother 60 and brother 35) so we don’t have much alone time except when we go to bed. He is such a great person, kind, intelligent, very family oriented and hella attractive!  But I feel something is brothering me and making me mad and I don’t know if I’m right to be so I need you guys. When we are appart, we don’t text much as we are really busy with our work during the day (10 text max including “hi” “how did you sleep?”) and we get on the phone every day but always when he decide to finally get to sleep (around 2am). If I want to talk to him I need to wait that long as he always, every evening, is watching movies or series with his mother and brother before going to bed. We have series we watch together but it’s always after he watched stuff with his family…  And when I visit, we always do stuff with them also. I don’t want to push him too much As I admire his sens of family and it is really important for me too but I feel treated like a second choice.  I tried talking to him but he gets really defensive and I don’t know if I’m right to be mad.  We also got together during covid and he is quiet scared for his mom so he don’t want to go to restaurant and take public transport to go out.  I’m a gamer, so I even tried offering a game we could play remotely together but didn’t really changed his habit…  AITA if I’m mad about him sharing all his time with his family ?	1643066437.0	sbzls7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbzls7/aita_for_being_my_long_distance_boyfriend_prefer/	AITA for being my long distance boyfriend prefer spending time with his family ?
4o0npx5j	TW: se1f h@rm and su!c!de discussion  So I’ve known this person on Discord for maybe a few months. We’re not close, we’ve never met in person, they’re my good friend’s partner so I wanted to treat them with kindness and support. But they have some major mental issues. I’m not saying this in a mean or insulting way, they actually have severe mental health issues.  A while ago they came to me looking for help because they felt like cutting themselves and burning their house down with them in it. I offered the best of my advice (can’t offer much cuz I’m not a professional), told them I’m here for them and I thought they were gonna be okay. But every time I try offering advice they blow up at me and continue to hurt themself. And after a few months, I’m starting to wonder if I’m being any help at all and if I should just let someone else take care of it.  I don’t want to leave them in the state they’re in, even if I don’t know them all too well. Their family is broken and their parent doesn’t care about them so they can’t go to anyone else other than to me and some of my friends. But I can’t keep being here for them if they won’t listen and get mad at me for trying to help. Am I the asshole?	1643066280.0	sbzjrm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbzjrm/aita_i_dont_want_to_be_my_kinda_friends_therapist/	AITA: I don’t want to be my (kinda) friend’s therapist or helpline anymore
9opmj63y	First time poster + on mobile, apologies for spelling mistakes. Will clarify if asked. This story is a few years old, but I have been feeling guilty and having second thoughts about it so here I am. TDLR at the bottom.   Backstory; I (12F) met my friend (also 12F) who I will call A. We were both in choir, and were really close for about 3 years. Now we fast forward to our freshman year of high school, second semester (me 14F, her 15F). We stayed in choir but she wasn’t in my class. I had a big crush on her, but I never told her because I didn't want to lose her as a friend.  Our biggest performance of the year comes, we're all in costume, I am backstage and A is on stage. I was chatting with a mutual friend (14?F) who I will call R. We weren’t close, but to pass the time we were getting to know each other. Eventually we get on the topic of A, and turns out we both have a crush on her. After a bit, R and I agreed to not make a move or ask her out in front of each other so we wouldn't hurt each other's feelings.  A comes back, a different group goes on stage, so we are all backstage. R asked A to play a game of hangman with her, and she said yes. I watched from a distance, but as A kept guessing letters, I realized what she was doing. R was asking out A. I watched my crush say “yes” to the question.  I left the room to go to the bathroom to gather myself so I wouldn't cry; I had makeup on. I isolated myself for the rest of the day, but had to go back to perform a second time, so I stayed away from them the next day too. The following week was hell; I couldn't bear to see them, so I stayed away from my entire group. I felt bad about it, but I was too upset to be able to keep my composure.  Finally around the middle of the second week, R asked if we could talk. I said yes, and she apologized for going back on our deal, and hated to see me so hurt. R called A over, and broke up with her in front of me, saying she did still like her but couldn't stand to see me alone.  I hung out with everyone at lunch, and held A's hand on the way back, which made me happy. I let go because I saw R was behind. I slowed down to talk with her, and she was crying. I apologized for if I had pressured her to act, but thanked her as well. I offered her a hug, which she took, and she smiled a bit after.  Im running out of characters so quick wrap up; covid happened and over summer 2020, I confessed and asked her out, she answered with a FaceTime call, and said no. I understood, and we ended the call. We hardly talked after that. Now at the start of the 2021-2022 school year, I find out that A moved away AND visited. I never knew. My guess is we are no longer friends, just two teens with memories.  So now I ask; was I TA for causing the breakup?   TDLR: Had a crush on a friend, learned a mutual friend liked them too, they dated and broke up for me. Confessed after covid, got rejected, now my friend moved and we no longer speak.	1643066867.0	sbzrdo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbzrdo/aita_for_unintentionally_being_the_cause_of_a/	AITA for (unintentionally) being the cause of a breakup?
ivvbjbks	My husband has not been eating at home lately. He buys himself take out when he is home or is just not interested in eating at all. I am fed up with dishing up for him and the food never gets eaten so I end up eating it instead because I don't like wasting. I have recently just been cooking enough for me and the kids only. I actually prefer it that way because the kids and I don't eat much and we get to save.  Well today he came back early from work and the kids and I had already eaten lunch. He noticed that there wasn't any food for him and asked me why I had not left him any. I told him that he never ate the food when I did leave him some and he always eats fast food anyway. He started going on about how he works so hard but I can't even feed him which is funny because he doesn't even buy anything around here.  I suggested making a sandwich for him but he did not want it and insisted that I cook something. When I refused, he said I was a lazy b and he left.

a1wshi9a	My wife (27) and I(29) have had the worst year of our lives thanks to her racist mother. A little backstory: my wife and I come from different cultures and different religion. Her mother has reminded her of that almost every month since we got together 5 years ago.  As a european she believes she has some kind of superiority on others (iam middle Eastern). MIL didn't like that, and she didn't like the fact that our daughter was being raised bilingual. She tried to interfere with that but i would stop her, and whenever i tell my wife about it she says iam exaggerating. Fast forward to 2020, my wife was pregnant and had give birth 14 weeks earlier than the planned date, we were devastated and needed every help possible. MIL offered to help with our older daughter. Because of the situation we were at i said yes! Wife was busy 24/7 in the hospital, I was working from home. Now starts the action part.  MIL put me even more intensively under her microscope. All this while trying to build a barrier between me and my daughter. But worst of all is that she started deciding important decisions for our family without asking anyone of us. The last one where she spoke to my landlord with a list of demands that didn't make any sense and i had to call him afterwards and apologize a lot.  After 8 weeks of horror and not even being allowed to eat in my own house i told her thanks your service is no longer asked. She fumed but didn't say anything. A few days later i received a letter from her in the mail saying that she expected me to react like this and ask her not come back so i would be satanizing her grandchildren( forgot to mention she is very christian) and then goes on with sacking me and saying you shouldn't be a father and it is a shame that her grandchildren were only half(her nationality) and she hated everything i represent and much more, i show the letter to my wife and she is devastated, she couldn't believe this sort of cr*p to come out of her mother.  So i call MIL and tell her she is nomore welcome around the kids and I don't even trust her being withing a kilometre of them. And she would only be seeing my kids if she apologized and stopped being racist. She says she didn't do anything wrong. Wife then calls her and asks why you did this and MIL starts ranting about literally everything, how wrong i play with my kids, how is it wrong to speak my language with my kids in front of her, how disrespectful iam to my wife because she sometimes have to cook and all sort of this crap.

58uuhmc5	 Just like the title said.   She has multiple piercing on her face before I met her. I’m attractive to girls with piercing just on their ears but I actually found it attractive that she has a stud and a septum on her nose even though I never found them attractive. She was the exemption because it just fits her. I never cared for tattoos.  Lately she’s been thinking of getting another nose piercing, an eyebrow piercing and lip piercing. I told her I wouldn’t like it since it’ll look so crowded on her face. I didn’t tell her that I’ll find her unattractive but I know I would since it’s just too much. I know I can’t stop her from doing those since it’s her body but I don’t want to be with someone I find unattractive. I’m only 21 so it’s not like everything is end all, be all but i feel such an asshole for considering breaking up with her before something like that. I’m also afraid to break up with her since the one time I tried breaking up with her, she told me something that should’ve been a red flag (can’t say it coz of the rules) if I break up with her (we weren’t in a good mental state at this point of the relationship. I had anger issues and I was scared I was gonna hurt her at some point). She has pointed it out that it was a red flag but I’m not sure if she’ll do it again.

20g98h91	Hi, I rarely use this sub, fairly sure this is allowed. Let me know if not.   This happened a while back. I always felt so disgusting when it happened and recently something came up which brought this whole issue up again.   So I (m19 at the time) had been dating this girl (f19) for the longest time. We started “dating” in 4th grade. Our parents didn’t even think about it, thinking we’d break up in a few days. Kids right? Well we never did and by the end of HS we were still going strong)   We were engaged at this point, I had always (since maybe 5th grade? Definitely by 7th grade) told her I was bisexual. She had always acknowledged it, “agreed” with it even though I could tell she was a little homophobic but looked past it.   One day we were watching tv I made some comment about a guy. She immediately said “oh you weren’t lying” I was always massively confused because we had talked about “gayer” things with each other.   Anyway, her argument about me not being bisexual was “how would you know? You’ve never been with a guy” I argued how did anyone know they were straight prior to having sex.   Well, like 3 days after this she came to me with “Fuck a guy” literally those words out of nowhere. I answered with “what” and she basically just told me she gave me permission to go do a guy. Point of it was to “make sure” I was actually bisexual.   I flat out called her crazy and said there was zero chance of that happening. For a few days we had this ongoing argument.

g6m5q	I lived with my father and step mother for a few years off and on.   Me and my father mostly get along, but he has anger issues/BPD. He'll get into fights with my step mother, and just overall be a miserable person to be around when he's in his "moods". He has medicine to help, but he would not put in a large effort to take it every day.   My step mother on the other hand, just never liked me I'm sure. She never treated me like I was her step child, I was more of a tenant.   I had to give them half of my checks when I lived with them (I was 18-19) so that was my "rent". But I didn't really have any freedoms, and had to do all the chores that no one wanted to do, like cleaning up the shit from our 5 dogs. Or cleaning the dishes from the meal I wasn't apart of.   I eventually stopped respecting them (and even later, stopped talking to them) since they never showed me any respect either.  I always got treated like I was an asshole for not treating my step mother like she's my actual mom. And for not being empathetic to her and my father and now two little sisters that they've had.  Am I the asshole? I don't see why I should be empathetic towards them.	1643114131.0	sccpz2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sccpz2/aita_i_dont_talk_to_my_father_and_step_mother/	AITA I don't talk to my father and step mother anymore.
imwrzhj6	I don’t mean to sound entitled but since no one has done anything about my health, I’m taking action. I’ve had pelvic pain for 8 years and it’s getting worse. It all began with an ovarian cyst that I was told was “functional” after an ultrasound years ago and that it would go away. Well it bursting was the worst pain. Since then at every annual gyno visit (with different doctors in hopes of a different outcome) I get told the same thing that there’s nothing wrong with me as I’ve had every blood test under the sun. I expressed to my recent gyno that I was still in pain (my pelvic pain feels like my pelvis is rock and it hurts to move sometimes, spotting between periods, bloating) and I wanted another MRI which I haven’t had in years to see what’s wrong with my body to rule out Endometriosis/PID/ovarian cancer/PCOS. She explained to me why I don’t have any of those conditions and referred me to a hematologist. I sent a message after our visit for her to give me an MRI referral as a way to document her response. She never replied. I called and told them I expect a reply. She denied it saying if I’m in pain to come see her. I told her she doesn’t do anything about it and I’m wasting money visiting her. I asked her what the issue is when I’m paying for the MRI through my insurance and she said its an unnecessary test for me when she already diagnosed my issue as functional cysts. I called to speak to the clinical director, explained my pain, and was told that the doctor knows best and I cannot demand a referral just because I want one because that’s not how justifying it to insurance companies work nor do I know better than the doctor. Even if it’s not anything I listed, I’m just throwing out possibilities since SOMETHING is wrong with me that my doctor isn’t trying to figure out.   I personally think there is an 80% chance that I have endometriosis as I’ve had pelvic pain since before I was even active in my late teens. One day it’s going to be too late once I find out and it could be something irreversible or in a late stage.	1643117558.0	scdtzq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdtzq/aita_for_demanding_a_doctor_give_me_a_test_i_want/	AITA for demanding a doctor give me a test I want?
tzmmvcq	Around 7 months ago, I (23F) had a final falling out with a once-close friend (28F) of mine.   Friend was close to another person, let's call her Bee (33F). Bee had once disappeared and went silent for a little more than a week to focus on her mental health (that's fine, do you) but Friend and I have a history with an old friend of ours, Chad, who ghosted us for abusive reasons, and Friend was hurt and confused by how nonchalantly Bee rejoined the group, not even giving a "I had to focus on myself for a bit" message, just rejoined like it was nothing.   A few weeks pass and I personally have to take a step back. I left a dead GC with Friend and Bee, and Friend sent me pictures of Bee shit-talking me, talking about how when she left, "everyone hated her and was upset with her", and that I was leaving to "attack her". This is where I moved from being friends with Bee, to tolerating Bee. Last year, we were in Friend's chat together. I made a joke about Alabama (From there) and its regulations. Bee, who lives in Alabama, hated that, and we had a direct argument in Friend's community. Friend was angry and yelled at me for "not respecting her", for which I apologized. We didn't talk for a couple weeks, and then I learned that Bee wasn't talked to at all.   Between the months of last January and April, our friendship was very hesitant, talking every once and a while, and I failed to recognize the distance being created and latched onto my feelings for her as romantic, not platonic, and ended up telling her, pushing a boundary. This was apologized for profusely.   Understandably, our friendship was extremely strained going forward, barely talking, messages being left on read, reaching out with requests to join for games if she was available going ignored so I removed Snapchat, our main app. An "out of sight out of mind" attempt. She still had my number, we still had other ways of talking together, just not an app that would show me that she ignored me.   When she saw I removed the app, she sent me "I see you removed me, good luck w/ everything." to which I responded, "You too!" and it felt like we were parting ways in a form that could allow for reconciliation down the line. She then sent me the message "Thanks for doing what Chad did. Good on you for not following through with your promise, I'm not sure why I expected otherwise." The promise was to not "cut her out of my life", which I didn't and still haven't. She's been ignoring me since then.   Now, I'm getting messages from an old mutual friend that that he was glad I "left", that my overbearing toxicity would have led to him banning me if I came back, and that by playing the victim, I missed out on a great community (He is very close to Friend).

9mypc2gn	I work for a family friend, watching their infant during the week whilst they are at work. I accepted a low pay rate initially thinking working my other job on the side would keep me afloat and the guaranteed monthly for nannying their daughter would be enough to cover my bills. For reference, they’re not married and living with his parents so money is tight for them; which is partly why I accepted a low rate. I technically make federal minimum wage but I do commute a decent distance (about an hour both ways) every day to get to their house. The average rate for full time nanny’s in our area is almost $25/hr (LA) and the average cost for a gallon of gas here is a little over $4/gal. I make ~$300 a week currently so roughly $100 of that pay goes to gas commuting to and from every week. I asked for a raise last week and explained that even with working my other job on the weekends I am struggling to get by; and never have a day off. It’s begun to take a toll on my relationship with my fiancé. Unfortunately they can only afford to bump it to $10/hr which would be $400 weekly and would obviously be helpful to have the extra money for gas, but my fiancé doesn’t think it’s worth it. She would prefer that I go back to bartending part time and at least having some time off to help plan our wedding and spend time with her. I make a lot more money doing that and I know it’s the ideal choice, but I do love them and their daughter. I really am struggling to decide what to do. So, WIBTA?

4rzy6gkt	TLTR; AITA, my only brother is getting married next year, I have always been close with him and his fiancé (or so I thought)!   I have recently broken up with my ex of 9 years so they have changed their mind about me having a plus one.   I have no role in the wedding at all so I am just a guest but I’m really hurt that I cannot have a friend or someone help me get ready on the morning of the wedding. Especially when they have allowed distant relatives to bring their new partners (less than 6 months).   I’m upset that my only sibling is getting married and I’m going to be alone during their big day. I know I will have other family there but they’re all with someone.   I questioned this and his fiancé is annoyed with me because in my brothers words “it’s her day and she can do what she wants, you can’t tell her what to do”.   I did have a plus one and if I stayed with my shitty ex I still would?!

j0c2pltl	A few of my buddies and I started a business and, because we're the owners, we're the ones setting the rules. My girlfriend had been unemployed for awhile and I decided that, if I hired her then she could be employed, even if it was just a resume builder. I hated that she seemed to have fallen into like this minor depression from not landing a job, was sleeping until noon and vegging out. I hired her, I trained her on the job since the position wasn't totally in her wheelhouse.   I thought I'd trained her up sufficiently. Any time I asked her how things were going, if she needed help, she always told me things were great. Well, come to find out, she wasn't fully understanding the job, was asking other people if they could handle certain tasks for her, just wasn't meeting the learning curve.  As gently, but as professionally as I could, I let her go. I told her everyone liked her as a person, but, that the role just wasn't a match for her.  In my view, I tried to help her out when she was down and I did my best to prepare her. In her view, I'm an AH for letting her go and for not keeping her on the team.

j0eiosc5	My rottie is a great dog; I love him to pieces! He and my boyfriend on the other hand do not get along. He was against me getting him from the start and they just never clicked or bonded. He’s the only person my dog is indifferent to. Which okay whatever...it's my house, we don't live together, so it is what it is.  Like alot of couples we've had a tough time dealing with COVID stress and have been arguing more. Lately he's started getting louder and talks with his hands more when we fight. Last week an argument over something stupid got way louder than it needed to be. He raised his voice (and I'm not innocent here; I did as well) and lunged to reach past me to grab something he wanted to show me to prove his point. My dog reacted instantly and basically knocked him down and was growling in his face while my boyfriend screamed. I grabbed my dog right away and he backed down instantly. Needless to say, he left right after.  My bf is now demanding that the dog be rehomed and posting tiktok and IG to try and shame me into giving him up. He's told his mother that dog is dangerous and now she's in my texts trumpeting about how her son is in danger and she can't "believe" I'd keep an aggressive dog. I told him (and her) my dog isn't going anywhere and they can pound sand especially since he's never been like this with anyone else. BF posted another butthurt TikTok about this and I just can’t.

yl4vh	I (30M) and my wife (29F) decided to married after we known and date around 1 year. I would describe our relationship is pleasant, except for one stuff, if we argue about my friends.  In the early month of dating, i am so openly talk about anything with her, if there are anything she is not interested with, she would tell me directly.  One day, I told her about people i meet at the past, about their characteristic, and some of them i like and still befriends with me. She start to look a bit jealous since she know i could enjoy something she doesn't like or found it weird. (If you curious about the weird stuff, it's about memes, mental illness, video games, solo travelers, and religions view.) I try to explain it to her in hope she could understand it a bit and discuss it with me. But she always tell me it's weird and doesn't want to know since it's not in her interest. Because of that, i try other method to not make her jealous, which is to let her know and introduce her to some of my "weird" friends offline and online. It's going okay but she doesn't want to know other very close since they don't peak any interest to her. Until she know some of my friends is also a girls.  She start to keep asking me about them like their social media, what is my chats with them, or what all stuff i have been doing with them before. After i told her about them, she start throwing tantrums like hitting herself because she can't control her jealousy or keep blaming me and ask me to stop connecting with them. For the first time, i was arguing with her and start to reason which is too much connection or not. Usually, i would be the one who yield since i don't like to extend the conflict while she would ask for her immaturity and try to be better. But since then, everytime my other woman friend contacts me, the fight will start again. By again i mean almost every months, and with almost similar cases. But the problem still smaller than my love to her, and i still married her. One time after our marriage, there is this girl i met when study abroad who i like and confessed. Since there are lot of circumstances, we can't be a couple and we decide to be just a friend since we have a lot of similarities. We stay connected for almost 2 years. But, she tried to make me stop contacting her and force me to told her to not disturb our married life. I am against it at first, but she tried to reason me by told her friends, and they agree i was wrong. In the end, i messaged her to stop the connection and that quite make me disappointed since i lost one of a good friend.  And now, this problem quite develop me a trauma and make me don't want to tell her anything if there are any woman friend contacting. She told me i being an AH to not give her any information about my woman friend anymore.  TL;DR: I develop some trauma because of my wife limit my friendship with woman friend. Because of it, i don't wanna tell her anything more about them.

5b4bn1xc	So I matched with this guy on bumble and since the beginning of the conversation he's been asking me questions. At first they were basic like, "where you staying, do I live alone, what do you do for work, etc." Then he started like asking me how long I've been single for and how many people I've dated. I kinda felt uncomfortable with that and I asked him why he was asking that. He said he just wanted to know. I told him I felt uncomfortable being asked these questions esp to someone I literally started talking to 30 min ago. He called me out saying I was being difficult and that I'm the only one that's had a problem with answering those questions. Mind you I did try to make small talk about other things but he refused to respond and just kept asking me questions. It kinda felt like he was filtering through people to find someone that meets all his criteria or something. Anyway AITA for not wanting to respond to these personal questions?	1643129458.0	sci4n9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sci4n9/aita_for_refusing_to_answer_how_many_partners_ive/	AITA for refusing to answer "how many partners I've had" to some guy i lit just "connected" to on bumble?!
4hcr02ol	Started at a new company this month. It’s fully remote. They didn’t provide me a work phone or a way to make outbound calls on Teams (like I was able to at my previous company).   So when people email me saying an employee wants to ask me something over the phone, I email them instead of calling 90% of the time.  I told my manager I will minimize the use of my personal phone for work because I have a limited data plan and am not being compensated for using it for work calls.  I’ve only been here a little over a week. AITA? It seems everyone else has accepted this type of thing but I’m making a stand for it.

9rx6mjy9	 Okay the title might sound bad but idk. So I (36F) and my husband (34m) have a 16 year old daughter. We can call her Lola. Well Lola has not been doing well in school and her dad and I have really been trying to keep her on course with school by reaching out to teachers and making sure homework and assignments have been getting done. Lola fights and resists every little thing we try to do to help her stay on track. She skips school, gets bad grades and all in all would just rather fart around with her friends. I get it, typical teen stuff. Now the issue stands that my husband is a marijuana smoker. he uses it for his depression. We also live in a state where marijuana is heavily illegal. Lola is aware of his weed use and we had a nice long discussion about it and everything was cool. Until the day came that we found out that Lola had been caught skipping school and was shoplifting at the local store. We had had it and we took away all of her electronics. Phone, computer, tv. Everything. She screamed and cried and threw stuff and told us she hated us in her rage. She went to her room for the night and we didn’t hear anything from her until the next day. Things were quiet and I figured she was going to try and be better at school so she could get her stuff back. Only to our surprise a few days later we had several police knocking on our door saying they were here from a tip they had gotten from Lola’s school about her telling the counselor that her dad was smoking pot and abusing her. Yes he smokes pot but we do not abuse her. Well the police searched our house and found all of his stuff. He was arrested and had to spend 90 days in jail for drugs and child endangerment. The state took Lola away from me and sent her to live with my mom as I was deemed a neglectful mother. I was sent to court for the abuse allegations and I spent a weekend in jail for it and now I am on a 6 month probation and I have to see a counselor twice a week. I have been working my job 40-50 hours a week to maintain my bills while my husband is in jail as he lost his job and won’t have one when he gets out. I have been getting texts and phone calls from Lola saying she can’t wait until she can come back home with us and that loving with my mom has been a night mare. I finally told her that I would have to think about her coming back to live with us after what she did. She said she only did it because she was mad at us and that she didn’t mean for him to go to jail and that I was being unfair to her by not wanting her to come back home to live with us. She has not apologized and I’m torn.

j0gaqnxi	My girlfriend is pregnant, our baby is due in June. My girlfriend's second cousin is also pregnant and she's due around the same time as my girlfriend. Her cousin immigrated to Canada and she lives there now in a city called Quebec city. Her husband is from there and she's exchanged American citizenship for Canadian. My girlfriend is jealous of how much less costly having a baby is in Canada. Also that her cousin gets a year and a half of maternity leave paid almost her full salary for that time between the government and her employer. She's having the baby this summer and therefore won't need to return to work until January of 2024. My girlfriend will only get 12 weeks and those will not be paid. Also daycare in Quebec city is capped at $179.00 (Canadian) dollars a month. Where we live (Boston) daycare costs are 10x that. There's also government healthcare in Canada which we don't have so no medical bill.  Now I will point out why I said what I said to my girlfriend. Her second cousin isn't even bragging or talking about this. She made one comment about filling out the paperwork for her maternity leave and my girlfriend Googled how much she gets, and then also Googled the daycare prices. She's getting obsessed with how unfair it is. I agree it is unfair but there's no good going on about it. I wish my girlfriend could stay home longer like she wants but we can't afford it and we knew that before we started trying for kids. She's mad at me for saying she needs to stop comparing, last night she tried to sleep on the recliner downstairs but I took it because a bed is more comfortable for her.

4tkb2q66	I'm on mobile, so please forgive my formatting.  I (16f) have to go on a family vacation this March to Hawaii for my cousin's (15f) "quinceanera". For background relevance, we are Hispanic, and this cousin of mine decided not to have a quince because she wanted to go to Hawai'i. Now, I have no problem with her skipping the quince, because I skipped mine in favor for a car on my 16th birthday, but I have a MASSIVE problem with her choosing Hawaii. I already feel uncomfortable because of the illegal annexing and corporate takeover of native land, but the tourism industry makes it so much worse, including the fact that many hotels and resorts are built on actual Hawaiian burial grounds, which is insane! I don't want to contribute to this practice and I don't want to even set foot on the island if it's not for conservational efforts/purposes, but whenever I bring it up I'm immediately shut down by my dad (38m). Recently he got very angry with me and accused me of hating my cousin, which isn't true, but I do find her annoying and he knows it. I don't want to go just because we don't get along, I don't want to go because tourism is actively harming Hawaii. Not to mention the restriction of water usage in favor of resorts, the sexualization of the hula, and the COVID issue which greatly affects the homeless and poorer Hawaiian population. Am I the asshole?  TLDR: Cousin wants to go to Hawaii for her 15th birthday, I disagree because I think the tourism in Hawaii is harmful, and now my parents are mad at me.	1643132960.0	scjggs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjggs/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_hawaii/	AITA for not wanting to go to Hawaii?

d67m679q	I've posted here before but this story makes me a little uneasy so bear with me.  I (25M) run Dungeon's & Dragon's campaigns in my spare time to help pay off student loans.  Most of my players that pay come as strangers I've met online through a networking site.  One girl in our campaign stopped showing up without notice back in early December, and hasn't contacted anyone since then.  She's just someone I know online so I didn't think much of it, people cut contact with online friends for all kinds of reasons and this felt no different except she didn't cancel her weekly payments.  When I noticed this I refunded her the money, sent her a message through the platform letting her know she forgot to cancel and also asked if she was still considering being part of the group or not.  Emphasizing it's totally fine if she no longer wishes to join the session for any reason.  I didn't get any response, but weirdly enough I did see her in my recommended friends list on Facebook.  I clicked on her account and saw a lot of "RIP" posts and shared obituaries, heartfelt messages, and found out that she had actually passed away.  She (19F) was very young and a great person so this was very shocking to me as I wasn't expecting it.  I let the party know when we got together for our next session and one player wanted to take a session to go out and rescue her character.  (Last month in order to continue without her character I just had her kidnapped by some bandits and planned to bring her back if she ever rejoined, but that is no longer the case).  I told them if they wanted to go that route I'd allow it despite being a little uncomfortable about it, but when they found her I just had her thank them and leave.  The one player was mad that I wasn't keeping her as a party member but I let him know that seemed to be distasteful and left it at that.  He later messaged me calling me an asshole and said that it's so hard to continue her memory if we just remove her like this.

j0ige60u	I (19f) have been dating my boyfriend (19m-Justin) for a year and a half. Around 3 months ago, there was an incident at our university that caused Justin to get really into 'women's issues'. I thought this would be a good learning opportunity, but instead, Justin wouldn't let me do anything that's seen as 'feminine'.   He wouldn't let me clean or cook and has gotten upset that I dressed up to go out stating 'you're perfect how you are'. I know but we're going to a nice restaurant, I'm not gonna cruise up in joggers. His whole attitude was annoying the fuck out of me, and I mentioned it, but it hadn't really gotten through (tbf I hadn't been super persistent, but he knew my stance) but it came to a head last night.  Justin once again refused to let me make dinner, and absolutely butchered it. He didn't follow the recipe and it was disgusting. We tried to laugh about it, but I had enough and as I was cleaning up (which he complained about) I snapped back and said 'at least a misogynist would be me cook.'. Justin got super upset and hasn't been the same since. I told my friend who laughed but ultimately said it was douchey of me to say. I also asked my mum for advice who said I was totally wrong.

46aju27	Before I get into the details, some background is necessary. So I’ve known this friend (Gina) for 15ish years. About 6ish years ago, I met my current partner (Pete). At the time, Gina had just started dating one of her longtime friends (Brad). I was already somewhat interested in Pete; however, I was his mentor in a peer mentoring program through our law school.   One weekend Gina visits & we go out drinking. Pete is at the bar & I point him out to Gina & tell her that I’m interested but a little concerned about the mentor thing. Next thing I know, I turn around & see Gina aggressively grabbing & kissing Pete all over his face/mouth. I pull her aside & ask her wtf she’s doing. She says she’s just drunk & threw herself at him. Later, our DD drives us home. We stop to drop Pete off & he asks me for my number & to take me on a date. This infuriates Gina. She asks me why Pete would ask for my number & not hers. This was strange, since Gina was dating Brad.  Pete pursues me. We become best friends, eventually start dating & 5 years later he proposed.   Gina has a history of always having to be the center of male attention. On several occasions she’s brought up the sloppy kiss from 6 years ago. She’s made comments openly to friends (including me, Pete & Brad) that she “kissed Pete first.”  Last year, a group of us took a trip for Brad’s birthday. Gina gets drunk & brings up the kiss several times. At one point, I see Gina push Pete up against a wall & start trying to grind on him. Pete pushes her away & says “um wtf are you doing.” I clear my throat & they both see me. Gina runs over, gives me a huge hug & says “I love you so much.”   Everything was okay for months after that. However, on NYE we had a gathering of 7 at a friend’s house (all vaxxed). Gina keeps telling the group about her nipples & tells the guys to look away so she can flash the group. I’m already anxious by this point because she’s being overtly sexual. Gina makes a comment to the group that “if Brad wasn’t here I would date Pete.” Then, deja vu. Pete is sitting alone, straddling a bench. We all start moving into another room, but I turn around to look towards where Pete was. I see that in those 4 seconds, Gina plopped down, straddling the bench so that her back is towards his chest & her ass is 2 inches from his crotch. She says something, giggling & looking over her shoulder at him. He immediately gets up, nearly kicking her head in the process of swinging his leg over the bench. Gina sees that I’m watching, comes running up, hugs me & says “I love you so much.”  A few days later I ask Pete what Gina said to him on the bench. He says that he doesn’t even remember sitting on the bench & that he blacked out earlier that night. Pete hasn’t done anything to encourage Gina’s behavior (that I know of). I’ve directly called her out on it several times.   AITA for thinking that she has a thing for him?

4n5xnk61	My husband went shopping at a big box store that we go regularly.  He got gift cards for a local place that we eat at frequently.  They accidentally gave her an extra 2 cards worth about $100. The store did not catch it at the exit (they check receipts).  I called the store in front of him to see what to do, hoping they would say we could keep it.  The person who actually made the mistake got on the phone and asked that we return the extra cards.  Ok - shucks, but fine.  Husband is now upset and angry at me because he feels like he is not a good person.  I said that he is a good person and that we are supposed to lift each other up and that there will be times when I will want to take the easy, but not moral path, and they should tell me no.  To be honest, most times in my life I would have just enjoyed the mistake, but, at the moment, it seemed like the right thing to do. We are not extremely religious, but we do go to Church, so, knowing the mistake it would have been stealing.   I didn’t mean to be a holier than thou person - just wanted to do the right thing.

82qqht6o	So this is my first post here and English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes in advance.   So basically my parents, especially my mother disowned me for marrying my now husband.  The reason is that my husband didn’t study at a university, but he still has a nice job and he started taking evening classes and got his Bachelor degree  this year.  They were also upset that he hasn’t bought a house yet, even though he is almost 40, but before we met he wanted to buy a house but his uncle totally ripped him off and the court case took about 5 years and we could buy a small condo together at the end.  I just finished law school and my mother sobs whentalking to me saying she always dreamed I would marry a doctor or an attorney and how she is disappointed that I married someone so “basic”.  She is also very upset about the fact that he was married once before we met, but he was divorced for 4 years when we met. He doesn’t like to talk about his ex-wife and he just told me that it didn’t work out and that this chapter is closed and that he doesn’t like talking about his previous marriage.  Through a mutual friend I heard that his ex-wife cheated on him with his friend who was his best man at the wedding, and that he found them in bed when he came early from work unexpected.   My dad tells me that he can see how much my husband loves me but that he is disappointed that my husband doesn’t show any wealth and he (my dad) is not sure how he will take care of me.   My mom even told me she is ashamed of telling people that I am married to my husband because there is nothing to brag about when she is talking about him.   My aunts and cousins are mostly on my side and love him very much, but some of them tell me that the most important thing in a marriage is the parents blessing and if I don’t have it, my marriage is doomed.  This really breaks my heart because I love my parents but I also love my husband. He is so loving and caring and he saved up all his money to rent out a wedding hall I once mentioned because we went to a wedding there and he overheard how much I liked it there. He even designed my engagement ring like a flower because I love flowers. We are together for almost seven years now and we haven’t even fought once because he is the most loving and caring person I have ever met.   But than also my mother always tells me how difficult it was for her to breastfeed me because she was only 16 and her parents forced her to marry early, and she still pushed though and that I am really ungrateful. It really hurts my heart, and I can’t help but think that maybe I should have pushed my love for him aside and listened to my parents…. They always tell me that they just want what’s best for me.

74ok2e03	On Friday the 21st I was hanging around one of those clubs, looking for men to have sex with. I found one man among the many who embodied everything I was looking for. I approached him and explained exactly what it was I wanted to do with him, he didn't reciprocate those wants of mine but I had no hard feelings against him. The man was quite a good fellow, I ended up talking with him for a few minutes then I bid him farewell, hoping to meet him again.  Only 2 days later, on Sunday the 23rd, I spotted him on the sidewalk with another man. The man he was with was very strong, they may have been lovers but I'm not sure. I wanted to greet them so I ran towards them and said "Hey f\*ggot!" (I didn't say 'f\*ggots' because I wasn't sure if the other man was gay and I didn't want to insult his sexuality). Suddenly the strong man he was with grabbed me and slammed my body into the sidewalk. The two of them left, leaving me on the ground in pain.  I just don't know what I did to deserve that. Maybe the strong guy thought I was calling him gay but I feel as though he could've just explained how he was a heterosexual, instead of slamming me into the hard ground. Hopefully you guys can explain if I'm missing something or if that dude was just off his rocker.	1643136278.0	sckqhs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckqhs/aita_for_calling_a_gay_man_the_fslur/	AITA for calling a gay man the f-slur?
za5cr	So my (m35) fiance (f32) and I were watching a show where it contained a cliched storyline of a boss cheating with his hot young female secretary. She randomly brings up that if I could never hire a hot secretary. Now it just so happened that my team at work was currently interviewing for an administrative assistant and I had meet some of the candidates as part of the interview process. They happened to be predominantly young women (it was an entry level position after all). I brought this up to her and stated that what does it matter what they look like, if they are qualified and can do the job it shouldn't matter what gender/ level of attractiveness they are. She said that of course I would say that, just to have some eye candy in the office. We started arguing because I did not appreciate the implication that myself of my coworkers would turn an important hiring decision into a "hot or not" contest. I then accused her of being not different than people who didn't hire me  or discriminated me based on my name (I'm Latino and this did come up in one of my first jobs out of college). Now we're pissed at each other and I don't want to apologize as I don't feel I'm in the wrong.	1643137004.0	scl0fs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl0fs/aita_for_insisting_that_a_persons_looks_shouldnt/	AITA for insisting that a person's looks shouldn't have anything to do with hiring decisions?
i4qjdxfp	Long time lurker, first time poster. To give some context, I’m 23F and recently started casually dating a friend (23M). We’re taking it slow and are not in a relationship yet (important to this story).  My job is incredibly hectic at the moment, with an average work day of 16+hrs on weekdays and 8+ hrs over the weekend. I also have to frequently go on business trips which makes my schedule erratic.   He is getting his masters degree in another State (Final sem) and in his own words is too free and bored most days. Even when we have discussions regarding how he can use his time, since he wants to be more productive and asks for my inputs, he ends up procrastinating all his work to chill with friends. Which obviously I don’t particularly care about or comment on since it’s none of my business how he spends his personal time.  The issue is that sometimes I want to talk at the end of the day, or on weekends since weekdays days I barely get time to eat much less talk properly. However he rarely talks to me on weekends since he wakes up hungover in the evening and goes gaming or something with the guys, and on weekdays by the time he replies at night I’ve gone to bed.  I kinda feel bad about it, but don’t want to bring it up for fear of being a hypocrite (since I can’t expect time from someone when I cant do the same) or sounding judgmental. So I just bottle stuff up (I’m extremely non confrontational by nature) and text normally.  Here’s where I might be the AH - He checked on me today and asked if I was mad at him about anything. I said I was mad before but it wasn’t a big deal and I’d gotten over it. He laughed and changed the subject since it was very plausible given my short tempered nature.  My friends say I should’ve told him directly what was bothering me instead of bottling it up, but I kindof feel like it’s not my place to say anything or sound clingy or hypocritical. Am I the AH?	1643137070.0	scl1dt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl1dt/aita_for_bottling_my_feelings_and_not_telling_my/	AITA for bottling my feelings and not telling my BF I’m hurt
7gvvbl3r	 I (18) moved back in after dropping out of uni, I unintentionally came out to my mum and sister (17).   My sister uses this to blurt out how I’m a horrible sibling and didn’t support her and that it was all about me. I am confused because I genuinely was ill for most of my adolescence like intrusive thoughts, panic attacks, s*** h***so I probably wasn’t fully there. I also really was trying to not off myself. I mentioned this and she goes tell me your triggers so I can make you have more panic attacks.  Yet my mum rushes to her defence saying that in fact my sister has a big heart and does this before she cares about me. I also have quite an androgynous style and my sister was like I will like you if you grow your hair, wear bras, act more feminine but I said I want to be happy and feel happier in these clothes but all I get are scoffs. My sister rants about how I’m a laughing stock in the community and that I deserved to be bullied and would fit in if I wasn’t a narcissist. She also goes on to say if I was you I would commit s****** for the shame.  Tbh all I want is to be seen and understood for myself and I realised I was never going to get that I was cold in the household and rather vacant.  So one hand I do see me being an arsehole but the other hand it was self preservation. My mum and sister are confusing me.	1643136938.0	sckzkf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckzkf/aita_for_being_selfish_and_not_being_there_for_my/	AITA FOR BEING SELFISH AND NOT BEING THERE FOR MY FAMILY
fgn2zih1	I(26M) have been dating my gf(25F) for over a year. We have a good relationship & we care for each other a lot.  When we started dating, I was very skinny & she was quite fit physically, but over the past year I've worked on myself & I'm now v fit. My gf on the other hand, has gained a lot of weight & is now on the chubbier side. I don't mind her being chubby at all, I still love her the way I loved her before & she's still a very beautiful and attractive person.  She is growing uncomfortable with her body. I often find her complaining about her weight and how she'd like to be skinny again. She often asks me if I'm still attracted to her. I have always reassured her that I'm still in love with her and I love her body the way I did before, but she has reached a point where she has stopped posting pictures of herself on social media. I feel very sorry for her, I often encourage her to dress up and we go on dates and I take a lot of pictures of her to make her feel better and I edit them to make them aesthetic but she never likes them enough. I've encouraged her to work out or follow a diet but I've never been pushy about it because I don't want to give her the wrong idea that I'm saying it because i think she's fat, I also tried explaining to her how being fit doesn't always translate to being skinny  Today, she decided she had it enough and she wants to be healthy and would start by fixing her diet. She ordered grocery online, and ironically they sent a complementary pack of cookies. My gf loves cookies, she binges on them when they're around. We laughed about it and she said "please take them with you or I'll eat all of them in a go". She was being a cute where she pretended to want the cookies and held close to her and then would be like, "no, no, take them away from me" for a few times, until she finally said okay take them with you. I didn't force her to give them to me, I said okay and put them in my bag cause I thought that's what she wanted.  Later this evening when I came back to my place, I was on a phone call with my friend (F26) & I started eating a couple of cookies. My friend asked what I'm eating and I told her it was cookies. She said she thought I didn't like sweets, I told her what happened earlier. My friend responded by saying, "are you serious?"  My friend is pretty offended that I took the cookies home with me when I knew that my girlfriend liked them so much. She argued that I should try and make her comfortable with her body and teach her to love herself and not 'control' what she eats. In fact I have always been supportive and never commented on what she ate, and I believe it's her choice in the end but my friend said that it wasn't enough and that i should be trying harder to promote body positivity and that it's a long journey & I'm being an asshole by enabling my gf in putting herself through a painful experience to fit unrealistic beauty standards.    So guys, AITA?	1643137334.0	scl540	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl540/aita_for_controlling_what_my_gf_eats/	AITA for 'controlling' what my gf eats?
hplw9f4f	Hi, so me (31) and my wife (28) both African Americans moved into our house 2 weeks ago, we have 2 gay neighbors, the first one is nice and a pretty chill guy, the second one completely ignored us until last week, we will call him X.   So my wife let our dog on their lawn to play(She didn't want to mess up our grass because our dog likes to dig) than X came out and start yelling at her and called her the n word(hard r) and threatened to shoot her so her and the dog came in. The next day he started dumping garbage bags onto our lawn so later we let our dog shit all over his lawn, when he came out he started yelling at us and we called him a (slur for gay people) he got furious and got a gun out so we quickly left.   That night we heard a banging on our window so we came down and saw him with a hammer trying to break the window, we got scared and went back to sleep, the next day our tv was gone and the window was shattered.   We called the police and they said they couldn't do anything, were getting a camera incase he comes back.   Are we the assholes?	1643137653.0	scl9ia	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl9ia/aita_neighborh_called_as_n_word_so_we_called_him/	AITA: neighborh called as n word so we called him (slur)
60c4u5kk	I was in high school and this ran pretty much through the 5 years I was there. Everyday before school, me and my friends would walk past a flat building that had a very large woman in a window on the second floor.   This woman was terrifying to pretty much everyone in my school. She was always motionless in the window, without fail. We imagined she was waiting for us, she was almost a folk story at school. When we got to her house, we would all run past laughing and screaming. Every. Single. Day.   I'm now in my thirties and, thanks to my wife, I now know who this woman was (sadly died recently, hence the topic coming up) and what happened to her. She and her husband were involved in a very bad traffic accident, leaving this woman unable to walk, speak, or move at all independently and Lord knows what else. Her husband immediately put this woman into assisted living and moved on with his life. She had a care worker visit her each day and they would leave her at the window so she at least had a view...of prick kids like me mocking her.     My wife knows what happened because she knows the woman's husband, as do I, as does everyone. He is a locally known character and is doing pretty well for himself. He has a new wife and that happened almost instantly. He never visited his ex wife.   I cannot imagine her sadness and suffering. I have never wanted to change something I did so much. I feel unbelievable anger when I see this man, going about his daily as if everything is fine. I know I'm more than likely passing the anger I have towards myself onto him, too.   I want to confront him. I have daydreams about HIM in a window forever. I feel like he will say "I may have abandoned her, but I didn't mock her everyday from then on"    I think it's pretty safe to say IATA, but my wife and friends are saying I am overreacting and need to let it go. I feel like I need someone to call me out.	1643137683.0	scl9xg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl9xg/aita_for_bullying_a_disabled_woman_who_was/	AITA for bullying a disabled woman who was abandoned by her husband as a kid?
4vgxh8jy	Title sounds very bad but please hear me out before making judgement. On mobile so sorry for formatting.    This happened a few days ago and I’m just struggling internally about this so I thought it would be nice to get some outside opinion. I will accept any judgment.   I (28F) was scrolling through tik tok and came across a video of someone’s ring camera. Basically it was showing her neighbor stealing her stuff and trespassing and etc. What caught my eye was that she had named the camera her home address - house number and street name only. Small world because I live on that exact street and idk it was just funny and a little cool the algorithm brought me to someone so close.   I noticed she was currently going live on her profile so I joined in and saw that she was talking about the neighbor. I posted a comment to the live saying :   “Omg do you still live on *street name* (did NOT use house number) because I think we’re neighbors! I’ll come help you whoop her ass LOL!”   Literally was just trying to be friendly and funny and be like “yay! Girl power!”   Her immediate response: “I don’t know who the fuck *my handle* is but you can get the fuck off my live right now. Trying to fucking dox someone are you serious? Gtfo”   And proceeded to block me and kick me off the live before I could reply. I had no idea what doxxing was so I looked it up and was so shocked because I would never try to do that. I know the internet moves fast and it’s hard to learn the etiquette but I mean even without knowing the term I would never try to do that.   SHE posted her full address and SHE had several posts of different ring videos so it wasn’t just the one. AITA for what I said? Moving forward I’m just going to mind my business so it doesn’t happen again but this incident just won’t leave my mind for some reason.

29v0v4lw	I’m currently in a semi-long distance relationship. We live about an hour apart, and only get to see each other on weekends (ie Saturday and Sunday). We usually meet up on Saturday and leave at around noon-1 on sunday. The problem is I have an extremely low social battery, and I need a lot of personal time. So sometimes I’ll ask her if we could just do our own things separately for a while. We’ve done it and it has worked for the most part, but I always feel bad or that I’m neglecting her in some way. We’ve talked about it and have been trying to work on it, but she has told me that she feels kind of sad that I get so tired of her, which isn’t true. I feel like I’m just being an asshole, since I’ve got the whole week to myself (ignoring school and work), but when I see her, it only takes a few hours or a day until I’m burnt out for a bit. Is this just me being selfish?	1643138960.0	sclr68	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sclr68/aita_for_wanting_alone_time_from_my_partner/	AITA for wanting alone time from my partner?
j0md626k	 English isn’t my first language so please bear with me.  I have been dating my GF (both 28) for 5.5 years. When I met her she was around 60 kg, I liked her body but found her thighs a little bit too thick, though she was very muscular and I never said anything. During the pandemic she gained 4-5 kg due to the fact that she had to work more (she’s a doctor) and didn’t have the time and energy to work out as much as before. I tried mentioning this fact to her several times but she didn’t seem to care enough to start a diet. She looked rather offended and claimed that she would do it eventually when she was in a better place mentally. That moment never came.   Eventually I asked one of my friends who is a dietitian for advice on weight loss and told her what he told me. She was mad. She told me she knows how to lose weight, it’s not rocket science and she has been working out her whole life while I haven’t so she knows better. She also reminded me of her disordered eating in Highschool and cried a lot that day. I told her that we can go to a dietitian together and that unfortunately I don’t find her “new” body attractive and I also want her to be healthy, although she claims that she is in a normal weigh for her height (around 167 cm I think). I think it should be a priority to make sure we stay attractive for our partner, especially at a young age. She asked me what I would do if she was pregnant or had given birth, but that is a different situation.   The problem now is that since our fight not only does she not act as warmly as she used to, but she has also stopped eating. We used to enjoy eating dessert or takeout together sometimes but now she always claims that she’s not hungry, has already eaten etc. When I asked her to stop thinking about our fight and delete my words from her mind, she said “You can’t control what I think, you can only control what you say. Once the words leave your mouth you no longer have control over what I do with them.” I think it’s pathological not being able to admit that you have gained weight and I find her reaction extreme. I fear that I have created a monster. This isn’t Highschool anymore and there is no need to get triggered by a simple suggestion. I felt that she dismissed my wishes when she didn’t put effort into losing weight but now I’m afraid she might lose the weight in an unhealthy weight. My mother agrees with me that I have the right to comment on my partners body. So AITA for asking my gf to lose some weight?	1643139159.0	sclu0w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sclu0w/aita_for_asking_my_girlfriend_to_lose_weight/	AITA for asking my girlfriend to lose weight?
13kuzz	So I've been with this girl a few months and then we broke up and through trauma in our lives we seemed to rekindle our feelings again. Last week her family had a traumatic experience which she was distraught about and rightfully so. Her dad pulled a gun on her brother for saying he can't yell at his kids and to bring any issues to him and he got pissed about it. Anyways we got past that fairly well until a few days back when she began mentioning talking to a guy she use to have a crush on but he's married now and she said she had no feelings of affection for him anymore. So me trying not to let past insecurities cause me the relationship decided to trust her and not think anything of it. Unfortunately as time went on we talked less and less and when we did it was about him or another guy friend. Then a day or two after they began talking she said we needed to go on a break because the family drama and stress in her life was way too much for her to handle so I agreed and she reassured me she wasn't doing it to hook up with anyone but just to get back into the right mindset which I agree she needed. So as time went on we barely spoke and something was off so I asked her what kinda break was this and she said it was a break up not really a break and she phrased it poorly. So I said "okay, I saw this coming I suppose so I'll sort everything out later. Take care of you and your kids and yourself". 4 hours later after work is over I change my relationship status to single and she blocks me on just about everything and says I used her and that I couldn't get rid of her fast enough. I explained it took me hours to do that and she had broken up with me not vice versa but she is adamant that I'm an asshole. I'll let you guys be the judge though.	1643139242.0	sclv3u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sclv3u/aita_pretty_sure_im_not_this_time_around/	AITA Pretty sure I'm not this time around 🤷🏻‍♂️
bqrlzdrh	Hi I'm a 15 year male. So my mother abuosulte loves my older brother (17 Male). He recently broke his phone and the first thing she does to go out and buy him a brand new Samsung galaxy s21 ultra. You should know it's a very expensive phone around 1200$ I believe. So to get to the story. I broke my phone around 4 months ago and have had a shitty phone wich can barely run anything and is very slow ever since I broke it. Well when I saw what she bought for my brother I immediately went to my cash savings and bought myslef a Samsung galaxy s9 for around 800$. (Just to clarify I took a summer job wich I got paid around 1500$ for so I worked for all my money). Well when my mother saw the phone she went crazy and screamed at me saying how I dared to touch the money without her knowing and that I forever broke her trust and she now refuses to speak with me. So am I the asshole?   I'm a 15 year old kid who dosnt have english and their first language so obviously wont be perfect english, but feel free to help me out and correct me.

5c3924j0	Alright, so I saw this girl the other day and I thought: “Damn. That’s a nice backpack right there. I wonder where she got it from?” I waited until lunch to ask her and when I did ask her where she got it from, it was really weird. She was clutching her backpack in what looked like fear and uncanniness while saying she didn’t know. But the way she said it was like it was super awkward and jarring. I felt like I scared her or something and I feel like maybe I made a wrong move. Did she think I was flirting? Did she think I was sexist..somehow? It has been clinging to my head all day and I have to know if what I did really was unnerving.  That begs the question.

mrhgyy4	I (18F) have not been feeling safe in the house lately. English is not my first language but it's my best and I love speaking English more than my mothertone. But my dad (51M) absolutely hates it. He screamed at me for the 4th time this week about me talking English.  I also game with a lot of friends and ebcause of the wifi in my room being bad I game downstairs, as well as doing my schoolwork there. I curse when i game, I get frustrated so I curse. But even a simple thing as Jesus Christ pisses him off and he starts screaming when he hears it, even though he swears worse than me.  I have a younger sister (16F), who is the golden child. She doesn't know a single word English even though she wants to be a teacher, works, and trains. She's overweight so she is required to do so. I don't have time to work with my education but my dad still insists I get a job in the only free day I have.  Today he screamed at me during dinner whilst I was telling him about my day. About how annoyed I was with how it went and how I want some feedback and security at school. He interupted me and shouted that he doesn't care. I said something in English and that's when it started. He screamed that he doesn't care and he doesn't want to hear it.  My dad also refuses to acknowledge that the LGBT community exists. I'm a transguy (still in a female body, hence the F at the start) and I can't tell my dad anything relevant about that. I also got stitched on my head so I've been in pain for the past 5 days.  After that I sat in silence when he happily went to ask my sister how her day was. I took a bath and cried because I've felt unloved for a while in the house but I still love my family.  The thought of running away to my boyfriend's house crossed my mind at least 3 times this week only and I'm also feeling unsafe now. I'm scared of facing him or talking to him.  Home no longer feels like home and i dread coming here every day from school. But I still love my family, you know. I feel like I need to.  Please tell me if I'd be TA for running away from the house.	1643139951.0	scm4i7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scm4i7/aita_for_leaving_my_dads_house_because_im_not/	AITA for leaving my dad's house because I'm not feeling safe

That is my outside perspective.”  She responded: “You're right, I know their relationship is none of my business.

7prz5tjr	The players are me (34F), my husband (33M), my mother(71F) and my cousin (49M) also playing a bit part is our 8 week old baby.  My mother decided she needed to renovate, it started with the kitchen countertops, then a new back splash, then she decided she was tired of the hardwood floor (there was some damage from sun and water it did need to be done) and this has turned from the kitchen only, to include the bedrooms and finally redoing the entire main floor. All the way to our front door landing which ment the removal of several false walls where doorways used to be, the demo of a glass decorative wall in the hall way, pulling up the entire floor all the way to the living room and the partial demo of our wall that separates her space from ours. She did it herself with some help from my husband.  She told husband she needed a hand moving the furniture on monday from the living room into the bedrooms and then move them back as they did the floors. She recruited my cousin to help. She also told me he needed to take the baseboards off the opposite wall.  So last night Husband got home, we connected about our day, heard that the baby was freaking out, I was at my wits end trying to console her and stepped in. It was time to make dinner for us (I make dinner for everyone including mom)I go into our living room halfway through and husband is asleep on the couch, baby too. I can hear noise downstairs and I look out to see cousin has arrived and is getting started on moving the furniture. I go down and ask if he wants a plate, he declines. Mom shoots me a nasty look. I finish up dinner around 6:30 and wake him up to take a plate down to mom, while I dish up and eat, after I take this hands-free opportunity to grab the lifter and pull off the baseboards that were mentioned previously.   I go to return the lifter and here's where the fight starts, mom walks by and says "tell husband thank you for the help in moving the furniture/s" and I retort back with why didn't you tell him when cousin arrived or mention something when he brought down food. She says she shouldn't have to say anything it should just get done. I take off back upstairs, I take the baby and tell him it would be a good idea to head downstairs and take care of business, more yelling from both, He comes back up and is snappy with me saying how nice to go down to help only to be yelled at and he doesn't want to participate with her nasty attitude. I convince him to go back down and work with cousin. We argue about who is doing what, and cousin jumps in to take mom's side. "He knew he had to help and didn't say anything" I replied with she didn't say anything about time frames or expectations when you arrived it was assumed, not communicated to the right person and not followed up on. She said if we don't like it we can leave. (Her usual shut down phrase).

3qtz4tgc	In the Fall of 2021, after taking my first year online, I (19m) began physically taking my first semester for aviation university as a sophomore. I'm sharing my dorm with one roommate (20m) while living in a suite with two other suitemates. Initially, I was happy to share a dorm with another person and thought we would get along over time. However, I feel like he's been ruining my college experience.  My roommate is awkward and a bit anti-social. We've not been able to get along throughout the year due to numerous events and conflicts.  * He used to tell me to go shower and other stuff as if he was a parent. * He makes a couple of bad jokes, which I ignore, but he went a little too far a couple of times. One time, he told me a joke related to the Holocaust despite being Jewish himself. * He makes loud breathing noises while he's sleeping, which doesn't allow me to sleep without having something to deafen the noise. Sometimes, he abruptly wakes me up in the middle of the night because he has panic attacks. * He tells me to wear headphones while I'm using my laptop. I wouldn't have a problem with this if it weren't because he is wearing earphones himself, and I have the audio to my computer at a low volume. And if I don't wear headphones after he tells me, he would either yell at me or threaten to call the RA. * Whenever I try to talk and argue with him about a topic, he ignores me while using his headphones. * He has these calls, which probably involve a psychiatrist and the Patient Confidentiality: this means he has the right to keep their records private and represents physicians' and medical professionals' moral and legal obligations in handling patients' sensitive medical and personal information. Whenever he had these calls, my roommate would always lock the dorm room to have privacy. And when I enter the room while he has these calls, my roommate tells me to leave the room and wait for a certain amount of time until he's finished. At first, I was okay with this since I always respect people's privacy, but it was beginning to annoy me over time.  I'm a pretty temperamental person and can get heated a few times, so it would tick me off a bit whenever he does something out of the blue. Anything that he would make would cause me to lose my mind. This semester I'm trying not to lose my temper so quickly, and I try to ignore my roommate at all times. I've wanted to talk to the RA about it, but I think everything listed will probably make them go on my roommate's side. I've also been feeling guilty since I believe that the situations with my roommate are not worth it, and I might be making a fuss over nothing.  So, am I the asshole?	1643140191.0	scm7nm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scm7nm/aita_for_thinking_my_roommate_is_entitled/	AITA for thinking my roommate is entitled?
3b0qcbyh	Ok wait I know the title might warrant an obvious verdict but hear me out.   Look, I’m not immune or cold to financial struggles people are having due to the pandemic. I work retail, I have some understanding of financial stressors. However, this customer- IMO- lost it for no reason.   Customer- who we will call Dan- comes into the place I work and asks me to do something. I clarify on the original set of instructions for the task and go to work. Dan then changes the set of instructions twice while I’m in the middle of working on the original set of instructions, causing us to waste materials (I.E. more than fifty cents of materials). Dan is also on the phone with someone and, from what they are saying, clearly doesn’t know what they’re doing.   I had quoted Dan a price on an item that was fifty cents more than what Dan needed, because initially, I thought Dan needed it. When I realized Dan didn’t needed it, I decided I’d charge it anyways. It was a small difference in price and I figured that Dan had already wasted more than that in our materials. I thought Dan would be self-aware of this and just let it go.   Dan didn’t, and started trying to cause a scene in the middle of the store. My boss has a temper and the last thing I wanted was for them to get involved, so I just started feeding Dan BS until they left the store.   Look, if it’s five dollars higher, fine, I’m happy to apologize and charge it correctly. I’m not seeing anything out of that fifty cents; I don’t benefit from charging that. I just feel like Dan overreacted, but am I the asshole?	1643140356.0	scm9td	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scm9td/aita_for_charging_a_customer_fifty_cents_over/	AITA for charging a customer fifty cents over what I probably “needed” to charge them for, even though I had a reason?
j0mjeeuw	(Throw away bc I've had enough family drama)  So my (26F)  wedding is going to be happening next month and I want as many people there that can be there. All partners and children are welcome, im giving single guests a +1. However the problem comes with my older brother (27M), he got engaged to his fiance (25M) and they have an adopted son (6M), they moved country in 2018, they did have plans to come and visit the whole family in 2020 but that obviously didn't happen.  At first, I wasn't bothered but I kept getting comments, like my older sister (30F) excited to see her nephew, my parents “cant wait to see their grandbaby” (he's the first and currently only grandchild, tho me and my partner are trying, so hopefully we have the first biological one) and it's just getting annoying. People are still excited about my wedding but when one person mentions the fact that we will get to see my nephew everyone gets excited and starts talking to him.  I called my brother and asked if he could leave my nephew at home, he was confused so I explained why, he then audible got upset, saying that he can't leave a 6-year-old on his own, I told him that his finance can stay and look after him (i will be honest I've never liked his fiance and almost didn't invite him anyway) my brother was silent for a while and then said that if his family wasn't welcome he just won't come. I told him he didn't have to do that, then he started asking if I didn't want my nephew there because he was mixed or because he was adopted because he couldn't understand why I was doing this. I get offended that he was insinuating I was racist and hung up.  Word got out that I don't want my nephew there and I've been getting some pretty shitty messages and my other brother and his wife even pulled out of my wedding, I didn't think people would react like this and it has me questioning myself, I just want this one day that is supposed to be perfect and about me and my future husband, to actually be about me and not have my guests fawning over my nephew the whole time.

j0mxuybg	I’m torn. Mother of a 21 year old young man. Not complaining but he can’t hold down a job. There is a question of schizoaffective disorder. Won’t comply with doctor’s recommendations. At this point he’s moved out, living with his significant other. He calls me almost every day and asks for money. I offered to take him to a food pantry but he refused. He’s been off his meds about 4 months and I don’t honestly know if he needs them. I offered him $50 a week to shovel my driveway. Didn’t do it once. I’m 65 years old and would like to know if I’m the asshole if I cut him off financially.

j0msbggw	I (33M) have been with my wife (36F) for eight years. My wife makes enough money so I do not have to work and when we bought a house 3 years ago. We decided that I would stay home and renovate (I'm an engineer) it instead of hiring a company. So I have not been in the workforce for three years and and have been fixing up the old house.. It was a huge project and since we were living there I had to do one room at a time. While the two story house is almost done but the basement still need to be finished.   Well last month my wife sister, Alex for the last couple years can barely keep a roof over her head. My wife use to give Alex money to help but I put my foot down about it since she would come back ever month asking for more. Alex would get a couple thousand at a time. Anyways Alex has a four your old son, Ben and we started to watch the kid on the weekends. This was fine we would both be home and watching one kid wasn't too hard. The problem started when the kid would get dropped off on the weekday. Ben is way to young to be around all the tools so I really couldn't watch him and work. So no work would get done. Then Ben started to be dropped off more and more. To the point that we have had him for three weeks and I can't get in contact with Alex.  Today I told me wife I want to hire a nanny for Alex. She said no, I told her that I can't get anything done because I have to watch Ben and pointed out we could afford it. She told me that I should be able to watch a kid and get the work done. This started an argument and by the end of it I told my wife I should call the police because Alex has abandoned her kid. With my wife coming back with this isn't my money and we wouldn't have this problem if I just let her give money to her sister.	1643141209.0	scmljs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmljs/aita_for_wanting_to_hire_a_nanny/	AITA for wanting to hire a nanny?
cpk9q09k	For backstory, I am what you call an outsider left politically. My dad is a conservative. He also barely graduated high school and had a reading level of the 4 grade. I am in my second year of college for pre-medicine and graduated as a Valid Victorian from high school. After high school I went by myself on a road trip to see the US (this will come in handy later). My dad was a truck driver and has driven throughout the US.   Here’s the story.  There was a Reddit post in like r/askreddit that said something to the tune of “if you went back to the 1950s what would you do?” And I told my dad about this saying that “I wouldn’t be able to go to college for pre-med and I would have probably been a housewife already with a baby. As well as in the 50s segregation was still a thing so I wouldn’t be friends with some of the people I’m friends with now. If you really think about it we came a long way with womens rights and racism.”   My dad chimed in saying, “racism is still bad as it was back in the 50’s except it’s white people being discriminated against.” And I looked at him and said, “give me an example.” I said this so that he has evidence to support his statement. My dad then said, “if you just go outside and look around, it’s everywhere.” I asked if he could give me a specific example. He then slammed the dining room chair into the table and yelled at me, “it’s everywhere if you just fucking look.” Now keep in mind I haven’t raised my voice and I’ve kept a neutral tone with him. But when he did that I looked at him with a pissed off face because he yelled at me. My dad then yelled, “you’re trying to talked educated.” And I said, “because I am” and I walked away.   I don’t agree with my dad. However, he constantly thinks that I don’t know the world and that I am a sheltered person that doesn’t know anything. He probably thinks this because I am his daughter and he can only see me as a little girl.	1643141558.0	scmqfa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmqfa/aita_for_educationally_arguing_with_my_dad/	AITA For Educationally Arguing With My Dad?
egd9w5a2	I work from home full-time. We have a 10-month-old together and I have two daughters from my ex-husband.   My boyfriend doesn’t work so we don’t have to put the baby in childcare. I make enough money to support the family comfortably, but not also daycare unless he went back to work to help financially.    Here’s the issue: I believe he should watch the baby during my 40-hour salaried work week and then outside of my work hours we should split childcare and all other responsibilities 50-50. I specify that I’m salaried because some days are shorter/longer than others.   My boyfriend disagrees. He believes any time he watches the baby should be taken away from his hours. For example, I take my daughter to school and pick them up on my custody days. If the baby stays with him, then those hours are taken away from the time I can work without watching the baby.   Am I the ahole for thinking this is unfair and he is just being lazy/taking advantage of me being work from home and salaried?	1643141075.0	scmjo5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmjo5/aita_i_work_from_home_my_boyfriend_is_a_sahd_who/	AITA I work from home, my boyfriend is a SAHD.

j0mb9s52	Throwaway account. This happened to me a few years ago and I feel raw about it.  I (male) was harshly bullied during elementary school. 6 years of being excluded, used and having zero friends because I was fat and different from other kids. One of my bullies was this very beautiful and energetic girl who dumped me like I was nothing. I had enough at 6th grade and switched schools were things got better.  Fast forward to mid 8th Grade. That exact same girl moved to my school to my class. I still haven't forgotten what happened in the past and had a lot of bitterness still there. She seemed to act like she didn't remember what she and my former classmates did to me, but this she was nice to me. I was fine with that. I didn't talked to her that much, but she never bullied me again.  On the first half of 2020, she had to quit school for a while for unknown reasons. One month later, she revealed she was diagnosed with cancer. Everyone was sad and stick to her side. I voiced why condolences and wished her to get better.  But what no one knew is that in reality I thought she deserved it. After all the bullying I was put through, I wanted everyone who did that to me to pay for it. This was her penalty, I thought. She caused me pain and now she would feel pain. Just as worse. At the time, I only told that to my mom and she said I shouldn't think like that. I didn't listened.  As treatment progressed, everyone was cheering for her. She even had to amputate one of her legs during the last stages of it. Everyone was sending support, but I was secretly and morbidly enjoying all of her suffering.   That lasted until last January, when she passed away. The whole school was sad. And I felt like a monster. It took a death for me to realize the gravity of my thoughts. Yes, she bullied me. But no one deserves death, especially someone this young.   I never told anyone about what I felt. I expect them to say "you're a monster", "you're sick in the head" or "you're spoiled". Yes, I feel like I'm a monster for that and I regret my thoughts everyday.   I expect this post to be controversial, so that's why I'm using a throaway account.

j0mzx4kw	I’m a 14 year old male.  He and his family used to life far away, but in August, they moved to a house about 5 minutes from ours.  We saw them about 2-3 times since they moved. But my mom and dad had to go out of town for a week, and wanted me to stay with my cousin.  He’s fucking creepy as hell. First, let’s start with his appearance. He’s 6 ft 3, he’s white, has an extremely hairy beard and mustache, has tattoos all over his face and arms, and has a nose ring. On top of mature clothing.  He looks like a rebel. Who needs that many tattoos, and a fucking nose ring? Not to mention his facial hair is extremely hairy.  He wears his shoes on inside of the house, he spits on the ground, he doesn’t have his shirt on all the time, he spills everywhere, he stands on furniture, he’s smelly (not like he hasn’t taken a shower, he has certain odors), he drinks full sodas out of bottles making him look drunk as hell.  He invited his boyfriend over (his boyfriend is 35), and they kiss every goddamn second. The only thing that’s weird is he dates a 35 year old. I get even more creeped out by his boyfriend.  His boyfriend asked me if I wanted to squeeze his dick. And I’m 14. And no, I don’t look 18 at all. I very much look 12-15.   He offered to take me out, and on the way, he got a text message, and then stopped by a strip club, and just left me there for 45 minutes.  That was the last straw. I refuse to go anywhere with him, and I’m dreading any time I spend with him.  He looks like a rebel and he is a rebel. And I’m creeped af by him.  AITA though because he’s still my cousin?	1643142003.0	scmwe2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmwe2/aita_for_being_creeped_out_by_my_cousin_18_m/	AITA for being creeped out by my cousin (18 M.)
3ie29ggj	For context I’m 21F and she’s 27F. A few months ago my friend was very depressed and needing something to get her out of the house so I got her a job at the company that I’ve been working at for upwards of 5 years. We are very close and have worked together previously so I never thought bringing her into that environment would cause any problems between us. I trained her when she first got hired on. The other day our employee of the quarter was announced and she won. I know that must’ve been really exciting for her and if I put my own feelings aside I am happy for her. But in the whole time I’ve worked there, I’ve never won and she has heard me vent about that months ago. I know it isn’t her fault she won and I don’t think of it that way at all, but it’s hard for me to celebrate when she has told me that this job is just something to get by for her and she doesn’t care about it and I have put my whole ass into it for so long. Am I wrong in feeling this way? I feel bad because I love her and I want her to succeed but at the same time I honestly didn’t even think she’d be in the running for it. Also the prize is just a paper where people write nice things about you And $75. I know it’s not that big of a deal but tbh it really got to me.

j0nwwcxx	I had a birthday dinner with my sister, my BIL, and his dad Steve.   Steve is an ass.  I found out he’s taking a job to be closer to his son and pressure my sister into having kids.  He keeps talking about how he wants his new house to be full of grandchildren.  He commented on me being single, and I focused on my career.  He told me not to wait too long, or I would be too old for a husband and kids.   I ignored him the whole time until he got to where he would be working.  It’s the same company  I did my internship.  I told him that, and he made some stupid comments about how I fell since I was freelance.  I laughed at him and said I’m a contractor for that company, so let's see if you get the offer once I tell them you are an asshole.  My sister was embarrassed and told me to be nice. I placed my phone on the table and started recording Steve as he called me a stupid little girl, and I knew nothing about the industry works.  He ranted on people like me who rather be independent contractors so I could bail when things get tough.  He said with all of my free time. I should focus more on dating and improving my life.   I took it to the office and showed it to the VP, who happened to be my boss when I was an intern, and recommended me as the freelance consultant.  The company denied his employment over sexism.     My sister called me and said Steve had already sold his home and bought another one here.  She said I had killed a grown man’s career, and now Steve has a house he can’t afford.   Steve sent me a message on LinkedIn saying I was a petty bitch, and Steve wanted to play stupid games, thinking he was better than me because he would work for that company.	1643142446.0	scn2d2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn2d2/aita_for_blocking_steves_new_job/	AITA for blocking Steve’s new job?

The very next day during lunch, Lucy’s sister, (who is a senior, let’s call her Layla) walked into me and Lucy’s homeroom and asked “wheres OP?” and I was so confused so I just awkwardly raised my hand, then seconds later, Lucy comes panting from the bathroom and screams “OP she wants to kill us!” And I just stared at her until she repeated herself, I wondered how Layla found out until my face went white and I realized that Layla’s best friend sat on my bus, with me being too overwhelmed, I ran to the bathroom and broke down in one of the stalls, after I came out I asked Lucy about everything and she said that Layla and her  friend were talking on FaceTime at night about how they were going to “beat” me and Lucy up for finding Layla’s account and get me suspended and whatnot, then after lunch, my homeroom teacher pulled me and Lucy out of the class and asked us about the situation and we got off the hook (he wasn’t mad at all, just confused) as Layla and her friend snitched on me and Lucy, so now I’m just scared for my life and my stomach sinks everytime I walk into school, so Reddit, AITA?	1643142453.0	scn2fz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn2fz/aita_for_finding_someones_instagram/	AITA for finding someone’s Instagram?

5r4fq	Before the pandemic I was a salaried employee at a law firm. When the pandemic started, I got laid off. This was fine as I had savings, the stimmy, and my wife worked from home.  After I got my second vaccine shot, I approached my old employer about going back. They took me back, but not at my previous salary but at an hourly rate that was slightly lower. I didn't mind so much as I wanted to get back to work and they said I could work when I wanted. Unfortunately, there was so much work to do that I ended up being there full time all the time. After about six months like this, I began asking for my old salary and position back, but they kept hedging and putting it off. As a result, I started looking for other jobs on Indeed and noticed they had an ad up trying to hire a permanent employee for my position.  Now, my boss was very emotional and abusive and kept blowing up at me over minor details. On Thursday she went really nuts about something and basically called me stupid and lazy. Screaming at me on the phone. So, I went home and slept on it and called in the next day and resigned. I totally left my clients and co-workers on the hook and screwed my boss.

ca151fok	Hey all.     I live in a houseshare in the UK and there's a few international students here. There's all sorts of smells coming from the kitchen and y'know, that's fine, I get it, each to their own.      One guy moved in 6 weeks ago, and he's from India. Naturally the food he's cooking is not only very spice heavy, but the chilli is a serious health risk to myself (lung conditions) and others, who've regularly been coughing a lot when he's cooking. About 3 days a week he'll cook using curry powders and chilli, and the smell wafts through the entire house. It gets in our rooms, on our clothes, it's practically stained the curtains too.  When it's chilli heavy it's physically fucking me up, as well as 2 other housemates who've complained to him.     Timeline:  In the first week it was a case of asking him to open all windows, and put on the extractor fan. He said it was fine, but he "forgot" a lot of the time.     The next 2 weeks were me and 1 other housemate complaining to our landlord. Landlord speaks to him, and asked him to open the windows etc. He agrees. Does it for the next week...no real issues, but it's still pretty powerful stuff.     The last 2 weeks, me and 2 housemates have launched an all out war on him because it's affecting us. I said to him 2 weeks ago that it's physically hurting my lungs and it's not practical, he's used to it, we're not. He called us racist and said that it was his diet, but we've explained that it's his responsibility to open the windows when cooking and that we cannot keep reminding him. The landlord also spoke to him, twice, and told him the next time he'll have to find a new place to live.     Out of spite, I suspect, he's still not opening the window, turning on the extractor fan, or even cleaning up surfaces properly just to piss us off. So 3 days ago after getting some legal advice, I called the police to report him for assault, which as far as I'm aware...it counts as. He's purposely releasing chemicals in to the environment and not taking precautions, and it's physical hurting me. The police came around, and spoke to him in his room. He left yesterday.

57vgwi1w	Okay so first a little background: My fiancé (22M) and I (22F) have been together over a year. We met in hs and didn't date then due to a bunch of external factors and didn't talk for years due to an ex he had during that time. We started talking again shortly after they broke up and decided to finally give it a try. A month into us dating he introduced me to his best friend. I'll call him Jake. Jake would bad mouth the ex and was adamant that nobody in the friend group liked her and never liked having her around. He claimed she did a lot of bad things and was the primary reason my fiancé couldn't hang out with anyone and said she was manipulative and a liar. I accepted that and didn't bring it up again. I didn't even know her well enough to form an opinion so I didn't try to.  Now fast forward to about 2 weeks ago when Jake invites me and my fiancé out to a restaurant to hang out because we hadn't all seen each other in awhile. We were out laughing having fun until Jake brings up the ex out of nowhere. My fiancé's face instantly clouded over at the mention of her name and he tried to change the subject multiple times. Jake wasn't having it. He used to insult ex and use lots of derogatory terms to describe her but he said after he saw her again recently at her place of work and hung out with her a bit he has had a change of heart. He made plans to hang out with her again. I could tell my fiancé was severely uncomfortable with that but didn't want to say anything to Jake. I told Jake that if he did that we wouldn't be hanging out with him or any other friend if she was around. I made it clear that we didn't want to associate with that girl anymore and that we thought that Jake was a bit of a hypocrite for switching up so suddenly out of nowhere. He tried making the argument that she was changing and that her and my fiancé's past relationship didn't matter anymore.  I got up annoyed and told my fiancé we were leaving.  On the ride home my fiancé told me he wished I hadn't antagonized Jake and that it was his choice to hang out with whoever he chooses. I was livid because Jake had made a huge deal about how much he hated this girl over the past year and all the things she had done to my fiancé. Now, my fiancé doesn't want to associate with her anymore but he also doesn't want to lose his friend and he considered just sucking it up and hanging out with them in spite of his discomfort. I told my fiancé I didn't want him to spend time with Jake anymore if he (Jake) was willing to hang out with the ex and put my fiancé in an uncomfortable situation. My fiancé disagrees but also refuses to bring it up to Jake and doesn't want to talk about it anymore.

466f3sfn	So once I happened to see my BF's Insta DMs. He and his friend (male) had sent each other IG posts/pics of semi naked / almost naked girls. I got angry and told by BF I was not okay with that. And he'd have to stop. Also, this other friend knows about us, and knows me through my BF too. So, did I overreact? He was kinda pissed and said they did it all the time and it was normal. We had an argument which ended in my telling him to stop doing this as I am not okay.

j0ghr8ne	Throwaway to protect the butthurt. I (31F) am a firearms and self-defense instructor. For context, I was an Army MP and briefly a cop. I teach classes for both LEOs and civilians, so I work with a variety of students and situations.  I’ve been seeing James (mid30sM) for about 3 months now. We have a good time, I like him, but we’re not to the commitment stage yet - at least not for me. James picks me up after a class for dinner a couple times a week. My main evening class right now is self-defense for DV/SA survivors, so when James comes in to wait, it’s mostly women on the mat.  Saturday we had plans to go to a movie, so he picked me up after another class which happened to be mostly men. James did not like this. I could tell there was a different mood when I finished and came over to talk to him.  That’s where things went wrong. He got touchy and made some loudish comments about looking forward to me throwing him around like that later.  Told him we’d talk and to let me change out. When I came back a few minutes later he was talking to a group of students and they looked annoyed.  I don’t know what he said. I told James let’s go and figured we would talk it over outside. He made a comment about being the one to go home with me. One of the students (gay black guy, explains the phrasing) looked at me and said, quote, “Dang, teach, you really like that whiny bottom energy?”  Was it out of line? Yep. Undeserved? Not sure.  Funny? I kept it in but yeah pretty funny.  I got James out of there before an altercation happened and let him fume, but he’s pissed that I just let my student disrespect him in front of everyone without saying anything. I told him he got back what he was putting out. I plan to talk to the student later.  The facility co-owner laughed his ass off, but another friend said I’m being hard on him, he’s just not used to my work yet and I should have called out the student.	1643144396.0	scnsfy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnsfy/aita_for_humiliating_my_date_in_front_of_my_class/	AITA for “humiliating” my date in front of my class?
82889k6v	So a few weeks ago my dog died from Parvo. At school I have a friend group with 4 people, Verlin Garth and Casey. (Fake names btw) I went to them for support and Verlin and Garth gave kindness and support back. Casey otoh said get over it I lost my cat and I didn’t come crying to you guys. Which  was a total lie cause he came to us for support which we gave him. His cat died 2 years ago and he uses it as an excuse for everything. This year he has been a bully towards us and will put us in head locks and choke us for no reason. Next week he completely left the group and ditched us to hang out with the popular kids when he was with them he laughed at us and told rumors about us before getting pushed out of their group last week. He came up to us and asked us to hangout with him I told him no cause he left us and made us look like total idiots. He said I should stop being a baby and to get over my dogs death AND I EXPLODED. I told him to leave us the hell alone and that he has no right to hang out with us anymore which he screamed back that I had no right to kick him out which Garth and Verlin said they were on board and for him to go away which he finally did and it lead to him doing everything he can to make everyone hate us.	1643144866.0	scnyzu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnyzu/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_our_group/	AITA for kicking my “friend” out of our group
j0pstiyk	Hi, new here  Recently, my 15-year-old son had a sleepover with 2 of his friends from his track team. At 2 AM, I was woken up by my wife telling me I needed to drive his friends home (she doesn't have a license), because she had found them doing something "inappropriate." Apparently they were all showering together, completely naked, as well as hanging around naked. My wife was shocked and got extremely mad at our son, saying it wasn't appropriate in any way.  When his friends left, I had a talk with my son. He told me that they weren't doing anything sexual, they were all straight, and just hanging out. I could tell he was pretty embarrassed, but I told him that it was fine, and even if he was gay, I wouldn't be bothered. He's allowed to do whatever with his friends as long as he's respectful, in my opinion. I told him that they're still allowed over to the house.  My wife on the other hand, is still very upset, especially about how calm I acted. She tells me that it's going to lead to sexual behavior and that I'm not being a responsible parent.

There is another girl (from the same group, her bf is also in the same group) who recently became good friends with my bf because they got a job in the same company. Sometimes the remaining group makes fun of them being together (you know, dating or liking each other etc.) Once they made these jokes in front of me as well. So, I asked my bf to tell them to stop.

gludohix	For reasons this is a throwaway and I’m on mobile so bear with me.   I [F16] have a friend [F17] Jasmine who starting dating a girl named Ashley early last year, and I was super happy for her, until I found out said girlfriend was in her 20s (not sure on her exact age). We’re not super close, I transferred to a different school our sophomore year, so I didn’t know the details until very recently. But I found out that they’ve known each other since Jasmine was 13, and met through conventions they both attend. I was shocked, especially because her mom seemed completely okay with it, even drives her to see Ashley.  For context, Jasmine struggles with mental health issues, and has had horror shows of teen relationships, abusive yk. She insists that Ashley is the best thing that’s ever happened to her, that she saved her from mean ex boyfriends and fake friends, her “goddess”. I’m glad she’s happy, but with an adult? She JUST turned 17 this month, and I know nothing I could say would convince her. I’m scared telling an adult would cause her to freak out, getting Ashley in trouble would cause her to resent me forever, even if it’s for her own good.    So I had an idea, a low blow maybe, but I wanted to make a fake account and DM Jasmine, tell her that Ashley was flirty over Snapchat, 1) That means I wouldn’t have screenshots and 2) I don’t use Snapchat so she wouldn’t suspect me. I understand it would hurt her and is kinda messed up, I feel the only way Jasmine would walk away from that relationship is if she grew to hate Ashley. My boyfriend agrees the relationship isn’t good, but doesn’t think the account is a great idea.	1643145018.0	sco0zx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco0zx/wibta_if_i_made_a_fake_account_to_break_up_a/	WIBTA if I made a fake account to break up a relationship between a minor and an adult?
j0pjn6m3	My (22, F) have been dating a man, Ethan (22) for nearly 3 years now. We used to be friends in a small group and have gotten together since then. When college started, my ex-best friend, who I'll call Sam, met a guy who I'll call Joe. They immediately hit it off, and Sam slowly started changing. It didn't surprise me at first since she was head over heels for this guy but it got to the point where he was all she would talk about. I confronted her about how I felt and Sam quickly became defensive calling me jealous, and other names. We stopped being friends from there for the sake of it, and I never thought of her again until a few weeks ago. Sam and Joe announced they were getting married in February 2022. My fiance Ethan was invited since he was still close with Sam. The invite stated that people who were engaged, married, or dating were supposed to bring a "plus one". My fiance brought it up at dinner and I said I didn't want to go. Sam was my best friend, and she ditched me for someone she knew for 3 weeks. He later got upset with me telling me if I don't go, he doesn't go. It upset me seeing him like this since he seemed excited to receive the invite. I've stood my ground and said I didn't want to go, but the wedding is in 2 weeks and my fiance still brings it up every so often. So, WIBTA if I didn't go?	1643145203.0	sco3m2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco3m2/wibta_if_i_didnt_attend_my_exbest_friends_wedding/	WIBTA if I didn't attend my ex-best friend's wedding?
j0q4441k	This is going to be very long, my apologies. I 15f and 16m(i’ll call him john) friends got into a big fight where I ended up blocking him and leaving the only discord server I was active in.   So I had this friend (john) that said the f slur once on purpose when talking about a story and I told him not to say that and he didn’t for a few months. Basically I sent him a song called the f slur saying this song is made by bad people and I thought they were gay. Then he said the name of the song when someone joined vc and asked what we were talking about. I got mad about it but moved on when he said it was a accident. Then another person I used to be friends with (Daniel) said the n word 3 times in a row. I stopped being friends with Daniel immediately because he was saying it wasn’t a accident and it was part of the song so he could say it(i didn’t really care because we aren’t close friends and only talk like once a month). John got mad at me for dropping him because I was “being to harsh and it’s not my problem bc I’m not black”. I got very mad about this and talked to him about the harms of slurs for like 2 days. He convinced me he understood but when we were in vc the next day Daniel with joined the call and I told him to leave or I’m kicking him. John told me I was being too harsh and this pissed me off so much because the day before he convinced me he understood why it was bad. I blocked him and was having no problems until I joined a vc on another server and another friend was trying to convince me that John is just stupid and I should forgive him. I agree with him that he is just stupid and will change eventually, but I know that it takes a long time. I have another friend who I am friends with now who used to say slurs but after talking about it with 3 people who don’t say slurs and taking apush he understood, but it took him at least 6 months and I don’t want to deal with it again.   Ps. All fake names and I summarized a lot so if you are confused please ask. Also if it is badly formatted it’s because I’m on mobile.	1643145369.0	sco5s5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco5s5/aita_for_stop_being_friends_with_someone_for_them/	AITA for stop being friends with someone for them saying slurs?

izdu5tzu	Throwaway because duh.   I am a newly minted trans woman going through transition. I have not had bottom surgery and I am not sure if I plan on it, I am however taking meds and doing everything else to feel like the woman I am meant to be.  I have moved back in with my family (my parents are very supportive) but my sister has been causing me extreme dysphoria, depression, and anger.  She is what I want to be. We look similar but she is a beautiful woman and I feel like a fraud. She has long thick hair, hourglass figure with full hips and big breasts, she’s skinny and feminine, etc. It is INCREDIBLY depressing and dysphoric to be around her.  She has been less accepting of my transition and I suspect she is a lowkey TERF. She doesn’t try to help me in anyway. She doesn’t teach me make up, how to do my hair, she doesn’t share her clothes with me, etc. I noticed that since I’ve moved back she has upped her femininity: she wears dresses all the time, shows off her feminine figure, curls her hair, wears feminine make up, does feminine things like drinking starbucks from this glittery cup (dumb example but you get the gist) etc etc.   It is hurtful she treats me like a brother and not a sister. I have asked her point blank if she thinks I am a woman like her and she usually responds with some TERF shit like, “I think transwomen are transwomen and different from cis women”.  I sat down with my parents and told them my sister is kinda responsible for why my dysphoria / depression is so bad. I told them asking my sister to tone down her femininity would help. They agreed and over dinner all three of us asked if she could just stop it.   She was furious. Said a bunch of hurtful disgusting transphobic stuff I don’t want to repeat, and basically told me to fuck off.   I feel like she is the major asshole here but my dad has made me second guess myself. After my sister’s ridiculous outburst and transphobic rant my dad has been more on her side and thinks I need to rethink this situation.	1643146199.0	scogss	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scogss/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_stop_being_so/	AITA for asking my sister to stop being so feminine during my difficult transition?
8jsw4gp3	So long story short. I came out as trans to my parents one year ago, and they're both trumpublicans and basically threatened to kick me out and didn't respect the identity. They then came back a week later and said that they would let me stay 'because they were generous' until the next semester of college. A few months later I was told that I wasn't being kicked out due to "whatever I identified as", but rather so I could "learn to live on my own."  Then I managed to get on HRT and things were unevenetful. About two months into my medical transition I have to drive my mother to a doctor's appointment, and she asks if I'm still trans. I lie and say no cause I don't want to argue in a car for four hours.  Now I'm seven months into my transition and I am living a lie to my family. Essentially using them for food and to help with my tuition so I can get a good job and gtfo of the town they live in.	1643146280.0	scohx0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scohx0/aita_for_lying_to_my_parents_about_being_trans/	AITA for lying to my parents about being trans?

b16w1	I was homeless for a while and struggled with food security for much longer. Besides that, food was around the house but as the oldest of many kids I was the designated "leftovers" eater.  My friends moved/married when we finished college, and I spent a few years going on lots of dates. Tinder was newish and I was in a college town, so it wasn't too hard  The first date was always a fun activity w/ snacks, the third date was usually dinner to get to know each other more deeply and see if we wanted to start a relationship. I'm an open book about struggles and very thrifty (to the point they would have noticed), and accidentally started a strange habit.  After a few dates of watching women pick at their food then take the leftovers home, I realized I couldn't stop thinking about the food that was likely going to waste. So I started asking if they were really interested in the leftovers, because if not I'd like to take them so it doesn't go to waste.  I usually gave a bit of my background and sometimes even joked that, "I paid to enjoy some time with you in a nice place, not feed you tomorrow!" Reading this now it seems weird, but most women seemed to understand or say, "I never thought of it that way, it makes sense!" However, one date did not go well, and she full-on laughed at me... I've always wondered if the other women were being nice to my eccentricities, or if I truly was basically a trash panda grabbing their food.

iim1dnzk	My friends and I are divided on if I did the right thing or am an AH.   I’ve been with this guy, both in our early 20s, for over 3 years, and have lived together for 3. He is nice and all, but a total deadbeat. He makes me do all the chores, doesn’t have a license, and can’t do anything at all for himself.   He never *says* mean things to me, but talking to him is like talking to a wall. He’s never excited for my many successes (I’m a business owner.) He sulks constantly and makes me feel like I can’t be happy or bubbly, even though he knows I’ve battled with mental health for so long and am finally getting better. My friends describe it as he’s a dark cloud and I’m a ray of sunshine. I’ve tried everything, and I’m just tired of having to water myself down so he doesn’t get sad about my success.   He cheated on me for the first half of our relationship and it just poisoned the well. I found out last year and just cannot let it go, even though he’s changed and gone to therapy and worked on himself a lot.   I confided in a friend of ours for the first time, and they said they’re renting a room in their house and I gave them the first month’s rent & deposit to move in.   I slowly moved everything of mine into the new room. It started with just a box or two a day, telling my boyfriend I was just doing some cleaning for the new year. Slowly I moved all my stuff out, since I had a lot of work to do and couldn’t do it all at once.   Eventually everything was gone one day when he got home; he didn’t even mention it because he never really noticed stuff I do. I sat him down and told him I’m never coming back, not to contact me, and wouldn’t tell him where I moved. I gave him my key back, had already contacted the landlord and had me removed from the lease, and gave him the prorated rent for the rest of the month.   I know that he can’t afford our home by himself, and that he’d probably get evicted, but I decided that wasn’t my problem anymore.   Since moving out I’m doing so much better. I no longer have to pretend to be something I’m not or light myself on fire to make him happy. I no longer have to pay his bills, cook him dinner, or clean up after him. It’s like a huge weight was lifted.   I haven’t even checked in on him or even really cared since I was so emotionally detached from the relationship for so long. He felt like I gave him no warning, but I had asked him to put in more effort for so long and it was just the final straw.   My friends think I should’ve given him a change to talk it over and given him more notice to find a new place, and not have gone behind his back. I’ve tried leaving him a lot though and he’d always just cry and beg me to stay until I felt too guilty to leave.	1643147823.0	scp15n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp15n/aita_for_how_i_broke_up_with_my_boyfriend/	AITA for how I broke up with my boyfriend?
ekfct444	TL;DR: My mom is flirting with my FBIL, and he might be flirting back. It makes me nervous and I'm not entirely sure why.  To start this off, I don't have much of a relationship with my mother. I was 'emancipated' at 15 from her home and moved in with my dad. Emancipation isn't technically legal in my state so I got out via a loophole. My parents have been divorced since I was 9 and separated since I was 7. My mother is diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and Narcissistic Personality Disorder, among a few others. She was also quite abusive to me growing up. My in laws know bits and pieces of the story, primarily that she didn't do the best at raising my brothers and myself (being that she didn't do much and I did most everything) and that we don't talk, hardly at all. I'm going on 22 this year and getting married next year. My  FSIL who married my FBIL late 2020 has hated my guts for the last 3+ years and no one knows why. It was recently found out that she was cheating on my FBIL. He's become someone he's not since marrying her, kind of just resting everyone like shit, being entitled, all he does is talk shit about everyone else, etc. He used to be super nice and he and I have always gotten along just fine. After we all found out his wife cheated on him, and he took her back days later, h cut contact with most everyone. During that time, he got a new receptionist at work. Come to find out, it's my mother. Come to also find out, she broke up with her latest boyfriend (no surprise, my mom can't hold relationships very well and the guy was a veteran with severe PTSD, super nice though, just a little messed up), and has been flirting with my FBIL, who might be flirting back. He told my fianceé about it and said she's kind of hot. My fianceé thinks I'm overreacting but this bugs me quite a bit and I'm not sure what's going to happen with it, but I hope nothing.	1643147957.0	scp2ve	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp2ve/aita_for_being_bothered_by_the_fact_that_my/	AITA for being bothered by the fact that my mother now works with my FBIL?
8e4tllwd	So, I am  a 19 year old guy, and I had an attraction towards guys for a while, and a  few days ago, I got really horny that i hopped onto grindr and got In touch with a guy, he was 40, and lives like 10km away from me, and she said he wanted to top, and i saw his "junk" ,we talked for a while and all seem good, so I went to the drug store, got a box of condoms and headed to the address he sent me..   He was constantly messaging, telling me to hurry and part of me was saying "this is bad", but I was too horny   And I finally reached his place, an apartment in the 3rd floor  When he opened the floor, the smell of paint hit me hard, and he was not the guy I was expecting to see, still....  He invited me in and I walked in,he made a comment of how bloated my body is, but I ignored it  the apartment was empty, there were a bunch of paint cans in the middle of the living room, and that's it  He told me he is in the city for "work" and guided me to where he supposedly slept, which is just a matter on the floor....  By that time, my senses were going haywire, but I still carried on for some stupid reason.m  He told me to get prepped, so I gave him the condom box and his face felled, he started wining whining about how condoms reeked of rubber smell(whereas I actually like the smell of condoms), and my mind just went into lockdown mode, I quickly made up a reason that I had an emergency and I have to reach home ,he looked disappointed and he said he will wear the condoms, but I still said I have to go  And suddenly this guy just grabbed my pants and I held his hands,looked into his eyes and said a stern "Stop" , he let go(I still don't know how I did it, but I did)  I stomped out of the apartment, ran down the flights of stairs, got out into the road, got a taxi, went to a mall, walked around to have a debate with myself and later went home  Now I am kinda semi scared if I will meet him again   And part of me is sort of feeling guilty for what I did	1643148904.0	scpf4o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpf4o/aita_for_ditching_a_guy_on_a_hookup_session/	AITA for ditching a guy on a hookup session

Josh has always called me "dad" and people automatically assume I am his dad. Only a few people know or figured out I'm his uncle.   Josh is going through a bratty tween phase where he's calling me "Uncle M" instead of "dad." I don't mind his calling me that at home but I take major issue with his calling me that in public.   Why? It brings unwanted attention. His teacher even asked me if I was his dad or uncle. I said it's complicated and she said that it seemed weird. Even one of his friend's mom asked me about it because she was "concerned" like I kidnapped him from a hospital. Otherwise I get bombarded by unwanted advice, questions, etc   I told Josh to knock it off and to refer to me as "dad" or "daddy." I won't acknowledge him if he calls me anything else. And if I find out he's referring me as his uncle to other people, I will ground him.

j0sjoedi	My bf and I have been dating for 5 months and mostly it’s been going good but there’s a big problem. He’s a slob and doesn’t have any table manners. When I point them out or ask him not to do it he just shrugs and makes a whatever noise and keeps doing them.   He eats so fast and messy he has choked twice on his food and everyone who eats with him cringes. He has juices all over his lips and uses his fingers to serve himself and other people even when I tell him it’s no sanitary. He often doesn’t wash fruits before eating them and I don’t eat his cooking anymore. Eating what he made once gave me diarrhea.  He dresses so bad like wrinkly T-shirts with holes sometimes with stains on them. I tell him we should dress up to see my parents, and bought him a plain white tshirt and he just shrugs it and says they should like him and not care about what he’s wearing. My parents gave me the side eye when he was eating like a caveman and dressed and that. I felt so embarrassed.  He has pretty bad body odor and denies it but I can smell it and so can my friend who hanged out with us. He works from home so no colleges can smell him but he smells like urine even though he insists he cleans everything and washes himself daily.  I’ve told him this many times and he just shrugs and ignores me. Last week he told me he has ADHD and that’s why he’s “not the cleanest”. I told him he can’t use his disability as an excuse and basic manners and body odor is expected out of everyone. He got mad of me and accused me of judging him for things he can’t control. Apparently I’m the 3rd gf who’s pointed out all these things and the previous 2 eventually dumped him because of it.	1643149934.0	scpsq9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpsq9/aita_for_being_embarrassed_to_be_seen_with_my_bf/	AITA for being embarrassed to be seen with my bf?
j0nwhmgq	My (16M) friend (17M) got into his dream college recently, which is very selective. His school also discriminated against Asians, so he was very concerned he wouldn’t be accepted due to that, despite having better academics than most applicants. Our school counselors discouraged him from applying, saying it’s not worth it as an Asian male to try to get into top schools unless you have international awards.  I congratulated him, and I said “And you did it all as an Asian male with the system designed specifically to exclude you. That’s beyond impressive.”  A student (18M), who was sitting two rows back and wasn’t part of our conversation, intervened and was like “What are you talking about? It’s not harder for him because he’s Asian. I got into an equally selective school. He’s not disadvantaged in any way in life or in admissions by being Asian. I had to work harder and score higher probably.”  This student, who got into a similar caliber school, is African-American. So all I did was state “It’s proven that Asians have to score 140 points higher than white students and 450 points higher than black students on the SAT for an equal chance at private school admissions. So yeah, it’s particularly impressive that he beat the odds as an Asian guy.”  He adamantly denied that, got very worked up, and said “how dare you say he has to work harder and be more qualified because he’s Asian! That’s the silliest thing I’ve ever heard!” He threatened to “report me.” I’m not sure for what specifically.	1643150356.0	scpylk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpylk/aita_for_congratulating_an_asian_friend_on/	AITA for congratulating an Asian friend on accomplishing his dream?
byhlag3d	This is my first post but its been a long time coming. I apologize in advance for any formatting errors or whatever.  So, I (32F) have 2 daughters, A (11f) and L (8f) with my ex husband (33M). I split with my ex 6.5 years ago because he physically assaulted A.   He is an alcoholic and heavily emotionally abused me throughout our relationship. Part of this abuse was talking me in to moving across the country, away from my family, while 7 months pregnant. Due to this move, when I took the girls and left him, we were forced to move back to my hometown so my family could help support us, as I also was not allowed to work, so I had literally nothing but the clothes on our backs.  I've since got a job, a home of our own, an ugly AF cat, and an amazing fiancée and stepdaughter. I've worked my ass off, pulling 15/20 hours OT/week for the past 3 years to support us. My ex has never paid child support. Has never offered to help, has never asked if they needed anything. His mother sends Xmas/birthday gifts.   He is living with his parents because he either can't or won't work. He calls/facetimes with the kids but has started trying to dictate how A manages these calls (due to online schooling, she's used to muting the call when someone in the house speaks to her, its the modern equivalent of putting someone on hold IMO,  but he has a problem with it.) He HAS from time to time gotten his shit together enough that he's lived locally and I've (mistakenly, I know now) allowed small bits of access, but an incident with the girls that resulted in the police taking them from him has resulted in him essentially running away. That was 3 years ago and he's been limited to the phone calls ever since.  Now his mother just texted me to discuss the girls flying out to their place for 2 weeks and I am hesitant, at best. She  doesn't call at all, unless its to get an address to send something. I haven't heard from ex's father in years. We'll routinely go months without hearing from any of them. I do not believe that I have seen any evidence that he's done anything to better himself and I feel very uncomfortable with the idea of my girls on a plane without a known adult, or even with him. I don't necessarily want to keep them from their grandparents either but I operate under the notion that if you want a relationship with my kids, its on you to put forth that effort.  EXMIL is going to call in an hour to discuss this trip and I'm going to say no and its going to cause a HUGE fight and I am very nervous. But I'm doing the right thing for my girls, right?

j0oti8yp	A few months ago, I (18) met a guy “Mike” (47) who I had sex with once, but we started to become more friendly with each other, so we decided not to have sex so that it wouldn’t turn into a romantic relationship. When we see each other, we cuddle sometimes, but that’s as intimate as we get. I don’t like the act of sex itself, but as of now it’s one of the only ways I know how to get positive attention, because I’m not really worth much as a person.   I met another guy “Rob” (37), who said he was interested in a friends with benefits situation with me. I agreed, saying I wasn’t looking to be in an exclusive relationship, and he said that he was fine with it as long as I was single. Considering I’m not dating anyone, and I hadn’t had sex in a few months before meeting Rob, I considered myself single and said I was without a second thought. We didn’t have sex the first time, but we did make out.   I didn’t really want to go back to Rob, but he said he wanted to see me, so I went back. I didn’t want to have sex but we did (I said yes the whole time, but I was lying about wanting it). Afterwards we talked about our sexual histories some and I decided to mention Mike as an “FWB”, despite not considering him that, in hopes that it would get Rob to not like me as much. He said “you have another FWB?” And I said “yes, is that alright with you?”. He said “well, I’d rather be the only person you’re sleeping with, but that isn’t something I can ask of you at this point”. I told him that Mike and I cuddled and kissed sometimes, but hadn’t had sex in a few months. The kissing bit was a lie; Mike and I had only cuddled the last few times I saw him when I said that, but I was hoping that by saying we kissed as well, Rob would back off of me a little bit. I asked if he felt like I’d lied to him by saying I was single, and he said “no, it sounds like you’re single to me. I just didn’t wanna be anyone’s side piece or help anyone cheat”.   So… I saw Rob one more time, and we didn’t have sex, but he said he wouldn’t mind having me to himself. I realized he was probably looking for more than a FWB relationship at that point, but I didn’t want to say no to his face, so I said “maybe”. That was the last time I saw him in person. A week later, I saw Mike again, and for the first time in a long time, he and I made out. At that point, I decided it wouldn’t be ethical for me to continue seeing Rob, especially since I didn’t really want to see him again to begin with.   I texted Rob and told him I didn’t want to see him anymore. He seemed disappointed but it ended well.   Did I do something wrong here? Did I lie by saying I was single? I wasn’t trying to be deceptive by saying that at all, I just didn’t think it was necessary info.	1643150616.0	scq27l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scq27l/aita_did_i_lie_about_being_single/	AITA?

34l99104	My 22f grandpa 87m has some constipation issues. I've been his live-in caretaker for a year and know that he takes 2 stool softeners (SS) pretty much every day to help everything, ahem, exit smoothly (his primary care physician recommended it). We drove to visit our family last week, and I packed him 2 SS with his daily meds. I will often check his meds to see if he took them in the right timeframe.  When I went to check his daily meds, he had taken everything on schedule except for his SS. I asked him why he hadn't, and he said he didn't think he needed them this week. I reminded him that he usually takes them in advance just in case, but he brushed it off. The last day we were out of town, he complained about constipation. I told him he should've been taking his daily SS to help, and he agreed he needed to be taking them daily again.  Well, yesterday, I noticed he had taken his morning meds, but not his SS. I asked if he wanted me to give them to him, and he said no, he'll get to it. Hours went by, and he still hadn't taken them. I reminded him once again, and he became frustrated and yelled "I know!" I decided to stop reminding him if he was going to be like that.   He never ended up taking them, and today he is once again complaining of constipation; telling me I need to be more adamant for him to take his SS. I don't want to remind him if he's only going to get frustrated and yell at me.

8u0yl2b6	 So I (14F) have a friend (13NB), lets call them Sam. Sam has had a very bad past that i wont divulge, but basically some really bad stuff happened to them as a child, and a very similar thing happened again last year. and Sam is dating Kody (15M). Kody has cheated on Sam 2 times already, and has begged for forgiveness each time, and Sam lets him off the hook. Kody has overall been more bad then good, from what i know, and is very toxic and controlling. for context, me and Sam have been friends for several years, and they started dating Kody not long after. for a little while i had a crush on Sam, but i grew out of it long ago. i understand why Kody was jealous of me for that, but what he did about felt very extreme. me and Sam make multiple "suggestive" jokes, as that's our sense of humor, but we never mean any of it. after a little while, as far as I can tell Kody didn't like this, and forced Sam to block me on all social media and refuse to talk to me. we started talking again about 6 months later, and Sam told me that they made that account to try and contact me. a few weeks later, me and Sam were talking over Instagram, and they were complaining about how Kody had been online on snapchat for over two hours but was not responding, and so they signed into his account. (they both have each others social media logins) turns out he was talking with a girl that they didn't know, saying that Sam was gone and that he and the girl could call again. Sam confronted him about it, and he apologized profusely about it, swearing it wouldn't happen again, that he was sorry, blah blah blah, standard cheater stuff. Sam agreed to get back with him under some conditions, such as he couldn't have girl friends since he had cheated on them with both of the girl friends of his that he had, that he had to be nice to me (he doesn't like me, neither of us know why) and that they could look through his phone whenever. Sam has contacted me several times about how much it hurts, and how it feels weird to be intimate with him. along with cheating, Kody refuses to respect their pronouns, and calls them by their full name when they much prefer a shortening of the name. He restricts what they are allowed to eat and drink, and Sam has told me that they are often afraid to do things he doesn't like because they're scared of him. I've always felt that something was off about Kody, and that he wouldn't be very much of a good boyfriend, but I respected their choice and didn't interfere. recently they've been posting on their close friends story about how depressed they feel, and I feel like they shouldn't stay with him. would I be the asshole if I told them that they should break up with him?	1643151063.0	scq8af	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scq8af/wibta_if_i_told_my_friend_to_break_up_with_their/	WIBTA if I told my friend to break up with their cheating BF?
j0tcqxmk	My friend asked me weather or not I liked female singers and I said I didn't and that they weren't as good as male rappers. he got upset and started shitting on me for not liking female singer and said I have shit music taste. He did the same with things like language asking me weather or not I liked foreign music, I dont and he started shitting on me more. it was funny or whatever at first, but after a while it got annoying, I told him but he didn't care, he started to talk like a smart ass diagnosing me on my 'problem' I got pretty defensive and shouted at him to get off my back and that he's being super annoying. He got quiet and hasn't talked to me in a bit. Some advice on what to do, or should I just get rid of him.

I’m fully aware of comfort shows and the like but whenever I’d like to watch something with her that I think we both might be interested in or something that I’d like for a change, it’s either an immediate no, or only for us to fall asleep to.

do05m3eq	Last year after I moved 2 hours away to pursue a new career. I was visiting my girlfriend and we saw her grandsons at her son's baby mama Sara's house. Long story short I fell asleep after playing football with the boys and left without my $600 snowboarding jacket.   She lived 15 minutes away from where I left it before she moved in with me. She refused to go over there solely to get my jacket. She outright said "it's not worth the time and gas to just grab a jacket."   Fast forward 11 months and it's 0 degrees again. She mentioned that she went to see her grandkids again and she couldn't find my jacket. I told her that it was obviously stolen because it was a ridiculously nice jacket and its been a year. She said she was sorry but i told her she wasnt because i asked her 5 times and she said no. She argues i should have driven out myself to get it if it was such a big deal. It was 3 years old and still looked brand new. Also it's hard to find anything semi-professional in that shade of blue. I loved that fucking jacket because it was a gift from my mom. I told her that she'll never find it because Sara probanly gave it to one of her new boyfriends or probably sold it at a 2nd hand store.   She doesnt own a winter coat. Apparently she never has despite living in this frozen shithole her whole life. I want her to buy an equivalent jacket for HERSELF so she can understand the value of a jacket like that. That jacket is HALF of her car payment. Yes HALF. She thinks saying "sorry" should be enough to cut it but the truth is that for me it's not. Whenever I ask for the smallest errands I'm always met with reasons and excuses of why she can't. She also is in crippling financial distress less than 6 months after doubling her salary after moving out here. Her car payment is pretty hard to handle but she also bought a shitload of furniture and clothes on credit. She can't even afford to help pay rent or groceries.   We got in a huge fight over it and I'm confused as hell if I'm overreacting or if I'm being played. I don't want a replacement jacket for myself because I went out and bought a new one.

j0sv2c3p	I (21 nonbinary) recently got into an argument with my partner (24F) of three years and need some advice. My partner and I live together in an apartment, and we're both university students doing classes and working entirely online right now.   I was cooking lunch for both of us in the kitchen while simultaneously listening to my zoom lecture. She was sitting at the desk in our living room (connected to the kitchen) trying to start a zoom meeting for her work. For some reason her laptop wasn't connecting to the wifi, so she wasn't able to start her call. She called out to me asking if the wifi was working for me, and I quickly replied it was. After a few minutes she got frustrated, banging on the desk, and shouted out again asking to use my phone for the hotspot (my phone was sitting in our bedroom). I told her she could use it, but asked her to give me a second, as I was draining pasta and trying to listen to my professor on the lecture, so I couldn't help her right away.   After a minute, she grabbed my phone from the bedroom and tried to connect it to her laptop. That wasn't working, and she was getting really frustrated, which was making her yell at the laptop. For a second I thought she was yelling at me, so I turned off the stove, muted my lecture, and came into the room to ask if she needed help. She told me that nothing was working, she was late to start her call, the zoom app on my phone wouldn't even connect to the wifi, etc. I told her I'd try to help out with the zoom app if she grabbed my iPad and tried on that. Eventually we were able to get the ipad to work, but she was crying in frustration, and several minutes late to her call.   I finished cooking, put her lunch on her desk and went into my workspace in the bedroom. We did our separate calls for about two hours, after which I came into the living room to check on her. She told me she was mad at me, saying that I "automatically assume she's mad at me when she's yelling." To be fair, I did think she was mad at me, because when someone is yelling and demanding my help, that's typically what I assume. She didn't say what else she's mad at, but she's icing me out and said she didn't want to talk about it anymore.   So, AITA? I'm so lost about what I did wrong, and so frustrated because I feel like I always end up apologizing whenever we argue.

fhazhxs3	My other friend Sara said I'm the AH. My friend jen came out as a lesbian recently, everyone was shocked including myself. I'm not homophobic or anything but I thought jen was being selfish. Jen had a boyfriend, let's call Aidan , he has been crushed since jen came out. I'm happy jen no longer has to "pretend " (her words not mine) to be straight but the way she went about coming out is honestly just cruel...jen and Aidan just had a baby. Aidan had told me she had been acting weird after giving birth but we all just thought it was PPD. Then at a family dinner she literally just sprung the news that she's a lesbian and had been living a lie. Adian is literally still in shock. Her family was in shock. She is literally making this all about her. Forgetting that for the last 3 years she has been playing aidan. She had been cheating on him with her current  girlfriend too. Her family freaked out on her and she came to me for comfort. I honestly sympathize until I realize how callously she behaved not towards her parents but towards Aidan , who had done everything to please her.   I told her to apologize to him and she refused. So I told her to leave my house and dont expectme to back her, she left . She has since been posting online about fake friends and homophobic family.

bon60t8k	I(F23) am fed up. Lately, my roommates complain about me only supplying food for myself and cooking for myself, or going out and bringing something home.   When we all moved into together two years, my roommates (M50, M20) and I would take turns cooking. This quickly became a me job, while the one roommate(M20) wasn’t working and the other (M50) only worked half of what my hours were.   Lately, the two of them realized I wasn’t cooking and they had to fend for themselves. The younger roommate doesn’t care or say much but the older roommate gets in my face. “Why isn’t the house clean? Why are you so fucking selfish and only getting food for you?? Why didn’t you bring food home from your lunch break?”   I stopped using the dishes and have paper and plastic dishes to dispose of because these two RARELY did dishes and blamed me frequently to avoid having the responsibility of doing them.   Tonight, since my schedule is 12 hours/6 days a week, I made two chicken breasts from my food, and I went to go to my room with my dogs when the older roommate got mad. I had literally no restraint in pointing him towards a bag of bread and peanut butter and saying bone appetite. Because he didn’t even go to work all week and the other roommate quit his job. So, no one BUT me is going to have to pay the rent and bills. The house is a fucking mess. The dishes aren’t done. No one else made dinner.   I am not a maid. My name is on the lease as an owner. I don’t think it should be up to me to provide food for two grown men that wanna fuck around all day.

d04u5qsw	I (24F) have recently moved back in with my mom. This was supposed to be a temporary stay, as I was planning on leaving the state in a few months. Those plans recently fell through due to reasons outside of my control. My mom lives in another city than I had been living in, so when I moved back in I quit my current job. I have not found a new job yet, my plans for leaving the state fell through and I have been dealing with some health issues.   None of this is my mom’s fault or problem. I feel incredibly overwhelmed with where I am at right now, and like I am not making progress as a person. I have always dealt with intense anxiety and depression, and lately it has gotten so much worse. To the point where it is hard for me to have normal conversations with people and act like myself around my family.   I have been spending a lot of time by myself while I look for work and do my class work. I am beginning to feel like this is effecting my relationship with my mom, as I just got here. I don’t want to argue or talk about my mental state at all with my mom, because she has a tendency to want to fix me and tell me there is nothing wrong and that it’s normal to be sad. I know that what I’m dealing with is more serious than just being sad. I sometimes think I am losing my grip entirely.

He has recently made contact with both of us, I was upset with the fact he'd even try talking to us. He even made Ali have a panic attack about it.

j0tvlqya	I'm 18 years old and am a student (freshwoman) at Amherst College, Massachusetts. I had been living with my parents and siblings in Chicago prior to college, but I haven't seen or talked to any of them since August... I wasn't even invited back home for the holidays. Back when I was applying for colleges last year, I wrote an essay about my dead grandmother. She passed away in a highly publicized drunk-driving accident (she wasn't the driver) back in 2009 or 2010. I wrote all about the feelings of shock at such a young age and seeing my grandmother in unbelievably beat-up condition. Was my essay fully truthful? Not at all; I wasn't there when my grandmother died and had only met her a couple times as she lived across the country. But, it was emotional, meaningful, believable, and I've never been so proud of anything I've done like this. I didn't tell my parents explicitly about my essay because they're strict about 'doing the right thing' and I didn't want to risk having to redo something I was so passionate about. I instead just told them "it's about my family" to their pleasure. I submitted my essay to several colleges and two scholarships as well, and to my surprise, I was accepted for everything! My GPA was only 3.75 and my ACT score was only 27 so I knew it must've been my essay that helped me stand out. My parents were so excited for me and demanded to see what I put on my applications (they never had high expectations for me so it was a surprise for them as well). They were silent as they read my essay, but once they finished, they started scream-crying about how I was disrespecting their mom and "selling lies for success". My dad even said I was "prostituting myself with words" which really offended me. It's not like I slandered my grandmother or anything, I just told a fake story that people were sympathetic about. I don't see why this was such a big deal to them... almost anyone else would be proud, am I right? Luckily I don't have to worry yet about college funding from my parents due to my scholarships covering the first 2+ years. So far, I guess the moral of the story is to do what you're good at and don't let others' opinions push you away from your goals, but once my scholarship money is up, maybe I'll find a new moral.	1643153228.0	scr11n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scr11n/aita_for_profiting_off_of_my_grandmothers_death/	AITA for profiting off of my grandmother's death?
j03g5g89	I manage a small team of employees for my family’s company. I decided we would be going back in person a month ago and everyone came back except one guy who got special permission from my dad to stay home because his wife is immunocompromised and pregnant. I was pretty annoyed he went above my head but whatever. He was maybe almost on the same seniority level as me so I let it go.  Unfortunately since he’s not back in person my other staff have been asking a lot to go back to WFH and it’s become really annoying.  He booked time off for 8 weeks after his wife goes into labor with 2 weeks of flex time before that because I guess they weren’t sure of the delivery time despite having a due date.  Well my girlfriend surprised me with a small vacation and I obviously decided to go, so I told the employee that he needed to show up for his first week of flex as expected. As a compromise I said he could stay WFH.  He said he would be there unless his wife went into labor. I told him that I wouldn’t be in the state and he needed to be available period, flex means flexible both ways. I then messaged the slack channel for all employees and reminded them that their flex time wasn’t guaranteed and would count as a strike if they failed to make it if they were needed.  Well sure enough I’m on vacation and he texts my personal number that his wife had an emergency (I don’t know if this is true the timing seems a bit too convenient) so I told him his poor planning doesn’t constitute my emergency (which I’ve seen people say a lot to great effect) he asked me if I was serious and said he would not be available.  I told him it would be a strike and he never replied. When I got home there were some issues and my slack notifs had blown up. So I wanted it in writing that it was employees failure not mine and I responded in the main channel that this is why missed flex days were a strike and employee now had 3 strikes, one for each day he missed.   He quit and now my team and more importantly my dad is extremely pissed off at me and says I was out of line and power tripping. My dad doesn’t realize I needed to make an example because him being WFH already undermined my authority. My dad has been trying to get him to come back and wants me to apologise but I don’t see why I need to say “ Sorry I told you to show up for expected work days.” Am I really the ass here?	1643153985.0	scraqr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scraqr/aita_for_expecting_my_employee_to_keep_his/	AITA for expecting my employee to keep his regular shifts?
5p3dt34z	I (39 M) called my wife (21 F) lazy and now she hates me. Recently my wife quit her job due to complications with cancer and has been at home all day and now she is REFUSING to take care of our children. She still does laundry and cooks dinner but I feel like it isn't enough. I work really hard training as an e-sports athlete so my hands are always really tired and I can't take care of the kids so I asked her to do it and she said it's not a real job and I'm not making any money (yet) and I should be less selfish and take care of the kids and be less lazy. In turn I called her lazy and she hasn't spoken to me in a month and moved back in with her parents.   I feel like she's being ridiculous because I've never taken care of kids and couldn't do it properly.

guxsu6gl	Scenario: moving house, need to remove the toilet seat (which has an integrated toddler toilet seat, as someone will wonder why we are playing Grinch by 'stealing' a toilet seat). I (f39) ask partner (m44) to wash his hands after removing the toilet seat, he refuses saying he has other dirty things to do outside. I have a not great immune system, and I am the canary in the coal mine that catches any stray bug going. He then proceeds to touch the front door handle, my car keys, my car door handle and everything associated with moving my car, and then his car door handles, etc. He doesn't see the issue, I tell him I feel he is not respecting me. As a fitting ending, I then watched him tuck the dried-urine spotted toilet seat under his arm as he walked down the stairs to the cars, wearing a sweater he washes maybe every four months.

67obz4hw	Emma (39F) and I (33F) are really close. Both single moms. Our break-up stories regarding our children's dads are very similar and that created a bond. We're both on Tinder.  Emma is very different from me in relationships. She likes to have lots of attention, is usually in contact with several men at the same time & if she feels the attention from one is waning, she usually makes sure that that void is filled with attention from another. I am rather cautious and although I do get enough male attention, my dating life is limited. I'm afraid of getting hurt and feel safer knowing someone a little longer or if they're an acquaintance of someone.  Before the summer, Emma had met Mike (46M) through Tinder.  I met him twice with Emma and he was nice to be around, but soon after she was dating someone else. I suspect they had a brief fling but nothing serious. Their contact diluted and she dated several men since.  Until last Saturday, she was in a short (1,5m) relationship that ended in a non-respectful way. Emma and I went to our favorite bar to take her mind off things next day. She also invited her favorite ex. A few drinks made us worry-free for a while and I wasn't too sober anymore when I started swiping (unattentive) on Tinder while she was flirting/went home with her favorite ex.  Next day, I got a Tinder message from Mike. Apparently we had matched that night and he invited me to go for a drink. A coffee sounded good but I would rather talk to Emma about it first.   Emma was sad & vindictive that day about her recent breakup and chose to drink wine again with another ex until 3:00 AM. When I asked Emma if it would be ok for her if I met up with Mike for a drink, she was furious. Said that I knew that she thought he was a nice guy and that she'd like to meet up with him again. I tried to clarify that I didn't know she saw him as a potential date & apologized if I had hurt her in any way + that I would not meet Mike:  our friendship is more important.  She continued scolding me: that I was pathetic for not finding my own dating potential. How could I, now that she was dumped, want to go on a date with a friend/ex-date of hers! From now on she would think twice before introducing me to anyone. She questioned our entire friendship and my honesty. I tried to explain that from my POV, they were just on friendly terms & she had moved on with her dating life, I had no idea he was that significant to her.  I informed Mike that I had talked to Emma about our match/possible date & my misjudgement, I didn't want to jeopardize Emma's friendship.   He said that he did not want to hurt anyone, did not understand Emma's reaction that well.  He also said that if he ever came across me, regardless, he would be happy to treat me to a drink anyway. I didn't reply to Mike and I blocked Emma for now because it was so intense that I had to cry while at work. Did I misjudge the situation and was I an AH friend to Emma?	1643155011.0	scrodc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrodc/aita_for_drunkenlyswipingmatching_a_guy_on_tinder/	AITA for drunkenly-swiping-matching a guy on Tinder who had previously matched my friend and for wanting to accept his invitation for a drink?
8kcc535t	My(20f) youngest sister(18f) is getting married in July and just told us about it. We will call her Jolene I was very excited to go and be her bridesmaid. I had a few concerns about going mainly because our abusive step mother will be there and i am NC with her. I decided that i will go because it is Jolene's wedding and i dont want to miss it. I can deal with the step monster. However, recently my step-brother got out of jail and she invited him.    This is the man who seggsually abused me for years as a child and who even after a few years came back to live with us in the house and tried to get me to have seggs with him because "we arent really related".    I can not deal with him and Jolene originally told me that she wasnt going to invite him because she hates him. so i said ok that i would still be in her wedding. she then turned around and said "He's trying to make amends for what happened" i dont want amends from him. i want him to be gone from existence. I told her as much and she said i was out of line and that he was coming. She said i was selfish. I told her that if he was there then i wouldnt be and she would need to find another bridesmaid that my mental health and physical safety is more important to me than her wedding. My older sister told her as well that she would not be going.    So AITA for telling my little sister that i would put my mental health above her wedding?	1643154853.0	scrmbm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrmbm/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_i_will_not_go_to/	AITA for telling my sister that i will not go to her wedding?

j0uf0qmf	I had no NC with my father for 15 yrs, now slowly growing a relationship in the last year.  My husband with stage 4 cancer just had major surgery and 3 days later he is diagnosed with covid. I am holding it together to calm him down but when he gets suited up, moved wards and put into a room with a load of other infected people, I am internally crying. He gets to sleep and now I am outwardly crying and can’t stop. All of the stress, all of the fears and worries that I will never see the love of my life again, it builds. It’s just after one at night and I am alone in a tiny house. Since my father is in a time zone 6 hours behind mine it meant it was only 7.20pm for them.  Sunday  1.20am I reach out to my father. No answer so I call 3 more times. Nothing.  1.22am I message her “Hey is dad there?”  1.26am I call my fathers partner, no answer. I then get a reply “We are at a bluegrass festival I can't answer the phone Is everything OK”  1.26am I respond “Husband was just diagnosed with Covid and is now on a covid ward”  No response.  1.46am I message her “Did you tell him?”  1.50am She messages “Big prayers. We will call you in the morning. Last show over (in an hour or so)”  1.53am Her “Yes… he’s upset”  1.54am I respond “Okay good night I guess just 2am here alone.”  1.55am Her “get some rest”  1.55am I respond “Could you really do that with your husband who just came out of surgery and now has covid?”  1.58am Her “You're right... I'd probably cry myself to sleep...I'm sorry”  1.59am I respond “I just wanted to talk to my dad”  2.01am Her “He'll call in about 30 minutes.” That would be at the end of the show, except he didn’t call for another two hours after that and I was asleep by then.  No call Monday. Then my father calls 4 times in a row sometime today. I had to hang up each time because I was on a call to the surgeon, who then put me on to the stoma nurse, a covid specialist and so on. I thought at the time today I was taking him home and would be contracting covid so I could care for him here. Delayed till tomorrow now. I completely forget to message or call him as I am taking notes for the next hour or so. Then 4 big deliveries of medical supplies  11PM I get this from her:  “Why won't you talk to your dad? He is going in for colonoscopy tomorrow. He's tried to call you a few times. I'm sorry I have difficulty talking about HUSBAND to you because my cousin has the exact same thing he has and is not doing so well... We could not talk to you when you called because we were in the middle of a concert crowd And it was very very loud. We did not even hear your dad's phone ring. I just happened to have the phone in my hand when you texted and it vibrated.  Your dad is in the shower right now please call him.  I hope you and HUSBAND are doing better.”  &#x200B;  That night I called the Samaritans for help and they were wonderful.	1643155083.0	scrpa5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrpa5/aita_for_feeling_like_my_father_does_not_care_i/	AITA for feeling like my father does not care?

j0vr9lm7	I have a US friend who is obsessed with the fact that a few generations ago his family lived in my country. It is a common consensus in my country that  people who brag about it are just loud mouthed and that no one gives a flying F about it.

i27c3jce	I go to an academy for engineering (U.S). Our school is comprised of 2% females. Myself being one of them. The specialized field I’m going into contains just as few women.  This morning, one of my classmates got my professor on the topic of the army and he told us a war story of his. Then he asked everyone to raise their hands if they were signed up for the draft. I’m the only woman in class. He looks at me and says, I see one hand that’s not raised and asks me to confirm I’m not signed up for the draft and I shake my head (indicating that I’m not). He then, launches into a rant saying how don’t I see that people (gesturing to my classmates) will resent me for that? And talking about how when he got back from Vietnam he had women spitting on him and stuff. At the end of this rant, without opportunity for me to get a word in even if I had thought of something to say he seamlessly shifted into lecture topics and that was that.  Would I be the asshole to future women being taught by him if I just let this go and don’t bring it to the administration’s attention so I can just quietly graduate in a few months Instead of fighting this fight?	1643155022.0	scrohq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrohq/wibta_if_i_choose_not_to_take_action_after_my/	WIBTA if I choose not to take action after my professor was sexist?
j0w70p2s	I currently drive a 64 plate Golf GTI. Recently I have been looking at buying a new Ford Ranger because I think the Raptor ones look cool and I can justify it to myself because I can use it to tow equipment for work. The one I want is about £50k including VAT and I would be paying cash and keeping my GTI rather than trade it in so I would have two cars.   My brother and his wife are struggling at the moment due to her quitting her job and the new one rescinding the offer, she is looking for work but I’ve been told it’s a specific field and that openings are rare.   My mum and I have been chipping on for their mortgage for the last 8 months (I pay ¼ , mum pays ¼ and they pay the remaining ½ ). When this arrangement was set up it must have been pretty hard for them because it involved my mum going over their budget, bank/credit card statements and everything. I know I’d rather the ground swallow me up than have mum go over my finances, so they must be in genuine need.   Would I be an arsehole for making a big purchase like a brand new pickup that, if I’m honest, I don’t really need, when my immediate family are in financial difficulty right now?	1643155262.0	scrrsj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrrsj/wibta_for_buying_a_second_car_when_my_brother_and/	WIBTA for buying a second car when my brother and his wife are struggling financially?
7y82vm3d	I have an aunt, she's not much older than me (considerably younger than my parents and not close to their other siblings)  as she was an oops/surprise baby.  She has no kids of her own, and honestly I've never been involved with her because when I was younger she openly hated kids and so she avoided hanging with me and my parents.  As I got older, I noticed she started coming back around and being friendlier to me (I'm the oldest grand, my other cousins are still fairly young), trying to build a relationship with me.  I brushed these attempts off as I really didn't want to get to know someone who didn't want to know me when I was younger. Over the years she keeps calling me and trying to get me to hang out with her, and I will just tell her I have other plans already.  Recently she stopped by to see me and tried to corner me into hanging out with her, and I just flat out told her I wasn't really going to because of how she acted when I was younger.  This lead to her being angry with me and confronting my parents about my attitude.  They told me I should be nicer to her and spend some time with her.  I don't think I'm obligated to spend time with her.  &#x200B;  Why I might be the ass: My aunt is obviously wanting to have a better relationship now, but I really don't anymore and I'm not trying to, as she didn't want to be around me as a kid.	1643155254.0	scrrod	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrrod/aita_for_not_wanting_to_see_my_aunt_again/	AITA for not wanting to see my aunt again
dj83avhw	I (23M) have been living with my girlfriend in a one room apartment for around 6 months now. Things have been pretty good, but recently I have been having issues with her.  I work from home (always have), and she just started working from home beginning of January til the end of this week. I am also a pretty quiet / introverted person; I like spending most of my week by myself and going out on weekends. Even when going out with friends I'm still pretty quiet as I have social anxiety. She (23F) on the other hand, is very talkative. Even when we're working she's trying to talk to me, the cats, herself. It's been a bit distracting, and incredibly draining for me. After work I am dead; whereas I used to talk to her and chill out with her now I just want to lay down. I've even been going to bed like two hours earlier.    I've been so exhausted from this that I've been re-evaluating the relationship a bit. I've had this issue in the past over the summer where I wasn't sure if we were right together, but then I spent a weekend without her at my friend's cabin and things got better. With this in mind, I'm thinking I just really need to recharge and have a weekend by myself to do whatever I want. I'd ask her if she could maybe go by her friends, but when she moved in with me she moved a couple of hours from her smaller college town to a bigger city where I live. So, all her friends are like two hours away. I really need some alone time but think it might make me an AH to ask her to drive a bit to let me hangout by myself. I'm going up with her this weekend to see her friends, which isn't super awesome for me, so I'm thinking maybe it'd be a fair "trade" to ask for a bit of alone time. I also don't have anywhere else to go; all my friends live near me.   So, WIBTA if I ask my girlfriend to let me have some alone time? And if not, what would be the best way to ask her to do it?	1643154917.0	scrn52	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrn52/wibta_for_telling_my_girlfriend_i_need_some_me/	WIBTA for telling my girlfriend I need some "me" time?

j0wd1z9x	My family came to visit from another state and I took last Friday and the weekend off to take them to this nice place in my state. I also went with several other family members.  One day, I went to this nice city with my brother, his girlfriend, my niece, and my family from out of state. My brother and his girlfriend invited me and the couples in my family from out of state to this nice restaurant that's known for being a romantic place for couples.  I was the only single adult and the plan was for me to babysit my niece and the other kids and I was really startled by the change in plans.  I asked my brother why I was going when I've been single for years and he refused to tell me and just told me to go with them. I didn't want to be a 7th wheel. I refused and he kept pressuring me and said that he hired another babysitter for the kids.  When I went to the event, I saw a guy I had liked for long time and my brother said he had "invited him as a friend."   It was incredibly awkward because I had gotten nervous around him then and was even more nervous then. It was even worse because he didn't seem nervous at all and was extremely "smooth" with me and complimented me on my outfit and looks when I wore a t-shirt and jeans and no makeup. He was wearing a suit, by contrast.  He ended up paying for me and we went off on our own, although the intention was to spend time with my family from out of state. He told me that he had liked me for years and asked me out later that day.  I told him I was annoyed he hadn't asked me earlier and told me he had embarrassed him in front of my family. I was blushing and stammering through the dinner and I wanted to hide because I was embarrassed. I even spilled water on myself.

3dijdm86	So for context I 20F have always had dogs and other animals in my life. Basically ever animal besides cats. I just recently got married and moved in with my husband and his cat. His cat doesn’t really do too much and mostly minds his business, but when he doesn’t I can’t stand him. He eats runs into the kitchen and eats my food while I turn around to get a utensil, licks clean dishes, puts his little dirty feet in my drinks. He LOVES to use my leather recliner as a scratching post and pops the leather right in my ear. My husband defends this cat as if his life depends on it. Saying I can’t have food on the kitchen counter, that he needs to ruin my chair cause “that’s just what cats do”. Whenever I say something he starts marking up random complaints about my service dog. Saying he’s annoying cause he walks in front of him and licks him too much. He has full screaming fit at my dog cause he put a toy in his lap. I want this to work but I just cannot stand this cat and how he defends everything it does. AITA for hating this cat?

I asked her who it was when she came out on our way out and she said that it was just Zika baby. He’s about 3 years older than her and she seems to talk with him a lot. She also doesn’t seem to want to talk about him with me and just plays it off as a friend. I’m worried not that she’s cheating but that he’s  more than a friend with him and has feelings to him.

izflad3r	 I (20F) have been close friends with A since highschool. We also went to the same college and were always together. When the pandemic hit, she dropped out. After that I went from seeing and talking to her everyday to not seeing her for months. Once she got a boyfriend, we became distant. I understood because we were adults now with separate lives so it is what it is. I tried to make plans with her but it’ll fail. It got to the point I gave up trying.  After 6 months of not seeing her, my bday came and i invited her to my bday plans. It was gokarting and a dinner. She canceled day before because she had to work. I understood. Hour before my bday plans begun, i had to go to petsmart where I found her with her bf. They were surprising her sister with a turtle. I was confused bc she said she had to work but didn’t bring it up. She said she’ll stop by my house to hang out later but never came.  Time goes on, we make plans to go horseback riding. She cancels day before. I see her after a couple weeks with her little sister & her little sister tells me about their horseback riding trip that she supposedly ‘canceled’. I didn’t say anything but kept a mental note. A month later we make plans to go bowling and she sends me a screenshot of the reservation confirmation. The day of she tells me her card didn’t go through and the reservation never confirmed. I was confused again bc she literally sent me the confirmation. The screenshot had the address and time of the reservation so when the time came, I drove to the bowling arena to see if she was there & she sure was. I was hurt so I blocked her & removed her off social media. A month goes by & her birthday comes. A mutual friend tells me that A posted that everyone was fake & none of her friends wished her happy birthday. I didn’t find out until night that she tried to message me but it wouldn’t go through. She ended up messaging me on Instagram off another account asking why she was blocked. I told her about how I knew she went bowling & lied to me & she always cancels our plans so what friendship do we have. She said it was a misunderstanding bc her bf knew a coworker from the bowling alley & said they can play one game & didn’t want to invite me bc it was just a quick game. She was upset that I blocked her without telling her how I felt & for waiting until her birthday.	1643158502.0	scsxv0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scsxv0/aita_for_cutting_my_friend_off_over_something/	AITA for cutting my friend off over something that might of been a misunderstanding?

The mom was holding the dog down and my mom said don’t let the dog in Stella (my name) is in there and it broke the chain collar and attacked my mom and mailed her right arm (1cm away from a main artery and she would have died the dog was coming to attack my neck)   After this the dad my sister and the high school soccer coach had told the girl basically to exile my sister and had the girls unfriend her.   Now I hate this family and I want them to leave the town I live in and the girl Mikela had started to date many people and it’s was Al over the school everyone hates her she is rude and not kind at all we also live in a small town. So she got in a fight and drama and rumors were spreading all over the place Ainsley is good friends with Mikela and she uses me as a therapist friend( I always listen to my friends and there problems but they don’t do the same) so she is coming to me to let out all her feelings and I really don’t care I just want to leave the town at this point I can’t do the thing I love because of the mauling I can’t me myself there I can’t use the pronouns I want to use at school because rumor will spread so fast it the find out that the “best kid in school” is lesbian and uses she/they pronouns so yeah I want to leave( I plan to apply to a hard to get into school I have all A’s and want to do more for my education because it’s just to easy) so I really am tired of hearing this drama and stuff and I really want to tell her that I don’t care about Mikela or you I have better problems.

inrd05yy	In 2016 i met AJ (13F). I was 15 at the time. now i'm 21 and she's 19. We were very good friends until 2019.. she started focusing more on the negative of my life instead of the positive part of it. she always changed the subject and always talked about her and her problems, she never listened to me. we used to fight because she said that my life and my problems were useless, and that her life was much more interesting, every time we made a phone call she never gave me advice on my problems saying that my life was repetitive and always said that i had to listen to her.  When i took my English courses she told me to pause and answer her calls, i was dumb a few times and i did that, and what was the call about? her complaining about her boyfriend or a date that went wrong (detail that she always said that the call was super important and that i should answer it).  She treated me like a brother (i knew that by her actions, and i also have a brother) and i thought that if i stopped talking to her i would only make the situation worse for her by being ''another brother she lost''. She lost a brother and saw me as figure of him. she also take anxiety meds and once i saw her having an anxiety attack, crying, screaming, her dad was so desperate and i was just sitting watching everything v confused, i thought if i stopped being friends with her things would only get worse. She always wanted to assume what was better for me as if i were a the sims character that you kept changing when you didnt like something, she even said (as i said) that i had no friends and i needed her, that my hair and nose was ugly, etc.  We stopped talking on 2020 by mu choice but she never left me.. My mother gave her my new number and we fought very ugly about it, AJ called me and kept asking me why i didn't answer her, i answered angry saying that i didn't want to be her friend anymore and that she was supposed to leave me alone, instead of her talking to me, she called MY MOTHER and started talking to her about me, her excuse was that i was very unstable. as my mother was angry with me, she took her side, saying that i was unstable and needed a friend like her, that she cared about me and didn't understand why i put her friendship aside. her excuse for calling me for 2 years since we first stopped talking ''forever'' was: ''i never understood why you left me'' even that i explained. she said that i had to review my attitudes. My mother repeated all these words to my face, still saying that the problems she had with drug and cigarette addiction was not a reason to stop talking to her because she is a good friend and cares about me.  She told me that i shouldn't be alone and that life would teach me that this was not something healthy (even that i love being alone :) ps: i really have 0 friends but love loneliness  Am i an asshole for cutting her that way? Had i ignored her anxiety? I'm NOT taking my choice back but still, i'm afraid she'll do something bad to herself because of my choice	1643159392.0	sct9be	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sct9be/aita_for_cutting_my_mentally_unstable_best_friend/	AITA for cutting my mentally unstable best friend?
cx1isr4b	So some back story with name changes of course. Me(20) and my bf Tyler (23) have been together for 6 months. Our relationship has been rocky but we have a good relationship. In the beginning of his relationship I found out he was cheating on me with one of his "long time friend"/ the girl I wasn't supposed to worry about Stacy. His two friends/roommates Rick and Dave (the boys) found out and Rick told his Girlfriend Jasmine (also a roommate). The boys weren't going to say anything but Jasmine got upset. She had the boys tell Tyler what they found and him tell me. It's caused distrust in the friend group (They all have been friends since they were pre-teens) and our relationship. Me and Tyler worked it out and had a session with my therapist to talk it out. Other than that we have a good relationship.  A few days ago I was told that Jasmine's friend Darcy was going to rent a cabin in April and was wondering who all in the friend group is going and to ask me.  He asked said it'll be 200 person I said yes and thought that was that. Me and Darcy don't really get along. She flirts with Tyler in front of me and tries getting with him when I'm not around. I told Tyler I'm no longer comfortable with him hanging around her alone or now if it's them along with Rick and Dave since I heard about them making jokes about those to sleeping together, telling him to do it, ect. Since I told him I wasn't comfortable with it he has respected that. If she's over he'll tell me so its full transparency. Well yesterday she called Jasmine upset that I was invited and how it was just supposed to be the 4.of them (Her,Jasmine,Rick and Tyler) since Dave doesn't want to waste his PTO (understandable) . Jasmine told Tyler who said he won't be going then since he knows that would make me uncomfortable. Jasmine understood fully saying if she was in my situation she wouldn't want Rick going. Tyler told me and said that it would make me uncomfortable and I don't really want him to go. Darcy and the boys are saying I'm being controlling, I shouldn't get to dictate who he's friends with, ect. Tyler isn't budging say that he doesn't want me to be uncomfortable and feels like if he went he would be disrespecting me.   Now Im starting to feel bad I have put him in an uncomfortable with the situation. I don't want him to miss out or take him from his friends. He said he doesn't care and that he's been to those cabins before so he's not missing out. So AITA in this situation?	1643160094.0	scti6d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scti6d/aita_for_not_wanting_my_bf_to_go_on_a_friends_trip/	AITA for not wanting my bf to go on a friends trip
f3r3srs6	I (17nb) was told by my best friend (16f) that her ex had threatened to come to her house this wednesday 10pm and kill her. he seemed pretty serious about it, and he is very unstable. he’s been using other people to get these messages through to her since she blocked him. i begged her to tell someone because he had also asked if she was at work.  (implying he was going to show up and do something) she kept insisting we not say anything to anyone because “it’s a wimp move” and that i’m a pussy for keep wanting to get adults and police involved. Might i also mention that this guy is on probation and is not allowed to have any contact with her at all?     So yesterday i made the decision to tell a teacher, who then advised me to tell police and the principal about this guy, so i did. i asked if i could keep my friends identity a secret so she wouldn’t have to know anything about this, but they figured out who she was pretty quickly against my wishes, and then my friend found out i was the one who reported this whole situation because of it.       she’s now super mad at me for doing this. my friends are saying i did the right thing but i can’t help but feel like i betrayed my friends trust. am i the asshole?	1643160131.0	sctimd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctimd/aita_for_reporting_a_guy_for_threatening_to_kill/	AITA for reporting a guy for threatening to kill my best friend?
j0z4iye7	I've been looking for a girlfriend, and I started chatting with this one person I met recently through the web. She had a great personality and interests similar to mine and we lived in the same state. I let her know I loved her personality and I wanted to get to know her more. She's very sweet and attentive.  She recently sent me a photo of her after I sent one to her and I told her that she was a 6/10 (okay looking, but plain in my book). Granted, she wasn't wearing makeup, but her features are just plain. Not ugly, but not gorgeous either.  She was insulted by this and said that other men had rated her anywhere from a 7-9. I explained that other men may have been nicer to her and not wanted to harm her self-esteem or that she was just more their type. I told her a 6 is not ugly. It's above average, just not incredibly hot, and that she could wear makeup and be an 8 at best, and that I still liked her for her personality.  She told me she wasn't interested in me and never was and that my opinion on her looks counted for nothing because I'm in my late 20's and have only worked dishwashing and retail jobs and haven't been to college.  I wasn't trying to be rude. I was just being honest. Heck, my last girlfriend was a 4 and she was fine with me telling her she was a 4 and we still loved each other.  I then asked all of my friends from high school what they thought and they said that she was extremely hot, even the ones that were even more judgmental than me back then. Most of them said she was a solid 8 and one even said she was a 9 because she had "good bone structure" and "pretty eyes" and a "cute nose."  I thought they were all joking and they weren't. Like...I thought she was plain and average.  What's even worse is that the one who thought she was a 9 actually had mutual friends with her. He got her information from her friends and asked her out and she apparently told him that she likes him too.  I told my friend I was mad at him because I've been single all my life and wanted to date her and that he took her away from me.	1643160927.0	sctslu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctslu/aita_for_telling_my_friend_i_am_mad_at_him/	AITA for telling my friend I am mad at him?
j0zkr3yq	My ex-wife and I have three children “Violet” \[10f\], “Ash” \[7m\] and “Kat” \[2f\]. My ex recently moved to a flat in a nearby city while I live in a house in the same town we lived together in. I pick Violet up from her choir practices on Wednesdays and tennis on Thursdays and Ash up from football/soccer on Fridays. It’s a bit of a drive for me but it’s worth it because I love those drives when I get to have 1-to-1 conversations with them both, while Kat is much harder to get along with. I also have them both on the weekends.  Life at my ex’s flat revolves around Kat, hence why I have to pick the kids up from a school over an hour away from my house sometimes. Violet has to share a room with her and all meals need to be toddler appropriate. I pity the children.  This weekend is Kat’s birthday and my ex is throwing a party in her parents’ garden for select family and friends. I've been invited, although I have no intention of going. Violet and Ash do not want to go either, they spend enough time with one toddler let alone an entire garden full of them, and want to have their usual weekend at my house. However, my ex is trying to convince me to force them to go to the party to ‘bond’ with their sister. She worries that they do not value their relationships with her enough. Violet sent me an email practically begging me not to make her go as she fears being made to entertain the children all afternoon and would much prefer to relax at my house.   My ex has put a lot of work into this party and it is clearly important to her that Violet and Ash go. WouldIBeTheAsshole if I let them stay at mine instead?	1643161373.0	scty86	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scty86/wibta_if_i_dont_make_my_kids_go_to_a_party/	WIBTA If I Don't Make My Kids Go To A Party?
dmwdkc7f	So basically I (21M) met this girl last semester (19F) who was in the process of breaking up with her boyfriend. We were hanging out a lot and we didn’t have sex because she wanted to make sure she was done with her bf before she did anything with anyone else. She would constantly tell me she wanted to have sex with me and that I’d be the next guy she’d do it with. She would say she wanted to go on a trip with me and have wild sex etc. We’d talk about our kinks, fantasies, and all that good stuff all the time.   Fast forward to the end of the semester and she keeps saying she wants to hang out a lot over break. Then she starts dodging me and she got with another guy who she is now dating. When I asked her about it she denied it and said she didn’t have a bf and still wanted to hang out. So I continue to ask her to hang out and she continues to dodge me.   We finally meet up and talk at school and she keeps saying it’s complicated although some slight social media stalking tells me she is basically with the dude constantly. She tells me she still wants to be friends and hang out but then and there I called her out for leading me on the entire time and she got really upset. She claims she did have feelings for me but this thing with the other guy just happened and she didn’t know how to tell me. I called her a manipulative liar who led me on so I’d help her with hw and stuff and she claims that’s not the case and now she’s really upset with me. I didn’t really care at first because I just wanted to get that off of my chest but now I feel like an ass since she denies leading me on and is claiming she did really like me. Am I the asshole or was I right to be straight up with her and tell her how I felt about everything?  TL;DR this girl led me on for most of a semester. I aggressively called her out on it and she claims that she did like me but didn’t know how to say she started seeing someone else because she didn’t wanna hurt my feelings. Now I feel like an ass.	1643161525.0	scu02k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu02k/aita_for_calling_a_girl_out_for_leading_me_on/	AITA for calling a girl out for leading me on?
j0zf15d0	My (19F) friend (19M) was with me getting food, and he didn’t put back his cart, which is not illegal or against the rules I’m pretty sure.  Some dude (40s) came up to my car and shoved his phone in my face. He was like “I’m videotaping you until your friend puts that cart back. I legally have the right to videotape you. There’s no right to privacy in a public place.”  My friend and I jumped out of the car and got out our phones and shoved them right back in his face and started videotaping him. My friend and I started advancing, videotaping him and holding our phones out in his face. He was backing up with his phone still out in our faces and was saying to the camera “Two miscreants shoving shopping carts around the parking lot, now confronting me and harassing me.”   So I said on camera “Karen guy came up to our car and started threatening and harassing us when we have not broken any laws.” And my friend has a big TikTok presence, and he kept yelling at the guy “Smile, bitch. You’re going to be TikTok famous.”  The guy kept trying to advance on us with his camera, but we had our cameras out in front of us and advanced on him instead. Until he left and said he’d call 911. And I was like “No, I’ll call 911. You’re the instigator.” But he fled.	1643161626.0	scu1cr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu1cr/aita_for_videotaping_someone_who_videotaped_me/	AITA for videotaping someone who videotaped me first?
6h1jj8ar	Hi all, Disclaimer: this isn’t me. I’m asking this as if I were the person I was speaking to and I’m just wondering if this person is reasonable or a bit of an a-hole. This is how it was told to me:  My sister (1 year older than me) had to undergo a hysterectomy for a life threatening situation at the birth of her second child. She always wanted a third. She asked me whether I would consider being a surrogate for her third child. She said she would pay for IVF, all medical expenses, top health insurance with top extras coverage (12 months prior to birth and 6 months after), travel expenses (if needed), a deluxe suite hospital stay, private OB of my choice and post partum care including exercise physiology and physiotherapy for 6 months pp. My work will pay me 14 weeks of my full salary and the government will pay me 18 weeks of minimum wage benefits. I already have one child with no pregnancy complications and I’m not opposed to being pregnant again. Commercial surrogacy is illegal where we live so the amount she pays me is to cover my losses and expenses arising out of the pregnancy. She said I wouldn’t need to breastfeed or express milk at all and to take medication and strap up after birth. The thing is, I told her that those expenses are needed but I would also need her to pay for an additional 8 weeks of my salary on top of what my works 14 weeks paid leave, a personal trainer 2-3 times a week for 6 months and for a boob job and a tummy tuck. She said she couldn’t afford plastic surgery, an additional 8 weeks of my salary (I earn about $115K pa excluding superannuation), 2-3 PT sessions a week for 6 months on top of IVF and the expenses she would have to cover. She was relaxed and said that it’s my body my choice but it was a shame I would place such high conditions on something that means so much to her when she nearly died in childbirth and lost her uterus. She said she wouldn’t ask for so much if I required a kidney or organ donation. She seems disappointed.   AITA for wanting her to pay for additional salary, PT and plastic surgery if I was to carry her child for her?	1643161629.0	scu1dt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu1dt/aita_for_my_surrogacy_requirements/	AITA for my surrogacy requirements?
j0op1wud	I’ve held my internship position for about a year. My mom recently suggested that I create a handbook for new interns to help them get the hang of things a bit faster. I said it was an interesting idea but that was it.   Next thing I know, my mom is creating the ENTIRE handbook. She tells me that she put in 80+ hours of work into it. Researching my job position, the company, and incorporating what she thinks would be beneficial for interns to know. But in my opinion, there’s a lot missing.  My mom works in a similar field, but knows very little about my office-she has never worked there. The handbook doesn’t really capture my job duties all too well. Anyways, she spends $200 getting multiple hard copies of this book made and bound up for me to submit to my boss. She insists that it will make a great impression on my boss and will be my golden ticket to a promotion. She keeps saying how hard she worked on this book. I feel bad, but I literally never asked her to do this. She’s really pressuring me to submit it, even though I have a ton of doubts. For starters, I had absolutely nothing to do with this book. How can I take credit for work that’s not mine? And, I think my boss could think I’m overstepping.  Am I the asshole if I don’t submit this handbook in to my boss after my mom worked so hard on it?

To get more evidence that she was, in fact, a 6 or lower, and that I was being generous, I sent photos of her to my guy friends from high school. They were all kinda douchey back then and did a lot of locker room talk stuff and I expected them to say she was a a 5 or 6 or maybe even a 4.  However, this one guy said she was a 9 and found out that he had mutual friends and asked them for her info and asked her out on a first date on Sunday. He found out that she liked him too and now they're official.  He posts photos of her all over his social media and seems enamored with her and I'm annoyed because I met her first.  Moreover, I'm older than he is and have had less relationship experience than him, and he can get girls easily because he's handsome and accomplished.

I've been getting insecure lately, He feels so distant and I've been wanting to ask him to maybe play DND a little less, so we could talk more, but it feels like kind of an asshole move...

hc9voi6s	My husband and I have been married for 15 years and we live in a different house. He has a sister, who got married last 2015. I wasn't very close to my SIL husband, but we talk about some family matters.  When we visited them, 3 months ago, I knew there was something wrong between, him and SIL, so my H and I decided to go home.  After a few weeks, he sent me a message and confessed about what happen and apologized for his rude behavior. (H was irritated with him because of it).  So, there, he told me something I could never imagine.  Just a little background.  Husband's family are all active in church. They would always ask us to attend the church once in a while.  He told me that when we visited them, he found out that SIL, is having sex with our churchmates, even her coworkers, and sadly cousins too.. in exchange of money.  He was devastated that time and couldn't control his feelings.  I really didn't know what to say because my SIL works outside. (That's what we know because we don't live with them. ) SIL husband's income is enough to feed their family and pay their bills.   Our parents in law always ask money to SIL, and didn't even know that it is going too far already.   He sent me a lot of evidences, and my SIL admitted it already to him.   Now, I felt like I also want to stop going to that church, felt humiliated too because of what's happening behind us.   AITA here for not telling my husband about it?   FYI, my husband respects SIL so much, but I feel like he also needs to know what SIL is doing and how PIL, should stop asking for money to SIL.   My SIL husband begged me not to tell anyone about it, but I feel like my H can do something about it to stop.PIL don't know anything about the sex thing too.   Their parents own multiple apartments, but don't know how to handle their money. They have a lot of debts. I used to live with them for 4 years, but decided to get our of their house because of that. Luckily, H listened to me so we are still together up to now.

Before he started playing online with us we had minimal contact. So he always had this feeling that we were conspiring against him due to us having been friends longer. We’ve tried telling him multiple times over the years he’s a valued friend like everyone else. Which he was. For a while. A few months in he really started revealing how easily upset he could be. He, to this day still gets pissed off and leaves when we:  - Don’t want to play the same game as him  - Side on an opinion against him  - Are playing games he doesn’t like  Now. I would like to think that my friends and I have been relatively patient with him over the past few years. It was normal for us to agree on something to play only for him to without saying anything. I know they didn’t like him, but they tolerated him because he’s related to me. So around 2020 my friends and I started really getting irritated. We tried multiple times to tell him our gripes we had with him and that we weren’t going to put up with it. He starting threatening to leave the group to which we said “cooling off for a while might be best.” Sort of nudging him to take a break. Half for his sake half for ours. He was gone for a few months. Over that time we realized we didn’t get into a single scuffle. Fast forward to now. He’s been back a long while with no real change to him. Today he started texting me how pissed he was that we weren’t going to play his new favorite game “Dead by Daylight”. I was currently grinding some Dark Souls 3 with the lads and told him that i’d gladly play tonight. He then started to threaten to leave the group again. To which I just agreed. The last thing he said to me was “have fun”. And we did!  As for some closing thoughts. I thought I should post this because encouraging someone years younger than me to leave a friend group feels really wrong. But at the same time it feels like a weight lifted off my chest. I can count on one hand the amount of times I fought with my friends over a decade. But he had an outburst at least twice a week. Thank you for reading and I’m sorry if I didn’t go into a lot of detail, I just didn’t want to make this longer than it had to be.	1643163445.0	scunkc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scunkc/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_it_was_good_for_him_to/	AITA for telling my cousin it was good for him to leave our friend group?
dg8ixgcf	Preface: my ex and I have known each other since the early 90s. He, and I know how this sounds, very intentionally got me pregnant when I didn't want to be. I fell in love with my daughter when she was born and she changed my life. He, however, has never stopped drinking or driving, or drinking and driving with children (not mine) in the vehicle.   He has made it a habit of hurting her with grand announcements of visits and trips that have never happened. Also, he informed us that she will be a sister soon but couldn't understand why she might take that negatively.   As a mother, I'm done. I told him he needs counseling and parenting classes. So AITA?	1643163697.0	scuqjw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scuqjw/aita_for_telling_my_ex_he_has_to_be_sober/	AITA for telling my ex he has to be sober
ifxwfml3	I'm a recovering people pleaser who used to be obsessed with people liking me. I could never understand why I couldn't click with her, and it really bothered me. IMO I’ve gone out of my way to be nice to her. I helped her write and admission letter for school, I've continually gotten expensive and personalized gifts for her family and my young nephew for every occasion, I helped her friend plan a surprise bridal shower lunch for her..etc. I have never received the same kindness.Most family events or gatherings she will enter the room and look at me and my fiancé and not speak. Sometimes will not even utter a "hello" If someone else pays me attention, or asks me questions about my job, or how school is going, or wedding planning she will turn away and not engage in conversation. My fiancé is gone most of the time working away and when he comes home she again, doesn't acknowledge him, ask him how he's doing.nothing. When I first got engaged and came to the family home to show off my ring and talk proposal deets, everyone but her was so excited. They asked to see my ring, gave me hugs, congratulated us, and she again sat there with nothing to say other then, "Yeah, I guilted \*fiancés name\* into showing me the ring months ago." Beyond rude. It's been a frustrating journey. For further context, we both work together in the same building, in the same field. I felt there was no reason we couldn't be friends and go out to lunch and coffee on breaks. No, I never asked her but, I felt like I couldn't. We don't have that relationship unfortunately. This issue came to a head recently. I admit, I did discuss some deets about my relationship at work which in hindsight I never should have. I don't recall saying anything other then "we don't have a relationship, she barely speaks to me..." Just my truth. I don't feel this was badmouthing her, I thought I was getting advice from older co-workers. But, naïve me, not realizing that you don't know how word will get back to her. She recently confronted me, at work for "talking shit about her" at the nursing station, and she allegedly heard be while in the hallway. Her accusation was not true, I wasn't talking about her, I never even mentioned her name. She then told me that I should "Not talk about her shit and she won't talk about my shit" and then stated she heard I talk about her within the building, on other occasions. When I asked her what she heard she never said anything other then "I heard you don't like me" I feel I am guilty of talking about her, even though the context of those conversations I truly feel I wasn't "talking shit" And then to accuse me of talking about her a few feet away from her is a new low. I'm at the point now I no longer care if her and I have no relationship, or if she likes me. I feel its an impossible task. However, I now fear the narrative she is going to tell my other co-workers, and make me look like an a\*\*hole. The question is, AITA?	1643163939.0	scutjl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scutjl/aita_for_discussing_family_drama_at_work/	AITA For Discussing Family Drama at Work?
j0sr5u2f	My roommate was chosen by my landlord and moved in last year in September. She was ok not very clean but ok. Then she got pregnant in Nov probably by her bf and he started coming over all the time. He creeped me out from the beginning and would walk around in boxers and no shirt often and I told repeatedly not to do it but he just ignored me. Then I noticed sometimes the money in my wallet was low. A couple dollars here a 20 there kind of a thing. I was pretty sure in was her bf so kept my wallet on me all the time. I told my roommate and she dismissed me and I didn’t have any evidence other than it was only him or her in the apartment. Then my benzos disappeared. Not all at the same time but one at a time. I have panic attacked and am given a few benzos at a time for them but haven’t used them lately. I suspected it was him again  and bought a hidden indoor camera. A few days later the bf came in and opened my nightstand and stole 2 of my benzos. I got the whole thing on video and showed my roommate. She begged me to just let it go and when I threatened to call the police threatened me saying she knows guys that would come and beat the crap out of me. I also had that recorded via hidden camera and told her to move out or I would bring it to the police. She said she would break up with him and I told her if she wanted to stay I would go to the police with the video. It was a month to month lease so she could but of course she didn’t have much money and probably would either be living with him or on the streets. Turns out her bf is an ex con and addict which explains stealing my drugs. She did move out after giving notice yelling at me that I was ruining her life. I’m sure the reason she did that was to avoid him going back to jail since he’s still on probation. I feel kind of conflicted because I wanted them gone and I didn’t want to leave the apartment because it is the cheapest place I can find that’s decent but AITA for forcing her to leave?	1643164777.0	scv3zp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scv3zp/aita_for_blackmailing_my_roommate_into_moving_out/	AITA for blackmailing my roommate into moving out?
j10ltoqi	Hello, before I start this, I go by they/them. I respect Neo pronouns, to it/thing pronouns. But one day my friend asked a groupchat if they could use it pronouns on everyone. So I had said "no I like being human-" but it was a joke. My friend didn't like my joke however. He goes by he/him but his friend goes by it/thing apparently and then sent me a list they had of pronouns. These were not pronouns though. They were words like crime, sol, error, bitch,fuck, youareanidiot, UwU, OwO, http , gif,/, -, !, and it even had emoj 🔆, 🕸, 🌈, 💀. My favorite one was softfuzzyman. He then told me I was being irrational and I even got blocked.

16j4of	POV: I'm 22.  I did some Google searching and apparently sneaking in and out of the house is childish?! I just don't want to announce whenever I'm leaving because my mom is nosy and I don't want her to know where I'm going (I was going to hook up with someone, and I'm not a very "outside" person, so I didn't have a good excuse for where I might have been). So yeah, I snuck out at 8 PM and snuck back in at 9 PM. But my mom heard the door open and called out to see who it was. I tried to close it and sneak off but she came to investigate and got scared when she saw me. She yelled at me a bunch not to do stuff like that and that I should have told her I was there when she called out. It didn't feel that serious to me.   I told her that saying I was there would defeat the purpose of sneaking in. She asked why I was sneaking in and out. I told her why does anyone sneak in and out and asked her hasn't she snuck out before? She says not at 22 and I just walk away, because I feel like that's a lie. My mom likes to convince herself of things in order to feel right. And I have no idea what she was doing at 22 years old, but I know she's had to have tried to sneak in or out at one point or another. I didn't want to argue anymore, but now I do feel bad about it. Am I the asshole?	1643165317.0	scvaiy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvaiy/aita_for_scaring_my_mom_by_sneaking_into_the_house/	AITA for scaring my mom by sneaking into the house?
beqsgot1	We have been married for 10 years. She stopped shaving because "it´s too cold" or "next week maybe". I mean, she was not like this when I met her or when we got married. I never agreed to this. I personally hate body hair and she knows it. Everything is good between us, no other problems. I love her and respect, support her as much as possible but hairy legs is something disgusting for me. I have tried to ignore it but I swear I cant even touch her legs, I just cant.	1643165642.0	scvele	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvele/aita_for_asking_my_wife_to_shave_her_legs/	AITA for asking my wife to shave her legs?
j102ne61	My friend recently started dating a girl that I didn't feel was special in any way. I had met her before and thought she had a great personality, but was average looking. However, when he saw a photo of her, he thought she was extremely gorgeous. He later found out he had mutual friends with her, got her contact info, messaged her, and asked her out.   I asked him how he won over her and he said that he flirted with her and made his intentions clear and complimented her.  I then asked what he saw in her and he said that he loved her personality and ambition and that her physical traits, like nice cheekbones, eyes, and a cute nose were a plus and I told him I disagreed and thought she was average.   He got mad at me and told me that my reaction was the reason I had no luck with women.	1643165701.0	scvfbe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvfbe/aita_for_asking_my_friend_what_he_sees_in_his/	AITA for asking my friend what he sees in his girlfriend?
h2i7c7l0	Hi. First, i'm sorry for my bad english, i'm not a native speaker.  My (23f) dad (49m)  had the c-19 the last week. I tell a friend about the situation bc he asked me if i wanna go out, obviusly  i didn't bc i don't knew if i was in the same situation even if i hadn't symtoms. I'd a test and the result was negative. I tell him, but i didn't see him anyway bc i'm stil expouse to the virus in my house and i prefer to be careful. A few hours ago, my friend text me 'Hey, are you a zombie now'? I think the cuestion is a little insensible bc he don't know my dad's status, he could be very bad and my family and me could be with the virus too, but the true is we're fine and maybe i'm being exaggerated. I didn't respond anyway.

huaktk7g	I, 22 F use to have this friend. we became friends through work and we got along great for awhile. but after some time I realized how toxic she was. she was always living in the past and could never bring herself to move forward with her life. during our friendship I went to college and graduated and even tried dating (covid put an end to that). while all she did was work, complain and work. even when we went out for a girls night it was the same thing. she would complain about wanting to find a better job, not being ale to find time to date as well as her past trauma.  but anyways, it eventually led me telling her that I couldn't be her friend if she was gonna be stuck in this loop. this wasn't gonna be goodbye forever, I still cared and still do care about her and I want her life to get better but she needs to pull herself together.  we see each other every couple of months cuz I live close to where I use to work and where she currently works.   this evening my friend and I made plans for her to come over for some food and video games. I went out to get us some desert. on my walk back I saw my ex friend infant of work waiting for her mom to pick her up. we said hello and caught up a little I told her about my new job and some projects im working and then she asked me what I was up to tonight. I kinda just blurted out "my girlfriend is coming over for food and I'm showing her the Uncharted Games before we go see the movie".  for context I'm BI, my friend is lesbian and my ex friend is also Bi  my eyes got wide when I realized what I said (luckily it was dark so she couldn't see clearly) but before I could correct myself she said in a bit of a sad tone "how long have you been seeing her?".  and I kinda just went with it, I figured maybe it would motivate her to get out of her funk. I responded with "I met her in college and we started going out about 6 months ago".  she responded with " oh that's nice"  I then said I had to go cuz she would be here soon so we said our goodbyes and we went on our separate ways.  my friend and I are just friends, she has even said that im not her type romantically so there is no chance of us being together at all. but I do feel bad about lying to my ex friend, and at the same time I really wanted to inspire her to try and improve herself.  so....

9ypof0k0	Today I booked an appointment for a silkpress. The session was supposed to last 1hr and 30mins and cost 200. The session ended up lasting 5 hours and costing 350 because my hair was badly matted. (I have depression and have super long curly hair. So I go weeks without combing my hair and it mats together). I honestly didn't think it was that bad, but turns out, I literally had DREADLOCS in the back of my hair. It's was embarrassing because I also have really bad scalp condition. But my stylist was kind and worked with me. Since the service ended up being 150 dollars more than I expected I didn't have much money for a tip. So I only tipped 30. But I honestly feel like shit because my stylist spent HOURS combing through my hair. I plan on going back in a few weeks for another wash and styling session. Just to keep up with hair maintenance to make sure it never gets back to that state. My next appointment should only cost like 100 dollars but I plan on tipping 50. My sister said this is unnecessary because I already paid so much for the hair, and that a tip isn't necessary.  But honestly I feel like such a piece of shit and I'm so conflicted.	1643166507.0	scvpeq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvpeq/aitah_for_giving_only_tipping_10_percent/	AITAH For Giving Only Tipping 10 percent
d5j1tza3	I, 7th grade girl, is posting things about my life on my sc story, but sometimes inappropriate things without context, like inside jokes, a lot of sex jokes, and basically teenager shit.  My 15 year old brother constantly barges into my room to try to check my stories, which i have 2 private story’s so he cannot see.  It makes me very uncomfortable when he does that, cuz it’s MY LIFE and private for a reason.  He keeps saying idc when i ask him to stop checking my phone, and most of the time takes it away for 1-2 days.  it’s not his phone, and it’s my life.  I don’t post abt him, but i’ll lie about some stuff bc it’s really embaressing or it’s really secretive information about me.  My parents are asian, and they grew up in asia and their pretty old, so they don’t know slang nowadays and think I shouldn’t know about SEX and DRUGS in 7th grade.  I think i am NTA tbh, and i made this so I could receive advice on how to fucking confront him.  more info on my brother, when he’s trying to take my phone we start fighting and since he’s stronger, he always ends up somewhat hurting me, and threatens me that he’ll expose my sexuality to my parents, who are homophobic or that he will “pound my head in”  I try to avoid him but his lonely ass always comes into my room and tries to get my parents to check my storie or take my phone.

io20zmx4	My(18F) boyfriend(22M) held a lighter up to my arm when I wasn’t looking. It wasn’t directly on my skin, but close enough to where I eventually felt the heat. My hair goes to my mid back, I’ve been growing it out for a couple years now and am finally taking of it, it’s my favorite feature rn. When I finally noticed he was holding the lighter to my arm, I saw that he had singed a pretty big part in my hair, maybe an inch or two!! I was pissed.. I screamed at him and called him stupid. He doesn’t think it was a big deal at all, saying it didn’t really burn much. My mom thinks I was overreacting while a couple of my friends think I was in the right to yell.

j0ul6dwf	I’m a 14 year old male in 8th grade. My cousin is an 18 year old male in 12th grade.  He and his family used to life far away, but in August, they moved to a house about 5 minutes from ours.  We saw them about 2-3 times since they moved. But my mom and dad had to go out of town for a week, and wanted me to stay with my cousin.  He’s fucking creepy as hell. First, let’s start with his appearance. He’s 6 ft 3, he’s white, has an extremely hairy beard and mustache, has tattoos all over his face and arms, and has a nose ring. On top of mature clothing.  He looks like a rebel. Who needs that many tattoos, and a fucking nose ring? Not to mention his facial hair is extremely hairy.  He wears his shoes on inside of the house, he spits on the ground, he doesn’t have his shirt on all the time, he spills everywhere, he stands on furniture, he’s smelly (not like he hasn’t taken a shower, he has certain odors), he drinks full sodas out of bottles making him look drunk as hell.   He invited his boyfriend over (his boyfriend is 35), and they kiss every goddamn second. The only thing that’s weird is he dates a 35 year old. I get even more creeped out by his boyfriend.  Finally, my cousin offered to take me out yesterday, and on the way, he got a text message, and then stopped by a strip club, and just left me there for 45 minutes.  That was the last straw. I refuse to go anywhere with him, and I’m dreading any time I spend with him.  My cousin looks like a rebel and he is a rebel. And I’m creeped af by him.

88qtqcec	So this happened last Friday, my university was having its yearly talent show. My passion is video editing so I decided I wanted to submit a music video.  I wanted to dedicate this video to my crush. I use the song “House of memories” by panic at the disco because it makes me think of her and it’s our song.  I told her it was for a school project when filming so she agreed to it. I think this white lie wasn’t that big of a deal.  Fast forward to Friday, my music video is on the big screen for the talent show. It was a form of expression of how I really felt about her. I witnessed her leaving the auditorium half way through the video.  She snap chatted me this weekend saying how I humiliated her in front of the whole school and should have told her the truth.  What do you guys think, I was really trying to impress her and I thought it would be sweet of me.

d4jt16k5	This is a bumpy ride and I give a lot of context so yea… also I’m sorry in advance for it being all over the place  I (26 f) have been friends with Anna (24 f) for roughly 10 years on and off. We met through a mutual friend at the time on a relationship type thing but I then realized I was trying to figure myself out and didn’t want that. Keep in mind, this was when I was about 16.   Fast forward. The first incident happened when I met my ex boyfriend at the time. We all became close and even double dated. I had a health scare and she didnt check in and wanted me to call and let her know what was going on…., I was focusing on not dying. My ex was there and she basically told me I pick him all the time and we stopped being friends.   Fast forward about 2 years. We started back talking…. And been “cool” for 6 years without bumping heads. She have been there for the most part when I was battling depression.   She also is engaged to John (27 m) but they been on the rocks. (Keep John in mind)  However, after getting over that hump in my life and moving and doing better, she got a great job offer 10 hours away. I told her I didn’t think it was a great move but I’m there for her.   When she went out there John and her eventually broke up. It was bad, but back to the point. Some how she got caught up in something and went to jail. When she went to jail, John help bail her out, I signed forms to help get her out, etc and she was free. She ended up coming back home after some time and I offered my extra room for her and John.   So, currently it is almost the end of Jan 2022 and she been here since the end of Nov 2021…. During the month of December they took two week long trips. Have no not at all got a job but recently. Have not offered to pay for groceries, gas, any bills after getting a job. This was the straw that broke the camels back however….  John car got stolen during a trip and I drove 15 hours to get her and didn’t get a single thank you. When I voiced that…. All Anna said was “I shouldn’t have to fun you for you be feel appreciated” when I voiced that my feelings was being hurt I got “maybe you need to work on you because that’s something you’re just dealing with” it was at that point…. I realized I am done.   Would I be the asshole if I ended this friendship? Obviously I’m leaving some things out but this is the major things…..	1643167388.0	scw09z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scw09z/aitafriendship_edition/	AITA-friendship edition
xewwt6d	So for clarification, I am a college student and I do not live in a dorm, I pay for my own school and my mother allows me to live here rent free at the house while I take care of everything so I don't have to take out unnecessary expenses. Her boyfriend has always had serious anger issues and is an alcoholic that can derail things and take things way too far. My father used to have serious anger issues as well when I was little and would throw things and yell at me and my mother about little things, and me and my mother would go into the bedroom and shut the door so neither of us had to be exposed to it, thankfully my father has grown as a person and is no longer in a situation like that. Unfortunately my mother's partner can't seem to grow at all as a human being and still consistently picks fights with me and my mother for seemingly no reason at times, yells a lot and has threatened physical violence with me and destruction of my personal belongings. My mother tells me that he's justified in some of the anger towards me because of my "attitude towards doing things" due to being "busy" at home most times, which is accurate because I work a part time job and do college full time. I admit my attitude towards some things can improve but when her partner enters my room like he just did tonight, and pushes my chair at my desk to the side, takes my headphones off my head and stands in front of me telling me to go "apologize to my mother for being disrespectful" after telling her I had to work on something for school and could not take the dog out at the precise moment. I told him to get out of my face, to which he responded by shoving me and poking me in my chair and getting more in my face. I told him to just leave my room because he was not helping anything and was causing an issue, and he decided it would be a good idea to step back and cross his arms next to my desk. I continued to tell him to leave and he didn't do it. There have been many times where he has threatened me with physical harm before and I'm entirely sick of it, and living here is one step away from hell. In some previous cases I have been scared enough to actually hide in places around the house because of his anger towards me, and it's the worst feeling ever. My mother told him to leave and he finally did, but she doesn't seem to care that he's quite literally threatening harm to me. I told my mother I would get someone to do something about it if he did anything again, and she told me that if I do she will throw me out on the street and expect me to find another place. I really can't tell if I'm the asshole here because this has been happening for years and I really don't know what's right and wrong anymore.  &#x200B;  tl;dr mother's partner has threatened me with harm and mom refuses to do anything about it, I told her I'd get someone involved and she said she'd throw me out.	1643167668.0	scw3nm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scw3nm/aita_for_telling_my_mother_ill_do_something_if/	AITA for telling my mother I'll do something if her partner keeps messing with me
61nhuopt	I (14 f) and my friend (14f) are very close and we get along pretty well. My friend doesn't act like she's 14 and is constantly doing things to try and act grown. Which, if that's what she wants to do whatever. I'm just genuinely concerned about her safety. For example on instagram she posted a picture in VS lingerie and her comments were filled with disgusting comments from men in their 20s-40s. I texted her and was like "Hey considering the fact your 14 you probably shouldn't post pictures in underwear" and she got super mad at me and told me that I just need to mind my own business. The other day she posted a video of her drinking vodka and smoking weed, in the video she was around men that looked like they were in their 30s. I called her mom and her mom isn't even letting her go to school right now and she's currently homeschooled. I know what I did was probably for the best but I kinda feel bad because her parents are being extremely strict on her.

7gr2yw56	Apologies for the formatting, I’m on mobile lol and I just wanna rant.   First things first, my dad’s (57) a whore lol. He cheated on his previous wife with her sister and my mother (56) with multiple women. I (21) knew about his actions since I was 5. He thought he was slick but he wasn’t. Kids aren’t stupid, they’re more intuitive than you think.   Today, I saw my dad pick up his phone and I saw the contact name was his side piece. I never confronted him about these things because I never felt bold enough to ask until today. I just told him that I wasn’t stupid and I knew about the side piece. He then proceeds to tell me my mother knows everything and that he has an 8 month old child with this bitch.   In my head I said no way. I immediately told him I never want to speak to him again. He’s disgusting, vile, disrespectful, etc. I called his side piece any and every single thing you could think of (because if you didn’t know about the wife that’s one thing, but shorty knew lol. She’s gross). He then said my mom knows about that too, just not taking any accountability whatsoever.   I finally said that I didn’t care about the kid, I just cared about the fact that him disrespecting my mother so blatantly hurts me. That he should just leave the house because it was obvious he didn’t care for or respect my mother enough to leave before he cheated in the first place. (My reaction, I will admit, was a bit childish but I was so hurt and I have a tendency to talk before I think lol). He said that I’ll never understand bc I’m too young (I’m literally an adult but ok) and I shouldn’t disrespect him because he’s my father. My mothers mad at me because I “disturbed the peace in the house” but I feel like I’m justified in my reaction. I just don’t understand why my mother isn’t as angry as I am.

j11xkx84	For many years, my wife and I were blind to our daughter(who's now 14)'s weight issues. We always passed it off as not that bad, something we would eventually handle, every excuse in the book. Well, we took her to a doctor recently and found out how out of hand things have gotten. The doctor was concerned given how much she weighed, so we took her to a nutritionist and have taken his advice as well, threw out the junk and have tried to get her to exercise. She's not happy with these changes, and we get that, we anticipated it. We've explained that this is something that has to be done for her own good, so that her future isn't plagued by the many problems being overweight brings.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  my side of the family thinks that my wife and I are, more or less being overbearing and that our daughter should get to choose what she eats and what her body is. Our case to them is that, we're stepping in now because we don't want her future to be riddled with issues.  &#x200B;  AITA?	1643168227.0	scwaf3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwaf3/aita_for_upholding_a_lifestyle_change_for_my/	AITA for upholding a lifestyle change for my daughter
8v9lkys7	My ex friend (27M) and I (26M) met in high school while I was a highschool freshman. We were assigned as lab partners, so we’d be doing a lot of work together for the year. We actually became friends, and he was my first close friend. By the end of the school year we were practically inseparable.  He picked up a bad habit of stealing the next year. It was just small things for a while, but he started doing more. The school year ended though, and he started working. It looked like he broke his stealing habit, but then he told me about stealing from the drive through register. That crossed a line, but I didn’t want to cause a rift between us. I made sure he knew I didn’t approve of it though, and he promised he would stop.  Fast forwarding a couple of years, we started college and moved in together. He cleaned and I cooked. We also argued. Mostly over petty stuff, but sometimes it was more.  One night he came home around 3am because he went to hang out at his friend’s place and fell asleep there. He was barely coherent and hadn't responded to my messages or calls. Things escalated, and I got confrontational about it since this wasn’t the first time. This kind of stuff kept happening for our first year in college.  One day during our second year a knock came at our door and it turned out to be cops with a search warrant. I had no idea why, so I let them in. After a bit, one of them said he found a pistol hidden inside a bin beside the washing machine, apparently. I had no idea it was there. It wasn’t the fact that my friend hid a gun that pissed me off, it was the fact that he didn’t tell me.  I spent the night in jail. They got my friend as he was leaving class, and he spent the night in jail too. I gave him an earful for it and he was pretty apologetic. He said he had it for self defense, and didn’t tell me because he hoped that he wouldn't have to use it. The next day they took him in for questioning, and that was the last time I saw him.  I was taken in for questioning, and they told me we could be on the hook for illegal possession of a firearm and possible relation to a burglary in the area. They asked if I knew anything about the pistol, and I said no. They asked if my roommate might have known anything about the pistol, and I started panicking a bit (I've been diagnosed with anxiety for years). I said he was the only person who was ever really in that area of the apartment, so he probably would know more than I did. They took it as evidence, and things just went from there. Turns out he was associated with the burglary as part of some stupid dare. He ended up in jail for a year and had two years of parole. I don't talk to him anymore, especially since I think I’m pretty much the reason he got arrested.  Am I the asshole for not telling my best friend from high school that I inadvertently got him sent to jail after letting cops into our apartment for a warranted search where they found an illegal firearm that I had no idea he had?	1643168240.0	scwaki	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwaki/aita_if_i_got_my_high_school_best_friend_sent_to/	AITA if I got my high school best friend sent to jail and never told him I was kind of the reason he got caught?

j129a1pp	I m25 has been married to my wife who's 25 for 3 years and we have a 2-year-old son together. I and my wife met during my breakup with my ex-girlfriend. My ex was my first love and she still holds a special place in my heart. I started dating my now wife to get over her and I eventually started to love her but it's not the kind of love I had/have for my ex. Don't get me wrong I love her and I love that she gave me my son but it's not the same. I've tried to get over my feelings before getting married but they become stronger whenever we talk. I've has so many dreams about touching my ex again which gets me so turned on than thinking about my actual wife. Recently my ex has been sending me messages that some would say are inappropriate and I've been replying with the same energy. We have been sending pictures back and forth and we plan on meeting up. I know I can't stay loyal if I do see her but I can't help myself. I'm think about getting an divorce because I don't want to hurt my wife but the love I have for my ex is still very much there.	1643168581.0	scwejn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwejn/aita_if_i_left_my_wife_for_my_ex/	AITA if I left my wife for my ex?
ija5c	 My fiancé (43M) and I (44F) have been together for 2 years. We have decided on a small wedding 60 people MAX for June of this year.  We told both of our parents early on that we are having a SMALL wedding, 60 people max. We sent out our 1st round invites to our closest family/friends, last august. The deadline for RSVPs is 1/31/22.  His mother made requests to have invitations sent to cousins/family/friends and he told her that we would consider the request, but, it would depend on the RSVPs we received back on the deadline (as we had agreed).  I sent my mother and her BF separate invites. My mother said that she was going to take her friend to my wedding as her plus 1. My mother stated that "my aunt suggested" I invite THEIR cousin (my mother and aunt's) as "we should consider the gifts we would get and \[her cousin\] gives good gifts" \[side note: this cousin has NEVER reached out to me at all personally, so we are NOT close\]. I told my mother the same thing he told his mother.  Last weekend my mother called me and started the conversation with "didn't I tell you to invite \[my cousin\]?" I repeated my previous statement about it being a small wedding and we had to stay under 60 people. I was waiting on the RSVPs. She asked if I had invited some of my cousins and I said no. She asked if my cousin, who is one of my bridesmaids, is bringing her GF and I said Yes, as her plus 1. My mother proceeded to also ask if I invited her other sister who lives another country, but will be in the US at the time of my wedding, again I said no. She then made some comment implying that my fiancé must be taking up all of the invites as I keep telling her no I didn't invite all of my large family on this continent to the wedding. She also implies that I must be inviting my friends over "who's important" (meaning family). At this point, I am losing my temper, and I tell her that is ABSOLUTELY not the truth, and MY side has all the invites. My Fiancé does not have a big family on either side. Here's where it gets even dicier: my mother says to me: "Well if \[my cousin\] isn't going, then maybe I shouldn’t go either". I was stunned. She says that her cousin is very important to her, I know she is, but she is NOT important to ME, and I repeat my earlier sentiments to her. She says that she will tell her BF to "forget" going to my wedding. I am so mad that I say nothing, as I know I will say something that I will regret later. She suggests that maybe she will un-invite her friend instead. I tell her "I don't know what to tell you, but this is the situation."  I think at this point my mother realized that what she is saying is offending/hurting me, as she says: "Maybe I shouldn't have said that. You're my daughter and I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry". Frankly, I don't want to accept her apology, but I also know that I should. I tell her “Ok" and pretty much leave it at that. I cut the conversation as I am mad and hang up the phone.

95r97mr3	I've been working at an IT firm with 400+ clients with only 10 people in our department. As we are short staffed like the rest of the world, I wear many hats.   One of my many hats is to talk with clients about their new hire and termination policies. I took this up one day on my own in my own downtime as lower level techs (level 1 techs, I'm a level 2 tech) were having all sorts of issues with these procedures and I wanted to assist.   Another hat I wear is being our Microsoft expert, meaning on my time that I'm off I study to become certified in Microsoft features as we are a Microsoft based company. Most of my team doesn't understand due to lack of training of most Microsoft items so I receive alot of questions daily on this.  I also ALWAYS help other techs in the middle of my own tickets/calls when they message me.   I also ensure that when new employees are hired, they are trained properly. Since I've been at this job I've managed to work 100 tickets per week on average while my coworkers do about 50.   I'm not saying all of this to toot my own horn only to give you an idea of the extra things I do to help our department that I dont have to do.  Recently I asked my boss for a raise due to all the extra work I was doing. He came back to me today and yay! I got a raise, only to find out that my coworker who is a level 1 got the same amount.

j12m7k77	Context: I was born/raised Muslim in a south Asian country, I don't believe anymore but I think I'm still a cultural Muslim.     I 100% support the idea of people dressing however they want, and have nothing against it. However, I grew up seeing females wear "covered" clothes (tank top/shorts would be considered slutty in my society, I know it's very backwards, but sadly that's how it is). When I say covered I don't mean full niqabs or whatever people think stereotypical Muslim women wear, I mean like normal tops jeans pants shirts sarees etc that people usually wear.    Is it wrong for me to have expectations from my ideal partner to dress in a certain way? At this point in life (I'm 18) I think I won't give a shit about my partners clothing but I'm afraid it might turn into an issue in a serious relationship (socially, family compatibility, growing up differences etc) and I don't want that to happen      Asking because I'm studying abroad.....and single.....and confused. I'm not active in the dating scene here in the US because I'm afraid I'll fall for someone and this issue will come up and I'll end up hurting her.       Sorry if my post is offensive in any way, I really tried to not make any mistakes in my writing, if I did make any, my intention was not to hurt anyone.

j0v88hm7	 My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over a year.  I’m 26, she’s 31. We get along great and share a number of things in common.  She’s my first girlfriend and first sexual partner I’ve ever had.  I never really put forth much effort into dating because of constant rejection and poor self-esteem.  After becoming more self-aware, I decided to start making changes in my life to better myself and my circumstances.    However, we’ve recently hit sort of a rough patch if you will.  One of her friends got married in early this month and invited us. I was on board for the idea and generally excited until I learned my girlfriend’s old hookups will be there.  I have kind of turn against the idea of going after learning this.  Here’s where I may be the asshole, I understand that it was a big occasion and I wanted to be there to support my girlfriend and her friend, I didn’t want to be in the same room as ex-flings.  I tried my best to explain to my girlfriend that being in the same room as guys she used to casually hook up with and have meaningless sex with is not an ideal situation for me to be in.  However, she has stated that I was overreacting, being irrational and making a bigger deal of this than it really is.    I’ve told her that she can’t really see my side of things and where I’m coming from because she can’t see things for my perspective.  I told her to imagine if I was the only guy she had ever been intimate with and she had to be in the same room with women I used to hook up with.  She claims she wouldn’t care.   We went back and forth on the topic ever since I got word that they would be there. Ultimately, we both decided that it was best for me not to go.  She told me that it was a great ceremony and she wishes I went.  She told me she saw three guys she hooked up with in the past.  One had a date and the other two didn’t.  I think I made the best decision.

d4oujlqr	I never really knew why I was kicked out. We had probably been friends for around 4 or 5 years at this point and up until the past year or so everyones been having fun. It seemed once I got a few girls interested in me that they started to distance from me. After I broke up with my ex, people from my friend group would still talk to her and she even slept with one of them (she came back to me saying I was the "upgrade" afterwards but we stopped talking shortly after that. Chick was too controlling) . Sure, I slept with other girls since then, but I made sure they had nothing to do with her. This is where things went down hill, and fast. It seemed like once one dude tapped my Ex the whole group wanted to. Mind you this was like 3 months after our break up and I let them know that I was still uncomftorable with them doing shit like that. I wouldn't give a damn now, I just need some time to process stuff. I've always been a little slow at shit like that and she was my first Gf. I really thought I loved her. Anyways, after me and my Ex stopped talking she kept coming around my friend group. Mind you not once in all of our years of high school did she hang out with us; only when I stopped talking to her. "bitches do anything but leave" actually makes sense now. After that she would continuously flirt with my group, getting them to put a vape in her mouth and shit. I still had feelings for her at this time, minimal as they were, so you can imagine it hurt a lot seeing the people I thought were my friends betray me like that. And a few days after the flirting, I walked up to my group, and they told me this; "Your ego is too big, we can't be friends." "you're too disrespectful." I don't get it though. I always tried to respect them even when that respect wasn't shown to me. I tried to be the best for them and I still got played and thrown away like a piece of shit in the end. I haven't seen this group hang out since they did that, not even in our usual spots. I just don't understand what I could have done wrong.  |||| |:-|:-|:-| ||||	1643168758.0	scwgok	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwgok/aita_for_being_outcasted_by_my_old_friend_group/	AITA for being outcasted by my old friend group
j11yzs8u	My brother has a newborn baby. I'm not sold on the name and I'm not the only one who feels that way. Hear me out as I give my reason:  The first and middle name they chose were from the list published by the Office of national statistics last year about the 10 names for boys and for girls that are unpopular and going extinct. So while the name isn't something strange like celebrities do, they aren't exactly common. Their reasoning was wanting to avoid their baby having the same name as their peers. Myself and my brother's first names were the most popular name in our birth year. Our middle names were the second most. I know my sister-in-law was named similarly. I think they can avoid choosing a super popular name without being so drastical. Choosing from a list of only 10 names is strange to me. The name also makes the baby sound like a senior citizen. My dad is mostly but my mum sort of feels the same way. I know the name raised a few eyebrows when it was announced. I'm afraid they will regret their choice and their child will hate their name as they grow up. I really don't understand why you would give your child an unpopular and extinct name on purpose. You don't need to use Olivia or Noah but there are other options. I even feel strange telling others when they ask about me becoming an aunt. The baby is only a newborn and I feel this is a strike against them.  Since I'm far from the only one to express this sentiment was I wrong to bring it up in a gentle manner? I am not the only one who has mentioned this to them.	1643168924.0	scwikm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwikm/aita_for_saying_my_brother_should_reconsider_his/	AITA for saying my brother should reconsider his baby's name?
ihzexs0a	I wanna start by saying I’m in no way anti vax - however, when I was 10 I had a anaphylactic reaction to a tetanus shot. We thought it was odd but it happened again 2x with the Gardasil vaccine. That’s when my parents, myself, and the advice of my doctor decided I shouldn’t get the third round. I went through a feel allergy tests.  Not allergic to egg protein or anything testable. Dr decided since we can’t pinpoint what it is causing these reactions I should cease getting vaccinations and finished high school on medical waivers. I also have a medical waiver for my employment.   My son also has these reactions and is not longer vaccinated while my younger two kids handle them just fine and are fully vaccinated.   My family is going on a cruise that requires proof of vaccination. I said no big deal, I’ll go on vacation another time. All hell broke loose now my parents have suddenly decided to flip the switch and say I just need to hit the bullet and get vaccinated.

b73v90j0	For context: I was pressured into this relationship about 5 times before agreeing because I had developed some feelings and I was tired of him asking.  My boyfriend (17M) is extremely needy. I (17F) am very busy with college applications, finishing senior year, studying for SAT/ACTs, dealing with family health problems, moving to a new house, the list goes on. This makes me schedule almost impossible to make time for myself let alone my boyfriend. I explained to him at the beginning that I wouldn’t be available as often as he wants.  He will send me constant messages throughout every day, trying to get my attention while I’m in the middle of school, doing homework, or doing something I can’t look at my phone for. He will constantly ask me what I’m doing and try to hang out with me when I have told him I’m doing things that require me to be present for without a boyfriend clinging to my waist.   Currently I am very sick with a stomach virus, and I desperately need some sleep. I’ve been taking naps all day, so I can’t answer his constant “heeey” “talk to meeee” messages. It’s driving me insane. I told him that I’m going to bed because I’m sick, and he replies with “awww, but I want to talk to youuuu”.   He always says this when I am doing something seriously important. I’m upset, because it feels like he doesn’t care about why I’m so busy or how I’m feeling, he just wants my attention. But I understand his POV- he just wants to see me and hang out more. I’m not mad about that, I just wish he would realize how insensitive he sounds sometimes. I feel bad for how harsh I might sound sometimes when all he wants is to just talk to me or see me. Am I the asshole for being annoyed at his texts?   FYI: despite my schedule, we hang out at least every other week, sometimes more depending on how often I find extra pockets of time. This relationship is not ALL texting, and I always do my best to hang out as much as possible.	1643169390.0	scwo1t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwo1t/aita_for_getting_annoyed_by_my_boyfriends/	AITA for getting annoyed by my boyfriend’s constant need for attention?
j124sf62	My bf is very self confident and believes he’s extremely physically gifted. I’m a life long skier and been living in a small ski town my whole life before I left for college. My bf had a company trip to a resort and I joined him along with some coworkers and his boss. Most of his coworkers never skied or snowboarded so they went with the an instructor the company hired. He was a beginner and never skied but refused to go for lessons saying he would just get it. A few of his coworkers and family were also go skiers and we were planning on hitting some blacks. I told my bf it’s a bad idea for him to join us and I would join him on some greens instead with the instructors group. I made it clear most people took a few seasons to confidently be able to do blacks. He insisted he could do it and even made it seem like I was gate keeping him from skiing. I was sick of arguing at that point and said fine let’s go knowing he would not be able to do it. And ya he slid of him butt down the hill because he had no idea how to even pizza or parallel. I was trying to show him but his face was just white with fear and wouldn’t listen. Eventually we got to the bottom where he took me aside and accused me of intentionally making him look bad in front of his coworkers (and his boss). I knew he’d never be able to do but was sick of arguing with him and let him do but he says I should have tried harder to try to talk him out of it.  Similar thing happened a few months ago where we where going hiking and I suggested an easier trail but he wanted to do the hard trail that required scrambling because I mentioned it was really hard. I knew he would have a hard time and told him so and he got offended saying he was fit and would have no trouble. We never finish the hike and he wouldn’t leave the bed for 2 days.  In my mind he’s done this sort of thing often enough that I know it’s useless to force him into doing what is the better option and let him learn but AITA for not arguing him into submission to prevent him from humiliating himself in front of his coworkers and boss?	1643169665.0	scwr6k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwr6k/aita_for_take_a_beginner_on_a_black_diamond/	AITA for take a beginner on a black diamond?
4xo3w7je	ds but allow me to give some context.  Me (16f) and 'Jake' (16m) had been best friends for years, we had a very close friendship and looked at each other as family. I suffered a pretty traumatic event in late 2020 which resulted in my declining mental health - Jake was not cut out for handling this and decided to end the friendship in november 2021. Our friendship had extreme highs and extreme lows, I do not fault him at all for his decision though it was really hard for me as I did not have a lot of friends and cared about him A LOT.  The friendship ending took a massive toll on me and after a lot of thought + meetings and discussion with my therapist and family it was decided that the best decision for me moving forward was a complete fresh start away from any ties to the past.   Just before Christmas Jake sent me a message for the first time in ages saying that he felt bad for how things ended and that he wanted to part ways in a less destructive way. We met up in person and both gave our perspective on everything. I explained how I was changing schools to give myself an environment to heal from what had happened and better myself as a person without reminders of the past bringing me down.  Jake agreed that it sounded like a good idea and we hugged, parting ways forever.   Until yesterday when a mutual friend told me that Jake had decided a week ago to enroll in the same school that I was going to because his friend is also going there. I messaged Jake simply stating "Is it true you are transferring to (school name)" he responded with a lot of hostility towards me which was a big shift from when we hugged and wished each other well. He said I have no right to care what he chooses to do. Which I agree with! I have not even mentioned how annoyed I am about it to anyone and I agree it is not my place to decipher what school he chooses to attend.   Though after all the effort I went through to change and how important it was for my own wellbeing to be away from him and everything else I feel like I should be entitled to be upset and feel even betrayed in a way. He knew how important this was for me, I TOLD him, he UNDERSTOOD. We live in a city with so many school options and the one I transferred to offers no courses that relate to his career path and does not offer the best academic results. The only reason from what I was told that he changed was because his new best friend is also changing there. Though I will reiterate that I do not think he should decide his future based on my feelings. I feel like I may be the asshole for caring so much, for feeling like I was entitled to this fresh start away from him.

hzsjaab2	Hi Everyone.  So I (12f) have a teacher.  I have just started a new school (during mid year), so it is very challenging.  This specific teacher is my algebra teacher.  I had already taken algebra last year, but I didn’t want to commute to the high school for geometry so I am retaking it.  On the first day of school, we had assembly. My algebra teacher, who’s class I did not take before, walked me to assembly.  She kept on asking me questions about the algebra class that I had taken. I didn’t find anything peculiar about it, so I continued conversing with her.  After my first class, she called me over to her and told me that she knew that I had gaps.  She had not been able to assess me yet since we were just taking notes, so I was confused. She continued to tell me that she knows parents like mine push their kids too hard.  I had wanted to take the class last year, so I did not know where she got that from.  After nearly every class, she called me over and asked me if I wanted to move down to pre algebra (even though I was getting an A at the time).  I heard that she was a hard teacher, but I was starting to get agitated.  I eventually let my mom tell the head of middle school, and they have not done anything about it yet.

j13rerj8	I (21F) have had a long history of resentment toward my cousin, "Sarah" (24F). She has always had a good relationship with my mom and they are very close. Over the years, she has done some things that rub me the wrong way. She once tattled on me to her mom because I drank a beer but then, I sh\*t you not, offered me weed not even 2 hours later (I was 17). She also lied in front of my entire family by saying that I drank all of the liquor when in fact, it was her and her brothers.   Last year, I thought that we could finally get past our petty fights because "Sarah" had reached out to me when I was going through a rough time in my life. We had talked to each other about our mental health struggles and bonded over our successes and failures. Then, I found out about her wedding.  A bit of backstory, my mom had a son before my brother and me, but unfortunately, he passed away two days after he was born. My mom still struggles to this day with the loss of her son and I have always been there to see her grief. "Sarah", was actually born on my brother's due date and survived. "Sarah" has 365 days out of the year to pick a wedding date. She has the AUDACITY to have her wedding ON MY DEAD BROTHERS BIRTHDAY and then ASK MY MOM TO READ DURING THE WEDDING. Of course, she "asked my mom's permission" because she "feels so connected to \*dead brother\*". My mom is the most selfless person I know so of course, she said yes.  Even though my mom didn't realize at the time, I recently brought up how f\*cked up it is that "Sarah" is getting married on my brother's birthday. She is basically forcing my mom to watch her, who is the same age as my brother should be, get married on his birthday when my mom will be mourning the loss of watching her own son grow up, get married, and have a life.  I can forgive many things but to me, this is unforgivable. AITA?	1643170488.0	scx0td	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scx0td/aita_for_hating_my_cousin/	AITA for hating my cousin?
2pfeh2h2	I am typing from a mobile device so sorry for the grammar errors.  I (17M) started talking to this girl (17F) (We’ll call her Mav)a few months ago. We are both in our junior year of high school.  didn’t have a ton in common but we both loved books. I am new to women in the sense that I’ve had crushes but never have had the guts to ask them out. So when I asked Mav out and she said no I didn’t know what standard protocol was so I decided to try to salvage the friendship. It was awkward at times but great for the most part. In the past 2 months i’ve noticed she had been venting to me non stop and saying she’s ugly, dumb, worthless, she’s gonna end it all. I comfort her but to no extent. I even went as so far as to say you should see a therapist but she doesn’t want her parents to know. So one night i’m chatting with my girl best friend(Lucy)and i bring up Mav and what’s she been saying. Lucy says she’s doing it for the attention, she’ll never like you back, and she’s using you. I believe her because i’m new to this whole thing and now i feel like a butthole . I texted Mav with a whole paragraph on why we can’t be friends anymore. She said “I get it, it’s ok” and we haven’t talked since”.We talked alot and got along great it was just the non stop venting that got to me. I’ve honestly miss her a lot. I’m open to questions.

gcqmw0rn	My boyfriend (m21) and I (f21) have been together for almost two years. He moved to my college town to be closer to me. He’s never been the type to get me flowers, small surprises, or any small acts acts of kindness. Our relationship is good but I feel as if I want more. I want to feel special… we have gone through weird periods where we both just kind of do our own thing and then end up missing each other quite a bit. I am thankful for our relationship and I wouldn’t want to be with anyone else or anything like that. I told him a while back that I felt it was time for our relationship to level up and he told me “the only thing we could do is have a baby or move in together” and it just kind of offended me. I haven’t mentioned it again. I obviously do not want him to change but it’s just the same thing every day. He stays the night at my place, we go to bed, he leaves my apartment at 8am and we repeat. I want time together and time to just spend enjoying each other’s company but I feel as if he will never do that. He has unintentionally hurt my feelings and made me feel not very important to him. He plays golf almost every day & makes time to hang with his buddies but acts like staying the night with me is out of his way.

fm2qqazo	Throwaway because some people I know use this subreddit.  I am autistic and I don’t like change nor do I like people being brought into my life and told to give them a chance without knowing them first.   So a few weeks back, our power went out because of a snowstorm and when it came back on, my mom offered her friend a place to stay until hers came back on. The first two weeks was fine. I was getting used to my mom’s friend and happy my mom found a new friend. A week in with her staying with us, well my mom told me that she was separating from my stepdad.   I was hoping they would make up, and they did, for a days. Week 2 comes around and I’m getting super suspicious on why her friend is still here. That was when my mom said that her and my stepdad would separate, and that her and her “friend” were together.   Now, before you get on my mom for “cheating”, well my stepdad was done the same thing quite a few times in the past. I’m not saying that two wrongs make a right or anything, but my stepdad and my mom’s relationship have quite tense at times. Even more so leading up to these two weeks.  My mom is upset because she raised me and my siblings better than this and that we should give her girlfriend a chance, but how can I give her a chance when in two weeks my whole life was changed.

j10u4xdc	My cousin (15F) and I (18F) were at a library.  She had a support dog with her because she has autism as well as severe trauma, which is allowed in the library, and he calms her and senses when she’s ready to have an attack or meltdown.  A woman (30s) came up to us and started very loudly telling us we cannot have a dog in the library and that we’re making her feel unsafe and ruining her experience at the library. I said it’s allowed by the library. She got progressively louder until she was yelling in my cousin’s face, and then she started clapping her hands at my cousin and at the dog, causing my cousin to start going into a meltdown and the dog to react.  It also drew tons of attention very quickly, and the librarian came storming over asking what was happening. I said this crazy woman is harassing us because she says the support dog makes her feel unsafe and is ruining her time here. The woman falsely told the librarian I called her a racial slur.  The librarian asked us all to leave.	1643171396.0	scxaxx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxaxx/aita_for_bringing_a_dog_into_the_library/	AITA for bringing a dog into the library?

I have a friend 17f who's trying to write this research letter thing for I think AP psych? She mentioned that she planned to write her thing on Eating Disorders. I was like oh that's pretty cool, what are you gonna write about them. I heard a mutual/kinda friend say/mutter that you could write about how some are fat-phobic. I said t hey aren't though. She said yes they are some are just them trying actively not to be fat. I said yes that's because they don't see themselves as they really are. She said that yes and that's because they don't want to be fat, and are just actively fat-phobic. I said this logic never made sense to me I've seen it online and it just makes no sense. She asked me to explain why it made no sense, and I said because then cut myself off because I was pretty mad at her stupidity at this point and pretty close to clocking her in the face. I walked away because I thought it was the smartest thing to do. She said why are you walking away? Did you know you lost.

icm9utsw	Okay so for reference, I had known this girl for a year. We were somewhat friends  with one other, nothing more. Eventually, about a few months into our friendship I found out she threatened my other friend to tell everyone she knew in our HS about how her dad SA’d her. My ‘ friend ‘ was next to me when another one of my friends told me this so I stood up and started telling her off and saying that if she had a problem with how I defended my other friend she could fight me or keep being a bitch in silence. After that class, people found out and I was called a bitch for ruining her social rank and embarrassing her, (in other words, not letting her bully my friend).

4xa20ng4	I F21 have a dad who divorced my mom when I was 7. My dad is in the military and while he was deployed my mom cheated on my dad and walked out on me. When I turned 9 he met my stepmother who at the time seemed really nice. She had 2 kids of her own and she recently got divorced from her ex. Well by 2010 they got married and overtime she began to grow super toxic. She would make me clean, yell at me because I didn't know how to do things, and she would call me a teacher pet because I was well behaved and I have autism which it made me have to be watched by the teachers more. As a teen she would get mad if I didn't have make up on or if I wore something she didn't like she'd tell me to "be more lady like". She'd also get mad because I wasn't into all that stuff and would get mad when I said how I wanted my mother. My stepmother would also make me clean constantly and get mad when I would get upset because I would be doing home work or taking a nap. I also had to watch my baby brother because she would work or she wanted to sleep in.  As an adult they divorced because they had problems as well but she still would talk to me and be hateful to my husband. She said how he was controlling and how he was going to make me the barefoot pregnant wife. There came a time when I finally blocked her on facebook and on my contacts. My dad found out and at first supported it. It has been a couple years and now out of the blue he texted me and started yelling at me because I blocked her and saying how my husband is controlling. He was going on a rant how "I moved because I hated my stepmother and how I'm being controlled". He even went as far as to say how I didn't like what he said because I would leave him on seen. I just didn't have the energy to respond. I have been going through a lot lately and therapy has been helping me but now I feel like I've fallen back down and feel like it's my fault.

9ymc2dz1	My friends and are are all 15. My best friend, P has been dating my close friend, H for a month now. They’re cute together, and most of the time I’m really happy for them! We use to hang out a ton as a group of three before they started dating, and we still do sometimes but it get very awkward. P and H are very touchy around each other, kiss a lot, and sometimes ignore me when we hang out now (the ignoring isn’t huge, it’s only happened a couple time but I’d still like to mention it). Don’t get me wrong, I don’t have a stick up my ass when it comes to PDA, I do it with my gf sometimes too, but honestly it gets to be a little much with P and S.   The worst part is, my gf lives pretty far away from me, and their parents are very strict so I don’t get to see her as often as I’d like to. P and S can see each other every day if they wanted to, and usually they do since we go to the same school, giving them plenty of other time to be affectionate not around me. I get jealous seeing them together when I can’t be with my gf. The constant affection from them in front of me doesn’t exactly help. I even spent my anniversary watching them hug and stuff (my gf was invited to hang out with us, but due to her parents she couldn’t come). It wasn’t a great day, and I felt too awkward to leave.  I feel awful, I love P and S so so much but I don’t know how much I can take. I want to be happy for them and not be jealous, but it’s not working. Hanging out with them individually is so much fun. I want to just be like “hey, can you maybe not around me?” but I’m worried they’ll think I’m an asshole. I don’t want to ruin our relationship now, and I don’t want to make things awkward for them.  Sorry for all the info for such a small question but,  Reddit, will I be the asshole?	1643172511.0	scxn8d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxn8d/aita_for_not_wanting_friends_who_are_dating_to_be/	AITA for not wanting friends who are dating to be extremely affectionate around me?
igq47ymp	College student living in a dorm w a roommate. My bf and I live an hour and a half away, which is why I put quotations around long distance, I know it could be worse.  My roommate, Ali, messaged me and asked if it'd be okay for my bf to visit every other wknd, instead of almost every weekend. Which would be reasonable if it weren't for the following circumstances.  When my bf is here (on weekends only) we are nothing but respectful towards Ali, we have never asked her to leave the room to have sex or for any other reason, if she wants to go to bed we turn the lights off and hop in bed as well, we pick up after ourselves, we do not show any PDA etc.  Her reasoning is she wants more girl time. Ali has a FWB who lives in the same dorm as us, Bo. When we arrived back at school after I agreed to her every other weekend plan we were hanging out with a few of our other gf’s, having the quality girl time she wanted. In the middle of us girls hanging out she headed down to Bo’s room. While we were having the girl time she wanted.  Ali and I were not friends before moving in, we met online, hung out once prior to moving in and she knew I had a bf before committing to being my roommate. I would get it if we were close friends and she just missed having 1 on 1 time. But we were never like that, we've been mutual hanging out in the same group of people but never close.  The next day she headed down to his room again while we were having her asked for girl time. I do not mind her spending time with him at all, she could be in his room 24/7 for all I care. My problem is her reason for not wanting my bf here, to have more girl time. But she has now left girl time 2 days in a row.  Weekend girl time is non-existent. The group of 7 girls we hangout w on the weekends all have their bf/FWB on campus leaving me with my bf an 1 & ½ away. On the weekend everyones S/O is here.  The week of finals I was hardcore studying. Bo asked Ali to hangout over FT and she said "come here." The volume in the room instantly goes from 0-10, while it was clear that I was studying. I got up and left w my study materials. Then the exact thing happened the next day.  This weekend we planned for it to be a girls weekend, starting the every other weekend plan. But Ali told me that she is hanging out with her other FWB Friday night, who also lives in the city where our school is. So it's not a once in a blue moon thing.   I would just go home to visit my bf, but we have friends here and we want to hang out w them!  I am interested in hearing others opinions. I do believe I should say something to Ali. I am a non-confrontational person and I do have to live w her next year.

i6wqri99	Just broke up with a girl that I was with for about three years two months ago. We grew apart and fought a lot and we both agreed that keeping the relationship going would make things worse. The first three weeks or so go fairly smoothly between us, in fact we had a pretty lengthy over the phone conversation.  Now, fast forward a little later, me and my ex were arguing over something that happened during the relationship, about how I was always breaking my back for her (paying for our vacations together and our dates, etc.) and she never gave me anything in return. She said something like "well your lucky that I even dated you in the first place, I never even liked you!" So me, totally angry knowing she just admitted she used me all this time I then said "well the only way you will another guy will find you attractive is if you get plastic surgery on your face, it looks like someone smashed it with a frying pan 5 times", we have not spoken since that incident. I feel kind of bad because I never should have said anything like that and I want to see if we can reconcile, but I might have broken her self-esteem so much that she might never talk to me again.

j14h5lrx	For some context, my ex and I, both 19, do not get along very well. I tried to remain civil for the sake of our baby, who is due in less than 6 weeks time but my ex, Jim, refuses to be any bit even polite. I'm not going to get into specifics of why we broke up, but Jim is very manipulative and is extremely talented at gaslighting. It broke me and eventually I snapped.   Jim keeps me blocked except for twice a month when he messages to ask for updates about the baby. I'm not happy about that and normally if I don't respond within the hour it results in a huge argument, him saying I'm ignoring him, me telling him to fuck off pretty much. He unblocks like 3 times a week for the sake of finishing an argument too.   Now, I've got high blood pressure due to the stress and I've had a few scares especially right after these arguments happen so I try to respond pretty much straight away and seem as polite as possible. Jim messaged me a few days ago at around 2am while I was asleep so I didn't see it until I woke up for work in the morning. At this point he had laid into me and I eventually got really pissed off with him.   He said something along the lines of I'm stuck with him for the next 18 years because I'm having his child and I finally snapped and said, "no I am not. The baby isn't yours." He blocked me, hasn't unblocked me, hopefully has no intention of doing so. Now, there is no doubt that the baby is his and I don't know why I said he isn't.   The past few days of not really having anything to do with Jim has been kind of peaceful, but I've had a few friends message me to see what was up since he's been posting on social media about me and when I explained my PoV they understand but also think I'm a giant ass for doing that to Jim.

j164abri	A friend, Isabella (fake name) and I talked about our lives, health, families, and dating stuff.   For context, Isabella has been popular with guys since she was 15-16. She's cute. I remember that in HS, we'd attend this winter camp together and that she'd leave with tons of admirers all the time and I'd never get any, or at least not any from the camp.   I had acne, dermatitis, and dressed plainly, so it it what it was. I'm ugly. It is what it is. I've had 6-7 guys interested in me, but probably 20x fewer than she has.   However, I get really irritated whenever she talks about her dating life. Yesterday, she told me that she was chatting with this guy from a different country, and that "he was the first one to get to know her" and that "other guys who dated her just focused on her looks."  I was irritated as hell, but I calmly said, "That's really great. What did he ask about you?"   I also told her that I was chatting with a guy from abroad, but that we were probably just friends, and Isabella said, "That's cool. I never hear about this part of your life." *Maybe because I'm too ugly to attract attention, unlike you?*   I want to tell her to stop talking about her dating life.

i20ebnpu	My brother and I both have a dog since we were kids. She turned 12 recentl, a Rottweiler. As we grew older, she got sick and the vet determined we had to put her down or she'd continue to suffer.  With a heavy heart, we decided to do just that. But before, we chose a day to do all her favorite things. We went to a dog park, got her all her favorite foods/snacks/toys, had a spa day, a doggie date with my cousins dogs and much more I won't bother including. Basically gave her the best day we could think of.  On the day of the appointment, two cousins, my bro and me were there. There was a jar with chocolate and a sign that said it was for dogs who would be put down. I asked the vet and he said he always gives an option to the pet owner if they'd like their pets to taste chocolate as it's not something that they usually eat. I asked my bro if he would like to (I was ok with it) and after some thought he agreed. I said we'd only do it if he wanted to. He fed her. It was at that point we all broke down watching her face brighten up. She wouldn't stop pushing her nose to my bro. She's the best dog we ever had and I don't think we ever want another pet. It's too painful.  After we left, my cousins said I was an asshole for suggesting it. I feel bad but my bro said he didn't mind, that he always wanted her to taste how good it is and he was glad he was the one to give her before she left us. Still, my cousin posted on fb what an AH I am. Am I the asshole, reddit? Idk anymore.

itpnd1w8	I (F38) met A(43) at Uni, so we've known each other a long time. She's ben married to B(M,43) for about 13 years. Ever since they got together, A has assumed that any invitation issued to her extends to B. B has few friends of his own and little self-awareness so it does not occur to him that his presence might occasionally be inappropriate or unwelcome. On the rare occasions B does not come, A will spend a lot of her time texting or speaking to him on the phone.   Here's the actual problem: about 6 months ago, B unexpectedly text me saying Hi. (Context - A had a severe health problem a few years ago that lead to hospitalization, so B was given some phone numbers for certain members of our group in order to provide updates until A was out of hospital. B's messages then messages ceased - until now.) It was around A's birthday so I asked if I had forgotten or if it was about a gift or something. He said he had been thinking about me. I did not respond to this immediately because I was shocked. He continued by saying that he had been struggling with his mental health (he has a history of depression and heavy reliance on alcohol.) and I said that explained why he was thinking about me because I work in a related area. He said it was actually because he thinks I'm a really nice person and was wondering "if, in any other life, something might have happened between us?" I have never seen him in that light - he is very much not my type - and I made this very clear to him.  It transpired that A was out for the evening so I figured that he was lonely and thinking too much - he's been known to get philosophical after a few drinks and he tends to have a few drinks when his mental health dips - so I wrapped up the conversation. I told a trusted mutual friend C (F 44) about it. C agreed that B had probably been drinking. She said she had never seen me act in any way that might have lead B on but agreed with me that A is not the sort of person that would see it like that. We decided that since B has never said anything like this before, that we know about, we would not tell A at the moment.  A is now suggesting that we meet up and it is likely that she will include B.

j14qz9o2	I (18F) met a guy (18M) at a party, and we left to hook up. The guy was like “This is awkward, but I’m a virgin.” And I was like “me too.” So we agreed to help each other get rid of our virginity.   After, both of us were like, “that was fun. Maybe I’ll run into you on campus.” Neither of us really ever planned on seeing each other again, and we both mentioned we aren’t trying to date anyone and were just glad to get rid of our virginity.  Then, I found out my friend lives across the hall from him, and I ran into him again. It was weird because we weren’t really trying to see each other again. It seems weird to run into someone you hooked up with.  But then I think he felt obligated to get my number so we could be friends. So we did, and he texted me later and was like “hey, I’m going to the dining hall in two minutes if you want to get dinner.”  But I was napping because I had pulled an all-nighter to write an essay. I didn’t see the message until hours later. I was like “sorry, I didn’t see it. I was sleeping.” And he was like “it’s fine. I just felt like I was supposed to ask.”  But I’m not sure if that’s a passive-aggressive response. Like he’s mad that I stood him up. I know he asked me since he felt obligated to, and he might be annoyed that I “rejected” him by not coming.	1643175978.0	scyo47	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyo47/aita_for_not_coming_to_meet_a_guy_for_dinner/	AITA for not coming to meet a guy for dinner since I fell asleep?
j16n4dzj	(My name isn’t John it’s just a different name I used) Look, I love my sisters, I really do. But I always imagine what life would be like if they weren’t born. Like I know they’re younger than me and need attention, but I always feel kinda left out. And they kinda always just get what they want. Like they want a Barbie? They get a Barbie. And it’s not just that, but if they cry, they will get what the want 9/10 times. What would life be like if that didn’t happen. I remember before my first sister was born, I would always have time to play with my parents and do fun stuff with them. Now my parents are so focused on them that they don’t have time for me. Obviously they’re young and need attention, but I have barely played a card, board, or video game with my parents since my sisters where born. Anytime I have, it has to be with my sisters. And what really annoys me is that they can yell and scream but if I get annoyed by it it’s just “John you use to be that age,” I know that, but when I was that age I would have gotten spanked if I acted like that. Like I have barely seen them ever get into major trouble for anything. No grounding no nothing. My sister broke my switch and my mom got mad at me for being mad at my sister! I don’t care if it was an accident, you still broke my switch. Ehh. I’m probably just a teen who needs to grow up.	1643176105.0	scypb8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scypb8/aita_am_i_the_ahole_for_disliking_my_sisters/	AITA: Am I the a-hole for “disliking” my sisters.
iajplrjw	Throwaway account. Also on mobile, so sorry for any formatting issues.  I (18F) was friends with Aaron (19M) for  a few years, probably since we were 14 and 15. We were very close. I’m also close friends with his girlfriend (18F) Penny. I was close with them both before they started dating, and was very happy for them when they did start dating.  Now a bit of important background is that my parents got divorced when I was about 12 because my dad cheated on my mom. I was crushed and it created a lot of trust issues for me. When me and Aaron became close, I confided in him about all of this. He was well aware that not only is cheating a dealbreaker for me in romantic relationships, but I also have no interest in being friends with a cheater. It’s just my ultimate dealbreaker in any scenario.  The original incident happened about a year, maybe a year and a half ago. Aaron and Penny had been dating for around a year by this point. All of a sudden, out of absolutely nowhere, he breaks up with her. She was obviously devastated. The next day, he tells her that the reason he did it was because he got with someone else (it’s also important to note, the girl he hooked up with was 14 and he would’ve been 17, almost 18, at the time). He tells Penny he broke up with her because he was feeling guilty, but now he wants her back. She didn’t take him back at that point though.  When I heard all of this, I was shocked and disgusted. On Penny’s behalf definitely, but I also couldn’t believe I was close friends with someone like that. Not only a cheater, but he did it with someone so much younger too. I instantly ended our friendship and I’ve never looked back.  The reason I’m asking now is because recently, Penny decided to take him back, and seeing as I am still friends with her, she wants me to give him another chance, but I won’t. The very idea of it disgusts me, and they both know why. I had to be around him recently at Penny’s birthday party, and I ignored him the whole time. I think that Penny thinks I’m being dramatic and that if she’s forgiven him, I should too. My sister says I’m in the right.

74nkv7zi	i’m 26 and my bf is 25. so basically for the past three - four years, my boyfriend i have been dating semi long distance (1.5 hours away by car ). we usually see each other one or two weekends while we’re both in healthcare professional schools. when discussing my boyfriend’s residency plans, i said that he should rank a program higher if it’s “good” and he gets to live closer to me. he basically responded that he doesn’t care about how good the program is and that he rather just be in a residency program that allows him to keep living with his current roommates bc he has a fun time with them   i responded upset because i felt like he was basically saying he rather live with them than live closer to me which would allow us to see each other more. he justified this by saying that i had ranked a residency program as my to choice that was significantly farther away- 12 hours by car (i did this because it was a great program with great reputation) (i ended up matching to a program that is in a similar current location that i am now)    i haven’t talked/texted/responded to him in a day bc i am sad thinking that he doesn’t care to stay closer to me/spend time with me. thinking about it makes me tear up. lol i think i am also triggered because 5-6 months ago he had told me he had thoughts about breaking up. but since addressing that , we’ve talked about marriage and the future together   aita for being upset that my boyfriend rather live with his roommates than live closer to me..or am i overreacting since residency is temporary/he talks about marriage and the future together?	1643176186.0	scyq0s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyq0s/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_boyfriend_would/	AITA for being upset that my boyfriend would rather live with his roommates than closer to me?
de2jzla6	Context: I’ve lived in this house with my family for roughly 4 years now. Anyways I have a really nice older man that lives next to me with his wife and three dogs. Anyways, he’s a good guy. Good conversation, however he has 3 little dogs that whenever he is outside doing yard work or working on his car are outside with him. EVERY SINGLE TIME they see me or any of my family members they charge at us and come into our yard and jump on us barking and jumping all over us. Almost like they want to attack. They never lick us or anything like that they just charge at us and sort of try to bite us? I don’t know if they are trying to scare us or what. However, they do this to other people in the neighborhood as well. I don’t understand why he doesn’t put up a gate around the front so that they can’t get out or at least put them on a leash and tie it to the tree outside? Anyways am I the asshole for hating his dogs and getting annoyed when they’re outside?	1643176365.0	scyrvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyrvy/aita_for_hating_my_neighbors_small_dogs_for_this/	AITA for hating my neighbors small dogs for this?
6lawgo90	I’m a 19 y/o student that’s taken a few months away from uni for a mental health check: my life was going to hell until I met this amazing man! I've been dating said guy (24) for around three months now, and it's been fantastic- *but* last night, he informed me that he didn't trust me, and, should we “get serious”, he wouldn't want me messaging my ex as he is uncomfortable with the possibilities. (This is due to insecurities that stem from his past relationships.)   Now, you may be questioning *why* I keep in touch with my ex: long story short, he owes me £1700, and, despite how awful the relationship was, I’m gritting my teeth and being friendly until he pays me back the total amount (he’s returned £800 already). The new guy *knows* about this and has from the start: he is also aware of how destructive my past relationship was and that I have no intention of returning to it as I’m happy now with him.   I understand that trusting can be difficult, as I have issues with it myself- but I have no problem placing my trust in him regardless of my trauma, so I struggle to apprehend why he fails to do the same in return. I love him dearly, and I make that known whenever I can, but it isn't easy when I know he thinks the worst outcomes; I would never do anything intentionally to hurt this man.  AITA in this? Am I being too insensitive towards his emotions? Or too sensitive about my own?	1643176253.0	scyqqa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyqqa/aita_for_still_messaging_my_ex_desite_dating_a/	AITA for still messaging my ex desite dating a new man?
gddd4gcm	For context I (22F) had a relationship 7 years ago when I was 15 and the boy was 16. We both were of the same cast and distant relatives. And we both were practically brought up together and his mother always encouraged me to call her MIL (in our regional language) from as long as I can remember and I still do.   We both were infatuated with each other since we were young, but started officially dating 4 days before he passed. But since we were close to each other since we were young the incident was exceptionally hard on me and I spiraled into depression. It was pretty bad and I lost all interest in school and life.  That was when I saw the really insensitive side of my parents. Being Indian, people here don't care much about mental health and getting help and dubbed that I was over-reacting for an unnecessary situation. I was sent to hostel to forget him and to focus more on my studies and I spent nearly 3 years in hostels.   But even when I tried moving on and forming new relationships, it was hard on me and and my partners because of my occasional breakdowns and constant comparisons I made between them and my late boyfriend. Using this as an opportunity my parents convinced me to persue a medical career which I never wanted and still hate. In their words- IF THERE WAS A DOCTOR READILY AVAILABLE THE DAY HE PASSED, HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAVED.   So fast forward to 7 years a few days ago his eldest sister got engaged and I couldn't contain myself and cried for the whole day remembering him and by imagining my life if he was still among us. My parents again berated me saying that I am doing all that for attention and a kid of 15 years does not know the meaning of love.   AITA for crying for him even after 7 years of his passing?  ps: My parents confiscated and threw away all his belongings which I had ( his perfume and some clothes) after he passed as they thought it distracted me from studies and I needed to just focus on getting good grades and join med school if I have to honor his memories...	1643176231.0	scyqho	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyqho/aita_for_mourning_the_loss_of_my_boyfriend_even/	AITA FOR MOURNING THE LOSS OF MY BOYFRIEND EVEN AFTER 7 YEARS OF HIS PASSING?

My cousin is not on the same maturity level as me and my friends, she is on the spectrum too and so finds it hard to pick up on social cues and needs confirmation on if someone is being serious or not when they are joking. Me and my friends aren’t exactly PG either. I simply don’t want my cousin to come, I have even been toying around with the idea of asking my parents for tickets to an R rated movie instead of the arcade so my cousin wouldn’t be able to come.

j174uzla	I(21f) and my boyfriend (23m) have been having some issues lately. This past week my boyfriend has been extremely short with me, saying things like “it’s a bitch move” or “I’m super disappointed in you” over wanting to take a car instead of walking, he’s been snapping at me if I ask him if he’s listening when I’m trying to talk to him, and most recently the other day when I asked him for help on something really quick he snapped at me again and said that I was constantly stealing attention away from his gaming. I don’t mind that he is a huge gamer, I never try to control when he games, so that one hurt. I told him he can’t keep doing things like this otherwise this isn’t a relationship I want to be in. He apologized and told me that he’s been stressed because he hasn’t had much alone time this week because we’ve been hanging out a lot. I’ve told him numerous times before that if he needs any sort of alone time that I am more than happy to give him that space and that all he has to do is tell me. I told him this again and he apologized for not communicating that. While I appreciate the apology, it’s still hard for me to not be upset right now over it. I feel like I’m being crazy for being upset. I don’t really know what to do about it.

And quite frankly i dont really give a fuck about the negative test. The tests are super faulty right now anyway.  Im pregnant and don’t really feel like getting sick over a birthday party.

633rivgh	For context, i am a 25yo Transgender male who has been on testostrone for over 3 years.  My mother and father ( who,might i mention are seperated ) have always been on and off in my life from the start as i lived with my grandmother since i was about 5yo. And in my teenage years, from the time ive spent with them, ive learnt that they were wildly homophobic, transphobic, and just snobs in general. Just recently i visited my grandmothers house as i usually do, And i noticed a strange car in the yard, paying no mind to it. I walked into the house and was shocked from my head to my ass to see my mother sitting at the kitchen table with my GM. My mother stared me down for a few minutes, looking me head to toe with a confused face. After a few minutes of tense discussion between, Me, her, and my grandmother, I was met with a heavy growl from my mother. She spent about 20mins practically screeching at me about how she was my mother and it was awful about not informing her of my new lifestyle. (Not without bringing up me burning in the succulent pit of fire of course) I argued back to her about her absence and how i hadnt talked to her in 4 years until then. After 4 hours of arguing i simply walked out of the house and drove away. Fast forward a week later I was met with very cruel text, videos, and calls by my father and mother. Basically telling me about how im going to hell, a disgrace to the family, that i would always be a female( the usual copy and paste transphobic non sense) And having one of my aunts show up to my house trying to "pray" the sin out of my body. My Grandmother and Boyfriend insist that i should simply apologise and admit that i was wrong so that we could all be dine with this whole thing. But i refuse, they can sob for all i care. But they rest of my family keep insisting im an asshole. So, tell me, do you think im an asshole?	1643177202.0	scz0s5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scz0s5/aita_for_not_letting_my_parents_know_about_my/	AITA for not letting my parents know about my transition?
j16b51kk	  Here’s the cast of characters:  E., is legally married to H. Recently, she and H. decided to try making their marriage a poly triad. This was done because H feels he had to acquiesce or risk her perpetual anger at him,. H. has attempted to date, but when those partners inevitably meet E., they turn on H. and begin partnering solely with her, which leads to more conflict.  E., H. and I share mutual friends Y. and L.  Y and L are married. They have had their share of issues, stemming from L’s past, including substance use. The biggest is that Y feels she puts more thought, time and effort into romance, communicating, and household upkeep than L. In the past month, that’s all come to a head. Y. has been talking to her friends, myself, E. and H. included, about what to do.  E. has moved another male partner that she met online into hers and H’s home. This household includes kids, who respectively each come from a broken home due to the failure of E. and H’s previous relationships. Their household is a mess. The arguments between adults never end, H. is constantly in some state of emotional breakdown and E. likes to steamroll his needs. New partner G. gets paraded around as superior to H. All three are unable to keep discussions with myself and other friends who are trying to give advice in confidence-message H. with support when he’s having problems with E., for example, and you will receive rebuttals from E. telling you that “you’re not helping” posthaste. Recently,  the following transpired:  -Y., distraught, messaged to tell me that G., E, and H. contacted her frantically telling her that G. witnessed L. “Doing drugs at a job site with a coworker”.  -G. then retracted his statement both to E. and S., saying that he told H. (He had done this first, telling H. it was confidential between them) only because he was “testing” to see whether H. would betray his confidence to E.  -Separately, I checked in with H. to see how he was doing as he’s been having a hard time. He replied telling me that things are “all fucked up”, he and G. got into a physical altercation a month ago, AND repeating the insane BS that he, E., and G. had just done to Y.  I went. All the way. Off. I said some really harsh things, stating that I was not impressed with their household or that they decided to rush in to “save” Y without checking facts and coming up with a supportive, calm plan to do so.  H. deleted and blocked me.  E.,  immediately messaged me to tell me the only reason G. retracted is that he “had a panic attack”.  I ignored her, she then asked how she SHOULD have handled it.  I haven’t replied. I’m considering severing ties; this isn’t just because of what they did to Y. It’s because all the selfish, manipulative things all three of them are doing are abhorrent to me, and grown men getting in fist fights around kids? BS.

bhd0vqm2	I recently had my husband’s family over for dinner, my MIL and I have never truly seen eye to eye on anything — gluten, politics, finance…you name it.   For the sake of the family, I manage to keep it peaceful for the most part. Today my husband’s sister also came for dinner and explained to the family how she’s trying to avoid gluten for health reasons. MIL had begun rolling her eyes and talking down to her about her recent diet change, I did my best not to create tension but I did encourage my SIL to prioritize her health.   For context, I’m 31, MIL is 61, and SIL is 25.   We get to dessert and my husband was so excited to show off his new baking skills. Baking is one thing husband and I bonded over. We were not aware of this new gluten-free lifestyle my SIL had embarked on, but I had conveniently just purchased a very small gluten-free cake to see what it tasted like and I offered her a piece of that.   SIL had not been eating much and was in a solace mood after being chastised by MIL all dinner about her gluten-free changes, and told us she’ll pass for now as MIL was staring her down when I had asked her.   Now Reddit, I said I try my best right?   MIL goes to the bathroom and SIL asks me if she could take the cake home. FIL hears this and tells me to watch my place, setting off a whole fiasco which leaves my SIL and husband in tears as well as my MIL.   When they leave soon after, I can’t help but see my upset SIL and feel the urge to do one of the craziest things with good intention. I try to carefully drop the cake from my apartment balcony onto MIL/SIL’s truck-bed, aiming for some tarp covered stuff, well, I miss and it lands on the top of the truck cabin and spatters everywhere.   MIL flips and curses me out, threatens to call the cops, and I’m pretty sure I may have broken the family over this. I just wanted to give my SIL a taste of freedom when she got home and was short sighted in that moment. SIL texted me to tell me she loves me and my husband has mixed feelings over what I did, so do I.

86dhb990	So I (20F) have been in a LDR with my bf (25M), and things have been rocky lately.  We’ve had disagreements more. He has an asshole joking personality where he’d make a smart but ass remark, (which he’s doing better at handling) but I don’t know. I’m thinking of leaving him, because our relationship is rocky to me, and I’m loosing the spark I felt for him.  Whenever we had a disagreement and he always tries to tell me my opinions are wrong and he won’t listen to anything but facts that comes from a legit source. Even when I show him, he’d fight on his hill that he’s right and I’m wrong or I’m dumb.  He wants me to move in with him and his four roommates, (who some have gfs, and they all are gamers, including bf.) I’m hesitant since I don’t feel comfy with rooming with people (past experiences.) plus he wants me to drive him to work everyday since he can’t drive, but would pay for gas money.

j17i5t9i	Using a throwaway account as she sometimes lurks and I don’t want her finding my real account lol.   Me (27M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been in a relationship for just shy of four years but were friends before that. I’ve been in love with her since we began dating and I truly believe we are soulmates, two halves of one person, all that crap. I believe she does too. Over the years, we’ve talked about marriage and kids with each other, but it hasn’t exactly gone anywhere beyond casual suggestions or her occasionally showing me dresses on Pinterest. I take marriage very seriously and want to get married, but she doesn’t seem to share the sentiment, at least not to the same level as me.   I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but there’s a bit of a problem. You see, her family has never been huge fans of me. I don’t know what it is about me that bothers them, I’ve been perfectly nice to them, not done anything to (intentionally) offend them, they just don’t like me. I’ve *tried* to make them like me, but they flat out refuse. I believe my girlfriend never taking our discussions of marriage as seriously as me is because of her family’s distaste for me, but I could be wrong.  Now, here’s where the story begins. It was her birthday a few days ago and we went to her parents house for dinner and to celebrate for the evening. A few weeks before the dinner, I decided I wanted to pop the question *at* dinner. I saved up a decent amount of money and bought her a beautiful ring (I showed one of my female friends and she said GF could never say no to it). Well, I spent all night with the ring in my pocket, and by the end, I thought it was now or never and got down on one knee right at the table.   She and her entire family immediately *flipped*. Her dad started yelling that I was no good for his daughter, GF started crying and denied the proposal. I asked why they were freaking out and they said she was too young and I was “too old” for her (which I don’t understand. Her family is always preaching equality and that “love is love” bullshit because she has a lesbian sister). I was obviously kicked out of the house and remained unengaged.   It’s been a few days since then, I’ve been staying with my brother, as I don’t know if I’m welcome in our apartment at the moment. She hasn’t said a word to me. I really thought proposing would show her family how much I love her and that I’m good for her despite what they think, and maybe change their minds about me, but it doesn’t seem to have worked.   I don’t know. I think they’re overreacting and should let her make her own decision. I mean, she’s a grown up in a grown up relationship, she’s been old enough to make that decision for years. I think they’re just controlling and scared of losing that control over her.

a1362cld	My partner and I were talking about what would happen if one of us became a vegetable. She said if you couldn't take care of your partner through that then you shouldn't be with them (long term).   To that I replied "fuck that" and told her if she had to wipe my own ass for me then she should just put a pillow over my head. She absolutely refused because she could never do that to me and still "would want to build a life with me." That's sweet, and I would happily take care of her too if she was in that situation.   But I would also mercy kill her ass if she asked.

d22f8g6g	Hi I’m using mobile so sorry for any spelling or grammar errors that might happen. Anyways.  I’m just going to preface this with some information. I (20f) am apart of the lgbtq+ community. I say that because it means I know how unaccepting my parents are And that my sister I am referring to is Trans.   Anyways so I am dating someone who has been talking about getting married recently. I feel an engagement coming this spring and I am very very VERY happy about it but it has also caused me to think about who I would invite and have in my wedding party and fantasizing about the whole ordeal.   The thing is I don’t have very many friends because I tend to be a closed off person who works a lot and I don’t really have time to see the few friends I do have let alone make new ones. Now of course that could change in the next two years but it also means my bridal party is going to be kinda small. I personally don’t mind and my S/O is indifferent to how many people we would have in our respective parties.    I want one of my sisters to be apart of it but not the other. It has nothing to do with her being trans and much more to do with me and her just not being super close. I don’t want to air her dirty laundry on here but for context she has a lot of mental issues that make hanging out with her very hard because 1) she is very lazy and has zero work ethic 2)she likes to joke about murder, sex (not just dick jokes but In detailed jokes about sex that would make a sailor uncomfortable), drugs, and in general just things to make fun of people (like disabled jokes when she is not physically disabled) or make people uncomfortable. Hence the reason I’m not really close to her. she’s also had some violent tendencies that have put her in “institutions” for 2 years.   Well she just got back for good last summer and I’ve been calling her out more for the inappropriate things she says and that just puts more walls in between us then breaking them down because she doesn’t like confrontation.   She blames EVERYTHING on being trans because we have one brother that deadnames her and refuses to call her by she/her pronouns. Her mom (my step mom) has been very supportive because her family therapist says it would help if everyone did their best to get over this hump so we could attack the real issues at hand and she wouldn’t immediately be able to blame “transphobia” where there is none. My only concern is I don’t want to make her think I don’t think she’s a woman by not having her in my bridal party.   Even with all the issues we have I do care for her like she is my bio sister I just really don’t want to deal with her dama on a day that is supposed to be me and my partners. I would still love her to attend with my dad and stepmom I would just prefer she not to be in my party even though I would still have my other sister there who just happens to be cis.   I also wanna say that I honestly do not care whether she is trans or not because I don’t think it truly matters what gender she is. She could ask me to call her by they/them pronouns tomorrow and he/him pronouns the next day and xe/xim pronouns next year and I would still think she’s valid the entire time. I say this because a lot of my family thinks she’s going through a phase. I don’t. I think this is who she truly is I just don’t want to make her feel invalid because I don’t want her in my bridal party one day.   So WIBTA if I let one sister in my BP but not the other?	1643178425.0	sczcvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczcvy/wibta_if_when_i_get_married_one_of_my_sisters/	WIBTA if when I get married one of my sisters isn’t in my wedding?
c2u818nm	i (18nb) have always struggled with my gender identity. i found he/they pronouns work best for me and im struggling to figure out if i’m a trans male or not.  with that, i’ve had issues losing weight and my doctor suggested i start taking testosterone to help my body weight kinda shift the way i want it and to hopefully help with my gender dysphoria.  problem is, while my parents are fine with me being non-binary, they are not with me being a dude. i don’t believe they would support HRT (hormone replacement therapy) and im worried to start in case they cut me off. i just got into college and am still financially dependent on them. would i be the asshole if i started testosterone against their wishes?	1643180037.0	sczs8h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczs8h/wibta_for_starting_testosterone/	WIBTA for starting testosterone?
j17p2ibz	My husband told me my music taste is weird and unhealthy and I should stop listening to metal. He likes classical these days.   This was in response to me telling him that shooter games (particularly Valorant) are bad for his mental health and he should spend more time with me. He plays for about 5 hours each day. He is currently unemployed but searching. I’m in school full time and working.   I could hardly believe it, he knows I’ve played piano for almost 20 years and music is important to me. I hardly play anymore because of household chores and wanting to hang out with him.   He has previously banned me from listening to a particular song by Sentenced (my last post got removed for saying the name of the song), which is by far the most extreme stuff I listen to.   Personally, I think the song “A Winternight Depression” by Evereve is the most harmful song I listen to so I deleted it off my playlist all on my own and he has no idea. I feel like I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life and he shouldn’t tell me I should stop as I can control myself. I’m on Lexapro now and I’ve gotten a lot better with my anxiety. But his video games… I just feel like he has no idea what they’re doing to him and us.   AITA?

7xpgzxmm	I have been playing an online DnD game with a group of six through discord. I'm trying to play a healer this time around (new experience).  Things were exciting in the early game, but as the weekly sessions continued we had to engage more and more difficult encounters. My cleric healing really isn't 'decent' until we hit lvl3-5, so most of us were surviving off of potions and I felt like I couldn't do enough to help the team.  An encounter at lvl4 team was pitted against a Dragon in their lair. With 3 legendary actions each turn and lair abilities it one shot 'killed' one member of our team by dealing 3x his health pool in a single turn (DM felt 'bad' and gave them two death save fails instead).  I voiced concern that that encounter was too difficult post game and DM would 'fix' that next game. Each session after had Huge sized enemies, giants, etc. Not once was there a cave of kobolds or den of bandits to fight. Everything was big, everything hit hard, and everything did more damage than I could heal through.  Enough was enough and I called him out on it. DM agreed to up our hit points to maximum, but in turn they would be 'taking the gloves off.' DM's final words that night were "I won't be satisfied until one of you has died." Their excuse being that because my character is high enough to know revivify and another has a scroll of revivify it should be 'OK' to kill our characters! (#meatgrinderdungeon)  There is drama.. and then there is trauma..

hctj937m	So i'm a member of this one forum and after asking what one members problem about a certain podcast by actors of a TV show was, she went on this insane rant about how famous people have no right to complain publicly about their problems because "other people would die to have their jobs"(she also said being a Youtuber was easy and that "anybody could do it" and that youtubers bitching about their problems uploading videos was "silly", ya know despite that directly affecting their livelihood)and that because her job was harder that famous people had no right to complain publicly about the problems they had to deal with on their jobs(She also spoke about how despite problems at her job she didn't dare to complain in front of her sister due to her being a teacher as this woman thought that it would be "disrespectful" to  complain about her job in front of her sister,  she also had that attitude towards non-parents, saying they had "no right" to complain to parents about lack of free time, which is insane)and when I called her out for how toxic and shallow and wrongheaded that kind of attitude was, she claimed I was being "rude" to her and treating her "horribly" and falsely accused me of name-calling even though I did no such thing, literally all I did was point out how wrong she was to have such a negative and misguided attitude towards people that create art. Plus her posts were chock full of bad grammar and mispelled words that made it tough for me to understand what she was saying at times, and when I pointed out her grammar issues a mod said that was getting "personal", to which I pointed out my issues understanding her and the mod was all "oh I understood her mistakes happen"(never mind that on almost every other forum I'm a member of that many grammar and spelling errors would not be acceptable, you would get a stern lecture and a warning from the mods for writing posts that ineligible)then this woman PMed me spouting more falsehoods about me and more ignorant statements about the people on the podcast, claiming I sounded "miserable" just because I dared to disagree with her. Frankly this woman sounds like she has problems taking any criticism and refuses to ever admit to being wrong ever(now I know how Gordon Ramsay feels every time he tries to get through to a thick-headed owner on Kitchen Nightmares and they just accuse him of being "mean" despite him simply telling them the truth and not sugarcoating the problems). Took me a lot to not call her names quite frankly. I've told this lady in no uncertain terms that if she continues making negative posts like that i'm going to put her on my "ignore" list(it's a feature on the site where you can click on a user and put them on a list so you won't see their posts by default on forums).  So what do you all think? Am I crazy for calling this person out for their attitude towards anyone even slightly famous?(she's under the impression that all Youtubers are rich which isn't even slightly true).	1643180274.0	sczud0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczud0/aita_for_calling_out_someone_on_a_forum_for_their/	AITA for calling out someone on a forum for their toxic attitude towards creators?
ilua514r	I (21F) got into a big fight with my (now ex) boyfriend, Caleb(20M). Me and Caleb started dating when I was a senior and he was a junior in high-school. He broke up with me the day after graduation because he wanted to fuck a girl he had already been friends with. We then would be on and off. We would go 3-6 months no contact but then only be on for 3-8weeks. A couple months ago while he was out one night drinking, he had gotten scabies from being in the grass. He then gave it to me and the treatment process is horrible. You have to deep clean and wash everything in your house on hot water and rub this stuff all over your entire body and sit in it for 10-12 hours(I also live w 2 roommates). Caleb ended up apologizing and we were able to move past it. Exactly 1 month later we were watching the joker at his house and he looked at his wrist weird. when I asked him about it, he said “oh its nothing” and I forgot about it. 2 days later I got woken up by my wrist itching so bad at 5am and texted Caleb saying “I dont want to freak you out but I just woke up from my wrist itching in the same spot before, I may have scabies again” he then responded at 1:30pm saying “I was thinking the same thing. My wrist felt weird to the other night” I then got so angry and frustrated with him because he didn’t tell me that he was “itchy”. I called him and we started arguing. I told him that he should have said something to me and he said “im going to get my eyebrows done I dont have time for this” and hung up the phone on me. I had to do the treatment all over again and wash every single thing I had touched or been around. I then left back to my parents house that next day and Caleb still hadn’t said anything else to me. A week later he said he went to the doctor and they said that he has eczema and thats what he gave me. Does he think im stupid? My little sister had eczema and its not contagious whatsoever. I ghosted him up until a few days before New Years and he begged that I go see him and we talk about everything(this is a reacquiring thing). He took me to see the new Spiderman movie and purposely kept pouring me more drinks to where I was too drunk to talk to him. I then left that next morning as nothing got resolved and didnt talk to him again for a few days. On New years eve 24mins before 2022 I texted and basically told him off saying I deserve better and to no longer contact me again. He didnt respond, I dont blame him but ig it just shows he never really cared about me. He never did the treatment again.	1643180185.0	scztma	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scztma/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_to_go_fuck_himself/	AITA for telling my boyfriend to go fuck himself
3z3f6lzi	I am 14F and I don't know how to comfort people or calm them down. When someone yells at me, most adults in my life do, I can only sit there and stare because I don't know a response that would calm them down but more importantly when people cry or breakdown at school I have no idea what to do. When I breakdown I want to be left alone but whenever I do that with people its apparently the wrong response. I've never been an emotional person so its hard for me to understand them. I'm alot more analytical. I look for solutions to their issues rather than figuring out how to help settle their emotions and people don't like that. I just don't know what to do when someone starts spiraling and it happens around me all the time with friends, family, and even people over the internet. I had to talk my friend out of killing herself the other day and it was one of the hardest situations I've ever been in. I had no idea what to do so I tried to reassure that people loved her but that was really hard considering that her mother had just told her that she didn't love her only 10 minutes before the conversation. My mom and brother just keep telling me "well you're gunna have to learn how to be sympathetic soon! It's part of growing up!" But I just feel like I can't. Also I don't feel anything for people when they tell me a family member died or something tragic happened. I just think of what to respond with to make them feel better so we can move on. I made a cake the day my step grandfather died,, not out of celebration. I just felt like eating something sweet and i expected the loss to hit me but it just never did. When my parents got divorced i wasn't sad but i just kinda played the part because they expected me to be torn. I never really felt conflicted with my emotions until I figured out my brother was in love with me. That one was a heavy hitter but I never really cried/broke down, just felt more confused as to why and looking for answers. I feel like such an asshole that i have to put on this mask of emotions for people and then they get mad to know what i really feel,, which is neutral in most situations. Also having to fake sympathy when I'm really bad at it. Am I just a shitty person or is there more to this? I just feel not normal ig.

iy04d1e5	I (m16) am not a vegan and my girlfriend (f16) is a vegan. I drove her to kfc because she wanted to try the new impossible nuggets and her friend apparently took her boyfriend who also isn’t vegan, and apparently he liked it. She wanted to prove to me that the vegan impossible food was the exact same as meat, as I’ve tasted the impossible burger before and said it was shit. So we got the nuggets and I tried to eat it but it was like a fucking rock and I couldn’t bite into it easily. And it fucking tasted bad. And it has a weird texture. I told her it sucked and she got all defensive like “it’s about the animals and the environment and the animals are suffering horrible deaths” but I straight up just told her I don’t care about the animals and they’re living a great life away from predators and they don’t have to die being eaten alive.

iebww056	Throwaway account   For context: I (F17) met this guy (M18) around two weeks ago. He’s a usually a very quiet guy with only a few close friends with whom he shares his interests with. He’s a good kid, with good intentions. He’d never do anything to hurt anyone on purpose.  The thing about him though is that he’s very socially tone deaf. In a quiet classroom, he’ll go on long rants about things that either happened that day or some sort of politics in a louder than average voice. I’m usually the one telling him to quiet down and lower his voice. He’ll blurt out random phrases in the middle of class. When transitioning between classes he’ll seek me out of a crowd of people and run against the traffic to come walk next to me. If I’m in the middle of a conversation with someone else he’ll awkwardly stand next to me until I’m finished talking to said person. If I’m walking and talking to someone else, he’ll walk behind me, not saying anything, until I’m finished talking to them. When he gets his chance to talk he’ll pick back up on the same long rant from earlier, using the same extremely loud voice and sometimes using explicit language, which gives us weird looks from other people walking by. I cant help but get embarrassed when he comes up to walk next to me and rant in public. It’s just strange to me how it seems like he’s literally forgotten about his other friends in favor of ranting to me about random topics.  About after a week of knowing him, he started to end or conversations with hugs. At the end of every conversation with him, even minor ones, he’ll wrap his arms around me and hug me. I’ve been just putting one arm around him to be nice. Sometimes he’d come up behind me and hug me without my knowledge, and I’d be visually uncomfortable. He doesn’t notice that I dont like when he does that. When I’m passing by him, we’ll say hi, and he’ll follow behind me with his arms out as if he’s expecting a hug. I told him the other day through text that I’m just really uncomfortable with him hugging me multiple times a day after every chance we get to talk. I don’t know him well enough to be giving him intimate hugs like that. I asked him if we could just say “bye” and move on with our day. He texted “Ok.”  The next day he was waiting for me to arrive to school by the main entrance. When he saw me, he started to come up to me with his arms out for a hug. When he got close up on me I shoved him away. I told him he needs to respect my personal space after I just told him I was uncomfortable with him hugging me. He immediately apologized, but looked really hurt. I told him it’s fine, but I still feel like such a asshat for putting my hands on him. I want him to respect my personal space, but I didn’t mean to come off as harsh as I did. He does his best to not come too close to me now, and I feel so guilty for making him feel like he can’t come near me.   Am I an asshole for that?	1643180740.0	sczyzg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczyzg/aita_for_shoving_a_guy_away_when_he_tried_to_come/	AITA for shoving a guy away when he tried to come up and hug me?
j18ee1h8	My friends and I have been enjoying Wordle over the past few weeks, much like the rest of the world. Just past midnight on Monday, I open the website and attempt the puzzle, getting the word in 4 tries. I'm pretty proud of myself - I had spent more than a few minutes racking my brain before finally realized the tricky word - "knoll."  I look across the room and my roommate is still struggling. I peer over his phone and talk with him about it. I accidentally say out loud the fact that the word contains an O, for which I admit I was the asshole. This annoyed my other friend in the room, who usually waited until morning to solve it. After having a letter spoiled, she decided to do it now.   But the word is hard. *Really* hard. Neither my roommate or my other friend can think of any word that fits the clues revealed to them, both on their third guess, poised to beat me. No way would they guess a random word for information if they have all the information they need to beat me. They struggle for almost an hour. My roommate gets it quietly, not telling anyone. My other friend guesses "knoll" and shows me, asking if it's the right word. I put on a poker face, not wanting to ruin her fun. Seeing my blank stare, she concludes that I wasn't aware of the word existing, so it's not the target word.   After a while, I give her a hint by quoting Sherlock Holmes: "When you have eliminated the impossible, what remains, however improbable, must be the truth." But she remains vigilant in believing that my facial expression was not that of a person who recognized the word. She searches for other words that fit, spending even more time. By the time she gives up and actually guesses knoll, I'm in my bed and almost asleep, listening to her talk to my roommate about how mad she is.  I knew she was going to be mad, but I thought it was a small thing that we could laugh about after a night's sleep. In reality, it's been two days now and it seems like she's still mad. I apologized over text and she says she accepts my apology, but we haven't been able to talk since then.

hgv25y6k	My (18F) best friend (18F) got a Boyfriend around 4 months ago. At first I liked him as a person and we get along fine. He was respectful to her and probably her most stable relationship. However, especially in the last week I've noticed she's been ditching me or blowing off plans to hang with him.   Last weekend my friend called me and asked if I wanted to help her with study for her calc final at a coffee shop by her house (I'm a physics major and basically tutor her). So I bussed there and brought my notes and old worksheets to help her. About five minutes after I got there, her Bf called her asked if she wanted to hang out, she left right away with him. I had a comment about her leaving right as I got there, but she didn't seem to think she was doing any thing wrong. I tried not to seem visibly mad because in reality she can do whatever she wants, but my feelings were definitely hurt.   Similar situations have happened many times, another example was her leaving my birthday dinner early to hang out with her bf and his friends. The worst part of that night was that she asked me to drive her there...  Her Bf cheated on her in December when he was in Brazil and I expressed how I think she should break up with him. She was pretty sad over the cheating but got together with him within a week.  I restated my concerns about him being unloyal and mentioned how I felt she was blowing me off to hang out with him. She basically just told me I was jealous because I am not in a relationship and that she is very happy with him. We got into a argument and haven't spoke in a week, and I don't plan on being the first to reach out. I'm glad she's happy, I just feel like she's putting a shitty guy before our 7 year friendship. AITA for being mad at my best friend for choosing to hang out with bf over me  I also feel like I need to mention that we have been literally un-separable since we met freshman year of high school.

isfz67rp	Ok Reddit so I am in desperate need of honest and unbiased opinions. I am going to be honest I am not asking for advice and I’m standing my ground on my choice I just need to know if I acted like an AH or not. My friends agree with me and her friends agree with her.   I (27M) shared an apartment with my best friend for over 4 years but he recently got married and moved in with his wife so I thought this was the perfect opportunity to invite my girlfriend (24F) of 2 years to move in with me. The apartment is a 2 bed of course so we would have a spare room since she would obviously share my room. My gf still lives with her parents and her sister adopted a cat a while back but couldn’t take it with her when she moved out so the cat stayed with gf and her parents. When I shared my thoughts on her moving in she was so excited and started planning everything she then said we could use the spare room as the “cats room.” I am severely allergic to fur (not deadly but I cannot be in the same room without sneeze attacks and itchiness) not just cats but fur in general so I’ve never had pets. I told her the cat would have to stay at her parents house and she said she assumed I would just take allergy meds. I told my gf I was sorry but I wasn’t going to do that plus since I’ve never had pets I’m not used to living with animals.   This tuned into an argument so I told her we both obviously had different feelings about living expectations so we should put off moving in together until something changes or we come to some sort of compromise. Upset she told me nothing would change and if I can’t accept her and her “fur baby” she can’t see us living together. I retaliated with “I guess we can’t live together then.” She has been giving me the silent treatment since yesterday. So I need to find out.

j19b0yyo	So I (23F) just got my bachelor's degree, which left me completely burnt out. I am planning on moving to another country for my Master's, but I just need a break, I'm sure I won't be able to perform as much as I want to, being so tired, I need to learn the language and I need to work so I can actually afford moving abroad.  I told my dad about a week ago that I am not applying for my master's this year because of all the reasons mentioned. He began screaming at me for not listening to him and for doing whatever I want without asking for permission. He also stated that I will get old and there is no point in studying for a master's if I will be old by the time I finish (I am actually going for a PhD after my master's so jokes on him i guess. I won't be finishing my studies before 30 anyways, but I don't think 30s are old).  Since then he is giving me the silent treatment and won't listen to me when I try to talk to him about it. I'm really tired and not willing to deal with it so I just gave up trying.  My mom talked to him about it and he says that I am the one refusing to talk (up until now he hasn't made an effort to talk to me or even acknowledge my presence) and as I am younger, I should make an effort.   I realize that they are giving me a place to live rent free and I am actively trying to find a job (since the restaurant I was working closed due to the pandemic), so I can help out with the expenses, while saving up for my studies, but this is a decision only I have to make, since I know my mental capacities ATM more that anyone.

Pics of me in just a bra and underwear, some pictures with my boobs in it, etc. Just to feel confident in my body.  Well my parents went through my phone to "make sure I'm safe". And saw those pictures. They confronted me thinking I was sending nudes. I explained I wasn't. I was really embarassed that they, especially my dad, had seen those pictures because I had my boobs out in some of then. I told them how uncomfortable I felt and they shrugged.  They found out I changed my password. When they asked why I told them so they don't look at private pictures of me naked again.

j19fchqj	I f24 has been in a relationship with my boyfriend who's 26 for 2 years now. My boyfriend has a childhood friend who's 22 named Keila that I've never met in person because my boyfriend says she's traveling with friends before she settles down. My boyfriend and Keila spend hours on the phone talking but when I'm on the phone with him he ignores me and either works or plays his game. There are times when his friend Keila would facetime him to ask his option on a very revealing outfit which I yell at him to change the conversation or hang up. When I do this I always feel like the bad guy because he would ignore me for days after until I apologized. Recently Keila invited my boyfriend on a trip since they haven't seen each other in a year and she wanted to catch up. Of course, my boyfriend agreed but when he hung up I told him I didn't want him to go. He of course asked why and I told him that I felt like Keila has bad intentions and that if he really wanted to go then I would like to come with him. He shut it down real quick and told me that this wasn't a couples trip and this was a time to check up with a childhood that he hasn't seen in a while. This turned into a big argument and I threatened to leave if he went so he turned down the offer and we haven't spoken in a week until he broke up with me over text saying I was too controlling. I haven't even met this girl and all I know is she's a stripper and she's my boyfriend's childhood friend. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend wouldn't want me going on a trip with some man he hasn't met and I wouldn't want the same.

9mtmes54	So I (31F) have been friends with (31F) for almost two decades, we had a lot of life milestones, even lived together for a bit, but I feel done with the friendship.   About two years ago she started dating her boyfriend (39M), and I don't approve. The guy has a child that he doesn't take care of, and I think that's gross and even worse that she thinks its ok. Previously, I've dated some dudes that sucked, but none to that level of having a child they didn't take care of and she would always give me a hard time about the men I've dated.  I felt gross being friends with her knowing she condones this behavior, and gave me attitude the one time I brought it up. He also mooching off her and she thinks that's OK. I tried to overlook it since it really isn't any of my business so I did.  Unfortunately though, she always been a crappy friend when she's in a relationship and she's repeated the pattern.  I've always been the friend to reach out anyway but she's been totally MIA for the better part of the two years.  The kicker really was this though.  Recently a very close friend of mine passed away and I was devastated. She was not friends with him but met him several times and knew he was a close friend and that he passed away. She did not bother reaching out until she "accidentally" texted me something else then said "while I have you im sorry to hear about your friend." That was about a month after my friend passed away.  Honestly, I would've rather she not said anything. I felt like that was my last straw with her.  I was cordial, but honestly, now, I don't really want to have wanting to do with her.   AITA for wanting to end or let this friendship disappear despite our history (and the fact that she was a good friend years ago)?	1643184743.0	sd0z8z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0z8z/aita_for_wanting_to_let_a_two_decade_friendship/	AITA for wanting to let a two decade friendship disappear
bni5dkip	ok now i know this sounds bad but listen to me.  I (m30) reported my mother (f50) for tax evasion after she found a huge stash of cash in my brothers room. My brother passed away 3 weeks ago for crack cocaine overdose. He was 21. My mother went snooping around his room and found a shoebox with approximately 200 thousand dollars. In the shoebox, there was also a letter. This letter was for me and my brother said he made about 500k trading stocks and that he wanted me to have a part (the 200k) because I thought him everything in life and I basically "raised" him. I was the one that taught him how to trade stocks.   Apparently my mom was sad that I was his father figure and it wasn't the multiple men she would bring to the house every week. She was already mad that his will 100% went to charity and that she didn't get any money and seeing my brother that left me this money she got absolutely outraged. She took the money and said that since I taught him so much I could teach myself how to make that 200 k. I told her I needed that money for the mortgage, and after the taxes  on that 200k id give her 25% of it but she wouldn't listen. She kept the shoebox and threatened to call the cops of me if I didn't leave her property. (I bought the house for her). If this was before covid, when my business was flourishing, I would have let her keep it but i am struggling financially and I really need that money.  I then reported her to the IRS for tax fraud, and after a little investigation they found her guilty. The money was given to me and she has to do community service. She entered a kind of deal that she gets a normal job  and half of the wage goes to charity or something.  She then called me mad that I reported her and I told her that now that she has a job she can make the 200k herself. She is threatening to disown me and my grandparents on her side sent me threats on social media because I stole "her" money.

6jw68	A couple of years ago I cut my sister out of my life because she was consistently toxic and taking a toll on my mental health. Since doing so, and despite asking multiple times for her to stop, my mom frequently brought up how she wishes we would just make up because she wants her girls to be happy. I've explained multiple times why I cut her out and have been living a more peaceful life after doing so, even if sometimes it's hard because we are still family and I do still care for her - I just have to care from afar.  On my last birthday mom came down to visit, and overall we had a good time until evening came. I mixed us some drinks and once again she brought it up, proclaiming that I don't care. This isn't true, and being told that I don't care and having the trust that the issue would be laid to rest broken hurt. I went to bed early and the next day woke up depressed. I tried to shake it off but nothing was working and I couldn't muster any enthusiasm for the suggestions mom was putting out there for what to do that day. I didn't want to lead her on so I told her that I was depressed - something she knows you can't just shake off as she has chronic depression - and just wasn't in the mood that day.  She got offended, packed up her things, and left. As she got in the car she said to me "I'm sorry you had to end it like this" and then drove off. I was devastated and after half a month of serious thinking I decided to cut her out of my life as well, letting her know why. She's respected the request for no contact when it's convenient for her, but multiple times (especially closer to when it started) I was receiving multiple messages about how I'm breaking her heart and attempts to start conversations. Throughout all of this, even knowing why this is happening, I haven't received a single "I'm sorry" for the initial event or the guilt tripping afterward. I've been told that we're family and that should matter, but this seems hypocritical since the entire family has cut my father out for being a genuinely shitty person.  It hasn't been easy since cutting her out, I do still love her, but especially in the last few years I've gotten such little tolerance for this kind of thing and have no qualms with cutting people out of my life who consistently drag me down. I know that this is better for my mental health and general well being, but there's still a part of me that wonders if maybe I overreacted or if I should have taken the hit to my mental health in order to maintain this relationship.  Am I the asshole for my reaction during my birthday and cutting her out?	1643186426.0	sd1dgi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1dgi/aita_for_cutting_family_out_of_my_life_after_my/	AITA for Cutting Family Out of my Life After my Birthday?
j19wx5lz	So a very close friend of mine (lets call her Jade) has baby GSD, I’m over at my friends house all the time (were really close), Dog even listens to my commands, etc, I take Jades dog for walks, etc.  So yesterday me and Jade took her dog to the dog park, and just for some context we go every couple weeks (Jade goes every couple days with her dog) and EVERYTIME we go on Tuesday theirs always this one dog and his owner who disturb there peace. He’s not trained well, no leash, scares the kids by running around barking (it’s an adult pit bull). Jade goes the dog park all time and she’s told me multiple times about how everyone gossips/and the pit bull terrorizes other smaller dogs all the time. So yesterday I was their with my friends dog who I basically consider my own as I see her all the time, etc. I was playing fetch with jades dog, and out of the blue the pit bull ran in and stole the stick. Owner couldn’t give a shit, I keep my cool cause dogs are dogs, they like to play and be competitive, anyways jades dog end up chasing the pit bull for a bit trying to steal the stick, etc dogs being dogs. I have a quick convo with Jade while turned around and then I hear her gasp, I look back at the GSD and the pit bull are fighting (keep in mind the GSD is a baby female, and this is a grown ass make pit bull, as I’m running over the pit bull had a bite that was locked in on the GSDs neck. (I guess at this time the pit bull owner noticed something was happening and started running over too) so once I reached there our GSD was just sliding out of the bite lock on her neck, I booted the pit bull right in the face, full force. Soccer kick as hard as I could. I’m 6’2 with lengthy legs and arms, 200 pounds. I heard the dog whimper a tad and the owner grabbed a hold of the pit bull while I ran towards the GSD  After a lot of screaming, he’s threatening to call police and press charges. We quickly left with our dog.  AITA here for kicking that dog while our GSD was escaping the bite, did I go overboard ?	1643187019.0	sd1iby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1iby/aita_for_beating_a_dog/	AITA for beating a dog?
iuxr2ixq	My wife unexpectedly died three months ago. We have a daughter who is now four.  Every morning before school, my wife would make our daughter a hot breakfast and lovingly braid her hair. She would also pack a homemade lunch for our daughter and drive her to school. At night, she'd again do our daughter's hair before bed and sing songs until she fell asleep (my wife was a trained singer). I love her and miss her so much. My daughter and I are devastated by her passing.   I spent a month after my wife's death grieving. My in-laws were visiting for my wife's funeral and they helped take care of my daughter then.   Now that they are gone, it's only my responsibility to take care of my daughter. I'm the one who is cooking and doing her hair. I can't sing but I play my wife's song recordings to my daughter before she goes to sleep every night. I clean the house, take her to school and her extracurricular activities, and make sure she is still loved and happy.   A lot of my friends and family members have been encouraging me to remarry so that my daughter has a positive female adult in her life as she grows up. No one can take the place of my late wife and my daughter's late mother though. She was a force of nature and a very strong woman and I refuse to have someone replace her.   My older female cousins told me that my daughter will struggle as she gets older without a motherly figure in her life and told me that I should slowly start to join the dating scene again. Even my parents told me it must be difficult to manage everything on my own and that there is only so much they can do as they get older.  I told them that no one can replace my late wife and I am willing to make many sacrifices to raise my daughter on my own. I don't want any other woman becoming my daughter's new mom or my new wife and erasing the old memories.  At the same time though, I haven't been a parent for as long as my parents  and older relatives, nor do I know what it's like to grow up as a girl as I am a guy. So I've got to ask, am I the asshole? I want to do what's best for my daughter while also honoring and respecting my late wife.	1643187105.0	sd1j3j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1j3j/aita_for_not_remarrying_and_taking_care_of_my/	AITA for not remarrying and taking care of my daughter on my own?
4fpwbddd	(People involved or at least whomst are important TK(The kicked) and OD(other dude)  So me and a group of people have been playing Escape from Tarkov together and we've set up some reasonable rules, or at least have been using rules that you'd think don't need to be said the one that's been a problem for them was: your kill your loot. So what starts this whole debacle TK has been taking loot from everyone, and later on in the day TK takes something OD wants from OD's kill, so after a lot of debating on who's it is OD just shoots TK and TK promises revenge(we were scavs so he basically lost nothing). Also TK still did take loot breaking our rule. Some other things TK would do was complain when we left his loot in situations where we believed was to risky.  Later on like a week or two OD stops playing for a bit to help his girlfriend as her Dad has cancer, so during that week TK asked OD to get on multiple times and when I got in a discord call with TK and he said how he'd like OD to get on the game with us, he didn't really say it in a way that made it seem like didn't give a crap about what OD was doing and just cared about the game.  So now we come to today where OD supposedly takes a helmet that TK claims is his cause he claimed the container the helmet was inside, which the container was not claimed by him it was the previous one had no loot and that I took stuff from it but I didn't (The containers are hidden caches that only I out of the group knew the locations of and I was letting everyone take turns, OD got one first, then TK, then me which the one I wanted was looted by OD and TK, which I was fine with). The argue for a couple minutes and the whole time TK was talking about cashing in the revenge where me and OD say we'll kill him if he tries, low and behold he tries it, and oh, wow, he was killed. After that TK get's upset and tells OD that he hopes OD's GF and her Dad both die of cancer which I immediately said was that too far, TK is then kicked from the group and then sends me a msg about how we don't respect him and basically is telling me I should've let it happen even though the original reason I found petty and stupid and we were slowly starting to get really on our nerves before hand and the acts of no respect I'm pretty sure was him doing the stuff stated above.  Sorry if this seems petty as it wasn't really IRL but on Discord. I tried my best to get as much of what lead to the situation that I could recall or knew of.  TLDR; We kicked someone from a discord group for telling someone else that they hope their gf and gf's dad die from cancer when the GF's dad actually has cancer.	1643187150.0	sd1jij	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1jij/aita_are_we_the_assholes_for_kicking_someone_out/	AITA , Are we the assholes for kicking someone out of a discord group for going too far?
15mu4d	It’s a long one, and complicated so bear with me.  My birthday was at the end of December and my bestie bought me some hair wavers. I’d already bought some from Christmas money I had.   My brothers fiancé - Kate’s birthday was last week. He bought her a handbag. He didn’t know her mother had already bought one for her so he returned it. He was gutted that he cocked up. I said I’d talk to Kate to get an idea for something she wanted. She sent me a list £60 hair wavers £60 & £70 Pandora necklace  Perfume  £55 hoodie  £25 hair treatment Since I had brand new hair wavers that I was never going to use I offered them to my brother to give to her for her birthday. He accepted. Great. Win win, she had hair wavers that she wanted, he had a gift, I got shot of the wavers.  Day of her birthday - I get a text in the evening along the lines of “you can have the regifted wavers that you wanted to get rid of that your bestie bought you back”  Personally I thought this was so rude. I’ve spoken to a few mates and they don’t think I’ve done anything wrong, however it’s been a week and I haven’t heard or spoken to Kate at all. AITA?   P.s my brother had already spend £300 on an overnight get away for the pair of them for her birthday. She also told him she wanted the £60 wavers. It wasn’t a milestone birthday or anything.	1643187362.0	sd1lbx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1lbx/aita_birthday_gift_giving/	AITA birthday gift giving
ttau9a2	 My husband and I started dating in high school,  right before graduation we found out we were pregnant with our first child. We got married, he joined the army, and we moved away from home. The first two years of our marriage my husband was extremely emotionally abusive to me and a severely neglectful father. He never abused our son, just wasn’t present in the home. I went back home  several times but I never left him. In 2020 he asked for a divorce, I originally said begged and pleaded  but eventually agreed but after one session of counseling he decided he wanted to stay together..  So i stayed and we ended up pregnant (failed IUD) and now have two children.  My grandfather passed away at the end of 2020 and my husband abandoned me. Myself , my 4 year old and newborn traveled to my hometown to lay my grandfather to rest. My husband rarely answered my calls and even told me “I don’t have time to help you through this, I want to game before I have to work”  That was my last straw, I lost my shit on him, went completely ape shit on him.  I did not care because I knew that at the end of the day, I would not be his wife anymore. I tried to break things I screamed horrible things at him I shamed him for how he treated me for the past 5 years. Well we didn’t end up divorced instead we moved overseas together, originally things were going okay, he was trying to make up for his mistakes but I generally could not accept the things he would do. Every attempt at better was met with a brick wall, I didn’t withhold any snarky comments and i became extremely vocal about my dislikes.  It all seems too late, instead of cleaning up the mess why make it in the first place. We are trying counselling again but I’ve made it very clear that I feel as if we are wasting our times and damaging our children (they don’t see up argue, but I know eventually they will). Im snarky in counselling and rarely believes the things he says. I know I’m short with him, and i get rude but I’m filled with so much anger for the things he does. This time he seems like he is really trying but I don’t have it in me.  My parents tell me I should suck it up and work through it that I am being childish and putting the kids happiness at risk..   Am I the asshole for not forgiving him or truly accepting his apologises?	1643187667.0	sd1o16	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1o16/aita_for_not_trying_this_time/	AITA for not trying this time?
ebiy3rxa	Hear me out...  Baby #1 will be 22 months when baby #2 gets here. I'm a SAHM and while money is not constrictingly tight, it is still tight on one income. We don't qualify for any outside help as we're just above the threshold, so diapers and formula are already on my mind of planning ahead, especially with the formula shortage crisis going on.  I read every website that says to replace them every so often. Logically I get it.  Emotionally I wonder if it's just another "big pharma" way to keep people buying replacement products at a quicker rate than actually necessary.   I had every intention of buying #2 new nipples, while using the same bottles, and tossed them. They were slightly yellow, not from "going bad", but fat deposit buildup that can be cleaned with vinegar and baking soda. They weren't damaged or stretched. I went down the rabbit hole trying to find new replacements for the brand we use. Every store had a shortage, the company created a "new design" that got absolutely TERRIBLE reviews, and the ones I could find were overpriced by 3rd party sellers.  I had a panic attack, dug them out of the trash, and proceeded to bleach, sanitize, and wash them by hand twice at 2 am. I plan on running them through the dishwasher, vinegar/baking soda bath, hand wash, and sanitize about 5 more times each. I feel like I'm failing my future child, my husband, and myself, because either I'm a disgusting person using old gross nipples, or spending money on nipples that might not work.   We do have samples of a bunch of different bottle brands. I understand #2 might not even take to these bottles, and we'll have to buy a whole new system anyways and this will all be just a moot point. And yes, I plan on trying to breastfeed/pump, but it wasn't possible for me to keep up with supply last time, and I'd rather not try and have a mental break down from "failing" at being solely responsible for feeding my child.	1643187992.0	sd1qws	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1qws/aita_because_i_want_to_reuse_baby_bottle_nipples/	AITA because I want to reuse baby bottle nipples for next baby even though I initially threw them out?
j1amdv0v	I’m a moderator for a group on FB. The group doesn’t allow business posts of any kind, including handmade items that were made with the intent to sell. It’s to keep things clear cut in terms of how business is defined.   “Stacy” posted an item with handmade in the description, so I reached out via FB messenger (after approving her other items - all posts must be approved). I asked if the item was made to sell or if she was reselling it after purchasing it. She responded saying “it was hand crafted”. I responded explaining that it doesn’t mean she made it and explained that the group doesn’t allow items that were made with the intent to sell the item. She responds with “it’s handmade”. At this point I said the post won’t be approved and that she doesn’t have to do anything to remove it.   She says I’m breaking my own rules by not approving it. Sends post of another of the same item she made as “proof” it’s handmade. In my mind that’s just proof she’s making more than one. She says she only has 2 and that isn’t a business. So I explain that we have to draw a line somewhere and that’s where we did. She asks what my problem is and repeats that it’s handmade. I post a screenshot of group rules (that includes the group name). She tells me I’m on a power trip and I inform her I’m blocking her from the group. At that point she says she’s reporting me, so I remind her I’m a moderator and she sends me a list of moderators for a different group. I tell her “wrong group” and send pic of group page. She says I’m just jealous and she doesn’t need to post to my “sh*t” page and I should get a hobby that is productive like hers.   Check FB 5 hours later. Randoms have posted on my personal page, trying to insult me for not approving her post. Then see that Stacy has put me on blast in a bunch of local groups, but changed the story to say she was selling the item because the size wasn’t right for her (which could be true, she just never said it during our 5 min conversation). And apparently had something in the original form of the post about the page she still thought she was posting to (a page specifically for handmade items, which explains a lot of her responses), until a moderator for that page pointed out her mistake and asked her to clarify the post. She did remove that part, but still accused me of being a power hungry moderator. She posted our convo, but left out the part where I said “wrong group” and showed our page and also her basically telling me to get a life. Your basic narrative switch. Garnered a bunch of comments that mostly agree with her, though also seem to think she was posting to the other group (i.e., before the other moderator asked her to clarify her post).   Am I the asshole for not approving the post even though it went against group rules? That’s the only info I had to go off of when making the decision, even though I reached out to her. And why do so many agree with her?	1643188156.0	sd1s5d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1s5d/aita_for_not_approving_this_post/	AITA for not approving this post?
cml6ah91	I'm on mobile and speak terrible english   This whole situation happened two weeks ago. My (18F) Boyfriend of almost 2 years (21M) got called by a mutual friend of us (18F). She apparently had a panic attack and needs comfort and someone to talk to. First she wanted to contact his sister (I love his sister!) but she was buisy so she called him. He went to see her at her house, comforted her in a derpy way and hugged her so she can cry on his shoulder. She apparently felt better after 2 hours so they played a video game together and he got home.  I didn't know about this till a few days later, Friday night as we where at our mutual friends house again. We joked around and she said something like "yeah like when *my bf* was here few days ago." I looked at him weird, but left it like that. I also noticed her outfit, she wore a tight tanktop and her whole bra was showing. It's not like I have something against women who show off skin, but it is winter rn and she hugs my bf and stuff. Before this whole thing she was a hoodie girl.   When my Bf and I were home again I asked him about this. He told me he is sorry and he honestly forgot to tell me he was there. We have an unspoken rule that we tell each other when we meet the opposite sex. I believe him because he has important finals rn and he doesn't have good memory (lmao). But I still feel weird about this whole situation. Im not the jealous type but something about her outfit, her neediness for hugs and the face that she cried on his shoulder where I cried many times before that too? I don't know... I need advise.  Also my bf and her relationship is also more of a joking, party-ish one. She does have other friends who she talks to a lot more often, and I don't believe that everyone was buisy.

bw9u95wn	I (25yo F) come from a huge middle-eastern family. I have probably over 40 cousins, and most of them are approaching their mid-30’s now, which has resulted in me attending weddings more frequently in the past year. I’m not really close with my cousins except for 3 of them, but they live far away. I also haven’t seen my cousin that is getting married next month, let’s call him Bob—in probably 6 years and it was at another cousin’s wedding. Before that, it was probably 16 years ago since we last saw each other.   So the wedding has been pretty last-minute and it is not very official — got an e-vite about a week ago, 3 weeks before the wedding date. Several of my cousins will also not be attending, and I know that’s not an excuse for me to not go as well but I’m just not in the mood for it. I know this sounds like I’m just being lame but I am pretty introverted for the most part and have really bad social anxiety. Even though it is family, a lot of my family members will speak to me in Arabic even though they know I don’t understand what they are saying. It always makes me feel uncomfortable and I’m not close to Bob at all and so I don’t feel inclined to go.	1643188916.0	sd1yhp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1yhp/wibta_if_i_dont_go_to_my_cousins_wedding/	WIBTA if I don’t go to my cousins wedding?
j1auh4v2	Throwaway.  I (26F) and my husband (25M) of three years have been wanting to move out of state for quite some time, and have been planning it since before we got married. I have discussed this with my family before, and though they weren't thrilled, this was not an out of the blue decision.  About five months ago, my mother got in a car accident that left her paralyzed from the waist down. I won't go into the details, but her injuries could have been a lot worse, so I am very thankful that she is still with us. Unfortunately, it is likely that she will never walk again. My father was never in the picture, so she lives alone. Because of this, my sister (23F) who we'll call "Emily" and I have been working together to help our mom through this which includes making her home and everything in it wheelchair accessible, as well as helping her get used to her new life.  Now, my husband and I were planning on moving back in November, but ended up postponing it. I thought I had made it known that we were still planning on moving, but apparently not.  This came up a couple of days ago while Emily and I were both visiting my mom. My mom says saying something along the lines of "thank you for everything you both have done for me" and I ended up mentioning that I plan on coming back to visit her a bunch after the move. Jokingly, my sister replied with "good thing you're not going anywhere soon."  I told them that we might be moving in about a month, and that we had a couple of houses we were thinking of buying. It's not like this was any shocking news, as I've been talking about it with my mom on a regular basis and she would usually reply with something like "you're not moving, I need you here". I always brushed it off.  Well, they both ganged up on me by calling me things like selfish, inconsiderate, and basically all of the other names in the book and I eventually left. I hadn't spoken with either of them until this morning, when I received a text from my sister. She told met that I really upset our mom and that she felt abandoned. Emily then proceeded to tell me that it wasn't right of me to just up and go when my family needed me, and that it wasn't fair to just make her do all of the work when it came to helping my mom.  I didn't respond because I've been thinking about it all day, but I've been kind of torn. I feel horrible about leaving, but I was venting about to my husband and he told me that I deserve to do this for myself. I really don't want to fight with my mom, and I'm thinking maybe I should just stay to keep the peace? After all I don't want to leave on bad terms with some of the only family I have.

cs1at8yb	About 2 years ago I started seeing a girl that I met through some common friends. First as friends, but that changed to friends with benefits after a while. I was in a bad place at that time, she as well, and I guess we kind of found eachother there. It was not long before I hopelessly fell in love with her, and even though she was in an open relationship, it felt like things were going good. As we got closer she suddenly backed off, and we stopped seeing eachother for a while. I eventually came back in contact with her, told her that I loved her and yeah, clearly she said no. That was about a year ago.  Anyway, fast forward 6 months. We didn't talk much inbetween, but we started seeing eachother more often, eventually I ended up sleeping at her place once (yeah, only sleeping though, she stripped naked, lay besides me and told me that she just wanted to sleep). I was also planning to go camping with a bunch of friends , and as they knew her (and I had my hopes up), I invited her. The weekend itself was not so much fun for me, as she completely ignored me. I also had the idea that she was flirting with one of my best friends, and he was not really doing his best to ignore it. I told myself that I was imagining things and even excused myself to him for being a bit of a dick that weekend. As I explained him why, he told me that he would of course never do such a thing (I talked to him a lot about her).  After that weekend  she kind of became a more permanent part of that group of friends, which I did not really like. They even started doing things without me (which I found out by accident), but I guess that was to avoid making it difficult for me(?). In a way I was happy for her though, as she did not have many friends in the city we live, and I know that was hard for her.  Now to the asshole part. Apparently she and the friend I mentioned before got along really well, started going out for drinks with just the two of them (which I figured out by her asking him to 'go for a drink soon' in front of me). And even though my friend says they are just friends and it is nothing more, I really don't like it and I just want to tell him to stop it. I feel like, even if they are just friends, it lacks a lot of respect towards me to just go behind my back and start befriending her. So WIBTA if I tell him that he should stop that friendship?	1643189730.0	sd258s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd258s/wibta_if_i_ask_my_friend_to_stop_befriending_my_ex/	WIBTA if I ask my friend to stop befriending my 'ex'?
j1ctn15c	Been with my partner three years.  I do pretty well for myself, and my partner knows the details of my finances as we are open about that.  We are going to be moving in together soon - hopefully in the next three months.  Right now my partner lives with their mother and other extended family (aunt, 2 cousins).  Currently, my partner's mom wants a cosmetic surgery that is incredibly expensive, but she cannot afford it.  I would like to be clear that this is for a mild to medium facial issue (I don't want to elaborate - privacy).  The surgery is mid five figures, depending on the variance of the surgery (depends on how long it takes, etc.).  Also, it could need a revision that's not priced in there if it doesn't heal correctly.  My partner's mother is embarrassed by the issue.  Normally this would be something that I just immediately help with, but my partner's mom does not work at all and will not look for work.  She initially said she couldn't find work because she was ashamed of the facial disfigurement, but she's also turned down all work from home jobs as well, so I don't believe it.  She relies entirely on my partner, her sister and her sister's adult daughters to cover her bills, and has for years.  Thankfully, once my partner moves that money train is over (my partner has been clear that money toward the household will cease immediately when they move out).  I can more than afford to pay for the surgery, but I really don't feel I should be giving out huge gifts to someone that refuses to support themselves and relies only on others - that sounds like a great way to get me looked to for all her needs.  I know as time marches on and I continue to do this well, my partner is going to wonder why I haven't made this offer, given how generous I am with my partner and others.  So: AITA if I never offer to pay for this surgery, even as I continue to do really well for myself?  I think I might be the asshole because I don't want to pay for this unless her behaviour changes, no matter how much money I have.  That isn't a very charitable way to feel about your partner's parent.  On the other hand, I prefer to help and gift to those that help themselves.  I'd also like to be clear that I've never asked, but my partner has made it clear that they wish they could do this for their mom so I know they'd be over the moon if I did this.  I just feel like it's rewarding bad behaviour.  **TL;DR:** My partner's mom wants a face surgery I can easily afford, but she mooches off others and refuses to work so I don't want to.  Would I be the asshole if I refused to ever pay for this, even if I had copious amounts of money?	1643190191.0	sd2947	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2947/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_for_my_partners_moms/	AITA for not wanting to pay for my partner's mom's surgery?
j1dkcgej	Context: me 21M lives in an apartment with my best friend 20F, my sister 16F suffers from depression generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, the list goes on…  now this all sounds terrible on paper, one would think, what has happened to this young girl so to as affect her so badly? The thing is, nada. That’s your answer, very little has happened in comparison with the upbringing I have had and have emerged “mentally sound“ — my father was an alcoholic and had a hard drug addiction for many years, which ended when my sister was around 4. Given the age gap, she was four and I 11, I surely would have been more affected? It must be said, however, that Bea’s “trauma” is more like a collection of events that most would consider ordinary.   The validity of my sisters proclaimed trauma surrounding benign family events can be explained by her diagnosis with borderline personality disorder.  However, she never makes any attempt to apologise for her actions, to be a giving and loving/engaged member of the family. The only time we see her is a dinner, when she eats still wearing headphones and then proceeds to leave immediately-she doesn’t like any interaction with us, yet proclaims to love us. She asks everything of us, yet never thanks us for it.   My sister is my mother’s job, 24/7 my mom is on duty. She cooks, plates, and brings upstairs almost every food that my sister consumes or demands via WhatsApp — my sister just brings her unhappiness, because she can “never do anything weight” in the eyes of my sister — I think she’s a bit of a selfish a-hole and idk if that’s true?  moms truly are gods	1643191878.0	sd2nya	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2nya/aita_for_thinking_that_my_mentally_ill_sister_is/	AITA for thinking that my mentally ill sister is a selfish bitch.
i57eox23	Using a burner just because.  So this had just happened.  I am a primary school teacher who is right now at home with covid. There are too few staff in school today so the head teacher has sent the children home. The school secretary posted it on the parents forum. Thing is, the message of ten short lines, had ten spelling and punctuation mistakes in it. Like, we are a primary school!  So I messaged the head saying 'not to be a pedant and I am sure it was written in a rush but I think that message home to parents needs tidying up a little.'  She replied saying they are trying their best in school right now.  Now I am thinking I should have left it be.

ij8ollyh	This happened a while ago but I wanna know if I was an AH. I(22F) had made an online friend S(22M), back in Dec 2020.  We are from same college but different campuses. During placement season we have to compete with the student population from all the campuses as well. Everything was virtual because of COVID.  I met him when we’d been put in a breakout room for a Group Discussion for Company X. The GD went well, it was intellectual & cut-throat. We all chatted after the recruiter left & ended up exchanging Insta IDs.  S added me & I added him back. We talked for a couple of days, exchanged nos. He’d often call me up to talk to me about his feelings and stuff post this as he had lost his dad a year ago.  I sympathised.  About 2 weeks after the GD & interviews. We received the mail that both of us had been selected. He called me to congratulate me, asked if he could have my address because he wants to send in something to congratulate me. I refused.  After an over an hour of pestering, I gave it to him.  The same day, in the evening he calls me to tell me the delivery man is waiting downstairs so if I could go get the delivery.  I step into the parking lot to find S in flesh. I’m shocked. I ask him what heck is he doing here. We live over a thousand kilometres apart. I’m rattled & I ask him to leave, he asks me if I could meet him the next day. I say I’ll inform him, still shocked. That night I told him I wasn’t comfortable meeting him like this as he practically sprung upon. He apologized. Asked if we could put this past us. I told him I needed time because this was stalker move on his part.  He would consistently message me & I would leave it on read. This went on for a month until I finally replied and accepted his apology thinking it was an honest mistake. Boy, was I wrong.  We would talk but I would cut short the conversation as I didn’t want to be an emotional resource to him. Surely, I felt bad he had to go through so much but I couldn’t support him emotionally as my dad had just been hospitalised for a heart blockage. We had a scare the previous year as well. I told him I couldn’t be a therapist to him and I needed space. March 2021, he calls me to come out of the house as he is waiting for me and I refuse to step out. I call his mom (he called from her phone once). I tell her that her child has been harassing me. S kept apologising. Told her he’s in my parking lot & is stalking me. I cut ties & blocked him. His mom was teary & mad at him. Apologised on his behalf.  He’d still tries reaching out and through different platforms and accounts & I blocked those too.  I may be an AH for involving S’ mom,  but her child made me uncomfortable. I didn’t know what else to do. It was impulsive. My parents think I shouldn’t have involved a grieving mother.

j1dolf5m	Hi, I'm M25 and my girlfriend Lena is F26.  Yesterday, when Lena and I were out, she found this really cute sculpture. She wanted to take some photos - we took a few together, then she took some solo shots for her Instagram. I helped her take them. However, she didn't look as slim in the photos (most likely the bad angle).   I offered to take more pictures in a different angle, and Lena asked what was wrong. I explained that she looked fatter in the pics. She looked offended and asked why she needed to look slim. I told her she didn't need to, but it'd look better. After all, she is a beautiful skinny woman and the pictures did her no justice. Eventually she accepted and I got some decent photos.  Later, at home - Lena was about to post her pics. She suddenly looked at me and said "You know, I think I want to post my 'fat' pictures." I was shocked and asked why. She got instantly offended, and said "I don't always have to be skinny!". She looked really upset. I apologised but thought she was overreacting. I mean, *most* people want to look their best, and I was merely trying to do that for her. She ended up not posting her solo pictures at all.   I feel a little bad, but at the same time I don't feel I did anything wrong.

cxcu3684	Please note I (28F) am not engaged. My partner (28M) has never asked me to marry him. We often discuss marriage and proposals. We sometimes talk about his first engagement and ex. He bought a ring that he wants his future wife to wear. He gave this ring to his ex and she returned it when they broke up. He plans on using this ring for me or whomever he wishes to marry. I've seen the ring and I don't like it or want it. For me, it's actually not about the ring. It's about spending a life together. I would be happy with just a proposal and no ring at all.

lu8u3i6	Little more info we've been friends for 6 years nearly all of high school. We had a sister bond sort of crap.  My Friend (F17) out of nowhere wanted a boyfriend so she took the chances by asking out a boy she let down before for a weird comment he made. He rejected her making an out of nowhere comment saying he thought she was sleeping with our guy friends.  With that she ignored me and all her friends for about 4-5 days not a single word to anyone as to why she's doing this I'm the only one who knew. She started hanging out with girls who she used to mock for being "basic" and all that.  I talked with a friend who knew the context and confirmed to him that this 'phase' of hers wouldn't last long because she's done this before to me and everyone.  She heard what I said and took it out of context without evening letting me explain completely blacklisted me then got mad at me for 'ignoring her' and not trying to communicate to her when she was ignoring me.  Instead of her apologizing to me for completely ignoring me for days on end. She expected a big massive irl apology and said "I'm only talking to you out of the decency you're a human being. I'm expecting an apology because I deserve it so grow some balls already" or some shit like that. Once again not letting me explain the situation I refused to apologize because I found her behaviour of the situation appalling. When I finally *quite lately* apologized she treats me like a stranger, and seems to still hate me. AITA for feeling the way I did?	1643193958.0	sd36r9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd36r9/aita_my_best_friend_stopped_being_friends_with_me/	AITA My Best Friend Stopped being Friends with Me because She Ignored Me and Didn't Let Me Explain.
b6q5ujku	 throwaway because i dont want anyone to find my account. im also on mobile so i apologize in advance.  long story short, i used to be a foster child. i moved to my “aunt’s house, after she wanted to take me in. i lived there with her husband and children for not even 3 months. she kicked me out of the house for not giving my phone password to her, and even tried as far to get an emergency removal, to get me out that same night.   the system is entirely messed up, for those who dont know. they didnt want to get me out of the house that night, since i would have been bounced, sleeping in offices, etc. not to mention this situation was immediately at the start of covid. so i had to wait two weeks living there while the state worked to find a new home. during those weeks, i was constantly misgendered, ridiculed, and messed with. i was blamed for random things, and even was told there were cameras in every room by the “cousin” in question.    my “aunt” took my phone, ipad, and school and personal laptop, and none of those devices even work anymore. i felt there needed to be a backstory to this, because everyone in the house was against me for not giving my password, especially “cousin” because i let her use my ipad for snapchat when her phone was taken, and she didnt want her account to show up.   onto whats the main problem. my brother recently texted me, showing me a screenshot of my “cousin” texting him. she was wanting my phone number, to ask how i was doing. in these messages, she used my deadname and misgendered me.    theres other things she did and said that i can explain later in the comments, but basically i told my brother no. i didnt want to speak to her, or even talk about her. there was so much that happened in so little time, i had no way to process it and i didnt feel comfortable. he was on my side, but i still feel kinda shitty because maybe she just wants to check on me, or apologize. i trusted them as a family for so long, so i wanted to hear her out i guess?   i asked my friends and while most agreed, a couple brought up that past is past, and i should at forgive her. i dont know what to do, so i just need to know. aita for not wanting to ever talk to her again?	1643194090.0	sd37vf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd37vf/aita_for_not_ever_wanting_to_text_my_cousin/	AITA for not ever wanting to text my cousin?
iulk448q	My husband (31) M, and I (25) F, got into a discussion about frontline workers, now I understand frontline workers are mainly nurses, doctors, etc.but during the pandemic, I honestly dont think that's the case.   Now our discussion stemmed from the fact my husband was talking about how people that worked as cashiers or work in department stores or any job that doesn't require to be an actual frontline worker, would absolutely do nothing but just stand there and complain how they would count themselves off as frontline workers during this pandemic. Now, mind you, normally I would ignore his rant and just let him be since he does work with patients with mental disabilities, but it bothers me that he would undermine other peoples job just because to him it seems like they are doing nothing.   I told him off, I asked him if he had worked their job during this pandemic, if he had been through different types of people who are vaccinated or not, masked or not, and deal with each people with different attitudes everyday. I told him that everyone is struggling right now, not a lot of people are working, and the ones that are working are the ones that are risking getting infected everyday, as you or me. As I continued what I had to say, I told him that it wasnt the first time he was like that, him and his family put down other people and their jobs because they think its "easy" that "it shouldn't be that hard", that's what set him off and got him angry with me and wont talk to me.  Now I feel bad about what I said but I know and feel like I wasnt in the wrong.

h6klwohp	this is actually my second post on here and i hope it’s better this time.   so, i (20f) started university in 2021. i have been living with my boyfriend since april of 2021 but i haven’t started university until september. before that, i worked full time (up to 42 hours a week) and had an additional job where i earned around 450€ (12 hours a week). i did this for around 3 months. after that i only had the 450€ job.   i tried to save for some stuff like an ipad for uni and a new car (my parents still paid a lot for it, i just added a little bit to the total price). during this time i would also pay for stuff like groceries and new things for our flat since my boyfriend paid rent (he works full time).   my parents refused to give me the money they get from the government (in germany you get around 200€ each month for each kid) since i was still listed at home and they had to pay for “water and electricity” (tbh, don’t argue on the fact that this is bs, i tried too many times) so i basically lived financially independent.   since uni started (i am studying and working, it’s a mix of both which leads to around 24 hours a week in working and 12 hours in uni) i got the money because i’m not able to work extra.   so i have around 400€ a month (200€ from the government and 200€ from work). i wanted to apply for extra financial aid that is granted to students and depends on your parents earrings. i would definitely get a good amount of money since my parents are not well off, but you have to pay back half of it after your studies finished.   this way, you should always put money away to not fall into any debts (which i am planning to do).   brother also applied to this program but still lives at home, he doesn’t go to university but to school (he is 23 and redoing his a-levels). he has plenty of time to work besides school but just wants to go parties and spend time with his friends (he once had a job but quit). the thing is, i would get a less money because the program calculates his money to mine.   this is where i might be the asshole.   since he is going to finish this year and has no costs (i need to drive to work which adds up to 200€ a month for gas alone) i asked if he could skip the program because i really need the money. i want to pay my share in rent, groceries and stuff like this but i am not able to right now. my parents said that this is ridiculous and i am being unfair but i always need to ask my bf and friends for money because it gets very tight at the end of the months. i would work but i need to focus on university because my work is paying for it (around 800€ each month) and if i fail they might drop me.	1643194572.0	sd3c89	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3c89/aita_for_asking_my_brother_to_work/	AITA for asking my brother to work?
j1dylm4g	So me (M26) and my now ex gf (F26) of three years broke up a couple weeks ago. I initiated the break up, and because we live together we agreed she could stay till the end of the month cuz she payed for it. Things actually were concluding well with open conversations and honesty about what the other needs to work on. It was starting to bring us back to our normal selves a bit.   Then the other day while I was at work she opened my laptop and found an email from Only Fans about a subscription ending. She has barely spoken to me since. The little I got out of her was her saying I'm a POS person and that if I had an only fans account then I was cheating in our relationship. I told her that I had only had it for a month or so and that I never DM any girl. I just used it like any other porn site, no posting content or private DM content. She is completely ignoring me now and has said its absolutely disgusting that I would have this.   So AITA for having an only fans account? Again not to post my material, just to use it as a porn site.	1643194956.0	sd3g5o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3g5o/aita_gf_thinks_having_only_fans_is_cheating/	AITA Gf Thinks Having Only Fans Is Cheating
258jriui	I (24m) have been living with my mom (58f) in this condo for over 12 years. The past few years I’ve really wanted to take the next step in life and get my own place with my partner, and last year we were ready to do so. I talked to my mom about it and she completely shut down and asked for one more year to prepare. My mom doesn’t make a lot of money, has gone through alcohol addiction, childhood traumas, bad divorces… I said yes to giving her one more year. So fast forwarding to the present, this is the year I’m moving out, our lease is up in May and my mom can’t afford to live here alone. She has completely shut down the past few days,  not going to work or leaving her room. My sister (32f) had to come over last night to talk to her, and my mom just lost it. She was begging me to give her another year, telling me she doesn’t want me to leave, and what really made me feel the most sad was her saying she “just wants to go home”. That hit me hard because we were in our home, but since I’m moving out, she feels she doesn’t have a home anymore because she can’t afford this place by herself. My sisters and I have told my mom so many times that she needs to seek professional help due to her severe depression, but she never does. I don’t want my mom to think I’m leaving her maliciously, and I really wish there was a way I could help her and find her a place to live but sadly I don’t have the resources( of course I’ll help her look). Sorry for such a long post, and possibly including details that arent relevant. AITA for not giving her another year?   Please note that my mom has known for over a year that I have had these plans, and she hasn’t been preparing at all.	1643195300.0	sd3jck	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3jck/aita_for_moving_in_with_my_partner_and_not_giving/	AITA for moving in with my partner and not giving my mom another year to prepare?
ce9e4j9d	I (26Married Male) was at the bar shooting pool, ended up shooting pool with a group of strangers. A (39married female) in the group is overly flirty with an even older guy that she seems to know. In the middle of their banter and flirting she, happily and jokingly, asks if he just touched her ass.  I pull her aside and ask her if he did and what had happened. She plays it off saying that he’s like a dad to her. I ask her if; she thought that was appropriate, if her husband would be okay with that and if that’s something her dad would be doing. She sums it up to it not being my place to ask.  I go over and ask the guy, very in his face, making a scene. Very much so instigating a ‘fight’  He doesn’t have much to say.  I keep pushing it and the bartender has to ask me to leave because of how aggressive I am being and how much of a scene I’m making.  AITA for not minding my own business. These 2 are both regulars at this bar and I’m from out of town visiting family. Me making a scene did nothing, and threatening this guy was just escalating a situation for no reason.	1643195789.0	sd3nu7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3nu7/aita_for_causing_a_scene/	AITA for causing a scene
h8f01jk7	So I (23F) and my SO (24M) have been together for 3 years, at the time. Were expecting or second child around August (2021). His ex?-step sister was getting married in August (2021). (His dad married her older sister, they divorced later on)  Anyways, while I was pregnant with our oldest (2018-2019 pregnancy) I had asked him what his thoughts were on marriage later down the road. His family is SUPER religious. My side was a bit more laid back about it, but still expecting it. (If we are right for each other) They were thinking we were getting married **BEFORE** our oldest was born.   He hadn't mentioned to me at the time, that his side was pressuring him into getting married. He snapped at me saying, "Marriage is just a piece of paper! It's not like anything is going to change how we live and interact with one another." And I left it at that. (I was honestly heart broken with how he responded. I'm pretty sure I cried over it later on that night.)  2021 late July, early August rolls around. He asks me. "What is your thought on marriage?" I replied with, "It's just a piece of paper." (Making him eat his own words is cold I know that...) he tried convincing me that it was a Promise between two people. To love and cherish one another. To grow old and build a life together. He seemed kind of down and bummed out about how I responded.   We had our second child, in the first week of August. The wedding was the second week of August, so we attend. (No children were allowed) As the ceremony is taking place, he starts looking at me during this. (I assume to see if I have a spark or change of heart)  We had to leave early since I had to go into work to cover a shift. He asks me again on the drive home. I responded with, "It was nice, but I don't see the big deal." He changed the subject after that.  To this year (2022) He wants a wedding. But I don't see a point in it really. If we sign the papers, we are legally married.   But AITA for telling him Marriage is just a piece of paper AFTER he said it to me?	1643196076.0	sd3qmd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd3qmd/aita_for_using_the_same_words_he_said_to_me/	AITA For Using the same words he said to me?

yek1z	Literally right before all the lockdowns etc my brother and sister in law's gave us all ( the entire family ) a holiday to France in some centre parcs esque camp.  They are much better off than all of us, and are very generous.  As the date approached it was obvious with all the restrictions it would have to be postponed or cancelled altogether.  Since then many things have changed, my family and my mother and father in law's have brought dogs into the family, traveling from the UK to France is a long journey which we are not sure the dogs will like, our dog is also an ex rescue from Bulgaria and still freaks out if she hears odd things like a particular Van door opening ( that may remind her of either her journey, or past life) so leaving her here in Kennels or taking her just isn't fair IMHO, she's been moved multiple times and I just don't like the idea of it, she's been with us 2 years.   Financial pressures also, we just can't afford a holiday, even if someone else is paying EVERYTHING, it's not much fun just sitting about just being there.  This is meant to be a family holiday and being together right?  The reason for going to France was that the centre parcs in this country would be far more expensive ( if you book the stupid level of accomodation of course)    My wife and I are also self employed and she in particular works as a wedding photographer, so the time they want to go is peak earnings time.  And then we get to the good bit!  My Vaccination status, please remember this wasn't an issue when this idea was formed and I've subsequently spent Christmas with them all and been tested etc etc so that's not the issue.  So whilst posting on the group chat for the holiday( which nobody reads in time ) they are clearly trying to flog this dead horse again.  They start up about the issues around taking the dogs ( they know we have reservations, why keep pushing this?!)  This makes me think about myself, and although possible it's really not happening. I'm not going.  So in reply to my wife's comment about the dog and not wanting to take her but unsure where to leave her I reply  "no need, I'll just stay behind"  And leave instantly.  Literally at that point my sister in law posts something about the rules regarding my entry, I've already left now.  My issue is.  If it's a family holiday and being together is what it's about, then why go there when there's resistance?  I feel they care more about hedonistic opulence than us all being together and comfortable.   And for those wrestling with the vaccination thing, think of it like this..   I broke my hip and can't go on the mountaineering holiday planned, others in the family are less able now too, but we could all do go ape or something ( high ropes) be together and do something that suits us all better.

5c9czkhh	So I commissioned someone to make a Logo for me. After a day, they sent it to me and it looked very amazing! The problem was... that it was very pixilated. The edges were rough, and if I were to slap it onto any form of overlay or anything else, it would be immediately noticeable.  I informed them about it and asked if they could remake it. They said they felt bad so they would! Without any communication back from their side, they texted me back after a few days, saying that they are learning and won't fix it since something came up in their life that they have to deal with.  I'm a bit disappointed and feel tricked. I don't know if I should ask for my money back.  TLDR; Commissioned someone and got a problematic result. Said they would re-make it, then after a few days, said they wouldn't.

7s8bg5cy	OK, let me explain. This happened a few years ago and I was telling the story to a group of people and several said it was an AH move. Here's what happened:   So B and I met on OKcupid, we hit it off pretty well and met. We got on like a house on fire and I thought it was going great. cut to six months later and I'm getting real sick of the mental and emotional abuse then the straw that killed the camel comes out. She must have thought I was out because she was talking to her friend about a night a couple of months ago where I wasn't feeling well and she wanted to get amorous and I wasn't feeling it. She mixed Erectile Dysfunction meds into my food and how she thought she was so clever for thinking of it.    I was livid and packed my stuff and left. A friend let me stay with him when I told him what happened.  I sent my now ex  text and just said we're done. Oh did I forget to mention she had anger management issues and I wasn't sure she wouldn't try to put a few new holes in me with a pointy object? Yeah, I know don't stick it in crazy, but the crazy didn't start to show itself until about the 5 month mark. She blew up. Freaking out and calling me every name in the book. She told me I had better come back if I knew what's good for me. I had called my mother and let her know just in case the ex called her. I was close with my mother and told her almost everything. Well guess what the ex does......yup, calls my mother.    Here's what you need to know about my mother. She's a kind, friendly, and caring woman, Until you do something to hurt one of her boys. My ex calls her and asks why I won't talk to her. Folks, my dear sweet sainted mother tells my ex, "Well, maybe if you hadn't treated my son like garbage and drugged him for sex he might have been willing to speak to you. Do not call here again." Yup my mother also didn't believe in beating around the bush. She said what she meant and meant what she said. Funny side note, my baby sister (I call her that because she the youngest at 25 at the time) offered to beat my ex up for me, It's nice to know people actually love me.   Anyway, cut to me telling the story recently and a few people in the group called me a coward and an AH for using text to break up. I don't think I'm an AH because I like not having extra holes in me.	1643197766.0	sd46kb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd46kb/aita_broke_up_with_ex_via_text/	AITA Broke up with ex via text
j1ftuxjz	I (18f) and my siblings (23f, 29f) grew up with primarily my mom (47f) after dad left. Growing up there was a lot of “traumatic” events we had to deal with, which I’ll get into in a minute. A couple months ago I got psychologically evaluated because I always knew I had something going on because I always struggled in school. I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, ADHD and PTSD. (Not all at once it was a whole process.) A few of the reasons I came to realize why I was like this was because of my mom. Now, everyone in the family knows my mom has SEVERE depression, bi polar disorder and anxiety so she’s done many things to herself that caused hospitalization, etc. That’s one example of trauma that we experienced. However the worst of it is because of how she treated my siblings and I.  For example, when I was 8 years old, my sister (I’ll call her Brandy 12 at the time) and I were teasing my mom about harmless stuff and she pulled over on the road and kicked us out of the car and drove off. We had to walk 8 miles home. She’s done this multiple times to all of us and once even when it was my friend and I. Growing up she always CONSISTENTLY called me a fat cow and degraded me for my weight despite me being on the thinner side. Another HUGE issue is that she is ragingly racist, we are Latina for reference, and she has attacked me many times for dating n* words (in her words) and has said “we don’t mix our blood with them.” And she said if I ever got pregnant she would “push me down the stairs.” She has also kicked me out for having a C in school in my sophomore year.  My mom has thrown things at me when she got mad, she controlled how my hair was cut, she said she would cut me off if I ever got tattoos (I have one but I hide it.) there’s so many things that I could go on. She does things that are nice too and I don’t want to paint her as a complete monster because that’s just not fair.  Now on to the current. When I got my diagnosis my mom asked me how it went. When I told her the results she said “how the f*ck do you have PTSD.” And I told her 1. Because I was SA and 2. Because of childhood trauma. Now this is when it gets messy. She says “what childhood trauma?!” And puts me down immediately and I calmly brought up those points while asserting that I don’t hold it against her and my dad had his part too. My mom had the worst meltdown the family has ever seen. She spammed me on text, she sent me emails COMPLETELY GASLIGHTING ME and threatening to take my home and my car. She flipped everything onto me and basically said that those things either didn’t happen or that she was completely justified.  My oldest sister “Mary” (29) got in contact with me and said I did it the wrong way and that I need to be gentle with mom because she has all her own issues and she had a hella traumatic life and that I shouldn’t have even brought that stuff up. I can’t help but feel like I’m the AH because I brought up those points.	1643198199.0	sd4awu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4awu/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_was_abusive/	AITA for telling my mom she was abusive
cyw8gbsu	A little backstory. I (14f) and my father (38m) get along pretty well usually. However, he gets a little uncomfy when I wear makeup. I also bear a bizarre resemblance to his late sister. This lipstick was free to me from my aunt if that's important.  So I woke up this morning and saw "clean the bathroom!" written on the mirror in one of my lipsticks. I'm upset because I ran out of makeup remover, so that's coming off, and I have to throw that lipstick away because it was on the mirror that I haven't cleaned yet.   I asked him not to do it again and explained why, and he got a little offended because he was trying to be cute. This lipstick was free to me from my aunt if that's important.	1643198524.0	sd4ei5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4ei5/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_dad_used_my_lipstick/	AITA for being upset that my dad used my lipstick?
cze1msxy	I (F16) live with my mom (F50) and sister (F25) and to give you guys some context, my sister has been living here since she graduated and has been making almost 0 contributions financially. She always makes my mom pay for everything, even though my mom does not earn much herself. My sister has a job and makes enough money to pitch in at home, but she makes it very clear that she does not want to.   My sister recently got into a new relationship and has been talking about her boyfriend (M29) non-stop. In the beginning it was funny, but now it's just downright annoying. Yesterday morning, she was talking to my mom about her boyfriend again (just repeating stuff that she had already told her) and I butted in to talk to my mom about college (since I'll be applying soon). I didn't interrupt, I just asked her a quick question and right when I was about to leave, my sister started to complain about how all I spoke about was college. This made me mad, but TBF, recently I have been talking about college a lot. I'm just really anxious about the entire process so I'm always asking my mom for advice on things and I guessed this irritated my sister. I can see this now, but in the moment, I got so mad and started yelling at her. I called my sister several names and even brought up the fact that she was always talking about her boyfriends which, for obvious reasons, made her mad too. Things got physical and although I didn't initiate it, my mom got mad at me and said that she wants the both of us to leave as soon as possible. I feel terrible and I don't know what to do. On the one hand, I feel like my sister is selfish and deserved everything I said to her. But on the other hand, she is still my sister and I wish I showed her more respect. So, AITA for yelling at my sister and 'putting her in her place'?	1643198376.0	sd4chg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4chg/aita_for_putting_my_sister_in_her_place/	AITA for putting my sister in her place?
47l9nzoj	Hi everyone,  I am in my mid 20s and husband is in his early 30s. We met when I was in college and I was young and stupid. We got married in under 6 months and have been together for 3 years now. We also have 2 young kids together.  My son is almost 2 and last year my husband quit his reasonably paying job to help our son with his milestones. Son was 10 months wasnt crawling at all. I was 4 months pregnant at the time and had better benefits. We both decided this would be the best move.  Husband took 3 months off and during that time, after years of trying to get him into my job (federal worker) he accepted the position for 30k less so that he could in 3 years make what I'm making. I was totally fine with that at the time.  So then we had our daughter half a year ago and money is extreamly tight. I guess we didnt figure in daycare and we have less help from my family. My husband also refuses to get vaxxed and the environment in our home is so toxic that my son has been vomiting. I tell my husband I'm not fighting in front of kids but he doesnt stop and wont leave the room.  I'm trying so hard to remain calm but I feel like my needs are constantly swept under the rug. Nothing I do is right. He hates my family and even convinced me to stop talking to them on multiple occasions. That's my fault. Young and dumb.   Every single day he tells me I'm not going enough and that I'm blaming my unhappiness on him and our marriage. But I've told him a million times that I dont feel like he cares and that I just want love. He even forgot our anniversary and told me that he can't chahge the past and I'm being unreasonable. Every time I mention ANYTHING about how his actions hurt me, he plays the blame game.   We even went to see my cbt therapist a few times and she has told me in private sessions that he us very controlling and has a lot of emotional growing to do.  At this point I am severely depressed. My job also decided to turn on me (change in management) even though I have gotten all 5s on previous reviews. He told me that he is going to stay with this job regardless of how I feel because it's his decision to stay in a cushy federal job. He doesn't care that we work at the same place and that I literally got him the job and my own position is currently in the air.   I am currently interviewing for much better and higher paying Positions.  Anyway. I feel like after giving him EVERYTHING that he wanted that I no longer matter. I spent the last 3 years thinking if I gave a man everything that one day he will love me in return  I want to separate and even tried sleeping in the closet. He keeps telling me that he refuses to coparent because he doesnt want to lose time with the kids. In all honesty, I feel so disgusted with my life. I honestly hate that I'm never ever enough and everything I do is wrong. Please help. He tells me I'm the asshole and breaking this family. Maybe I am the asshole but I feel trapped.	1643198742.0	sd4gtf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4gtf/wibta_for_separating/	WIBTA for separating?
iiwwt799	So he went to spend the weekend with his friends while I watched our 7 month. I also had to drive an hour both ways to drop him off because they rufused to drive 10 extra minutes to pick him up on the way (we share a car). He literally will do anything for them and they never return the favor... they've been best friends since they were small. They're genuinely nice guys, but extremely irresponsible,  kinda like mountain dudes. Most of them are single, unmarried, and smoke weed all day.  My husband isn't like them at all, but loves them to death. They also still kiss on the cheeks to greet eachother (despite that being heavily discouraged for obvious reasons), aren't very clean, and pee on the floor when they visit us (which is rare honestly- an hour is too far for their effort).  So he went and had a ski weekend with them, and one of his friends was throwing up Saturday night. He didn't tell me until we were at his 95 year old grandma's house on Wednesday, and then started vomiting a few hours later. So we basically exposed at risk people to this thing, which was totally preventable. He was also supposed to take me out for dinner that night, which I was excited about because it would have been the first time he's spent time with me in weeks since he's always away.  I'm mad because he didn't ask me to pick him up when he saw his friend was sick and stayed the day after.. and this is also so typical of these guys. When I was pregnant, his friend kissed me on the cheek and then told me immediately afterwards that he was exposed to a certain famous illness. I also tried to plan a surprise party for him once, and because his friends are like this, I didn't know they were coming until they just randomly showed up without a word the day of. I just can't stand irresponsible guys, especially when I have a baby. I'm very careful about washing my hands and being clean, but these dumbasses have nothing to lose.   I'm also mad because I know I'm going to get it in a few days (along with the baby) and he will be away on a work trip. But while he's sick he expects me to take care of him, take care of the baby, and be super sweet. Instead I'm pretry cold and bitchy to be honest.. and at the end if the day it's not his fault he got it. I guess I'm furious at his friend and taking it out on him.. but he always defends them.	1643199266.0	sd4m64	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4m64/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_partner_for_bringing/	AITA for being mad at my partner for bringing home the stomach bug?
61exl2wk	My partner has a best friend who got married to his now wife last year. The two of them were/are planning on getting married later this year.  Everyone was excited, my partner and I were even able to get vacation to fly to their wedding.  My partner is even supposed to moderate the event and everything just seemed to go as planned.  Until about 5days ago.  I got a message for his best friends wife. Let’s name her Lisa.  Lisa texted me asking to not tell my boyfriend whatever she is going to say next.  I ensured her that I won’t say anything but then she told me that she wants a divorce. Lisa said that there was a fight between the two of them the other night and that both of them haven’t talked since then. She said that she was at a point where she doesn’t want to be with him and questions if he ever even loved her. I listened to her and told her to take some time off- maybe go to a friends place or her parents to get a clear mind etc.  She agreed and is now on her way to her parents. I was very shocked about the story but since I know my partner and hers I know that they are very similar so I know that her husband does NOT have a clue on what is going on.  He really loves her a lot. For him she is the perfect match.  But guys are still guys which means that sometimes they don’t understand their actions to the fullest.   As for today I am the only one knowing about all this. I really want to help them but I promised her not to tell my partner.  In my opinion I really want to tell my partner and ask him to talk to Lisa’s Husband. Since that will probably help.  But if I do ,then I break my promise and trust towards her… But if I don’t say anything and it turns out I knew then I might ruin their friendship… So AITA?	1643199913.0	sd4ssd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4ssd/aita_for_not_telling_my_partner_that_his_best/	AITA for not telling my partner that his best friends wife wants a divorce?
j1fs5upn	I (21M) have a group a friend of 8 people(all Males with ages between 20 and 22) and we've been together for 5+ years at this point.  In the group of friends, there's a guy named Mark(22M) and I don't like Mark, he's annoying to hang out with, if the group is having fun and drinking beers together just chilling, Mark makes everything about him, how miserable his life is and how he's so unlucky and how all the girls his age are in university and think they are too good for him (When we left high school, unlike the others, he decided he didn't want to go to university to follow his dream of being a full time streamer)  Covid hit and one of our friends told mark that now would be his perfect opportunity to be a full time streamer and he said no because it's not how he had planned it   Almost 2 years later, most of our group improved a lot together, we start going to the gym together, we start taking care of our looks and some got girlfriends while others are happy with the casual fling but not Mark, he stayed the same and seems like he resents us for improving but he decided he wanted to improve too and he decided to start with his social skills so he start talking with people on Discord servers and with VRChat  He met a girl in a Discord Server and they start dating after knowing each other for 4 days and she lives in the same state as my girlfriend, so he asked me if next time i went to visit my girlfriend, if he could tag along and now here's the thing i might have been the asshole : I ask him if he already had saw the girl through photos or video calls and he said no so I reply with "So we are just going to be playing Where's Waldo on the airport without knowing how she looks?" My friends start laughing and Mark got offended and left  Later the group chat went crazy making jokes about how they are both going to make love with the lights turn off because if the light was on, they would be the one's turn off and similar jokes  The next morning, i woke up with messages from my friends saying that I'm the asshole because Mark was offended and i hurt his feelings and he was really happy he found somebody that loves him from him and not because of his looks and i ruin it, making other think it's okay to joke like that  But some other friends said that Mark needs to grow up cause it's not normal to date somebody after knowing for 4 days and without ever seeing a picture and he should know we were just teasing  I don't think i'm the asshole cause i didn't make any comments about the looks, i was just trying to show him that how are we supposed to find her in a airport full of people if they don't know how they look  So am i the asshole for saying the Where's the Waldo comment?	1643200016.0	sd4tsf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4tsf/aita_for_making_a_comparing_somebodys_girlfriend/	AITA for making a comparing somebody's girlfriend to Where's the Waldo
7fotk47r	So, I met this guy on another sub group, I posted some sort of ad, looking for some company as I was bored as hell and I had a rare free time on my hands.   I was planning on an out of town trip with the premise of a One Night Stand, as I have been sexually inactive for two years and I wanted to feel intimate with someone again.   The night before the trip, he made plans for us to have lunch/dinner, do trips on the side. I was just expecting to do the stuff and probably not go out of the room till the next day. Suprisingly, he was a really good companion, I really enjoyed our time together.   However, the sex was such a fail on my part, as I was freaking dry as hell. I didn't know what was wrong with me. We tried everything, but till the morning I was still dry and mine was really sore. But he was patient and didn't force me to do it anymore. 🥲  Throughout the whole trip, he was repeatedly saying that we should meet again and do it somewhat regularly, but I was insisting this was a one time thing. However, we have a really good connection, we found out we have a lot of common interests. So, my indecisive ass reluctanlty said yes, that maybe we could give this a try. But by the end of the trip as we were about to part ways, he just got up and left the car and say a nonchalant goodbye. I was dumbfounded and kinda shocked, thinking, "How the hell did it end up like that" I was expecting a proper goodbye at least since it was obvious we both enjoyed the time together.  I cried while driving home, and I realized I'm a pathetic loser who gets attached easily. I confronted him about it, he said we shouldn't try anything anymore since he has his own 'demons' to get rid of. I was frustrated and said more than I should. In the end we aren't speaking anymore.   So am I the asshole?	1643201192.0	sd55vs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd55vs/aita_for_insisting_it_to_be_just_a_one_night/	AITA for insisting it to be just a One Night Stand, but I've already attached.

j1ghp1jc	I don’t want to give too much away as the parent could potentially see this. I am 34, female, and for the majority of my life have been this parents crutch. I have done everything to please them in every way I can but it was never enough. They would always make me feel guilty whenever I didn’t feel comfortable doing something and I would end up doing it. For example, they didn’t drive.. so I would do the food shopping (under 10 years old) by using my bike to to ride to the shop and get all the shopping.. I would do this for anything else they wanted or needed.. I would do the housework to make them happy then have it thrown back in my face that the house wasn’t as clean as they’d have it. (I cleaned to the point I had lifted the microwave, kettle, toaster off the kitchen sides to clean underneath). I even cooked dinners for the whole family most days whilst going to school and dealing with that pressure. One thing I haven’t mentioned is they are mentally ill. They have received help for this over the years but nothing has helped them. I always feel like if I do or say the wrong thing they may act in a bad way as they have done so before.  Anyway, I now have my own children and sometimes a situation will arise that makes me think of what this parent did, and I get angry and think I would never do that to my own children, how could they? They would make me feel so guilty about not helping them (even though I did). There would be times when they’ve asked me to clean the house from top to bottom and they would be screaming their head off whilst getting it on with their partner in their bedroom. They would do this when I had friends over too. You couldn’t even pretend the noise was something else.  Anyway, my question is, knowing that they have mental health issues, AITA for wanted to be free of them?	1643201335.0	sd57cj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd57cj/aita_for_not_wanting_anything_to_do_with_my_parent/	AITA for not wanting anything to do with my parent?
cgxa9yfq	So recently my ex and I decided to work things out and get back together.  Shortly after, his father passed away. I’ve tried being there for him through everything and he pushed me away. I’ve taken off of work for him, waited around for him, and he completely ghosts me.  Well I’m in contact with his ex and suggested he reach out to let her know, because his family and her were close. He questioned why I even suggested it. I thought it would be nice, and the right thing to do.  We were supposed to see each other several times, and he blew me off for his friends. I’ve offered my support, especially since my own dad has passed and I know exactly what he’s going through.  Days later I find out he’s seen his ex (they broke up June 2020 according to him, Jan 2021 according to her), and he lied to me about everything. She’s been over their house comforting them, helping with funeral arrangements, and everything. Now if he wouldn’t have hid it from me, I probably would only be a little upset that she was there before me to help out, but he flat out lied and said he had no idea she was coming over, he lied and said they weren’t together that day.  I confronted him and said that I’m upset that I was lied to, and he says he doesn’t have to answer to me and I had no right to know anything. And that I’m such a horrible person for bringing this up days after his dad died.  I tried everything in my power to not bring it up but I couldn’t hold back. I know the timing is horrible, I really feel bad. But to be in a relationship with someone who says I have no right to know and that he doesn’t have to answer to me about anything he does just didn’t sit right with me.  Am I the asshole for breaking up with him over this?	1643203082.0	sd5s48	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd5s48/aita_for_leaving_my_bf_days_after_his_dad_died/	AITA for leaving my bf days after his dad died
20cjmagv	I want to try to make this short. My bf (26) is visiting from England. Things were going great the first couple months, he’s here for about a month longer but about last week he started becoming super negative. Just little things at first like I was helping him with our sink, showing him the different settings and he says “I know how to push a button”. A couple days ago I was helping him find his socks after I did his laundry, he wanted a different pair than the first I handed him and he says “but I doubt you know where the other ones are”.   Yesterday we went to the beach (my suggestion to cheer him up). He complained half the time because he couldn’t find a particular type of stone I had showed him and we didn’t find any sea glass or anything. Pretty silly but I said he should just enjoy the time we get together.   After the beach a few hours being back at the house he says I have to see this tiktok. It turns out to be about how to get sugar mommas or daddies on tinder. He knows I’m insecure and I’ve accused him of talking to other girls in the past. Later in the night when I mention it he blows up and flips everything on me. He says he “wouldn’t have such a shitty personality if I wasn’t accusing him all the time”.   I feel like whenever I bring up my feelings they’re invalidated and things get flipped. Everything gets blamed on me. I told him if our whole relationship has been awful he can leave and I don’t know why he would come. He’s not talking to me now and is sitting outside. I need to know AITA? I admit I accused him a lot in the past but kI’ve been trying to change, that tiktok just set alarms off. I made him breakfast in bed this morning hoping to just be good. I hope I can get some advice on what to do because I miss the nice side of him I know.	1643202883.0	sd5pxo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd5pxo/aita_and_just_causing_problems_in_my_relationship/	AITA and just causing problems in my relationship or are my concerns valid?
e9kvb6je	Me- 15 L- 18 E- 17 O- 14 D- 14  This goes all the way back to March of 2021.  My ex, O, (who is now my “friend”) has his ex, D. D is an asshole to not only me but O’s other ex, E. And we found out recently that D hates me and E because we dated O. D has resulted to calling me a C*nt, and no one was okay with that (I’m a trans man but I still present female because I can’t change my situation yet as I am a minor). And our other friend, L, also got called a c*nt. L has told D off about and D apologized not only to her but also so E and I. And we have told O many many times to drop D, which they have refused to do so. Which brings us to the present.  D found out about some messages L and I were sending O and threw a hissy fit. In said hissy fit, D broke something valuable to L and all of us got mad, also while L was breaking down because of it. D went home early and we had yelled at O to drop D. O said that they did drop D. We have since found out they didn’t, from D, and that O just told him to pretend that O did drop him when they didn’t. L, E and I are all respectively mad at O, and plan on dropping him.   Now, I see why O doesn’t want to drop D. They’re friends, really good friends, but D has openly stated that he hates the rest of us. That paired with his actions we want O to drop D. I consulted my mother and she has said that the problem is “petty”.

j1in1uh4	I moved in with my husband, then boyfriend, about 7 years ago. I've always thought of it as "our" house. Until yesterday.   I told a friend I would dog sit for her for a week. I've dog sat before and he has not had an issue with it. Yesterday, when I told him I was going to dog sit, he flipped out. He said he wanted to be involved in the decision and that *NO* it wasn't going to happen. He said I  had to tell her I wasn't going to be able to do it.   Now I feel like he confirmed that fact that it is indeed his house and I'm just living in it. I didn't even think I'd have to as his "permission" for something like this. Am I missing his POV? Should I have asked vs let him know? Now I have to either make something up or tell this friend that my husband said "no."  I guess I just don't see the big deal... He wouldn't have to do any of the work, and he never has had to. He's had dogs his whole life. We currently don't have one, so I thought it would be nice for all of us to have some dog time.

j1ibd1p6	I f24 and my partner m28 is expecting our first baby in march. This pregnancy has been okay but ill most definitely need about 3 years before I do it again. Recently my inlaws came over which will be the last time I will see them before I give birth and they started to bring up me breastfeeding. I have no interest in breastfeeding but ill probably still pump along with formula this is what I told them. My husband and his parents just looked at me like I came from another planet and his mother called me selfish because I have no real reason to not breastfeed which is "bonding". I feel like I can still bond with my child while bottle feeding them. This situation has definitely cost some awkwardness between me and my husband since he's a mommas boy. Wish I knew that before marrying him but it's whatever. I kind of feel selfish but im just not comfortable with having someone close to my breast after my childhood but everyone is making me feel like im selfish.

144o5r	TW: Vaccine debate  So in November, I bought my sister, myself, and a friend tickets to see a concert at Radio City Music Hall (I live in nyc, the others would travel to me). The tickets were expensive, but my friend covered hers and I figured I could gift my sister her ticket. To be transparent, I suggested she might pay half bc of the price, but never pushed or followed up bc I was okay with eating the cost, as it was a nice gift.  Come Christmas Day, I’m at home with just my sister and mom eating a nice dinner. My sister suddenly has something to tell me. She hates to do this, but she won’t be able to come to the concert in January. There are many reasons: 1. She isn’t fully vaccinated (required in nyc for shows) 2. She isn’t planning on getting fully vaccinated before the show (she’s had one dose over the summer and never went back).  3. She also goes off on a rant about NYC being a hot spot and she couldn’t take off work if she did get sick… all while she still doesn’t intend to finish her doses of the vaccine to protect herself.  I was hurt, but after trying to talk it through, I ultimately had to remove myself from the conversation at the time. I wasn’t going to get into vaccine misinformation with her or debate her flawed logic. I asked if she’d be willing to reimburse me for the ticket, she said no. So I kinda just threw up my hands and said fine, I’ll try to sell it. Her loss.  Fast forward to this month. I looked into selling her ticket, but the site I purchased from wasn’t offering that or a refund. Again, I had accepted that I would just eat the cost and have a good time with my friend all the same. I find out last week though that the concert was postponed until August and because of that, I could finally get a refund. I didn’t run to my sister to update her because she had already refused the gift.   But this morning I told her (concert was supposed to be today), and she immediately responded “yay, now I can go!” Apparently she plans to finish her vaccination between now and August? This completely pisses me off, especially bc I finally had an option for a refund.   WIBTA for getting a refund for her ticket, even though she’s changed her mind and would be able to go to the new, postponed date?

j1hbk9vr	To clarify, I have no problem with him speaking his native language, it's context it is done in.   We are both foreigners working in France, which is where we met. This workplace is all foreigners and the language is english, which we both speak, and all our friends our foreigners as well.   The main language of our group is english, which everyone can speak, however, there are a quite of lot of people from my partner's country. As a result, I often find myself feeling excluded of left out because when we go out etc, my partner will be speaking his language, often while im right next to him, and having no clue what's going on. He might translate a fair bit of what is being said, or switch to english for a few minutes, but inevitably, he goes back to his language when he's with his people from his country.   It doesn't feel nice when they speak and I can't understand, or they joke and I sit right there not understanding. I sometimes ask to switch, but it makes me feel very desperate and only works in the short term.   I have spoken about this to him a little bit, and he says he doesn;t want to exclude me etc (which I do believe), but the same thing always happens. He often asks me what's wrong if I look a little dispondent when they're joking in his language, so i am not sure he really gets the issue.  I dont want him not to speak his language, but i also cant help these feelings of unworthiness and exclusion, especially if there is a big group of people from his country and I understand what they selectively decide to translate for me.

g6195ee1	Title sounds awful but please let me explain  For some background my mother takes care of an 8year old autistic boy. He is not severe in the spectrum more like in the middle (that’s what his parents say) she has been watching him since he was 3 so a total of 5 years. He used to be nonverbal but has started talking well and communicating emotions well thanks to my mom and a lot of special schooling. It is also important to note the boy (we will call ty) has inappropriately touched his family dog and almost strangled two of his sisters cats. This Will be important later   So my mom used to go over to Tys house to work with him but their family moved and my mom can’t drive that far at night (she leaves in the evening) due to nightblindess so he now comes to our house with my mom from about 3pm to 7pm no big deal. I absolutely adore Ty. He is a great kid and is always very excited to see me. When I got off work and came home he was there and very happy to see me. I said hello and gave him a hug and asked him ti give me some space while I take my puppy outside to potty. He did. I came back in and tried to feed my dog (he is 5mo old and being trained. Also very excitable) but Ty got excited near the dog and started to rub and jump around him causing ny dog to get too excited and he jumped around and spilled the food container and excited peed on the floor. I asked Ty to step away because the dog is in training and doesn’t need to get exited like that rn and they could play later. He said okay and sat down. A bit later i am cooking and ty comes and asks if he can pet the Cat who was sitting in my view in the laundry room. I said yes as long as he is gentle and respects the cats space since I can see and watch him. He said okay and pet the cat. I see him start jumping around and yelling (he gets exited and vocalizes incoherently sometimes) and my cat pushed back and ran up onto a higher counter. I told him okay the kitty is happy you let him but he wants his space now and I asked him to go work on his school sheets with my mom. He did. A bit later I walked by the laundry room and see him in there poking my cats butthole and chasing him to do so while my cat runs away. I told him “stop, we do not touch the animals that way it is in appropriate. If I see you act like that again you will not be allowed to pet him. Please leave him alone for a while now” he got upset but he walked away. I went to the bathroom and came back and he was holding my cat BY THE HEAD AND PULLING HIM AROUND. my cat was crying and hissing but he was holding him too tight for him to leave. I yelled at him. I said “NO GET OUT RN yOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TOUCH THE CATS YOU CANNOT TOUCH THE DOG NOW EITHER. They aren’t toys and they don’t like to be touched like that.” He looked at me and started crying and said he hated me and that he doesn’t want to see me anymore. He also said he was going to set me on fire that’s how mad he is. He even say and told my dad he hates him for making me cause I’m so mean. My family and Ty’s family do not think I was wrong but I feel so bad. So am I the asshole for yelling?	1643204583.0	sd69jq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd69jq/aita_for_yelling_at_the_autistic_boy_my_mom_takes/	AITA for yelling at the autistic boy my mom takes care of?
52xrj4ga	Now, I hate the word 'like', but it's the easiest way to put this.  I (20M) have really liked this girl (20F) since we met 2 years ago - beyond what I thought was possible to like someone. There's always been something between us, and we have a good time whenever we're together.  We drunkenly kissed a couple of months back (late September/early October?) and haven't spoken about it directly but have constantly tried to see each other since. However, life got in the way as it does until yesterday, when she reached out to me and we arranged for a date this morning.   We had a lovely time, until I found out that it wasn't a date. It was a catch-up.   And she has a boyfriend.  It's weird because the build-up to it seemed so much as if it was going to be a date. Anyway, after she revealed she has a fella (of whom she didn't sound too thrilled about), she asked me if I was seeing/talking to anyone and I said "No... I just feel like I'll know it when I see it." To which she said, "And y'know, sometimes you've got to put yourself out there and say 'Hey, I like you.'"  We're both at uni and she's finishing in 4 months with a high percentage chance she won't come back. I've always been waiting for the 'right moment' to tell her, but I've come to realise there's never going to be a right moment. I feel like I should just tell her how I feel because otherwise I may regret it 4 months down the line, however, I don't know whether I should because she's got a boyfriend.  So Reddit, WIBTA for telling a girl I like her, even though she has a boyfriend?	1643204486.0	sd68cq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd68cq/wibta_for_telling_a_girl_i_like_her_even_though/	WIBTA for telling a girl I like her, even though she has a boyfriend?

j1igdzek	In my school, football is absolutely massive. When our team plays, most of the school comes out to watch. For context, I'll call my school B, and our rival school SA. SA and B have a very heated rivalry when it comes to football, and it's basically like a North London Derby everytime we play. It's heated af. I personally hate football, and think it's utterly stupid, but that's my opinion.   My school team is very good. We currently have 5 players who are insanely good, and are also playing for a pro academy. All 5 are thought to be future Premier League players. One of the 5, arguably the best, is my Brother.   When I say my school is crazy abt football, I mean hella crazy. We even have recordings of all the games and play highlights during school assemblies. Our school is also very heated with SA, and my brother in particular, is incredibly passionate when we play SA.   My brother is always a very good player, but when he plays SA, he becomes absolutely demonic. I don't remember the last time we played SA and he DIDN'T score. Our school even has a nickname for him "SA's Oldest Ghost" who always returns to haunt them. It's so fucking cringey and weird.   I don't know why he is so angry when he plays SA, but I think it's because his first ever match, at the youngest age he possibly could have been, he played SA, and lost a very close game 2-1. Since then, the other 5 players have joined the team and our team is very good.   3 days ago, we had another SA game. A relevant point is that the previous game had us lose 3-1, with my brother scoring. So my brother, and pretty much the entire school were desperate for us to win this game and were getting hyped. My brother was getting very scary.   He wasn't super angry or anything, but he had his "game face" on for pretty much the entire week before the game. He always seemed annoyed and was just all around acting very emotionally unhealthy.   The day of the game came and I saw my brother and he looked absolutely nothing like himself. He honestly looked a little inhuman and monstrous, nothing but anger and fury in his eyes. I decided it simply was not a mentally healthy thing for him to play in this game.   I took his kit bag, which had his boots in it and managed to throw it in the rubbish. I had every intention of giving it back after the game. The game begins and my parents hv to go home to get him another pair of boots. By the time he comes onto the pitch it's already the 35th minute and the score is 2-2. My brother came on, scored twice and we won 4-3.   Everyone is angry at me for trying to keep him out of the game, and i'm now grounded at home, and also everyone in school is ostracising me. WE STILL WON!!!   AITA?	1643205003.0	sd6eoq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6eoq/aita_for_hiding_my_brothers_football_boots/	AITA for hiding my brother's football boots?

5ft1nsow	  So today at school I was in the bathroom with two friends. At one point, they went in a stall to vape, so I decided to wait around for them since we’re in the same class. (For context, in my country we share all our classes with the same classmates and we sit in the same classroom all day.)                 While they were in there this cleaning lady comes in and I guess she smelled the vape bc it had a pretty strong flavor. Vaping in the bathroom isn’t that uncommon and no one does anything about it usually but I guess we got unlucky. When my friends got out we went to our classroom and the lady followed us. Eventually she talked to some people and our class master found out.            My friends left school early so when our class master came to ask about this situation only I was there. Without going too much into detail, she’s generally an insufferable and overbearing person so I really didn’t feel like having an argument with her. She basically said that even if we didn’t come forward she would find out who was in the bathroom because the cleaning lady who’d seen us knew what all three of us were wearing.          My problem was the fact that she said three of us were vaping when I was literally just standing there waiting for them to come out. I guess I felt annoyed by this and felt the need to defend myself so I just said I was one of them but I hadn’t been vaping. At this point I couldn’t back down because she kept pressuring me, so I told her who the other two were.             Understandably, my friends got upset. We argued over text and I apologized and tried to explain my perspective but they weren’t having it. They told me I shouldn’t have said anything or I should’ve lied and said it already smelled like that when we got there and that the cleaning lady was mistaken. I think that could’ve been a good excuse but it just didn’t occur to me at that moment and there isn’t really much I can do about it now.           I’m not sure if our class master will do anything more than give us/them a warning. I mostly feel bad because if she talks to my friends’ parents about this, my friends won’t hear the end of it and it will be my fault.            I know I acted selfishly but I would like to have some outside opinions so I can figure out if I was completely in the wrong or not.	1643205899.0	sd6q04	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6q04/aita_for_snitching_on_my_friends_who_were_vaping/	AITA for snitching on my friends who were vaping in the school bathroom?
j1i5v35p	alright, a lot to unpack here.  2 years ago my dad wanted my brother (20m) to pick my 10-year-old sister and 12-year-old brother up from school, keep in mind my dad had never asked my brother for a favor like this for a long time. since both my dad and mom were going to be at work and my school is really far away from theirs. at the end of their school day, they had to wait an hour outside in the cold because my brother didn't want to pick them up. my dad found out because their teachers were concerned and called him, now he had to get out of work early and pick them up. when he confronted my brother about it he said that my dad was putting too much responsibility on him as a young adult and ghosted him. now my brother says that he misses his siblings and wants to move back in and see them again and says that he has full right to. my dad thought it was a good idea because he could take care of the kids while they were at work but I think if he can't handle the responsibility of picking up kids from school then he shouldn't babysit them. I told my dad this and he said I was an asshole for not letting my brother make up for his past mistakes and that I should forgive him. we both went to our rooms and we haven't talked that much since. aita?	1643206844.0	sd71hy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd71hy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_adult_brother_to_move/	AITA for not wanting my adult brother to move back in after he abandoned my younger siblings?
ejruj8wh	I (18 trans male) and my sister M (12f) have always had a rocky relationship. I know what I'm saying with our age difference sounds absolutely insane, but hear me out. From a very young age, she has always had a habit of being physical towards me. It started with little things, but over the years it has escalated severely, seeing as it wasn't discouraged in the beginning. She also throws homophobic and transphobic slurs at me. I don't care that she has her opinions. Our Uncle, whom she is very close to, has the same opinions, but he doesn't spout them in my face. I think at 12, she's old enough to know what is or isn't polite to say. Recently, she had made a threat to choke me with a charging cable, then proceeded to put her hands on my throat when it was taken off her. After that incident, I told both M and my mother ( 43f) that when I moved out, I would gladly visit her and my younger brother (3m). But, I would refuse to have anything to do with M.  My partner (21NB) fully supports me in my decision, as they have been a witness to some of M's behaviours, but my mother thinks I'm being unfair to M. Personally, I don't think my mother has a right to an opinion in my choice, seeing as she has never helped me in any way, other than basically telling me to suffer in silence.   M doesn't care what I do, but then will carry on about it later. I just don't think she's the sort of person I want in my life. I don't know when I'm moving out yet (I will be moving with the intention of looking after an elderly relative with my partner), but I'm already making my plans with who I will and will not contact. My mum thinks I shouldn't be deciding until I'm in the process of moving, but at this point, I am sick and tired of the way M treats me. So, am I the asshole for refusing to have anything to do with her when I move out?	1643207116.0	sd74y8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd74y8/aita_for_refusing_to_have_anything_to_do_with_my/	AITA for refusing to have anything to do with my younger sister when I move out?

5sfkny72	I want to start by saying that this post not about something I did, but something I wanted to do, and I'm not sure if this is something I can do on this sub...  10 month ago I (17m) come out to my incredibly non confrontational religious grandparents. They never said anything bad about it, but I can tell that they don't really like it.   About 2 months ago they hosted a dinner at their house. My great aunt (grandma's brother's wife) was staying there for a few days. I've only met her once before and nobody told her that I'm trans.  When I realized I was gonna have to come out to her, I told my grandfather I want to wear a kippah/yarmulke (a head covering for boys). I was thinking about it for a while and I also realized that if I come out to her and then she sees that I'm the only guy not wearing one it might send the wrong message. He told me he wants me to wait till next week with it because he doesn't want to upset her. I said that I was planning on coming out to her next time she misgendered me anyway because I felt very uncomfortable with the entire situation. He tried to convince me not to and even said "you know that the whole world doesn't revolve around you right"? Which is the most confrontational thing I've ever heard him say.  I should probably note that ever since the first time I came out, I came out to every person I know the next time I saw them, so not correcting someone who thinks I'm a girl is something I haven't done in months, and don't plan on ever doing again.  I've talked with my grandma about it and she said that my great aunt was preaching to them about religion the entire time she stayed there, and they even had to drive to get her food because they didn't have anything that was kosher enough for her standards.  Eventually after hearing her misgender me a few more times I ended up just going home in the middle of dinner because I didn't want to cause any drama.  I've been thinking about what I should have done since, and I think that if I had to do it again I would have came out to her, but there is a chance that she wouldn't have taken it well and then my grandparents would have had to deal with the backlash,  So reddit, would that have made me the asshole?	1643208594.0	sd7o1c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7o1c/wibta_if_i_came_out_to_my_aunt/	WIBTA if I came out to my aunt?
8e39bttd	I 30f got a message today off a friend I made on a dating site, we aren't super close and in the three months we've known each other we've not spoken except at Christmas.  Yesterday she contacted me  and asked me to look at a guys fb profile as he'd blocked her after he accused her of being controlling and they had argued.  I offered her my sympathies said his Facebook is private and to take it up with the admins of the dating group. Not my business right? Later in the evening she messages me again asking me to contact him on her behalf on a different platform, I think she was asking for a second chance. I refused and again told her to take it up with the admins that I feel uncomfortable with her request. She said not to bother she'll sort it and hasn't spoken to me since even though I asked her if she's OK? Her ignoring me makes me feel like an ahole but what she was asking me to do felt like stalking and harassment... Not sure if it is that bad but I don't want to be involved in some one else's drama.

Which is the most confrontational thing I've ever heard him say.  &#x200B;  I should probably note that ever since the first time I came out, I came out to every person I know the next time I saw them, so not correcting someone who thinks I'm a girl is something I haven't done in months, and don't plan on ever doing again.  &#x200B;  I've talked with my grandma about it and she said that my great aunt was preaching to them about religion the entire time she stayed there, and they even had to drive to get her food because they didn't have anything that was kosher enough for her standards.  &#x200B;  Eventually after hearing her misgender me a few more times I ended up just going home in the middle of dinner because I didn't want to cause any drama.  &#x200B;  I've been thinking about what I should have done since, and I think that if I had to do it again I would have came out to her, but there is a chance that she wouldn't have taken it well and then my grandparents would have had to deal with the backlash,  &#x200B;  So reddit, would that have made me the asshole?	1643209290.0	sd7xnl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7xnl/wibta_if_i_came_out_to_my_aunt/	WIBTA if I came out to my aunt?
2hv4s3xr	The defendant was indicted for stealing more than $500,000 from an elderly relative and is now negotiating with the prosecutor for a plea deal. She claimed she couldn't afford an attorney, so the court provided her with a public defender paid by taxpayers. But I found recent social-media photos of her on holiday, posing in front of the private jet she took with friends to a luxury resort. Based on her past history, I think it's likely she stole the money. I realize she might really be broke, and is just enjoying the hospitality of rich friends. But it nonetheless angers me to think she's possibly duping the court. So, WIBTA if I sent copies of the photos to the judge?	1643208993.0	sd7tap	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7tap/wibta_if_i_gave_a_judge_photos_showing_a/	WIBTA if I gave a judge photos showing a defendant claiming poverty was flying on a private jet?
5f9g0nlk	So me and my ex were together for almost 2 years and split in November due to me being severely ill and unable to maintain a relationship. I believed that we were both aware it was a temporary break until i got all my hospital and appointments sorted and started my new medication. Prior to the split however I had found out that he had been getting close to his best friends cousin, and told him I was uncomfortable - he got angry about this at the time and told me he had no interest in her, nothing had  happened and nothing would, and told me I needed to stop being controlling. He had also been getting closer to a girl in one of his classes but I passed this off as I knew the girl and thought nothing of it.  Last night, his best friend informed me that only 2 weeks after splitting up, he and the girl from his class were getting into a relationship but he pulled back and said he "wasnt ready for a relationship" -  in actual fact he had gone behind everyones back and slept with the cousin. Ofcourse, I was upset as I still wanted to be with him and thought we were only on a break so I confronted him. He lied about everything that had happened and then tried to claim he wasn't aware it was a break, despite us both making it clear and agreeing. He then said that we weren't together so I had no right to be upset about something he had done when we weren't together. My friends have told me he's a bad guy and he is in the wrong - but I'm starting to agree with him that I have no right to be angry at him as we are no longer together, so AITA?	1643208069.0	sd7hbw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7hbw/aita_for_getting_angry_at_my_ex_for_something_he/	AITA for getting angry at my ex for something he did post breakup?

5cnylcuo	Basically I'm (M19) one of her (F21) bestfriend that always helped her when she was down, depressed and at her lowest point. She has trust issues because her boyfriend (let's call it Mark) cheated on her with his own bestfriend (Let's call her Mia). They broke up but then they started dating again, which I fully disagree because once a thief always a thief kind of ideology.  Mark treated Mia more like a girlfriend than my friend, which made her mad. He always use "childhood friend" kind of reason. My friend started to throw tantrum and harass Mia in every way just to "fuck off from my bf". But Mark protected Mia and he told my friend to never insult Mia anymore. So they were like in this kind of Love-Hate situation  Mark's Ex told me that she was lied by him, r\*ped, and dumped, continued to date Mia while at the same time dating my friend. I told her to just broke up with him immediately but she refuses to do so despite there's a literal proof about it. She was mad and asked him to confess, he said "I never done any of that". They went back to normal as if nothing happened. I gave her a reality check to call her "you're just a fresh meat waiting to be consumed by him", and she was mad. Even blocked me for two week for saying so.  He really did it to her. She was sick and had a hard time to even move her body, Mark took an advantage of her current condition and r\*ped her. I still think about it, why she didn't just break what just happened? I tried to push her to just broke up, she just scolded me back about it.   I was told by an Anonymous that he had a sex tape of Mark having an affair with another girl (let's call her Lisa). He sent me the video and confirmed it was him. The video was taken recently and told me about Lisa's account. Without a doubt I told her about it, and she was mad, not towards Mark but towards Lisa. She attacked her Instagram, even asking her friends to harass Lisa to the point she closes her account. I told her to stop because but she didn't listened to me.  Lisa chatted me through her alt to prove her innocence and she didn't know Mark had a gf. Proving that Mark are the one to blame, not Lisa. I told my friend about the truth but she choses to attack Lisa rather than Mark himself.  She asked me to send the sex tape, for no reason she said. But I refuse, I don't trust her anymore and may use it for blackmail or anything malicious towards Lisa. Because Lisa was innocent, and my friend didn't attack Mark in the slightest.  I refused to send her the video. She and her friends started to harass me to give the video. I blocked them on every social media  and that was my last interaction with her, cutting myself from the drama and our friendship after a whole year.  I apologized to Lisa. I deleted the video on my phone and moved on. She made a public post that she called me an AH and even paying others like some of my friend list to confront me with the "unfinished problem" we had just above.

bx4hmcv2	AITA (M51) for wanting to have a solo FaceTime session with my wife (F51) when she travels to her conventions?  We have been married almost 30 years. She is usually gone for just over a week at a time when she goes away to her conventions (several times a year).  I stay home, because I work full time and take care of our daughters and pets.  She always takes a couple of toys with her, so we can connect while she is away.  In our entire marriage, I can count on one hand how many times we have actually done this (she has been traveling for work for about 20 years).  She always says she is too busy and doesn’t think about it. Sometimes she doesn’t call at night because she says she is tired and forgets.  Last night she called at 11:00pm, we were talking for a bit when I asked her why she leaves a day earlier than others and comes home on the last flight, instead of the first one of the day?  Turned into a huge argument. As she was hanging up, she said I ruined the surprise of “doing something nice together!”  We then argued in text for an hour. Needless to say, nothing “nice” happened.  She tries to make me feel like I’m expecting too much from her (I’m the one taking care of our children, house, pets, laundry and working full time.  I really don’t want to do anything with her when she comes back home.

hnkb2ap3	I know that it’s none of my business, but hear me out.  I have these friends (both 18) who have been dating for not even a year (i’d say around 9 months now), and are saying that if the girl got pregnant they would keep it. I’m pretty sure they’re actually planning it too, since they talk about it so much. The girl is currently unemployed and the guy works at a bar. They are both heavy users of alcohol and weed (as a young adult does) and are broke 24/7. Yet again, I think everyone is like that when they’re 18 though.   But having a child at this age? I feel like they really need someone to tell them to slow down. They are close friends of mine too, so it’s not like it’s a rando telling them how to live their life. I’m just worried for the kid, it honestly is a pet peeve of mine when I see parents smoking around their kids.   So, WITBA if I said something about it?

The thing is, my wife and I really don't care for those names. They really don't connect with us, especially my wife. I do feel a desire to honor my grandparents and I know it will mean a lot to my parents but I don't know that I feel that its something to push for if my wife doesn't want it and I don't even particularly love the names.

96anuiou	(This is going to be really long I’m sorry I cannot organize my thoughts for the life of me) Im a homeschooled student (f, teen precise age isn’t relevant), and I have an older brother (also teen) who is such a douchebag to me. 4 weeks ago he got covid and gave it to the rest of my family so we were all sick but that was basically ages ago at this point. He was supposed to return to school 2 weeks ago but he skipped school the first week because he kept telling my mom (single mom btw+ super busy job, will be relevant later) he needed a letter. He didn’t need a letter, just a blatant lie. He also just started a new job without a reason (he’s not self sufficient at all and blows his money on weed or something idk), he now works 2 jobs and ever since post having covid, he swears he’s too busy with work to go to school. My mom is a permissive parent, I know she is, she knows she is, it’s whatever at this point. My problem is that my brother is basically running wild. My mom leaves for work before he has to go to school so he’ll tell her he’s going to go and then when it’s time for him to go he just won’t. During the day he blasts shitty music, screams on the phone with his friends, will try to make me do his chores then makeup a sob story to my mother. Basically just a bunch of pig shit, leaves food everywhere, if he hears me getting my laundry ready, he’ll jump infront of me and shove his stuff in because “he needs his work uniform clean” but instead of doing his shirt and T shirt he’ll run a whole fucking load just to piss me off. He turns up the heat to 80° to get my attention when he’s bored or when I ignore his other antics (I literally can barely regulate my body temp ever since I got covid, he knows this because my mom has had the same problem recently and we were all talking about it the other day). Bangs on my door the second he’s pissed off, super aggressive dude without reason as well. Just these little things that are so stupid. Yesterday I blew up at my mom telling her he shouldn’t be here at all when I’m homeschooling because it’s a huge fucking distraction and he’s a problematic teen in general. She told me that I’m making her choose between her kids which I just didn’t get at all. I feel like he should be where he needs to be which is his school and I should be able to have my time to do my school. She compared it to around a year ago when I was depressed from the pandemic and dropped out of school (not legally, I just stopped going) but to me it’s absolutely not the same. I spent all day in bed miserable, he goes out and hangs out with his friends (worth mentioning even if it was a mental health issue he refuses to see a psychologist). I have adhd and anxiety if that’s relevant. Nobody in my family is accessing this issue and it’s giving me so much more to deal with on my plate. It’s worth mentioning my mom has much higher standards for me, I have to do well in school, take care of our 2 cats, dishes, groceries, all of those things are my job (she won’t yell at me for not doing the groceries but I’ll complain that we don’t have groceries and then she’ll tell me to do it and otherwise it just doesn’t get done). Not to mention I have auditions coming up for an acting thing. To get to why I might be the asshole I guess I can be a bit conceited, I’m told that I think I’m better then my brother and in my head too much. I think the reason I praise myself so much is because I lack that praise from my mother, she praises me on occasion but at the same time she expects it as well. I also genuinely put effort into my life unlike him 99% of the time, it’s always been this way. With my brother it’s entirely different, he does one thing right and fireworks light up the sky. I only recently have started being a bit spiteful, my brother was knocking at the door for 40 minutes before I answered it. I don’t really know why I did it, I was just kinda pissed off when I realized today was once again another day he was skipping. I do little things like that from time to time but its not for nothing. He’s the one who taught me how to be annoying. He just randomly started being an ass to me one day when I was like 7 and its been happening ever since then. Another thing is that I constantly bring it up to my mother, I don’t think it’s excessive given the circumstances but she clearly does, I probably bring it up 4+ times a day idk. My mom keeps telling me I’m making her miserable because she does everything for my family and that I need to stop bothering her about this. I just tell her over and over that I can’t have him here anymore during the school hours and she tells me to just deal with it, AITA?

ix58m256	So I work as a retail cashier and this Elderly woman came in buying a bunch of toys. The toys added up to roughly about 99$. The woman scoffed and complained about how expensive toys were. To break the tension, I commented on how happy her grandkids would be and that it would be worth it when she saw them smile. She then proceeded to tell me that the toys were merely to donate to an orphanage and then continued to complain about how she had to follow a wish list and how she only expected to spend a few dollars. I personally found this tangent to be kind of scummy, especially since I’m sure these orphans would much rather have homes so I asked the woman if she thought the orphans weren’t worth 99$. She gets defensive and goes into a “back in my day” tangent about how she didn’t have toys and how she’d play in the streets. I said that didn’t sound safe and she told me not to talk back but I wasn’t talking back?

4uth7zv7	My sister(26) and her wife(30?) have been having a bit of trouble with her son(12) with him recently getting into porn and texting older "girls" (not sure if they are girls). He currently lives mostly full time with his grandparents due to her having mental issues after his birth and to my understanding his grandfather is a bit of a narcissist. A few months ago I overheard him saying things to my girls and female cousin along the lines of "we will go in here and shut the door" and I noped them all out of there. He plays way to rough with the little kids and in all honesty he scares me a bit.

So about a week ago I was hanging out at my friends house when his mother needed help getting the groceries out of the car. I excused myself to the bathroom so I wouldnt have to deal with that nonsense. By the time i went out to check if the coast was clear my mates mum came out of her room snd saw me standing next to all of the groceries my friend brought inside and thanked me. I said it was no problem and felt pretty good about myself. When my friend came back in after locking the car she chastised him for not helping me and i saw the disappointment creep across his face as he shook his head at me. I was struck with a blow of embarrassment but couldnt help but chime in and ask him why he didnt help me. He didnt say a word and just walked off to his room leaving me and his alone. She apologized for his attitude and offered to make me some cocoa. My friend still hasnt responded to my texts and i cant help but feel horrible for taking credit for something i never did.

The landlord sent a few plumbers but none has the time to fix it, and the only one who could, she said he scammed her.. the first week was pee and poop water in the kitchen and living room, we were walking in huge never ending puddles of pee. Now its just water. We moved everything upstairs, including our kitchen, in our bedroom. She suggested we should just move, but if we do we know she'll keep the entry fee money, 750 euros.

6d0kygdk	TL:DR My (30sF mother 65F) has an unhealthy relationship with social media. AITA for pointing this out? Or is this even an issue?  I have had a contentious relationship with my mother for my entire life. She doesn’t not enjoy being a mother, she is an emotionally abusive parent and immature human to the point that she has problems functioning. She hasn’t been able to keep jobs or maintain friendships. Now she is retired and my sibling and I often are out into parental roles over our irresponsible elderly parents so they don’t make dangerous financial or health choices.   My mom has always been overly invested in social media but since the pandemic her interest has consumed an unhealthy amount of time and I believe her physical and mental health are suffering. An example is she came for the holidays and my sibling and I both had events where my mom could not walk short distances because she is so out of practice of walking around that she could not walk from the car through the parking lot or to walk the dog without falling down. My dad has confirmed all she does is sit on the couch with her tablet 24/7 from the time she wakes up until she falls asleep.  My daughter only sees my parents a couple of times a year but used to FaceTime a couple of times a week with my parents. My daughter hasn’t wanted to do it anymore over the last few months because she complains mom acts like she is “watching YouTube” instead of having a phone call. She says my mom will make comments about her to herself but not talk to her, or just stare at her and not interact. It makes her uncomfortable so I told her she doesn’t have to talk to my mom anymore.  The health issues are shocking enough on their own but we will be talking about friends or family members we are close to and she will be glued to her tablet then start reading status updates aloud about people we went to high school with we haven’t spoken to or thought of in 20 years or old former coworkers we’ve fallen out of touch with. I’m struggling with a serious illness and infertility and she’s interjecting  “huh. Welp, JoeBob Somebody’s wife just had twins aren’t they cute? She works at that gas station down the street from our old house. Let me read you this joke she just posted about Trump…” I am not exaggerating, she will read everything on her feed while scrolling for minutes at a time while my entire family is saying “OKAY ENOUGH!” She just does not get it.  I have firmly told her “I don’t know these people, I don’t care about these people. You are hurting me when you ignore me to talk about Facebook.” It’s gotten another level of weirdness lately when my nephew had a behavioral issue come up at school and my mom bought him a very (off-brand for her) religious book on the issue he was having. My sibling and their partner are NOT this religion at all so I asked my mom where she found the book or the idea for this book. She confessed she is part of a Facebook group for Christian parents of preschoolers in the town we used to live in and saw the book in that group. Let that sink in. She infiltrated a parenting group for kids that go to a school in a town she doesn’t live in, for a school her kids don’t go to, and the children of this group are not even the same age as her grandkids!   I lost my shit. I told her this is unhealthy. We don’t know any of these people (she argued that my sister and I had gone to school with some of the people who have children who go there, and we did 20+ years ago!) we don’t live in that town, and it’s just CREEPY for her to lurk! I told her that her Facebook habits are inappropriate. That just because people have public profiles and she met them once does not mean their intention is for her to memorize their kids activities or to make small talk about their health and employment issues and she needs to get a fucking grip.   My sibling told me I’m way out of line and who cares if my mom uses Facebook as an outlet. In her words “Who doesn’t stalk around on social media sometimes?” And she is right, everyone snoops around social media. My point is, I think my mom has a BIG fucking problem with reality and boundaries and frankly has completely lost her grip.   AITA for thinking this is unhealthy behavior?  Before these questions - yes she does have friends who call her regularly. She does not see them because of the pandemic. This is not a case of lacking people to fill her life with.	1643213662.0	sd9kwg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9kwg/aita_for_pointing_out_my_moms_inappropriate/	AITA for pointing out my mom’s inappropriate Facebook stalking?
b94uugaz	Can't believe im posting this on here, i didnt think I was in the wrong but now im second guessing myself? On mobile, apologies for formatting.   My (NB 22) husband (M 30) was in charge of bedtime a few nights ago for our daughter (2F) as I had worked a 9 hour day and run a bunch of errands after work and was totally wiped. I passed out pretty early for me (like 10pm) which is about 30 min after our daughter goes to bed.   I woke up at 6am to screaming from her room and jumped out of bed and opened her door and saw her COVERED in blood. It was all over her face, hands, and clothes. I thought she had fallen out of bed and broke her nose or something so i was freaking out! As im cleaning her up and trying to find where she is bleeding from I see a pair of scissors on the ground.   I guess my husband had used them the night before to cut her diaper genie bag and left them on top of her dresser. I have no idea how she got them off the top of her dresser. Luckily she was okay, she had accidentally cut her finger on the scissors and it was just bleeding a lot, but not a big cut at all.   I told my husband what happened a few hours later when I woke him up as I was leaving for work (around 9am) and he felt horrible. He was almost crying he felt so guilty. I told him its okay, i dont blame him we all make mistakes, and thank god she didnt hurt herself worse. I thought that was the end of it.    I was talking to my cowoker later in the day and was telling her about my crazy morning and she got so upset and was like "How are you not furious with your husband? He could have killed her with that mistake!! If i was you id divorce him right away" I was honestly awe-struck. I get that he totally fucked up, but like. We all fuck up at some point? Yes it could have been worse but it wasnt. I dont see why I would end my relationship over a mistake. I thought she was crazy until I told my best friend what happened and what my coworker said and she agreed with my coworker saying she wouldnt be able to forgive her husband either it that happened.    Now Im feeling like a horrible parent? Should I be more pissed off? The guilt is eating me alive. I love my daughter more than anything in this world, and id do anything to protect her and keep her safe. But I love my husband too, hes been there for a lot of ups and downs for me, and is my biggest support system. Ive mad some pretty big mistakes too and he's never left my side. Am I the asshole for not being madder at my husband for his actions resulting in our daughter being hurt?	1643214724.0	sd9zok	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9zok/aita_for_not_being_mad_at_my_husband_for/	AITA for not being mad at my husband for accidentally hurting our child
iu6kxzsj	so, not-so-long story here, but i still have the debate in my head  Me (23M) and my partner (24F) have been thinking about getting a dog for a long time, and we both shared an interest in pitbulls. We both also saw the rise of hatred and bad rep this breed had in america, not only because of their aggressiveness to other dogs (and even humans sometimes), but because of being directly linked with southerners republicans Qanons (we're both non-radical democrats FYI)  So, about a month ago, we had a talk on the dinning table about this topic, and what we should do if we get a Pitbull and what we will be doing to keep the dog out of a bad reputation. We agreed that (for example) the dog would only be out of the house on the weekends and that if a visitor with children came along, we wouldn't be fucking arround: the dog would be leashed and secure in the backyard so that any aggressiveness towards the kid wouldn't take place. And so, along with other safety measures, we decided that we were ready to get the dog.  And we did it, after some paper stuff, medical stuff to see if we were capable of handling the dog, and after having some visits with the vet, we went to a Dog Rescue and we found a beautiful, 8 month old pitbull. We named her Bulma, and we took her home 4 days ago, she slept on the couch and got to see the full house and, after that day, things went south. The next day after getting Bulma, we woke to a crowd, some cops along with a cop car, there was also a crying woman, and we decided to go see what happened. We left Bulma on the house and when we got close...  a woman crying devastated, the corpse of a pitbull with blood on the road and a man with severe leg injuries. One of those situations were the dog had to be put down to let go of the man. We wanted to go back home but an argument started between some neighbours and us, telling us that it was very incosiderate of us to just get a pitbull knowing full well how it's dangerous breed that should be banned. At this point i was raging a little bit, and i was actively trying to get my point across that i wasn't going to "return" the dog because of some negligent owner, and some people were saying they would get their guns  the police finally broke up this argument and we went back home, my wife now scared of the safety of our dog, and i'm still fucking mad about all of this  TL;DR: my partner and i got a Pitbull dog and took safety measures, one day after we got the dog, a pitbull fatal attack occured near our house, and the neighborhood is pissed at us for getting a pitbull  AITA?	1643215085.0	sda4wr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sda4wr/aita_for_getting_a_pitbull_dog/	AITA for getting a Pitbull dog?
