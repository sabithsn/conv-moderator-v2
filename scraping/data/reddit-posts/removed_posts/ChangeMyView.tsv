yndq6	Democracy is the thing whereby if four out of four people are on the edge of a ravine, three decide to jump; even the fourth is forced to jump with them. This sentence highlights a real problem intrinsic to universal suffrage.  The problem of universal suffrage is that it makes so-called populism effective, successful, and therefore inevitable for those who make politics, those who make political propaganda. By populism, I mean a rhetorical strategy that does not focus on the problems and the real facts of the issues. Populism does not bother to delve into the many issues that every referendum or electoral round should put at the centre of the question. Populism, on the other hand, promotes the charisma of individual leaders, their sympathy and focuses public political discussion around marginal things. Populism moves further and further away from the crucial issues that are usually not very popular and attractive for the mass. It does that because everyone goes to vote, even uninformed masses who will never delve into matters and have no incentive to do so. That is why populism wins. It’s logical and couldn’t be otherwise given universal suffrage.  So should only the educated vote? Should only those with the highest IQ x vote? Should only those who are graduates vote?  Absolutely no. Universal suffrage is an achievement; universal suffrage is an invitation to anyone to participate in political life. It is a fundamental thing that, at best, should make a person into responsible citizenship and make it live its freedom as participation in political life. Universal suffrage is an outstanding achievement, but the problem we have talked about, the three who want to throw themselves into the ravine, the fourth that must be thrown with them remains, so we have a problem, but it is not solved in my view by taking a step back to universal suffrage because we will naturally create an élite group.  So how do we keep universal suffrage and at the same time have a conscious and informed electorate? How do we keep an electorate that exploits its time and freedom (it takes very little today, with the internet, to get information and keep up with the times) to express a conscious vote? In short, how do we reward interest, reward the desire to participate and entice everyone to abandon the indifference that leads to an ignorant electorate?  I have an idea, it is a very simple idea, I certainly did not invent it myself, but in short, I propose it like this: we will have to give a different weight to the votes. Weighing the votes is a way to incentivize the voter to be informed and aware. Obviously, an informed and aware voter gives no guarantee of what he will vote, and he will not necessarily vote where we believe they will vote. It does not provide us deterministic guarantees that things will go one way rather than another, but if nothing else, the voter will eventually be aware of its own decision to jump off the cliff. If nothing else, the voter will do it knowing that you will die if you jump off the cliff. This is very important because if an individual is always free to commit suicide, a community to which we all belong, we would prefer to try to preserve itself and do its own interest and good.  What does it mean to weigh the votes?  It means in my view, that together with the electoral preference with the crosses to put; yes and no in the case of the referendum, or the symbols of the parties in the case of politics or Europeans. Together with this I would add some simple questions, a dozen very easy cross-check questions. Do not imagine something diabolically perverse to exclude someone, but something of minimal culture linked to the electoral question very very simple in the case of referendums, a little wider of course in the case of European political elections where, however, there are always the economic and social problems updated to us. Therefore it is important to be informed when going to vote. So even a political election has issues because they are the issues of the moment, economic and social, about which it would be necessary to be at least informed. Well, this minimum of information must be tested for which I imagine myself, a ballot paper in which we briefly fill in a very easy quiz of about ten questions and then express our preference.  Does this exclude anyone?  No, because even whoever gets all the questions wrong will vote, and his vote will be counted, but it will count less. The vote will count in proportion to how they are to the answers given to these questions. Imagine 10 questions drawn from a group of 10,000. Who answers 10 questions correctly, his vote value is 1; who answers 5 questions correctly his vote value is 0.3.  In this way, more weight is given to those who have answered all the questions correctly, precisely to incentivize and reward those who are informed enough to find trivial questions that will still be understood as trivial but at least cut the legs of the uninformed and indifferent electorate who takes the responsibility of being uninformed indifferent when today really nothing is enough to get information, so the objection is not valid: only those who have time to get information will have a really heavy vote. We all have this time, even those who work hard from morning to night have a few tens of minutes a week to know what is happening around them, we do not look for excuses and from this point of view.  What is the positive side effect of all this?  It is a change of rhetoric, politics, and communication change. It will no longer be useful and successful to use populism or to talk about the tiny anecdote of crime news that in reality, does not matter for the fate of a country. Instead, it will become rewarding to speak to an aware electorate and then make propaganda focused on issues of merit, facts, numbers, economics and major social issues. Knowing that they are going to speak to an electorate that is aware because it will be the conscious electorate that will weigh the most and direct the electoral result more.  Instead of being a vicious circle as we have now, that is a level that is lowered more and more of the public discussion and therefore a level that is lowered more and more of awareness and information on the part of the electorate we will have a circle, we will have a virtuous circle where it will be It will be rewarding to be informed it will be rewarding to speak the language of those who are informed because they will mainly be persuaded.  Each of us will find it rewarding to inquire and discuss with the others in depth the issues of politics, the issues of the referendum and the economy, and so on. So you see that a virtuous circle is really created that should lead everyone to understand, if nothing else, that being informed and interested in things rather than giving a damn is rewarding and rewarding for those who play politics and is rewarding for those who decide to participate.  It will be understood that freedom is not only a right, but it is also a duty understood participation, participating rewards because only those who participate in the life of the country weigh a lot at the electoral level and who if who cares, who does not want to, who finds stupid, or boring, or not interesting to inquire about the issues will vote like everyone else but his vote weighs less than those who think that being aware and informed is an important thing.  So we will really have a virtuous circle but not a circle that excludes, indeed a circle that invites everyone to be informed because their decisions inform them and the responsibility that one has is all the greater the more one is informed. So I think it should work instead of having a universal suffrage system as horizontal and imprecise as we have now that unfortunately rewards ignorance and above all rewards the ignorance of politicians, the ignorance of political communication in particular that rewards messages for a people and an electorate ideally composed of teenagers and we do not want it because it is offensive to the citizens and depressing for a country that in fact easily makes politically bad decisions for itself through its elections.	1642590563.0	s7nses	/r/changemyview/comments/s7nses/cmv_political_communication_and_democracy_will/	CMV: Political communication and democracy will improve if we change universal suffrage into universal suffrage with weigh votes.

dm4mp	I don’t believe in the sanctity of gender stereotypes. I don’t believe if you play with dolls you’re a woman or womanly, or if you study engineering you’re a man or manly, including physical attributes, if you have long hair you’re a woman, or if you have a beard you’re a man, etc… Given this, and assuming this is a position that is correct to hold, what makes a transsexual woman a woman, rather than a man that does things and is physically like a stereotypical woman? I understand that society as it is holds these stereotypes, but they are just further ingrained into culture with transsexual people, after all, what is it that you do or you are makes you a woman or a man that you can’t do or be as the gender you’re assigned at birth? I have absolutely no issues with transsexual people, and no problem calling you what you want to be called, just because I am not an asshole, but when it comes to understanding transsexuality, I just see gaps in reasoning.	1642645927.0	s87rwf	/r/changemyview/comments/s87rwf/cmv_transsexuality_is_deeply_rooted_in_gender/	CMV: Transsexuality is deeply rooted in gender stereotypes and shouldn’t exist
cfy17s9l	Germany has renamed one of the barracks in their country to honor Field Marshal Rommel.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_Marshal_Rommel_Barracks,_Augustdorf  I believe that this is highly unethical.  While Rommel was not technically a member of the Nazi Party - he was obsequious to the Nazi regime.  I also believe he is an international criminal because he helped plan and carry out what he undoubtedly knew to be illegal wars of aggression on behalf of the Criminal Nazi regime (e.g., being a body guard during illegal invasion of Poland).    Rommel is also implicated in being complicit with Holocaust order in the area of his command in North Africa.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erwin_Rommel#Treatment_of_Jews_and_other_civilians_in_North_Africa  On the balance, this person is evil, and should not be honored in any way.  It’s a travesty that Germany would name barracks in his honor, and a bigger travesty that there is barley any  International outcry over this.	1642786623.0	s9g73t	/r/changemyview/comments/s9g73t/cmv_rommel_barracks_in_germany_are_immoral_and/	CMV: Rommel Barracks in Germany are immoral, and Germany should be pressured to rename them.
clqcyvm3	Disclaimer: I am Not a Christian In Any Way, I Just Love Christian Praise Music.   Let me start by saying I am a practicing Hindu. I love lots of different types of music: Hindu devotional music, Indian classical, Western classical, country, jazz, secular rock, Christian praise and worship music, and opera are some of my favourites.  Something about Christian praise and worship just stands out to me though as EXTRA good. By praise and worship I mean artists like Hillsong, Elevation Worship, Kari Jobe, Casting Crowns, Chris Tomlin and Laura Story. There is more but it would take forever to list them all.   The thing I think that I think makes Christian praise music so good is the themes and the instruments. These artists I listed sing of victory, hope, and defeating enemies, the idea that everything ind possible if you put your mind to it, the idea that you are loved and special and the idea that you should never give up. As someone with several severe disabilities, these themes really speak to me. I also love the vocals of the singers, the drums and the guitars.   However, lots of people disagree with me that this is one of the best genres ever - in fact they see it as one of the worst because they see it as "preachy". I definitely don't. It is so powerful and makes me feel so good inside. I want to be convinced it isn't as good as I think it is because I want to understand where my friends are coming from and how any genre could beat the feelings praise gives me.	1642803601.0	s9mmlj	/r/changemyview/comments/s9mmlj/cmv_christian_praise_music_is_one_of_the_best/	CMV: Christian Praise Music Is One Of The Best Types Of Music
zzqdp	Examples of sexual orientations: heterosexuality, homosexuality, bisexuality.   Examples or paraphilias: pedophilia (attraction to prepubescent children), hebephilia (attraction to pubescent children), toonophilia (attraction to cartoon or anime characters).   The difference is quite clear: sexual orientation is morally okay but paraphilia may or may not be morally acceptable (toonphilia is fine since it doesn't hurt anyone, the other two I mentioned are not fine).  But being morally wrong or not is just a social difference. I think scientifically speaking they are the same thing - sexual and/or romantic attraction to something specific.  Why does it matter, you may ask? Because currently the general consensus is that it's impossible to "cure" or change sexual orientation but you can paraphilias. If they are the same thing, it would mean you either can change both of them or neither.	1642851126.0	sa0mg6	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0mg6/cmv_there_is_no_scientifical_difference_between/	CMV: There is no scientifical difference between sexual orientation and paraphilia
g8jjcoqa	My argument is quite simple, it's quite obvious that if someone is all-loving they wouldn't want to cause suffering especially the terrible suffering so many endure. Now it could be the case that this god is all-loving, but not all-powerful and so he doesn't have the ability to get rid of that suffering.  People often say well there is suffering because humans got free will, so it's not the choice made by God but by humans, I'll just grant you that free will exists but what about animals?  Animals suffer in so many ways in the world in factory farms or farms in general due to the standard practices and also in nature. The theist would say that the suffering in factory farms is caused by the free will of humans, that they choose to do something bad but that can't be said when you're talking about nature.  Animals suffer in the wild, on average every animal has one offspring that reproduces so the species is balanced, but animals have way more offspring so what happens to the rest? They don't get a chance, they starve to death, freeze to death, die of dehydration, die because of infections, die because of predators who painfully kill them, etc... Suffering is not the exception in the world it's the norm, only a a tiny fraction of animals lead comfortable lives and that's dogs, cats and humans and of course some animals in the wild who live in environments that aren't terrible for them. I could make the case that an all-powerful, all-loving God wouldn't allow any suffering in the world so how can the world we live in be explained by an all-loving and all-powerful God? It can't, if I were all-powerful I would make a way better world and I'm a flawed human.   You now might think "without suffering there is no joy" or "These are caused by the laws of the universe", well if God is all-powerful then I could make it so that we couldn't suffer, but only feel joy, if he can't then he is not all-powerful, he can make the world work beyond the laws of the universe, not make any predators exist and when too much vegetation is consumed just make the animals not want to breed, their population goes down and the grass grows back, then let them want to breed again, or just let them breed so little that they don't overpopulate and there is no problem anymore.  You can choose how you want to change my mind, I don't want to set restrictions because it limits the disscusion	1642866588.0	sa5b0h	/r/changemyview/comments/sa5b0h/cmv_an_allloving_allpowerful_god_doesnt_exist/	CMV: An all-loving all-powerful god doesn't exist
aa4raxka	The only masculine features black men have is more muscle mass and a broader nose that’s it.   So every time I look at a black man you can clearly see there is a lack of chin development, more forward growth and lack of deep set eyes. The eyebrows are upturned and thinner in that case it must be downwards to be more masculine.  You look at an Asian man he has narrow eyes which is masculine, mild jaw development (more common in Caucasians however) and taller stature. The biggest penises have not been black men in fact the average size for black men is 16cm and for white men is 17.2cm.

gg3r8ore	I would like to hear some opinions about this topic. I am not American and I do not come from a country with a strong colonizing past (for example UK or France), and therefore not much immigration. At least not until recent times. Given this background, I understand the desire of each culture to be represented in art, etc, and I love it. I have lived many years in China and other countries and I have learned to appreciate the beauty every culture has to offer. But if black people get angry because a black author's book has been made white, can I get angry as a white person when I see characters written by white authors made into another ethnicity just because minorities (Asian, black, Indian, etc) want some characters to look like them? As a white person, I would never want to take a story that has a Chinese character and make it white, or a traditional local story and give it white characters. But why if a tradition, a genre, or a story that is white is okay to be made not white? For example, I like very much the medieval and medieval fantasy genre, so I have seen few examples in it. Why taking a historical phenomenon (the Middle Ages) that was circumscribed only to Europe (I mean  the phenomenon of the Middle Ages with the culture, literature, and movement s it produced) and make it multicultural? There were people from other cultures in those days in Europe, but do not take a European knight and make him black, Asian or Arab. If you want to represent Arabs represent them as Saracens or something that was similar or possible for the time. Same goes for the mediaeval/fantasy genre. A Game of Thrones used people of different cultures in a very good way in my opinion. Making them believable in their own culture. It certainly didn't use a black or Asian actor to play a knight inspired by white European knights from the Middle Ages. Under the light of the cultural appropriation logic it doesn't seem fair to me.	1642875945.0	sa8ofc	/r/changemyview/comments/sa8ofc/cmv_cultural_appropriation_is_one_way/	CMv: Cultural appropriation is one way
zc3juxh	Nicotine, particularly addiction, really fucks you up and it’s so easy to get caught in it, particularly with these new tasty products which are so appealing to a younger audience. The regulators have been so far off the pace since vaping became commonplace.  Eg. Nordic Spirit and Velo are currently offering a free box of their tobacco-less ‘suns’ nicotine pouches. They come in a range of youth-friendly flavours and are packaged in brightly in mint-box style containers.  Imagine Marlboro giving out free sample packs of cigarettes? I understand tobacco is worse but nicotine is so problematic. Interested to hear some other perspectives.  Nicotine is so pleasurable initially, and it used to be that you’d need to smoke cigarettes to enjoy it. The fact that this horrendous addiction is so much more easily accessible, and so marketed towards young people, is enormously problematic. These companies deserve to be treated like cigarette companies because they’re just as exploitative, crafty and unscrupulous.  Only plus point is that they are useful tools for smokers seeking help. But Nicotine chewing gum and patches do that just fine.	1642876344.0	sa8tnr	/r/changemyview/comments/sa8tnr/cmv_tobaccofree_nicotine_products_should_be_taxed/	CMV: Tobacco-free nicotine products should be taxed and regulated as much as cigarettes
5zg4jvtk	42% of US households have a gun in their possession as of 2021: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/#:\~:text=The%20share%20of%20American%20households,one%20gun%20in%20their%20possession](https://www.statista.com/statistics/249740/percentage-of-households-in-the-united-states-owning-a-firearm/#:~:text=The%20share%20of%20American%20households,one%20gun%20in%20their%20possession). That's about 51 million firearms.  If the murder rate for 2021 is the same as in 2019, there were only 10,258 murders out of a population of 329.5 MILLION. [https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8.xls)  Assuming one firearm per victim, and that firearm comes from the aforementioned firearm count, only about 3.6 out of 100,000 firearms are used in a murder.  Now, we've only addressed murders - but I would assume firearm use in other violent crimes is also rare.  Enforcement of regulation always comes at a cost. An FBI background check costs $50 ([https://cjusjobs.com/fbi-background-checks/#:\~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20an,more%20to%20obtain%20your%20results](https://cjusjobs.com/fbi-background-checks/#:~:text=The%20average%20cost%20of%20an,more%20to%20obtain%20your%20results).). $50 \* 51 million firearms = $2.55 billion dollars spent on background checks alone. And it will be a recurring cost, too.  That's in addition to the inconvenience these additional proposed regulations will force upon the firearm owners who aren't prone to violence and who IMO constitute the majority of the firearm-carrying population.  It's a high cost for a too-insignificant reward.	1642880339.0	saa9g2	/r/changemyview/comments/saa9g2/cmv_the_us_doesnt_have_a_gun_problem_thats/	CMV: The US doesn't have a gun problem that's significant enough to do anything more about.

This can pertain to money issues, food, drugs/alcohol and relationships(especially romantic relationships.)

3eips2un	Science has been the main driving force for the technology that has built our modern world, and one of the only methods that allows us to collectively reliably know something  That being said, there are  a lot of things that cannot be known through the scientific method, and we should consult other fields for insight into them.   For example, a lot of people tell you to 'trust the science' when it comes to a contested issue like abortion but it's really unclear what that means. Our scientific studies of where life begins offers little to no insight on the ethical issues surrounding abortion or where the definitive beginning of life is. If anything it further confuses the issue. Science can tell us that the DNA from the gametes mixes at conception and that the baby has a heartbeat at X number of weeks and is viable during X trimester. However, none of this information really helps us determine when, if ever, it is ethical to terminate a pregnancy. That depends on your preconceived ideas about whether someone is entitled to the rights of personhood at conception or birth or some other time.   In other words, appealing to 'listen to the science' actually frustrates the issue more, rather than granting clarification. This can be applied to a lot of different hotly contested issues  To give an example from the other end of the aisle: people on the right tend to attack trans people with "listen to biology, there's only XX and XY chromosomes., and they determine the genitalia you're born with." For all intents and purposes this is the only thing that science tells us about sex. The right wing intentionally neglects to separate gender from sex and ignores psychological data about the benefits of transition and instead hides behind the dismissal "listen to the science." In other words, there are a lot of considerations that should go into ethical debates that have nothing to do with science, and a blanket appeal to science is not a strong argument.   You cannot claim to have the more intellectually supported position just by appealing to science on most issues. You should also be informed in work on the matter in fields like philosophy, sociology, psychology, anthropology, theology and culture. Often times the work in these fields contradicts the conclusions came to by the people who most often appeal to 'trust the science.'	1642904538.0	sair24	/r/changemyview/comments/sair24/cmv_science_can_only_give_us_a_limited/	CMV: 'Science' can only give us a limited understanding of the world and we have to consult other sources

8wwb5tsw	Firstly, Novak was fully in his rights to gain entrance into Australia by the grounds of his visa and his COVID exemption. People have died from taking the vaccine, and granted it isn’t that many people, but it does raise some concern. Not everyone does this, but him being an athlete and cares for his health as much as an athlete would, he would definitely consult his doctor before getting it. I would see that he would consult his doctor before even taking an advil, so consulting his doctor before the vaccine was fully on ground.  He has had COVID before, and as research suggests, the body builds up a sort-of natural immunity with a varying of antibodies relative, but different, relative to those in the vaccine. Same as how the vaccine doesn’t stop you from getting COVID, so does not getting the vaccine. I’m not saying people shouldn’t get the vaccine, because they indeed should, but if people have died from certain side-effects, vaccines like J&J and the Astrazeneca are constructed same as the flu vaccine on the construct of introducing the dead virus to the body, the fact that he has had COVID before, the fact that his medical exemption shows that the vaccine would be more harmful than good for him, the fact that he is pro-vaccine but it isn’t good for him same as how all people should’ve checked out before taking it including myself, and the fact that he had to go through court twice shows the Australian gov’t‘s weakness and indecisiveness.

9tmcm73	Since the gender of person A can only be determined by person A, it's actually impossible to be any gender besides the exact gender that person A is. Even as time moves on, if person A were to all of a sudden demand to be called some different gender than they were previously, that would still not be transgender. That would be the gender that they are, which is the only gender they can be at that time. Since gender is inherently defined by the person describing their own gender,it can never be different than what it is. The term transgender is therefore meaningless or an impossible word to use correctly.  Some folks may make the case that "transgender is someone who identifies as a different gender than they were assigned at birth". Well, genders are not assigned at birth, as the definition of gender is inherently a personal definition. Sex is actually discovered at birth, so the idea that the formation of words to describe the physical characteristics of a human being can somehow be "wrong" to begin with does not make any sense at all. The names of the sexes are literally signs that humans write and type as a part of a language.

57ai3fqd	I’m not a theist. This does not come from a place of believing in a god myself. I’ve never seen any reason not to be a scientific atheist. What I can say however is there are tons of people way smarter than I who somehow believed in a god, so I don’t think that belief is beyond any sense of rationality.   My gripe is that if anyone posits the idea of a god as an explanation for the universe or even as a hypothesis/thought experiment, it is quickly shot down as absurd, irrational, unscientific, and at best should be reserved for philosophical/theological discussions and left out of science.  Fair enough, but I don’t see any proof that there are infinite universes full of infinite timelines and infinite outcomes. It is an interesting thought experiment, but it is unfalsifiable and is about as probable as intelligent design in my opinion. That brings me to….  Simulation theory? Really? How is “we all live in an artificial simulation” not another way of talking about the possibility of a creator? To me, the idea that we are all living in a crafted simulation is just a fancy way of saying “intelligent design”.  Again, I’m not religious. I don’t even really want religion brought into scientific discussions. But if we are going to go with these other thought experiments, god belongs right next to them and has equal merit to them.	1642915493.0	sam3n2	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/	CMV: Belief in a god is unfairly discriminated against in scientific discussions in comparison to other “acceptable” hypothesis.

If you are having a conversation in a public setting you can speak whatever language you want with the people you want. For example, If I want to speak Spanish with my friends on the bus. I don't care if I am in a place that only speaks English I am going to speak Cantonese to my great-grandpa and it isn't rude because it's not like I'm talking to an only English-speaking person (if I was I would speak English obviously). Also if say you and 2 other friends are having a convo and one leaves, you and the other friend are free to speak whatever language you want. I also think it isn't rude to speak a foreign language on the buses (as long as you aren't yelling but that has nothing to do with language.)	1642922275.0	sanxpt	/r/changemyview/comments/sanxpt/cmv_speaking_a_foreign_language_in_front_of/	CMV: Speaking a foreign language in front of people who can't speak it is almost always never rude.

I don't understand why it's discriminating to mis-gender someone when I generally don't really care, because there are better things to be worry about.  In what form can I call you they. "Hey, them! What are you up to?" that does not make sense.   My argument may be dumb but I don't want to call someone they or them if they are too soft to handle just being called anything. Of course, there are pronouns that don't have pronouns or whatever, but that's just calling myself shrek/shreker	1642933541.0	saqptr	/r/changemyview/comments/saqptr/cmv_pronouns_are_grammatically_dumb_and_at_times/	CMV: Pronouns are grammatically dumb and at times just a way for "quirky" girls to think they are quirky and funny

Psychiatric hospitals don't do bail, no matter how much money you have in the bank if a cop puts you on a psych hold You're not getting out until a doctor says you can leave a doctor would be more motivated to hang on to their patient until any guns were sized by the police first before they were allowed to go home and have a list of conditions they'd have to meet in order to not be brought back in the form of a legally binding treatment plan rather than dropping a few thousand dollars and promising not to do it again like you would with a judge dealing with a first time offender.	1642955765.0	saxjx5	/r/changemyview/comments/saxjx5/cmv_stop_arresting_antivaxxersantimaskers_who/	CMV: Stop arresting antivaxxers/antimaskers who show up to school board meetings threatening to shoot people and start putting psych holds on them in stead.
h69cjfq0	Given the prevalence of animal exploitations and the ease with which they are widely accepted in our society, I find myself confused as to why bestality is still illegal in most parts of the world.  We are okay with farming and murdering them, just to eat their meat.   We are okay with peeling off their skins, just to make luxurious bags.  We are okay with growing cancers or testing drugs on them, just to save our own lives.  We are okay with repeatedly impregnating them and traumatizing them by separating them from their children, just to get milk.  We are okay with abducting them from their natural habitat and incarcerating them in cages, just to entertain ourselves.  The list of exploitations goes on and on.   To those of you people out there who's okay with any of the exploitation, What reasons do you have to draw a line at having sex with animals?  Arguably, the sexual pleasure is probably reciprocated by the animals to some extent.  Note that I am using "we" to refer to the society as a whole, which has failed to protect animals from exploitations.  I look forward to hearing your opinions.	1642959956.0	saz6dy	/r/changemyview/comments/saz6dy/cmv_theres_no_good_argument_against_beastiality/	CMV: There's no good argument against Beastiality.

87a97vj3	First of all, I'm 30, not an old timer, but remember the time before Wi-Fi.  What made me post? I think there are a few alarming things about what I call the cellphone generation:  1. Cellphones promote consumerism and not creation: whereas computers are built for work, and could be used to program, edit videos, music, photos etc., cellphones are all centered about consuming content.  2. Plug anywhere into the machine: whereas people in the past used to sit in front of a desktop computer, gradually there is a shift to laptop and then to consuming the same with a cellphone. Plugging from anywhere misses the point of the roles of the workspace or university as a gathering space and bonding place. This leads in my opinion to some gained opportunities, for example for someone to sick to be able to attend university in person, but for most people makes it more likely to lead to less cooperation and less self-development. 3. Other areas affected: for example, the NFT's trend. I have to admit I personally have a huge dissatisfaction with the thought of someone buying values of pixels in millions. While there is investment into such art, it doesn't seem to me that there is the kind of suffering and dedication artists had to undertake to get painting or sculpture done. It is a material thing, every break might entail doing everything all over- there is some value in my opinion in the need to perfect your craft so much that your mistakes are subtle enough to create a masterpiece in fabric or stone/wood/ceramics/metal that digital work can't recreate. It is this trend toward buying into the tech in excessive ways- not delineating the line between beneficial tech and hype tech.

p436l	You hear this quite often in opposition to trans people... **"the definition of what a woman is, is a biological female"!**  This makes little sense to me.  Never has anyone known the biology of a person (their chromosomes, whether or not they have ovaries etc...) before feeling perfectly comfortable gendering someone as a woman.  for example:  Is [Jennifer Aniston](https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jennifer-Aniston-A-Friends-Guest-Star-Felt-They-Were-Too-Above-The-Show-Promo.jpg?w=700&quality=86&strip=all) a woman?  I feel like everyone would say "yes"... however, do you know what chromosomes she has? no.  Do you know if she has a uterus? no.  So how is it, if we are supposed to be basing who we decide is a woman or not, on biology, can you determine whether or not this person is a woman?  You determine she is a woman because she meets the social criteria for being a woman (ala she looks like a woman) therefore we call her a woman because that is where the social utility of the word lies.	1642969941.0	sb33lr	/r/changemyview/comments/sb33lr/cmv_biological_female_is_a_bad_definition_for/	CMV: "Biological Female" is a bad definition for what a "woman" is

Our differences are more broad than what the average person may think.  ## Part One: Differences in the mind, and in action.  “Questions in each of these categories test for a specific cognitive ability, but many psychologists hold that they also indicate general intellectual ability. Most people perform better on one type of question than on others, but experts have determined that for the most part people who excel in one category do similarly well in the other categories, and if someone does poorly in any one category, he also does poorly in the others. Based on this, these experts theorize there is one general element of intellectual ability that determines other specific cognitive abilities. Ideally, an IQ test measures this general factor of intelligence, abbreviated as g. The best tests, therefore, feature questions from many categories of intellectual ability so that the test isn't weighted toward one specific skill”.

srkv9lm	CMV:   If the United States sent military forces to Ukraine it would eliminate any real threat of Russian invasion.  My reasoning is the following:  1. If a certain base number of US forces were deployed in Ukraine, any major Russian military action would come into conflict with them. 2. If even a token USmilitary force was attacked by Russian forces the United States would go to war.  3. Whatever domestic gains an invasion could bring for Putin, would be greatly outweighed by the global repercussions of a real war between great/nuclear powers. 4. Therefore a deployment of even a small contingent of US forces would curb the possibility of a direct Russian invasion of Ukraine  My best argument against US Military involvement is the fear of entanglement experienced in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Vietnam. However, While there are striking similarities in the size of Ukraine and its population and that of Afghanistan (603 vs 652 k km, and 41.3 and 40.2 million people respectively).

s44shi	when a person sues it is (usually and should be) over a claim of violated rights. the idea that a person should be able to sue over libel and slander is based upon the idea that a person owns their reputation and that their reputation is being harmed by lies.  i assert that you don't actually own your reputation. your reputation exists in the minds of other people and you cannot own the minds of other people or demand, with any legitimate authority, that they think one way or another about you.  a secondary point that is less crucial is that the laws to protect a person's reputation from lies is not even necessary. the reason why we use those laws is that we have, to some degree, become dependent upon the government to tell us what we should think about things. if the government wasn't involved in shaping our minds we would do more to fact-check what people say ourselves.  when a person or company is caught lying we would not believe them or trust them with future data, nor would we be as likely to patronize them or their businesses. in this way the people are capable of responding to libel and slander, independently, free of government.	1642984134.0	sb8gpe	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8gpe/cmv_you_shouldnt_be_able_to_sue_over_liable_and/	cmv: you shouldn't be able to sue over liable and slander.
ab3rot27	The main arguments for the validity of trans identity seem to go as follows: identifying as one or the other gender hurts no one, one’s biological identity is separate from their social identity, the definitions of masculine or feminine gender identities are porous and filled with exceptions, and, at the end of the day, denying someone’s identity, or not respecting their identity, is unnecessarily hurtful. And yet, in the few public cases of people identifying as transracial, they have been absolutely torn to shreds by the general public, oftentimes most vigorously by the same people who are most supportive of transgender identities.  To change my view, someone would need to show how transracial individuals, by identifying as such, cause tangible harms to other people, or how racial identity can’t be separated from biology (and furthermore how racial categories are biologically valid).	1642988635.0	sba0n6	/r/changemyview/comments/sba0n6/cmv_identifying_as_transracial_is_as_valid_as/	CMV: Identifying as transracial is as valid as identifying as transgender

ad2ipf3u	 If female ovaries are analogous to the male testicle, that means the vagina is analogous to the penis and the female clitoris is analogous to the male foreskin.   And if circumcision of the female clitoris is considered genital mutilation the  why isn't it such for males? I wonder if it's so companies can sell more lube/lotion in the name of 'cleanliness'. Here in Canada circumcision stopped being free back in 2005 and now costs the parents $250, I'm sure this is no coincidence and is being done to make parents think twice about doing it to their newborn child.  It's important to have a closed "circle" of stimulation not the garbage circumsized experience which is having to pick which side of the penis to stimulate because a palm only provides a "C" shaped area of stimulation rather than a circle.   The skin that is exposed by circumcision is living tissue, but exposure to the dry air causes keratin to build up and essentially makes the penis head into an external organ rather than being "semi-internal" (if that's a word).   Not to mention swimming in pools is literally the same as swimming in diluted bleach.  Now when I was a kid I used to use a soft blanket to jerk off with because it felt better than any kind of lotion+hand, and I remember the reason was that I was able to make a closed circle of stimulation with a blanket. Well fast forward to today, and the obviously because humans didn't evolve to jerk off using blankets, I can barely feel anything because it's like the nerves are dead.   It makes me so mad every time I think about it and I hope I'm wrong	1643002630.0	sbejct	/r/changemyview/comments/sbejct/cmv_circumcision_at_birth_is_genital_mutilation/	CMV: Circumcision at birth is genital mutilation and causes desensitization

ggw5fsyd	in past 2 years, I've seen people who once were held on a pedestal being torn to shreds in the name of contextualising history. I am fairly neutral in doing so but i do believe it's a pandora's box.  Let me clarify my position a bit, Mahatma Gandhi's name has been dragged through the mud recently for his racist views about South Africans and his experiments on sleeping with his own nieces naked.   now, this isn't taught to anyone in school because i don't really think it needs to be taught in schools. when we in India think of Gandhi, we think of the Civil Disobedience Movements, the Dandi March, the Quit India movement and his diplomatic tact and firm belief in non violence. those are the reasons his is put on a pedestal.  in that similar vein, i think the Jefferson is put on a pedestal in US because of his writings and being a president who led a nation. Edward Colston, while being an arsehole to everyone else, did donate to the city of Bristol and that's why it makes sense for his statue to be in Bristol and same can be said for Rhodes statue.   but regardless, these people are starting to get thrown down of those pedestal because morality of out times consider them criminals and rascals.   so, in light of our Modern morality, the first person who should be put down from his pedestal is Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. I would like to believe that it's only fair and moral to drag his name through mud because of his acts in his times. It's documented that kept multiple slaves, started multiple wars and laid down a religion, that in 21st century still holds homophobic and mysogynistic ideas. through interpretations of his words, Gay people and Women are treated like second class citizens.  So yes, Jefferson should fall but only after Muhammad.	1643029966.0	sblxcw	/r/changemyview/comments/sblxcw/cmv_if_the_society_has_decided_that_were_to_pull/	CMV: if the society has decided that we're to pull people of the past down, the i believe it must start with Muhammad.
wr9ori6	I'd like to start by saying that I think this matters because a lot of people like to argue against veganism by labelling it as extreme or extremist and this encourages further resistance because it puts it into people's minds that it's the 'annoying pushy vegans' who are in the wrong and that they needn't think about what they are doing at all. I think that it's fairly easy to see where they are coming from as if we're framing it in societal norms, then cutting out all animal products from your life is a huge step. It's also a barrier for people considering veganism as they might agree with the ethics but find that the prejudice and extra difficulties they might encounter are a lot to deal with. However I believe that it makes more sense logically and ethically to view omnivorism as an active choice that *requires* justification rather than the reverse.   When you buy an animal product you are actively sending a message to the market that the thing they did (killing an animal) should be repeated because someone will buy it and they will make money. As this can be considered immoral, the person who performed that action should carry the 'burden of justification' for what they did; societal norms are not enough to justify what you do. Would you be convinced if someone performing FGM on their daughter thought that societal norms were enough to vindicate them?   Why then should refraining from causing suffering be thing that needs justification? I shouldn't have to explain myself to a murderer why I don't kill people. So why do we tolerate that line of reasoning anymore? The amount of times vegans get shut down because they're the fringe and 'we can't expect people to have to consider doing anything that extreme' is staggering. There exists a deep need for a paradigm shift here.

bbepslkc	I recently saw an article (a few days ago so I cant remember many specifics and I now cant find it) about how 2000s alt/emo/punk genres had offensive words in them and that they had affected a whole generation in a way.   They used some examples, I remember these.   "Wh*r*" being used in panic at the discos song "I write sins not tragedies"   I mean it's about a cheating woman, who's getting married while continuing to cheat. Like sure he could of gone "the poor grooms brides a cheater" but it wouldn't fit well and that's so incredibly weird sounding. Also. It's an insult, being used the way the insults used. It's like saying its sexist to call a guy a d*ckhead for being a d*ckhead.   "Boys and girls" by good Charlotte was used as an example of a very sexist song. But is it not meant to be a bit ridiculous? I doubt their general belief was that was all girls liked and that was all guys liked as he is indeed a guy. I think it was more meant to be frustration and about how shallow some people can be.   And 1 describing a rape, that although I've never heard, sounded like it's meant to more shock people than really be meant. Its also not about anyone in the bands.  There were more general points made about sexual songs existing. Which seems strange since both sexes enjoy sex, and from what ove seen enjoy the music too. Like I've seen more girls listen to and dance to "candy shop" than guys.   They then said something along the lines of it showing the bands were/are sexist and that people were made sexist by them and said they affected the veiws of everyone to be sexist??   I thought it was a ridiculous article but the comments under it were like 50/50 split seemingly and everyone was disagreeing so if I'm wrong in my mindset I'd like to be shown how.

olw1a	Cancelling student loan debts would primarily be a massive wealth transfer to the wealthy.    The higher up in the income bracket you go, the higher the share of student loan debts is. This is because people taking on advanced graduate degrees, take on more debt and then proceed to far out-earn those without graduate degrees. The top two quintile of incomes in the US, have the highest amount of student loans.  "The data show that students who go to college and particularly graduate school tend to earn more and are more financially secure, which is why student debt is nevertheless so concentrated among well-educated and higher-income households."   " The 3 percent of adults with professional and doctorate degrees hold 20 percent of the education debt. These households have median earnings more than twice as high as the overall median  "  "Many of the lowest-income households consist of adults who did not go to college and thus have little education debt. " \[1\]  Blanket loan forgiveness is a very regressive policy that disproportionately benefits the wealthier. Any type of loan forgiveness should at least consider your income:debt ratio or whether or not you completed your degree.

It is essentially a writing sample that features different prompts that an applicants must answer, and more often than not, there are specific instructions.

57ai3fqd	I’m not a theist. This does not come from a place of believing in a god myself. I’ve never seen any reason not to be a scientific atheist. What I can say however is there are tons of people way smarter than I who somehow believed in a god, so I don’t think that belief is beyond any sense of rationality.   My gripe is that if anyone posits the idea of a god as an explanation for the universe or even as a hypothesis/thought experiment, it is quickly shot down as absurd, irrational, unscientific, and at best should be reserved for philosophical/theological discussions and left out of science.  Fair enough, but I don’t see any proof that there are infinite universes full of infinite timelines and infinite outcomes. It is an interesting thought experiment, but it is unfalsifiable and is about as probable as intelligent design in my opinion. That brings me to….  Simulation theory? Really? How is “we all live in an artificial simulation” not another way of talking about the possibility of a creator? To me, the idea that we are all living in a crafted simulation is just a fancy way of saying “intelligent design”.  Again, I’m not religious. I don’t even really want religion brought into scientific discussions. But if we are going to go with these other thought experiments, god belongs right next to them and has equal merit to them.	1642915493.0	sam3n2	/r/changemyview/comments/sam3n2/cmv_belief_in_a_god_is_unfairly_discriminated/	CMV: Belief in a god is unfairly discriminated against in scientific discussions in comparison to other “acceptable” hypothesis.

eirdclud	Let me start off with I know racism exist and I know the people who control the system are mostly or all white.    I see so many influencers White,Black, Mexican, Indians etc talk about racism in America and the world. I really enjoy them and love being educated. "I am Mexican if you think im white or mexican" anyways as I scroll through these influencers I enjoy and enjoy until I eventually stop enjoying.      Once I keep seeing these videos I start to get upset. At first I was questioning myself. Am I upset because im racist or in denial of things happening then I stopped and thought and realized no its because Im realizing they are not helping they are destroying us further.     What I mean by this is watch tiktok, twitter youtube etc race channels. They start their videos with "white people are racists" " White people have incest" they find articles of a white man who ate a black person and generalized it as white people. This started to really weird me out why do we go from talking about racism in America to now "White people are....". The further I dive into these types of videos I see videos such as "White women are basic and bland and Black women are the pillars of beauty" Trust me I also hate racists ass videos that call Black women ugly when they are beautiful. However for this context why do we need to call white woman bland and basic etc? The comments to these videos are "YA Im white and I hate whites" or "White people should just collapse the world will be better.     It finally dawned on me I hear about so much racism Towards POC and I see those who want change for POC but the way they are doing it is by creating more hate. When you start off a video about stopping racism with "Any color is negative comment"  your whole video is just a flop.     This is why in my opinion we need to stop watching these "Whites are incesters videos as facts" and start actually educating ourselves on how to make the world a better place. Racism is mostly white but it comes in all forms and colors all around the world. I was stupid enough to think its Just America but its all over the world and we need to actually start working towards ending racism.     Imo we haven't all we have done is racism is only whites (not true but its mostly them) Then people say no its white people in America only (Ok stretching it but fine). No its only white people in the south they owned slaves back then (OK) Then you got white people in the south no its not me its the other guys that are racists and we never progress because we shorten the issue of racism so goddanm much that we can't admit racism us all over the world. Imma say it hear if you were racist or maybe you got scared because you were taught that because someone has a different color means they will mug you does not make you a bad person It means you had a shitty community or family but it is your job to learn and change now.    This is my final message for those who want to change tbe world and stop racists use facts information completely destroy the racists or get help. Do not talk to a racists with a start off cussing them or getting angry it will further anger them and create no change. Too stop a racist from being racists you need to talk to them and uphold your debate. If he does not change I don't know what to do but never resort to their level keep your chin up and keep fighting for a better world.	1643097128.0	sc8f97	/r/changemyview/comments/sc8f97/cmv_the_way_influencer_teach_antiracism_is/	CMV: The way Influencer teach anti-racism is terrible.
hwpp07gr	They are a root of hatrid, sexism, rasism, homophobia, transphobia and overall a miserable fucking lifestyle of absolute wankers. Now obviously not all of them are and religion itself isnt bad but most religious people are exactly like this. Look at middle east for example or america even. Its absolutely ridiculous that religion still has place in politics in this age.   Just look at history, look at how much hatrid the 2 i named brought to the world. Now im not here to talk about how no higher force exists because nobody knows. But if their god was real they would all go to hell anyways. Again, I'm not saying religion itself sucks, I am saying that Christianity, Islam, etc. suck and its wild to see so many people not seeing that.   Also yes I know that they will die out soon anyways because younger generations finally figured out how terrible they are but thats not the point here.	1643138164.0	sclggw	/r/changemyview/comments/sclggw/cmv_religions_like_christianity_islam_etc/	Cmv: Religions like Christianity, Islam, etc. shouldnt be a thing and should finally die out like they were supposed to years ago
cpolw3mx	I think people should be allowed to commit suicide for depression if they truly believe that they are at the lowest point in their lives, and they have no one to reach out to, and no way to get help. If they truly have thought about it deeply and want to commit suicide, who are we to say no and keep them living a life that causes them so much pain? I just feel like alot of people have no way out, and living life is pain. Of course, some may say there is always someone you can reach out to, but for alot of people, like myself, there is no one to reach out to. Sometimes a suicide hotline or a random stranger who is just doing a job and really doesnt seem like they care about you isnt enough to make your life magically get better. Idk am i a bad person for thinking this?	1643140910.0	scmhaw	/r/changemyview/comments/scmhaw/cmv_people_with_severe_depression_should_have_the/	CMV: People with severe depression should have the right to commit suicide.
is8u4yd1	The focus of this problem should not be the tool, it should be the cause.   The people that commit these acts are always the same type: fucked up. And. None of them got the help that they need.  If guns are banned they will still use guns but for the sake of the argument we will say that they won’t use guns anymore, they would just use a knife(common), a car (happened in Paris), chemical attacks(super easy to make chlorine gas or mustard gas), and various other forms of attacks.   But if you fix the root of the problem there won’t be attacks of any kind.   I am looking forward to hearing your arguments.	1643143148.0	scnbto	/r/changemyview/comments/scnbto/cmv_mass_shootings_are_a_mental_health_problem/	CMV: mass shootings are a mental health problem not gun problem.
vfszi	now first, when I mean obese I mean like loads of rolls of fat not just one or two     but whenever I see obese women I genuinely feel sick, to the point sometimes I run to the toilet and prepare to boke, like when watching through glee I skipped mercedes parts because she was just to gross to look at same with that other obese person seen later, or that obese model I felt sick seeing her     I am not sure why I feel like this , maybe it is just because it is so unhealthy ? but I know medication and illnesses can cause it so it isn't always the persons fault     and I myself have never been fat or obese so I don't      but I don't want to be like this, I want to try and be accepting off everyone and I feel bad that I get grossed out when I see them     please CMV	1643146487.0	scokoa	/r/changemyview/comments/scokoa/cmv_obese_people_disgust_me/	cmv: obese people disgust me
clmyp719	I think my opinion is strongly influenced by the dominantly conservative town I live in, although it's usually not. I don't think the vax has a microchip or anything conspiracy theory-y and I get other vaccines. I'd get this one if I had a money incentive.  I just think it's like the flu vaccine. There's too many strains and mutations and frankly it just doesn't really seem to work. I wear a mask in public and I'm very reclusive (OG social distancer) and wash my hands often.   I could be forming this view based off skewed facts or environmental influences, or idk. I feel kind of guilty though but then again I don't want to get the vax and get minorly sick for a day or two just to make myself look good.  Ok, let me have it.	1643152412.0	scqq4h	/r/changemyview/comments/scqq4h/cmv_i_am_vaccine_hesitant/	CMV: I am vaccine hesitant
60n1l547	So I’m Canadian so my experience working is only in Canada. But it seems to me that any developed society should have a law in place that every persons wage should increase by at least the rate of inflation annually.  And I should specify that the rate of inflation should be calculated based on all COG including housing costs. Right the rate of inflation in Canada is measured by CPI which is usually around 2% and rn 4% due to the pandemic but this does not include Real Estate which has increased by at least 10% annually. More rn.  If wages followed the rate of inflation there would be less poverty.	1643164042.0	scuusu	/r/changemyview/comments/scuusu/cmv_wages_should_be_increasing_each_year_at_same/	CMV: wages should be increasing each year at same rate of inflation.
fbyru0ig	Part of the reason jobs that require a degree generally pay better is the price, in dollars and time spent, is high. Supply and demand means the market value is high for those with the aptitude and determination to earn those degrees. If college is made free, or even heavily subsidized for all, those degrees will become easier to obtain and will drive down the market for both graduates and those already having those degrees.   Consider that the reverse does actually happen. There is a concept of "compression" which my compensation professor used to talk about. The going rate for fresh college grads goes up year by year faster than professionals in that job receive pay increases. This is in part because degrees get more and more expensive to obtain.   Because you can't pay less than market value to get the best graduates, and because you don't want them earning more than your tenured employees with the same educational qualifications, the value of all go up.  There SHOULD be a large barrier of entry to obtain a degree, like the high price. Look I'm not at all saying that college shouldn't be more affordable, and that college, along with the medical industry, needs to be re-evaluated. But the solution is in containing those costs, not in handing out risk free money.	1643164832.0	scv4nm	/r/changemyview/comments/scv4nm/cmv_free_college_would_primarily_devalue_college/	CMV: "Free college" would primarily devalue college degrees and drive down wages
3m2uzg94	When trying to date someone, high body count is a red flag because that person has probably dated/hooked up a lot and probably has an issue with commitment when im looking for long term.  Also a lot of mental health disorders, mostly the severe ones, include sexual hyper sexuality/impulsivity/risk taking as a symptom. Also, for people with body counts of over 20, with that level of impulsivity and risk taking, do you /really/ think that that person who you hardly know was responsible and used protection every single time? Not just the pull out method or birth control, but actual CONDOMS? That there werent a FEW accidents or scares? I mean if its just a hook up, you do you, go for it i guess but for dating/long term its a major red flag at least for me.  This whole body count positivity movement and debate mostly relies on the whole why-can-men-have-as-much-sex-as-they-want-but-women-cant argument but my argument/thinking goes for both genders.	1643202116.0	sd5hct	/r/changemyview/comments/sd5hct/cmv_body_count_does_matter_especially_when/	CMV: Body count DOES matter, especially when looking for long term relationships
