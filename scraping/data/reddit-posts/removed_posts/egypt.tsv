an4jo4kk	When I was a kid I loved reading about wars, especially the ones Egypt took a part in it. It is easy to find documentries and info, even movies about many of the wars, BUT when it comes to the 1962 Yemeni war, there is hardly any data. I was watching a show last week ( A girl named Zat) and they mentioned it briefly, so I tried to look it up again but I didn't find much about it. anyone knows sources to get educated about this topic?	1643135144.0	sckbbd	/r/Egypt/comments/sckbbd/where_can_u_get_any_info_about_the_war_of_north/	where can u get any info about the war of North Yemen

eqy9qxp7	I am a very religious teenager and everyday I see the weirdest things ever in egypt and I'd like to say that many of the harrasers on the streets and rapists etc claim to be religious and I see them doing awful things such as cussing which has been very normalized. For example, our religion teaches us to respect EVERYONE and by that I mean no excuses for no one. for example, we have LGBTQ people that get insulted daily, and I don't support neither insulting them nor supporting them we should just encourage them with peace and kindness to force them to like us and respect us we should respect everyone even if we don't like them and even if we absolutely hate them, this isn't what our prophet taught us he taught us to be forgiving and filled with kindness. I know this is going to get alot of hate because of uneducated people trying to justify their actions but I'm just saying the truths and I can provide u with all the sources and I also see that people take fatwas from anyone and the use it to justify awful things such as rape in marriage and rape in general and sex slaves and even BEATING UR WIFE??????! Wake up people this isn't the ummah prophet Muhammed pbuh would've wanted, I myself have seen many people on YouTube having extreme hate towards us Muslims and insulting us but I always reply with a loving introduction and inquire about their choice of words and never have they replied back with another insult.

Egypt's economy is different from the other developed countries that have their personal-finance subreddits, we suffer from high inflation, high-interest rates, poverty, and a large unbanked population which is probably one of the reasons personal finance is not so popular in Egypt.  I would like to try and revive this subreddit again, and I am sure that I can not do it alone, and would appreciate this subreddits help.

I'm going to kill myself if no one helps me.   I've been struggling with depression for 15 years, my life has been just a series of misfortunes. My current situation is that I feel like a second class citizen here, or a prisoner. I'm an Iraqi refugee in Egypt. I've been here for 3.5 years. The UN is not doing anything to help me. They hung up on my face. I do not have residency here, meaning I can't legally work, I can't travel anywhere even if I had the money, I can't do anything on my own. Multiple employees in the government told me you can't have a residency here because you're from Iraq. And told me to go back home. So, okay. I should just go back home right? I submitted a request to close my file with the UN and lo and behold, they told me I can't go back as it's too dangerous in Iraq and we don't allow refugees from Iraq to go back home.  So now, I don't have residency, I can't go back home, And I can't travel. Am I supposed to waste here? If so I might as well end it here and now. why wait?

7ya047y3	Fuck, this is infuriating.  We have to stand and watch our culture being handed to someone else just because a fucking grandkid of a slave owner feels guilty, and nobody gives a fuck about the Egyptian, Imazighen, nor any North African civilization ever.  The irony here is that the term Africa was first used to describe North Africa and it later grew to include the whole continent.  There's a lot of studies out there that suggests Egyptians nowadays are easily connected North Africa, with lesser connections to sub-saharan Africa, Middle East and Europe respectively.  So why the fuck do we stand and watch this pseudo-scientific idea grew to the point where they organize conventions in Egypt? Like what in the actual ancient Egyptian fuck?	1643905012.0	sjn5qa	/r/Egypt/comments/sjn5qa/i_am_really_tired_of_this_and_someone_actually/	I am really tired of this and someone actually has to to say it, Afrocentrism is all about cultural appropriation, stealing our identity and history and its basically pure racism but the world encourages/accepts it cause of white man's guilt; but it isn't our fucking problem.

8khle258	 The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African autosomal (both maternal and paternal) ancestry in three Ancient Egyptian individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is significantly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the modern Egyptians from Abusir el-Meleq, who "range from 14 to 21%.   Egyptians' Sub-Saharan African ancestry on their paternal side also increased from 0-5% to almost 20%, though it is only from the paternal side and is insignificant compared to the Autosomal ancestry shown earlier. In short, scientists concluded that Modern-day Egyptians are almost indistinguishable from their predecessors phenotypically.  ''Most scholars believe that Egyptians in antiquity looked pretty much as they look today, with a gradation of darker shades toward Sudan.''  The Sub-Saharan African influx that happened after the Islamic conquest of Egypt in the 7th century may have been caused by more connections with Sub-Saharan Africa, including the infamous Trans-Saharan slave trade.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/x6nwd97eqof81.png?width=1300&format=png&auto=webp&s=247740973aeb0f46944aabe0321e25f5246cc754  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459999/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5459999/)	1643923705.0	sjuvpi	/r/Egypt/comments/sjuvpi/a_genetic_study_concluded_that_modernday/	A Genetic study concluded that Modern-day Egyptians have 8% more Sub-Saharan African ancestry than the Ancient Egyptians.

zp3kp	البوست ده محاولة للتعبير عن شعور دايمًا فشلت في وصفه وتوضيحه للآخرين. الشعور هو الضجر بالتغوّل الديني على كل مجالات الحياة، بس مش من ناحية الحرام والحلال أو التشدد بشكل عام، بل من ناحية «المحتوى». مع كامل الفهم لدور الدين وأهميته للمؤمنين بيه، بس فيه ظاهرة في مصر أو ظاهرة مصرية المنشأ هي إن كل ما يفكر فيه الناس هو الدين، وكل كلامهم ومصطلحاتهم ومرجعياتهم الثقافية والأخلاقية وحتى اللغوية هي الدين. مفيش محتوى غير الدين. الدين هو الخامة الأساسية لشخصية الإنسان في مصر وكل حاجة تانية هي مجرد طباعة عليها وعناصر مضافة.  في مداخلة من طبيب مصري على قناة عربية، الطبيب مقالش جملة واحدة مفيهاش إن شاء الله والحمد الله وربنا يسهل. نفس الكلام بيحصل في أي موضوع من أي نوع. الدعاء والاستغفار والخشوع والمناجاة ماليين الكلام حتى على مستوى الحديث العادي اليومي بين الناس. أكيد الغالبية العظمى مش شايفين مشكلة في حاجة زي كدة وده من حقهم، ومن حقهم يعتقدوا إن كلام زي كلامي هو مجرد بذاءة وقدح في الدين بلا مبرر، بس افتراض حسن النية لثانية واحدة كفيل إنه يوضح نقطتي. لو أزحنا هالة القدسية عن الدين أعتقد من الواضح غرابة واقع إن ملايين من الشعب المصري ماشيين في شتا 2021 بمعلومات دقيقة جدًا عن تصرفات ونوايا وأفكار ناس عاشت في شبه الجزيرة العربية من 1400 سنة. ملايين من البشر مكرسين حياتهم وعقولهم لدراسة هذه الفترة من التاريخ السعودي (معلش، خلّي هالة القدسية متشالة سطرين كمان) دونًا عن أي موضوع أو فكرة أخرى. فيه مستوى متطور جدًا من البحث والتدقيق والتفسير والفلسفة حوالين الموضوع. طاقة روحانية هائلة وتضحيات مادية شخصية وجماعية غير معقولة تم بذلها في استكشاف الدين وخدمة للدين.   الدين نجح تمامًا في تطويع أدوات التواصل الحديثة، ودلوقتي فيه ملايين من ساعات البث التلفزيوني والإذاعي مكرسة للديم، وأرشيف هائل من تناول الفقه والسيرة. أول إم بي ثري مسكته في حياتي كنت في نادي سبورتنج في إسكندرية من حوالي 18 سنة، وكابتن الجيم شافني وأنا داخل وماسك الإم بي ثري وسألني إيه ده، قلتله بسمع فيه موسيقى، قاللي يعني مينفعش يتسمع عليه قرآن؟ ده شكل مبسط وعابر جدًا من الزحف متنوع الأشكال ومتفاوت السرعة للدين على المحيط العام وتفاصيله.   خلال السنة اللي فاتت كنت بركب أوبر أكتر من مرة كل يوم، ومفيش عربية واحدة ركبتها إلا وكان القرآن شغّال على الراديو، أيًا كان شكل وعمر وهيئة الشخص اللي سايق، وبقعد أتخيل الواحد من دول سايق مسافات طويلة لوحده وفيه برنامج ديني شغّال على الراديو فيه واحد بيتكلم عن موضوع الحلقة: من هو الصحابي الفقير الذي لم يملك دارًا أو نسب؟ ساعتها بسأل نفسي: معقول الدين قادر على فصل الناس عن الأشكال المتنوعة من التعبير و«المحتوى» الآخر، لدرجة إنهم يسمعوا الكلام ده طواعية أو بالقصد والرغبة، دونًا عن أي شكل آخر من أشكال التعبير والتواصل؟   طبعًا كلامي مش معناه إني مش فاهم أسباب هذا الواقع أو إني عايز الناس يغيروا عقولهم عشان يبقوا كوول ومحايدين، بس هي شكوى حابب أفهم إذا كان فيه ناس كتير مقدرين أسبابها. مشكلتي مش إن الناس تآمن أو يتحمسوا للي مؤمنين بيه. مشكلتي هي إني داخل مطعم وقاعد بغمّس قرن الفلفل في الطحينة وأنا بسمع ماذا فعل ربك بمن بغى واستكبر.  ليه في استسلام تام لفكرة إن حتى الأسانسير وشركة الطيران بيشغلوا دعاء الركوب؟	1643942890.0	sk25fw	/r/Egypt/comments/sk25fw/مظاهر_سيطرة_الدين_على_كل_تفاصيل_الحياة_في_مصر/	مظاهر سيطرة الدين على كل تفاصيل الحياة في مصر

9l76k1ly	Ok folks, I need help. I'm looking for a long lost friend who is from Egypt. Her name is Hala Taha Shahawy and she was my mom's best friend. We were neighbors in Saudi Arabia in the 90s but unfortunately we lost contact with them many years ago after we both moved. So these are a few details about her:  Name: Hala Taha Shahawy and she was from Dokki Giza in Cairo. She's probably in her 50s or early 60s. Husband's name: Mokhtar Children: Hossam (Simsim), Khulood (Loodi), Shaza  She may have had more children later, I don't really know. I also know her sister's name, it was Amaani and Amaani had twins.  It would be REALLY REALLY GREAT if I could connect with her or any of her kids.  I am not from Egypt so I don't really know how else to look for her.	1644059926.0	sl4qe8	/r/Egypt/comments/sl4qe8/looking_for_a_long_lost_friend_help/	Looking for a long lost friend. Help.

df7vsf8f	Anyone else think we are in a great danger ?   why our values are being demolished and mocked over and over and over ?   Mona zaki appears in a copied movie and people went crazy to defend that crap    claiming that this is our society while it's not,  not at all,  the movie writer is british and this is their social issues not ours,  and yet many many stupid egyptians are being very aggressive to prove that those are our problems and we are even worse! :D    I can't understand why anyone would have this very strong desire to prove that his community is the worst ever, while it's not !   Yes we are not perfect and Egyptians are annoying especially on the last 10 years    but this is because of the tremendous pressure they are dealing with !      And then you have this weird Riyadh season!    at the same time there is expo dubai and the israeli-emarati affair    all that while we as Arabic nation are leaving thousands of syrian families dying of the cold with no food or shelter ?   and still what matters to people is to prove that we encourage lgbt and adulteries !    very weird,  where is our culture?   where is our social values? yeah the so called "cool" guys are mocking them    Ignorant pieces of shi\*\* who are living on European scholarships and they are nothing in Europe and yet. they are speaking on social media like they are Einisteins :D    and people are buying it very happily !     Please people stop confusing the repetitive regimes failure with the culture    our culture didn't make us third world    Occupation did, dictatorships did,    and btw,  I am not a member of muslim brotherhood or any religious group    on the contrary,    And I am not the most follower to our values,  I mean not at all :D    I wish I can be though,    please remember that being culturally defeated to the west won't make us like them    the best shot we got on this is to be a copy cat,  fake nation and 2nd degree humans who are ruled by our dear neighbors in Israel !   Respect to Israel    they are standing tall and confident while being literally surrounded by enemies    they are not mocking their values or culture,    and that's why they became- hands down- the best country in this whole region.
