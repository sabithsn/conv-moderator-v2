c8baovm8	I’ve heard some people claim that colours don’t exist in the external world outside our mind and that science has “proved” this. However, has science actually shown that colours don’t exist in the external world? And if so, how?

aj9jprmf	I know this seems like a simple question, but the context of this question comes from a debate I heard between two classmates. One claimed that sex of an organism was first and foremost a question of gamete type. The other claimed that sex was a question of general reproductive function, i.e. a woman with Complete Androgen Insensitivity syndrome would not be male because despite having testes, the rest of her body was geared towards female reproduction.  Their analogy is that if a left shoe was put on a right foot, it would still be a left shoe because its structure is organized around the left foot, regardless of what it's being used for or wether or not it's functional. Basically, that a "male phenotype" was an organism organized towards the production of sperm, and that this is born out by the definition of sex that comes up on Google.  >either of the two main categories (male and female) into which humans and most other living things are divided on the basis of their reproductive functions.  The however, the gamete-based definition seems to be favored by dictionaries like miriam webster which say that "female" is  >"of, relating to, or being the sex that typically has the capacity to bear young or produce eggs"  And vice versa for men. The Oxford Dictionary similarly favors it with even less ambiguity.  >Denoting the gamete (sex cell) that, during sexual reproduction, fuses with a male gamete in the process of fertilization. Female gametes are generally larger than the male gametes and are usually immotile (see oosphere; ovum).  Which of these perspectives is correct? I understand that this is a touchy topic for a lot of people, especially with current debates about gender and intersex people.	1642878582.0	sa9ms2	/r/askscience/comments/sa9ms2/how_is_biological_sex_defined_gametes_or_body/	How is biological sex defined, gametes or body types?
bjc5vrn	I heard about this test where patients have to collect urine for 1 day and then creatinine amount is determined (concentration x urine amount). But like how do they do this? They surely can't use a 1.5L sample. Do they just give the container a good shake and then take a small sample? And what about bacteria growth? I've heard sometimes the container has a special powder, what is this substance and what is its purpose?  thanks	1643038188.0	sboq6i	/r/askscience/comments/sboq6i/how_do_hospitals_use_1day_urine_to_determine/	How do hospitals use 1-day urine to determine kidney function?
4oxfau	You are able to simulate an oxygen nitrogen nebula that evenly distributed throughout.  It then beings to collapse into itself. At some time, its core reaches 760 torr. The size and the amount of atoms in the nebula are set to maximize the time the 760 torr exist at its core.  How long would that last? Would frozen oxygen and nitrogen start forming shortly afterwards? As it collapses more and more it heats up. Will there ever be a location where the temperature is survivable by a human with a space suit without a helmet and where that is, have the proper density of breathable air?	1643150809.0	scq4rk	/r/askscience/comments/scq4rk/what_total_mass_would_a_oxygen_nitrogen_nebula/	What total mass would a oxygen nitrogen nebula need to be to maintain 760 torr the longest?
h2xlk	Basically, when it's 22°F without snow, it's bitter cold and the air hurts everything it touches but that same 22°F with snow on the ground is now much more bearable, it actually feels "warmer".  Is there actually any scientific reasoning for this or is this just placebo?	1643110289.0	scbn4k	/r/askscience/comments/scbn4k/why_does_snow_have_a_warming_effect/	Why does snow have a "warming" effect?
