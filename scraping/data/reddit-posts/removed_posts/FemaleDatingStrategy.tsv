czttavkd	Hiiüëãüèª. First I wanted to thank all the women who made this sub because this place is so helpful and was a relief for me when I found it last year. As someone that is just starting her early 20s, there are a lot of things I already knew but there are a lot of other things I feel like still need to work and understand. Now I‚Äôm focusing more on the university ( I study psychology) so dating is not my main priority and even though I am quite well being single sometimes I feel like maybe I should try dating a bit or maybe try online dating. But my problem with online dating is that it seems a bit, not in line with how I would feel more comfortable meeting guys and getting to know them better. I tried it last year for some days after my friend convinced me of doing that but deep down I knew it was not for me at all so I deleted it.  Now I feel like it‚Äôs hard to meet guys that are willing to make a move and ask me out because one thing I notice a lot is guys looking at me from afar, making some eye contact but never coming at me to ask for my number. I honestly have no patience for cowards so I try to not waste too much time wondering if they‚Äôre going to talk to me or not.  So what tips and advice do you all have about dating in your early 20s? And if anyone notice experienced something similar about guys just admiring from afar but never approaching I would feel very happy to hear your stories!! :) üíú Ps: English is not my first language so sorry if there‚Äôs an error.

cuu3uhhi	Is it just me or is it sooooo annoying when men say this?   It‚Äôs like men are blaming us for not showering them with compliments- uhh, maybe we will if men stop thinking all compliments from women are coming from a place of sexual interest??  Or better yet, men should start complimenting each other instead of relying on women to stroke their ego. No, it‚Äôs not ‚Äògay‚Äô or ‚Äòunmanly‚Äô to compliment other dudes, dudes. Just how a woman complimenting another woman doesn‚Äôt automatically make her a lesbian üôÑ  And why is it our fault that men have no emotional support? Maybe they should actually talk and communicate with each other for emotional support instead of always relying on a woman to play therapist? And no, not all women have emotional support. Many women are expected to be the emotional support pillar in families/relationships, and receive no support in return.   I just see these scrotes whining, yet they make no effort with fellow men and instead expect a woman to fulfill their ego and emotional needs ü§¢	1642932959.0	saqks0	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/saqks0/men_rarely_get_compliments_women_do_men_have_no/	‚ÄòMen rarely get compliments, women do‚Äô, ‚ÄòMen have no emotional support unlike women‚Äô ü§°ü§°
4qvw4na4	On this sub I've read a lot of posts about how we should avoid male friends as they all want one thing (sex), and instead look to cultivate only HV female friends. While this argument has its merits I think it overlooks the crucial benefits of having a carefully 'curated' group of male friendships, that is: having the time to vet them as friends without having to date them or sleep with them.  If they're friends with you they're probably attracted to you in some way. However, men know that when you label each other as 'friends' that means you are not meant to engage with each other romantically or sexually. That element is off limits and if they want you, they're going to have to convince you that they are better than all the other male friends you have, and they KNOW. They know that the other male friends in your life are also very likely to be interested in you. It's competition for them and that's good for you.  The friendship dynamic automatically sets up a situation where you are the uninterested party and they are the pursuer. It's during this period of time, assuming you play your cards right (and NOT make things flirtatious or sexual with them) that they will get to know you and you will get to know them (read: vet them for an extensive period of time). I don't think most men fully see women as people beyond their immediate sexuality until they have spent non-sexual time with them and have an opportunity to develop an emotional connection and respect for them. That's why flirting and sex is off limits, but being a sweet, considerate, caring and gracious friend is ok (obviously, you can decide how much emotional labour you want to do for this, but some is required to develop the friendship). Friendship is the foundation on which you can find out whether you have compatible values and whether he is HV. As Lundy Bancroft said in a recent podcast, if you want to get to know someone you have to give them time to reveal themselves to you and friendship is the perfect cover for that, as it doesn't have the same time pressures that OLD can bring, for example.  This is a long term vetting strategy because developing emotional intimacy with a man who is attracted to you and keeping it non-sexual requires time, boundaries and space from each other. Don't be desperate to see him, don't be a pick me. Let things develop naturally and if they don't then you have your answer. It can take a year or more of a man knowing you to appreciate you and respect you enough to open up about his true self in front of you. That's when you take notes.  I've had a man who I've been friends with for three years recently admit to me he's actually not emotionally available (lol). He had opened up about his dating troubles when we were chatting on the phone.   I've had another man who I've been friends with for two years who has been fairly unproblematic and that's great because it's a green flag. He has always respected the boundaries of the friendship and it's nice to have - tentatively - HV men in my friendship circles.   In an ideal world men would respect and emotionally connect with women from the get go, but we don't live in that world. Even a HV man who respects women as a class will need time to get to know a woman personally and do his own vetting before he respects you on a personal level for who you are as an individual. Don't forget LV women exist out there and he doesn't know whether you're LV or HV without the benefit of time and friendship.  Finally, we always talk about how men dig women for their labour, but we don't often talk about how women can counteract that. Being single and having lots of male friends is actually a great way to secure labour and resources because no one is nicer than a man who wants to sleep with you. Again, for this to work you have to be extremely strict about not sleeping with or flirting with your male friends. You have to maintain extremely high standards and let them see how you dismiss LV attempts at courting you while you give them time to understand your HV stance in life. Male friends who become invested in you and respectful of you as a person will gladly offer you their resources as a shoulder to cry on (emotional labour), someone to help fix something around the house, or protection from other problematic men (physical labour), buy you drinks or a meal (financial labour). It is your job to be able to receive these gifts and be gracious about them as it makes most men happy that they can do something for you.  The man you finally choose to be your partner should be a person whose positive qualities are so great that the benefit of having him be your chosen partner outweighs the cost of potentially losing your male friends and the resources and benefits they provide to you as a single woman.	1642952978.0	sawi45	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sawi45/dating_strategy_if_youre_single_carefully/	Dating strategy: If you're single, carefully cultivating a group of male friends is a great way to vet for mate compatibility and secure resources
