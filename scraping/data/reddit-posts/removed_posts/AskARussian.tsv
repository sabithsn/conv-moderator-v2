ehomo9o8	Russia has managed a significant buildup near the Ukrainian border which rises extreme anxiety to Ukrainians and Europeans - uniting them in threat of Russia - which could make Ukraine NATO inclusion extremely fast. Otherwise it would take many decades for any theoretical inclusion, given border disputes and corruption in Ukraine.  Can you explain such moves given main thing russia don't want is Ukraine inclusion into NATO? It does no make any sense. Or is Russian government really setting up a soon invasion and occupation of more territories?	1642805448.0	s9nbf0	/r/AskARussian/comments/s9nbf0/why_is_russia_threatening_ukraine_if_it_is_the/	Why is Russia threatening Ukraine if it is the main factor increasing average Ukrainian support for joining NATO?

ahle7qv5	do you Russians think the comments that putin made about the collapse of the soviet union being the greatest tragedy in the 20th century have help fuel anti russian sentiments and made the situation in ukraine worse??, I have family in poland who like russian people but the older generation are not too fond of the memory's of growing up/living in the USSR and the younger generations like the cosmopolitan vibe of Europe now.  Imo the recent flocking of former soviet states to NATO and ukraine wanting to move closer to Europe is not so much US expansionism but a fear of the old Stalin days and living under the KGB scrutiny and tget seek NATO alliances to keep their national identities intact.  What could russia/putin do to maintain his sphere of influence in Europe with peaceful relationships rather than heavy handed tactics that could have European countries keep the US away from Russia's borders through good dialogue and mutual understandings and respect??  Edit, post may come of as western bias but I purely ask this as discussions with family members overseas as they are afraid of war but also going back in time 20 - 50 years.	1642948082.0	saut2n	/r/AskARussian/comments/saut2n/putins_comments_on_the_ussr/	Putins comments on the USSR

Russia appears to have always been completely governed by people of non-russian descent, like, initially by Mongols, then geman surnames appears to dominate, then when soviet union started Lenin was jewish, Stalin was Georgian and when russian-ish descent people took over soviet union fell. Now elite is mostly foreign descent as well, like Lavrov is armenian, medvedev/mishutin/zhirinovski jewish, gasprom director being german, only woman claiming to be Putins mother also appears to be jewish.	1643296291.0	se0let	/r/AskARussian/comments/se0let/is_it_true_ukrainians_are_the_actual_rus_people/	Is it true Ukrainians are the actual "Rus" people, while Moscow is led mainly by elites of post-Kievan Rus immigrants?

dveprz84	Russians. Tell me why you treat all countries around you as targets for your invasion. Why are you such aggressors? Why can't you live on your 17 million kilometers and fuck off from Europe Georgia Ukraine etc? You have bigger problems than NATO. AIDS epidemic (even in Ukraine the most AIDS is in the areas inhabited by Russians), alcoholism and poverty. You in 5 million households don't even have a toilet. Take care of yourselves, stop fucking up countries with which you are neighbors. Shove your iskanders up your asses and stick your heads in your artillery guns. If you don't have enough blood, start carpet bombing Moscow, or maybe nuke Pskov or Kuban. You are aggressive jerks. At first I thought you just had fucked up leaders, but when I look at your subs I see that they are not the only ones who are sick.  I have not seen such an amount of hatred and lies anywhere else. You live in your hypocritical bubble and think that everything is ok. You are surprised that Europe thinks you are savages. You accuse other countries of being in alliance with the USA.

14mytb	Many Russians i have spoke to do not believe they lost the cold war....we have 3000 tons of military gear in the Baltic states just miles away from St Petersburg. The Baltic states used to be a Russian stronghold full of military gear and the tip of the Russian nuclear spear, now they are in nato hands and are the tip of the nato nuclear spear. NATO is still expanding with the latest countries joining in 2017 / 2020 and with every new country added Russia gets weaker while nato gets stronger and stronger. Everything that Russia has worked for, all of its conquered territories, all of its military gains, its grip over eastern Europe, its carefully crafted security sphere, all of it lies in ruins. With all of this in mind HOW IN THE HECK DID RUSSIA NOT LOSE THE COLD WAR?   Dont listen to me listen to Putin. Even he says that everything Russia had worked so hard to achieve has been lost.
