it87i94w	Just need to get this off my chest.  And before someone comes in here and accuses me of not masking or getting vaccinations. I do mask up and I have gotten my vaccinations. With that out of the way...  It's pretty sad how the pandemic has caused so much hatred and division among people. But in particular, the drama with masks and vaccinations. Both sides are annoying as fuck and people never shut up about it. It's just people politicizing a literal face-cloth and being at each other's throats over vaccines. The division and hatred that masks and vaccines have caused is disgusting, and I don't care about who does what anymore as long as I'm doing my part. I don't even check covid news anymore because I no longer want to hear about the endless "political" debates and arguments about masks and vaccines.  I feel like these past two years have made me lose a fraction of my sanity.	1642775272.0	s9by4g	/r/offmychest/comments/s9by4g/im_sick_and_tired_of_the_antimask_and_antivaxx/	I'm sick and tired of the anti-mask and anti-vaxx drama.

d71kfwc9	I'm just in so much pain ALL the time. Both physical and mental. I have more than one disability that makes it so hard just to work a full-time job. I've never been happy. I'm in my mid 20s and I just will never be able to mentally feel happy and I'm so miserable. I just can't do it anymore. The world is so fucked and there's no point in even living anymore, people can hardly survive at this point. Why even keep dragging everything out the way we do, why keep suffering constantly and needlessly. I don't understand how people can even have children when the world is so fucked. They won't have a future, hell my generation has no future. And yes I have people who love me but I'm also just a burden at this point. I'm so negative and I can't fix it now. No amount of therapy or drugs works. If I'm not high I'm just crying and depressed working my life away for nothing. It'll just be better to end it.	1643141939.0	scmvkm	/r/offmychest/comments/scmvkm/im_probably_going_to_kill_myself/	I'm probably going to kill myself
j0patxi4	I know I know. This isn't the place to go to for help. Contact professionals, talk to friends and family etc... I'm not going to contact a professional because they'll call the cops and put me on a list. My Friends and family have no idea how to help me and when I've tried talking about it they've kinda just blew me off saying I shouldn't be like this. So you guys are all I got at this point.  Anyways here's the situation. I'm 25(M). I'm obese beyond a point to where I can see myself being able to really do anything about it. I've always been this way. I can't remember ever being as thin as a normal person. Even as a child I was fat. When I was 16 I was trying my absolute best to lose weight and be active and hurt myself playing tennis. I guess I went to hard and got a herniated disc. They wouldn't operate on it then because I was too young. So through the rest of my high school days I was basically dormant. No sports or any extra curricular activities. I gained all my weight back plus a lot more making my back situation worse. It gets worse.  My sophomore year of college I had to finally get surgery on the disc because I could no longer walk. I don't know how to describe how this made me. I was depressed sure, but also just lost all drive for everything. I would procrastinate on school work putting me extremely far behind. I already wasn't a good student. So I ended up having to drop classes putting me to where I wouldn't graduate on time. At this time my parents knew about the situation and weren't too pushy about it.   The surgery ended up making the discs above the original disc weaker which made me have to get another surgery on the disc above the following year which made me fall even further behind in classes. My parents and I already knew I wasn't going to graduate on time but they didn't know just how bad it was. My grades had dropped to a 1.9 GPA and I was put on academic probation and was no longer allowed to take out state loans. So I ended up dropping out almost completely.  I had to constantly lie to my parents about classes and now have gotten so deep to where they think I've graduated.   That brings us to today. I can't do manual labor jobs because of my back. And can't get anything except customer service jobs because I didn't graduate and that's basically all my area offers that doesn't require a degree. I'm severely obese because of various reasons, depression, my back, my weight etc... So I'm forced to still live with my parents and am running out of reasons to tell them why I don't have a job and why I'm not losing weight. So yeah I think I'm gonna just kill myself soon with drugs or something because I can't see any way out of this. So I'm making this post to see if you guys have any ideas. That's all.  &#x200B;  P.S. Also I've completely thrown away the idea of any relationships or having a family one day. It's just so unlikely at this point I've just put it out of my mind completely.	1643143368.0	scneuf	/r/offmychest/comments/scneuf/so_i_think_im_gonna_kill_myself_you_guys_got_any/	So I think I'm gonna kill myself.

j12qkr5h	So one of three things will happen in February: Either I die, ugly people die, or we all die. Because I'm not going to jail. there's no fucking way that's happening, not jail. If it comes to that I'll suicide. Fuck jail. I always promised myself I'd die by age 30 anyway and I'm 27 in the first place. I don't want to get old. I feel like this was always kind of going to happen. My 20s has been a decay towards realising there's no fucking way for me to change anything. I want to go out still being who I am. I don't want to abandon how much I fucking detest ugly people on a fundamental level and how much beauty means to me, I'll take that to the grave	1643169576.0	scwq3s	/r/offmychest/comments/scwq3s/at_this_point_im_just_gonna_do_what_i_have_to/	At this point I'm just gonna do what I have to
j13okhia	Pretty much the title. I've always had a dirty mind, I literally remember thinking up rapey scenarios in my head when i was in elementary school, though i only got into the actual stuff in 6th grade. I fucking hate it. I'm currently in high school and usually gets straight A's, and just hearing my parents and teachers say how good of a student i am just makes me feel worse considering none of them no i have a fucking rape kink. I've literally read real rape stories online, and somehow have gotten turned on by them. In addition to that it's gotten to the point i literally can barely go a day without masturbating, and some of the time i do it twice in one day. As said, I just feel so awful because i know that if any of my friends, or my parents, or my brother found out i feel like they would just be horrified. Again, I'm not saying that my situation is unique or whatever, and I don't mean to imply that my life is bad or anything. I usually go half of the day without thinking about it, but whenever i do think about it, especially during school, i just hate my decisions. It's also made it so I keep staring at girls' breasts which fucking sucks as well. I can only imagine some random girl thinking that I'm some pervert, well i kinda am, after passing me in the hall because i stared at their chest. so yeah. again, i don't really know what the point of this post is, well to get all this shit off of my chest, but i don't mean to give off that im depressed or constantly sad about this, this is just a part of my life that im really ashamed of wish would disappear without a trace. so yeah.	1643169664.0	scwr62	/r/offmychest/comments/scwr62/im_addicted_to_rape_porn_and_i_hate_it/	I'm addicted to rape porn and I hate it
j17jo8i3	I have a friend my age who pulls guys like bees to money. She was bragging to me about how she finally found a guy who liked her for her personality and not just her looks.  She's my age. Always been very popular with men.  I've realized how ugly I am. I'm incredibly hideous and I need help becoming more popular with men. On average, I've been rated a 7.5/10 and that's not good enough, apparently!  I'm 22. 23 this year. 5'4, 111 pounds. 4 pounds over the underweight mark. B cup breasts. I wear hoodies and jeans and only eyeliner and mascara. Nothing much else. Maybe some concealer if I have acne but I normally don't.  Personality wise, I'm introverted and sarcastic. I don't flirt with men and I'm not warm and outgoing with them either since they've only caused me sorrow and rejection.  Any advice is welcomed.	1643180105.0	sczswh	/r/offmychest/comments/sczswh/im_ugly_and_unpopular_with_men_because_of_my_looks/	I'm ugly and unpopular with men because of my looks
izqsfqjn	&#x200B;  All I want to do is fuck hot beautiful women forever but I can't - because slave to money and because people find eating assholes and eating shit offensive. This form of narcissism given by my parents - who got to have cake and eat it too by having me but are embarrassed to talk about it - this is because fucking religion the root of all evil.  I rather be happy than be a sad fuck staring at a computer screen pretending to be happy.	1643181097.0	sd024m	/r/offmychest/comments/sd024m/all_i_want_to_do_is_fuck_hot_beautiful_women/	All I want to do is fuck hot beautiful women forever
