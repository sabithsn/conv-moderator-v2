oaby1vd	Spoilers for Dinsey Pixar's: the Incredibles.  &#x200B;  Early on in the movie, Bob (Mr. Incredible) saves a man who had comitted suicide by throwing himself off a building. Said man then sues Bob on the grounds that he "didn't want to be saved" and this would be the domino who's knock on effect would cause super heroes to become outcasts. While i'm aware this is a kid's movie and that this serves as a means to get the plot rolling, this has bothered me for as long as I was old enough to grasp the situation.  Was Bob suppose to let the man die? Any form of suicide is awful, but that one especially due to not only the clean up needed, but the emotional scarring it can have on passerby. Really think about this: the guy didn't sue Mr. Incredbile for breaking his bones or property damage, he did it because (and I quote) he "ruined \[his\] death!"  Bob's powers include super strength; he can't fly and so put his life as risk to leap over and save the man. But no, "supers" are menaces that needs to be abolished! Ok, lets look at what Mr.Incredible did earlier that same day:  * Stopped a bank robbery * Helped an old lady get her cat down from a tree * with the help of elastigirl, stops an armed mugger * Attempts to stop super villain: Bomb Voyage (Super villains exist btw) and is only unable to do so because he- * STOPS A CHILD FROM BEING BOMBED!  And he's being judged by both the court and the court of public opinion for saving a man from ending his own life? Also, while we're on the subject: Mr. incredible was sued by the people of the train he attempted to save. Nah you're right; he should have done nothing, let it carine off the bridge as i'm sure that would have ended WAY better.  &#x200B;  Also, Mr. Incredible and his family save the town of people who to this day see people like him and his family as outsiders.  &#x200B;  Like if you want to hold said supers more accountable, sure. But to abolish arguably one of the greatest assets the city has over criminals and SUPER-VILLAINS: people who have significant power over the populis and chose to use it for good because elements out of their control ended negatively is baffling.	1642773819.0	s9bfv4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bfv4/mr_incredible_did_nothing_wrong/	Mr Incredible did nothing wrong.

83g88r8b	At some point in your life, you did not need coffee (or caffeine) to wake up and be productive.   Instead you used it as a crutch to cover other bad habits (i.e. a poor sleep schedule, bad diet, lack of healthy practices), and now have made your body dependent on it just to function.

bmmha634	Food banks bad, Food PANTRIES good. As a certified poor person with lots of hungry teens to feed, everyone is all like, “Go to the food bank.” But the quality of the food is horrible.   Food banks advertise that they can produce a certain number of pounds of food per dollar donated, but at what cost? My dog won’t even eat the meat product (think far worse than Spam), and he’s not picky. A very minor food allergy in the home means that 3/4 of us can not eat 3/4 of the food. I give it away, of course, or make for guests, or just feed it to that one hardy soul, but I feel bad for “being choosy”, even though it is necessary.   Food pantries, on the other hand, give out actual produce, which is the most expensive thing to buy, and the most important for health. That is something that helps, a lot. I don’t mind picking out the bad apples or freezing something so that it won’t go bad before I can use it. And the other food items at the pantry are actual food, for people, not “food flavored product” that was produced as cheaply as possible, and is not actually edible or nutritious or even safe for most of us.	1642774632.0	s9bpwa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bpwa/food_banks_are_bad/	Food Banks are bad

3u8wlgeh	Do they have the potential to be dangerous? Absolutely. But so do people who experience emotions on a more typical level. However not all psychopaths are serial killers, they are not all like Ted Bundy, or what the movies portray them to be. Many of them claim to not be interested in violence and their actions match that statement.   Many of them due to their stunted emotional range are well suited for jobs that would deplete a typical person, such as a soldier, homicide detective, or surgeon.   And I don’t know about you but if I was having brain surgery I would want someone who would not be perturbed by their emotions if something goes wrong during the procedure. I would want someone who would be calm, collected, and focused on the task at hand instead of panicked and overwhelmed by emotions that distract them from focusing on how to keep me alive.	1642775703.0	s9c3t2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3t2/psychopaths_play_an_important_role_in_society/	Psychopaths play an important role in society.
1tx512p2	To be clear, I don’t think that a 70-180 minute movie isn’t a good length, or that stories can’t be told in that time. If anything, the constrictions of the medium often has made the story better because things need to be edited out and contained in a self enclosed context. So the length of movies we’ve become accustomed to is by no means super flawed or something that needs to change.   However, as the stories artists try to tell become bigger, more complicated, with wider casts of interconnected characters and plot lines, especially ones based on ridiculously expansive material such as comic book movies, that time frame just doesn’t work anymore. Although mini-series don’t bring in the revenue of movies, and don’t have nearly the industry to be build upon, if movie-quality time and effort were put into them, there would be more stories available for telling and worlds available for building.   I don’t think this will change because the film industry is pretty cemented, but even stuff like filming several movies simultaneously to make sequels more cohesive and releasing them separately seems like a step towards a new kind of media, in between tv shows and movies	1642775711.0	s9c3xa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3xa/movies_are_too_short_to_tell_the_stories_people/	Movies are too short to tell the stories people want to see these days

2akz56e	It's absurd that YouTubers and TikTokers monetize trash content aimed at kids which encourages them to go out and destroy things, like school bathrooms, city property, etc. Not only should content creators not be able to make money off these posts, local governments should fine these content creators as a disincentive, and potentially pursue criminal charges for especially dangerous content.   The other day I was out for a walk and I saw a boy (around 10 years old) bashing his scooter against a public trash can, hard enough to dislodge it from where it had been hung. He was unattended, but with a group of peers, and as I got closer he did it a second time, so I asked him why on earth he'd do that. The kid was actually very polite and told me it was a challenge from his favorite YouTuber, and how funny that person is, blah blah blah. I told him that person makes money off of those videos, but when he repeats those actions, all he gets is a broken scooter, while destroying something meant to keep our city clean. I doubt what I said had much of an impact, but it's really frustrating that what seems like a nice little kid can be influenced into such destructive behavior, because these videos are so prevalent, which normalizes this kind of thing. There shouldn't be an economic incentive for influencers to churn out this kind of crap.	1642777024.0	s9ckji	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9ckji/there_should_be_financial_andor_legal_penalties/	There should be financial and/or legal penalties for social media "challenges" that promote vandalism/destruction of property.

e2hhsmf7	Pop artist are products organized by category and rotated periodically to cover the range of demographics ages 2-72 and it’s even got gender categories. Some are more memorable than others and although music can reach you in many more ways than the local record store and originate from legitimately gifted folks’ living rooms these days much of it holds true IMO. They throw knockoffs at us and some of the lazy/formula-missing efforts are hilarious and repulsive.  Ex.  Take what your local rock/alternative station threw at us in the 90’s - even commercial one’s that were genuinely trying to bring real alternative options to the airwaves. WFNX in Boston comes to mind.   So hear me out. Epic had Pearl Jam’s Ten so Atlantic had to have one of those new things over there and scrounged up STP and it went downhill from there. Interscope sharted out Bush with a handsome front man who’s forced, gravel-voiced utterings and intentionally odd/unrelated sentence fragments for lyrics under the guise of a beautiful tortured artist brought us to the basement of the hierarchy of the 90’s house of mainstream rock just what, 4 years in?   However if Bush was a shart in the basement then Geffen actually China Syndromed the foundation a hundred feet deep and released a hundred foot long, open-air shit in it with Counting Crows by openly antagonizing the listener - I Am The Rain King - He screamed! Yes outright SCREAMED at the listener!  Ahem the record company has informed me that my character is to be thought of as a poet. So I will insist the listener now call me a name oh-so similar to, you guessed it, an overrated try hard from days of yore!The Lizard King. Reselling a warmed over and ham-handedly, thrown together Tupperware version of an overrated yet memorable persona should be subtle not screamed. Geffen even got the formula wrong by sanding any suggestion of edge off the music and inserted some of the most contrived, Fisher-Price lyrics and imagery since the monkees.   Pick your product - you want shocking females? Let’s start off dunno 70’s? Patti Smith’s barely tempered madness becomes Maddona flopping around on the floor becomes Liz Phair’s lyrics on Exile in Guyland becomes Lil Kim’s whole persona becomes Nikki Minaj and her troop of current Kim clones. Just trot new versions out every 7-10 years or so and catch the next wave of consumers passin on by thru their demographic. It’s all so formulaic.   Sporadically there are exceptions - some spectacular, genuine and authentic. RUN/DMC/J  kicked a door open that had been created by hyper-talented predecessors just a few years ahead of their time but too far ahead for the mainstream. DMC cemented an entire genre’s permanence - that is big dickin on a categorical scale.   Yet I fall for it. Yes, I love my Tool and my Smiths, Public Enemy, Al Green, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Cash, Elliot Smith and Rakim so to me I’m actually enjoying creative and talented people’s creations. However when now one’s around? Marc Anthony’s Need To Know comes on? I rip at that fucking volume knob tryin to get to 10 before the baseline hits Lol.   Ever get the feeling you been cheated?

1od8mybd	Most of the fan content I see for Star Wars is directly related to the prequels or to the extended Universe in general which shows that more hardcore fans engage with the content more. Yes I will acknowledge there are problems to the prequels, but way too many people have Nostalgia goggles whenever they make these critiques about the prequels and the original trilogy. Both of them have awkward dialogue at times especially in their Premiere movies. The people who complain about there being too much dialogue can never recite what's being said in the dialogue, name a scene and I can justify why the dialogue in that scene is necessary. Revenge of the Sith is one of my favorite movies and it's my favorite in Star Wars.	1642777859.0	s9cvpt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9cvpt/the_prequels_are_better_than_the_original_trilogy/	The prequels are better than the original trilogy.

"Hey I work hard, there's nothing wrong if I enjoy a cocktail from time to time."  That's the very first sentence used in the very first step to a slippery slope that destroys businesses and lives.  However, every other person in the world thinks owning a bar would be the greatest thing ever. "It wouldn't even be work. I would love it so much".  Then reality sets in and they have to work. But sitting around bullshitting and drinking is better and far easier.  So depressing how many people think alcohol is manna from heaven.

8d0oxa1c	I’ve been a professional oldest sister for 25 years now and I just have to say. The amount of oldest siblings/oldest children I see saying essentially the equivalent of they don’t want any part in helping with their younger siblings is baffling to me. I helped raise my siblings especially as I got older and became an adult myself and it just wasn’t that bad, I’m not saying it should go so far as raising your siblings but if your parents need your help stop being little assholes and just help them without complaining about it. It’s really going to be okay if you watch them for a few hours while your parents do things they need to do, it’s just not that big of a deal if you have to make a few meals in your life for your siblings, or if you have to drive them to school. They will bitch about helping their siblings in any capacity and then wonder why their siblings want nothing to do with them later on.  And to clarify I’m not saying you should be doing the parenting of your siblings but helping should not be as big of an issue as it’s become for older siblings, you’re parents don’t have to pay you, your parents don’t have to go to extra lengths to get your help it’s just selfish. You should not be cooking every meal every single day, you shouldn’t be caring for them while your parents lay around, and if they’re going on dates and things you should be paid but if they ask you to watch them for 2-3 hours while they grocery shop is it really going to kill you?	1642780299.0	s9dsd5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9dsd5/you_have_a_responsibility_to_help_as_the_oldest/	You have a responsibility to help as the oldest sibling

3551d6xv	Don’t get me wrong, I know money isn’t everything, but a huge part of everyone’s life is controlled by money, and how much of it we have and are able to spend. The mentality that a job you love which pays significantly less than a job you hate, is better than living an unhappy work life, sounds illogical imo. Yes, your quality of life matters and you should be able to enjoy your work life to some extent, but this doesn’t mean you should sacrifice the potential to live a financially stable life. In the long run, if you worked the high-paying boring job, you’d have more than enough money to live off and from there it probably would be fine to leave the job and pursue your own interests, but going straight for a low-paying dream job that won’t cover all your expenses, seems foolish.	1642780983.0	s9e1o0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e1o0/having_a_job_you_hate_but_you_earn_a_gooddecent/	Having a job you hate, but you earn a good/decent living from it, is better than having your dream job and not making enough money to live at all
3qkq70lu	Before I start, I want to point out this isn't advice.  I'm so happy I never got to ask her out. Of course, there was still the pain of realizing she was taken, but I missed out on the fun of social activities because I was so focused on her. When I was with friends, my mind constantly shifted to her. I did well in school, but I feel like I could have done even better if I never had a crush. Even if I asked her out, the distractions would still be there. If I got rejected, I would be distracted by the heartbreak; I was not a good sport when it came to being comforted.  Another reason why I am so happy is that it helped me develop new insight into how the dynamics of a relationship work. My crush and I had many things different from each other, but I was only in love because I "felt" it. I loved affection, but that doesn't tell a lot when it comes to the actual character. Now that the high school years are behind me, I can say for certain that I can reenter the dating world with a new perspective on how a relationship is supposed to work.  Everyone says that having a crush feels awesome, and adults regret not asking out. The latter is exactly what I mean when I say having a crush is painful. The confusion, the fear of rejection, and the disappointment from those whose relationships didn't work out. If you married your high school sweetheart, awesome. I'm saying that having a crush shouldn't be as glorified as it is, and it should be more widely accepted to stifle these feelings if one wishes to do so.	1642781142.0	s9e3qf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e3qf/the_feeling_of_having_a_crush_is_so_painful_and_i/	The feeling of having a crush is so painful, and I wish I never had one in high school.

They say: “omg you don’t know what that is?”  Now if it was a rhetorical question I wouldn’t have been as annoyed but they really expected me to answer.  Like obviously tf not. That’s why I asked.

7ha5i8u4	So this weird ass opinion clicked into my head about a week ago. I remember all my life hearing stories from friends family and on the internet about how shitty it is getting you car broken into it’s scary it sucks you lose all your valuables etc….. then it happened me last week.     So maybe I’m weird but once it happened I realized oh wait nothing happened I literally have nothing to steal in the car then I realized “who is keeping valuables in their car and what are they”? I have heard of stereo systems getting stolen but I’ve also never met anyone with one of those.     Getting you car stolen sucks getting it broken into? Kinda not a big deal. I had a lighter and a disposable vape taken. Obviously still a pretty uncool thing for whoever did it and not a fun thing to wake up to. But it really isn’t as a big of deal as people made it sound.     Obviously I sound crazy and let me be clear still a crime and still not cool. But it was about the same level of irritation as like a neighbor letting their dog shit in your yard	1642783973.0	s9f6mz	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9f6mz/i_dont_get_why_getting_you_car_broken_into_is_as/	I don’t get why getting you car broken into is as big a deal as people make it sound

bihfx1bz	Just hear me out. I know it’s not actually but there are many similarities. Parents are actually kids that have been “murdered” by society and responsibility. Because they now miss the fun, they try to get revenge by making their kids get the same way like how the animatronics stuff the night guards in the suits to be like them. We as kids try to hide from them because we don’t agree with them, don’t want our “life” to be murdered. The parents “killer” are life problems(the way school is made, social norms, etc. They were forced to be a certain way and now learned to do the same with the kids(“programed”). Like when the ghosts of the kids confronted the killer, some parents try to confront these problems . For a while, it is changed, but after those parents are gone, it comes back, like when Afton says “I always come back”. In security breach, we have an ally, Freddy, who I think could be a family friend of some sort, like an uncle, aunt, cousin? They try to help us as kids be different from our parents and fix the problems once again.

oaby1vd	Spoilers for Dinsey Pixar's: the Incredibles.  &#x200B;  Early on in the movie, Bob (Mr. Incredible) saves a man who had comitted suicide by throwing himself off a building. Said man then sues Bob on the grounds that he "didn't want to be saved" and this would be the domino who's knock on effect would cause super heroes to become outcasts. While i'm aware this is a kid's movie and that this serves as a means to get the plot rolling, this has bothered me for as long as I was old enough to grasp the situation.  Was Bob suppose to let the man die? Any form of suicide is awful, but that one especially due to not only the clean up needed, but the emotional scarring it can have on passerby. Really think about this: the guy didn't sue Mr. Incredbile for breaking his bones or property damage, he did it because (and I quote) he "ruined \[his\] death!"  Bob's powers include super strength; he can't fly and so put his life as risk to leap over and save the man. But no, "supers" are menaces that needs to be abolished! Ok, lets look at what Mr.Incredible did earlier that same day:  * Stopped a bank robbery * Helped an old lady get her cat down from a tree * with the help of elastigirl, stops an armed mugger * Attempts to stop super villain: Bomb Voyage (Super villains exist btw) and is only unable to do so because he- * STOPS A CHILD FROM BEING BOMBED!  And he's being judged by both the court and the court of public opinion for saving a man from ending his own life? Also, while we're on the subject: Mr. incredible was sued by the people of the train he attempted to save. Nah you're right; he should have done nothing, let it carine off the bridge as i'm sure that would have ended WAY better.  &#x200B;  Also, Mr. Incredible and his family save the town of people who to this day see people like him and his family as outsiders.  &#x200B;  Like if you want to hold said supers more accountable, sure. But to abolish arguably one of the greatest assets the city has over criminals and SUPER-VILLAINS: people who have significant power over the populis and chose to use it for good because elements out of their control ended negatively is baffling.	1642773819.0	s9bfv4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bfv4/mr_incredible_did_nothing_wrong/	Mr Incredible did nothing wrong.

bmmha634	Food banks bad, Food PANTRIES good. As a certified poor person with lots of hungry teens to feed, everyone is all like, “Go to the food bank.” But the quality of the food is horrible.   Food banks advertise that they can produce a certain number of pounds of food per dollar donated, but at what cost? My dog won’t even eat the meat product (think far worse than Spam), and he’s not picky. A very minor food allergy in the home means that 3/4 of us can not eat 3/4 of the food. I give it away, of course, or make for guests, or just feed it to that one hardy soul, but I feel bad for “being choosy”, even though it is necessary.   Food pantries, on the other hand, give out actual produce, which is the most expensive thing to buy, and the most important for health. That is something that helps, a lot. I don’t mind picking out the bad apples or freezing something so that it won’t go bad before I can use it. And the other food items at the pantry are actual food, for people, not “food flavored product” that was produced as cheaply as possible, and is not actually edible or nutritious or even safe for most of us.	1642774632.0	s9bpwa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9bpwa/food_banks_are_bad/	Food Banks are bad

However not all psychopaths are serial killers, they are not all like Ted Bundy, or what the movies portray them to be. Many of them claim to not be interested in violence and their actions match that statement.   Many of them due to their stunted emotional range are well suited for jobs that would deplete a typical person, such as a soldier, homicide detective, or surgeon.   And I don’t know about you but if I was having brain surgery I would want someone who would not be perturbed by their emotions if something goes wrong during the procedure.

1tx512p2	To be clear, I don’t think that a 70-180 minute movie isn’t a good length, or that stories can’t be told in that time. If anything, the constrictions of the medium often has made the story better because things need to be edited out and contained in a self enclosed context. So the length of movies we’ve become accustomed to is by no means super flawed or something that needs to change.   However, as the stories artists try to tell become bigger, more complicated, with wider casts of interconnected characters and plot lines, especially ones based on ridiculously expansive material such as comic book movies, that time frame just doesn’t work anymore. Although mini-series don’t bring in the revenue of movies, and don’t have nearly the industry to be build upon, if movie-quality time and effort were put into them, there would be more stories available for telling and worlds available for building.   I don’t think this will change because the film industry is pretty cemented, but even stuff like filming several movies simultaneously to make sequels more cohesive and releasing them separately seems like a step towards a new kind of media, in between tv shows and movies	1642775711.0	s9c3xa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9c3xa/movies_are_too_short_to_tell_the_stories_people/	Movies are too short to tell the stories people want to see these days

2akz56e	It's absurd that YouTubers and TikTokers monetize trash content aimed at kids which encourages them to go out and destroy things, like school bathrooms, city property, etc. Not only should content creators not be able to make money off these posts, local governments should fine these content creators as a disincentive, and potentially pursue criminal charges for especially dangerous content.   The other day I was out for a walk and I saw a boy (around 10 years old) bashing his scooter against a public trash can, hard enough to dislodge it from where it had been hung. He was unattended, but with a group of peers, and as I got closer he did it a second time, so I asked him why on earth he'd do that. The kid was actually very polite and told me it was a challenge from his favorite YouTuber, and how funny that person is, blah blah blah. I told him that person makes money off of those videos, but when he repeats those actions, all he gets is a broken scooter, while destroying something meant to keep our city clean. I doubt what I said had much of an impact, but it's really frustrating that what seems like a nice little kid can be influenced into such destructive behavior, because these videos are so prevalent, which normalizes this kind of thing.

e2hhsmf7	Pop artist are products organized by category and rotated periodically to cover the range of demographics ages 2-72 and it’s even got gender categories. Some are more memorable than others and although music can reach you in many more ways than the local record store and originate from legitimately gifted folks’ living rooms these days much of it holds true IMO. They throw knockoffs at us and some of the lazy/formula-missing efforts are hilarious and repulsive.  Ex.  Take what your local rock/alternative station threw at us in the 90’s - even commercial one’s that were genuinely trying to bring real alternative options to the airwaves. WFNX in Boston comes to mind.   So hear me out. Epic had Pearl Jam’s Ten so Atlantic had to have one of those new things over there and scrounged up STP and it went downhill from there. Interscope sharted out Bush with a handsome front man who’s forced, gravel-voiced utterings and intentionally odd/unrelated sentence fragments for lyrics under the guise of a beautiful tortured artist brought us to the basement of the hierarchy of the 90’s house of mainstream rock just what, 4 years in?   However if Bush was a shart in the basement then Geffen actually China Syndromed the foundation a hundred feet deep and released a hundred foot long, open-air shit in it with Counting Crows by openly antagonizing the listener - I Am The Rain King - He screamed! Yes outright SCREAMED at the listener!  Ahem the record company has informed me that my character is to be thought of as a poet. So I will insist the listener now call me a name oh-so similar to, you guessed it, an overrated try hard from days of yore!The Lizard King. Reselling a warmed over and ham-handedly, thrown together Tupperware version of an overrated yet memorable persona should be subtle not screamed. Geffen even got the formula wrong by sanding any suggestion of edge off the music and inserted some of the most contrived, Fisher-Price lyrics and imagery since the monkees.   Pick your product - you want shocking females? Let’s start off dunno 70’s? Patti Smith’s barely tempered madness becomes Maddona flopping around on the floor becomes Liz Phair’s lyrics on Exile in Guyland becomes Lil Kim’s whole persona becomes Nikki Minaj and her troop of current Kim clones. Just trot new versions out every 7-10 years or so and catch the next wave of consumers passin on by thru their demographic. It’s all so formulaic.   Sporadically there are exceptions - some spectacular, genuine and authentic. RUN/DMC/J  kicked a door open that had been created by hyper-talented predecessors just a few years ahead of their time but too far ahead for the mainstream.

Yes I will acknowledge there are problems to the prequels, but way too many people have Nostalgia goggles whenever they make these critiques about the prequels and the original trilogy. Both of them have awkward dialogue at times especially in their Premiere movies.

8d0oxa1c	I’ve been a professional oldest sister for 25 years now and I just have to say. The amount of oldest siblings/oldest children I see saying essentially the equivalent of they don’t want any part in helping with their younger siblings is baffling to me. I helped raise my siblings especially as I got older and became an adult myself and it just wasn’t that bad, I’m not saying it should go so far as raising your siblings but if your parents need your help stop being little assholes and just help them without complaining about it. It’s really going to be okay if you watch them for a few hours while your parents do things they need to do, it’s just not that big of a deal if you have to make a few meals in your life for your siblings, or if you have to drive them to school. They will bitch about helping their siblings in any capacity and then wonder why their siblings want nothing to do with them later on.  And to clarify I’m not saying you should be doing the parenting of your siblings but helping should not be as big of an issue as it’s become for older siblings, you’re parents don’t have to pay you, your parents don’t have to go to extra lengths to get your help it’s just selfish. You should not be cooking every meal every single day, you shouldn’t be caring for them while your parents lay around, and if they’re going on dates and things you should be paid but if they ask you to watch them for 2-3 hours while they grocery shop is it really going to kill you?	1642780299.0	s9dsd5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9dsd5/you_have_a_responsibility_to_help_as_the_oldest/	You have a responsibility to help as the oldest sibling

3551d6xv	Don’t get me wrong, I know money isn’t everything, but a huge part of everyone’s life is controlled by money, and how much of it we have and are able to spend. The mentality that a job you love which pays significantly less than a job you hate, is better than living an unhappy work life, sounds illogical imo. Yes, your quality of life matters and you should be able to enjoy your work life to some extent, but this doesn’t mean you should sacrifice the potential to live a financially stable life. In the long run, if you worked the high-paying boring job, you’d have more than enough money to live off and from there it probably would be fine to leave the job and pursue your own interests, but going straight for a low-paying dream job that won’t cover all your expenses, seems foolish.	1642780983.0	s9e1o0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e1o0/having_a_job_you_hate_but_you_earn_a_gooddecent/	Having a job you hate, but you earn a good/decent living from it, is better than having your dream job and not making enough money to live at all
3qkq70lu	Before I start, I want to point out this isn't advice.  I'm so happy I never got to ask her out. Of course, there was still the pain of realizing she was taken, but I missed out on the fun of social activities because I was so focused on her. When I was with friends, my mind constantly shifted to her. I did well in school, but I feel like I could have done even better if I never had a crush. Even if I asked her out, the distractions would still be there. If I got rejected, I would be distracted by the heartbreak; I was not a good sport when it came to being comforted.  Another reason why I am so happy is that it helped me develop new insight into how the dynamics of a relationship work. My crush and I had many things different from each other, but I was only in love because I "felt" it. I loved affection, but that doesn't tell a lot when it comes to the actual character. Now that the high school years are behind me, I can say for certain that I can reenter the dating world with a new perspective on how a relationship is supposed to work.  Everyone says that having a crush feels awesome, and adults regret not asking out. The latter is exactly what I mean when I say having a crush is painful. The confusion, the fear of rejection, and the disappointment from those whose relationships didn't work out. If you married your high school sweetheart, awesome. I'm saying that having a crush shouldn't be as glorified as it is, and it should be more widely accepted to stifle these feelings if one wishes to do so.	1642781142.0	s9e3qf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9e3qf/the_feeling_of_having_a_crush_is_so_painful_and_i/	The feeling of having a crush is so painful, and I wish I never had one in high school.
wikv3	I’ve been downvoted to hell for this in comments but like a Bat out of Hell, I return with this take.  I find American Pie to be the most annoying, whiny, self gratifying waste of 8 whole minutes of radio airplay. It’s one of the only songs I’ve ever heard that never once grew on me.   If radios really want to play 8-12 minutes of one song, then they should just play any of Meat Loaf’s epics (I’d do anything for love, Paradise by the dashboard lights).

7ha5i8u4	So this weird ass opinion clicked into my head about a week ago. I remember all my life hearing stories from friends family and on the internet about how shitty it is getting you car broken into it’s scary it sucks you lose all your valuables etc….. then it happened me last week.     So maybe I’m weird but once it happened I realized oh wait nothing happened I literally have nothing to steal in the car then I realized “who is keeping valuables in their car and what are they”? I have heard of stereo systems getting stolen but I’ve also never met anyone with one of those.     Getting you car stolen sucks getting it broken into? Kinda not a big deal. I had a lighter and a disposable vape taken. Obviously still a pretty uncool thing for whoever did it and not a fun thing to wake up to. But it really isn’t as a big of deal as people made it sound.     Obviously I sound crazy and let me be clear still a crime and still not cool.

4zh37eb	Activision Blizzard's CEO is Robert Kotick. Robert Kotick was an (alleged) associate of Jeffery Epstein, a financier and convicted sex offender who ran a pedophile ring on his private island. Robert Kotick's name is on Epstein's black book. It should come as no surprise then that Activision Blizzard has a very toxic work culture. Notable examples of Activision Blizzard's abusive culture includes low pay starting at $12 an hour, long crunch periods of having to work at least 10 hours a day for seven days with no overtime pay and turning a blind eye to constant sexual harassment such as one individual who signed all his emails with "1-800-ALLCOCK".   Even with the toxic work culture aside (or maybe because of?), Activision Blizzard's major franchises have been waning over the years. Call of Duty's latest title was down 36% in the UK and it seemed that sales were on the decline for years. Meanwhile, world of warcraft's popularity has also been declining as well with the latest expansion "shadowlands" been described as polarizing by many players. Warcraft III reforged and diablo 2 resurrected has also been negatively received due to false promises, poor design choices, with Warcraft having a hostile user agreement and diablo having major technical problems for online multiplayer.   Microsoft has the ability to purge the horrible work culture, revitalize call of duty and world of warcraft, bring back many of Activision Blizzard's older franchises and continue to expand xbox gamepass. Call of duty doesn't need to have annual releases and can become relevant again. Microsoft can bring in fresh blood for world of warcraft's development teams and reinvigorate the community. Toys for Bob (owned by Activision Blizzard) can work on other Microsoft owned properties like commander keen or even something original. Obsidian entertainment (owned by Microsoft) could work on a starcraft or warcraft rpg.  So for Sony and Playstation owners, they benefit from this too. It's high time that Playstation be given true competition. The ps1/2/4 have dominated their respective generations. Every generation, Sony has received timed/full exclusives with the ps2/4 in particular steamrolling the competition. Sony will need step up to compete with Microsoft. Make new franchises, develop their version of gamepass, introduce new console features to stay relevant.	1642784674.0	s9fggv	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9fggv/microsoft_buying_activision_blizzard_was_the_best/	Microsoft buying Activision Blizzard was the best thing that could happen for game developers and gamers (even ps4/5 owners)

And they get violent, throwing tantrums when they are finally asked to move out.   Sometimes the back story is that the parents spoiled them since they were little and they never learned to function like an adult.   Parenting is essentially preparing kids ready to get out on their own and make their own living. Well the parents never taught them how to do that by spoiling them, not setting boundaries, tec.

4e2hj82m	Oftentimes you hear people say "if x company can't afford a living wage, they shouldn't be in business." This is a very short sighted opinion, because this puts dozens if not hundreds or even thousands of people out of work, which usually means their effective wage is now $0. If your response is "well those unemployed people can just find another job that pays a living wage", then why can't they do this with the business still open and operating. If you're really concerned about people making a living wage, then you shouldn't be hoping for their work to close.	1642790493.0	s9hofb	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9hofb/people_care_more_about_harming_employers_than/	People care more about harming employers than they do with helping employees.

4ljsq7kg	This comment got a LOT of hate in another subreddit, where I was cursed at, belittled, and downvoted like crazy. So I thought it would be perfect here!  The main argument against this POV was that it is unethical for a spouse to ask their partner not to move on (and I agree to a certain extent) however the spouse who asked for this IS NOT what we are discussing.   If you make a promise of celibacy to your spouse, regardless of the situation, and you FULLY INTEND on keeping it at the time - you are in the wrong for going back on your word unless a significant amount of time has passed (upwards of at least 3-5 years) and you have given considerable consideration to the implications of breaking your vow.  1. How will this affect you emotionally? (Guilt is a heavy burden)  2. What are your religious beliefs? If you believe in an afterlife where you will meet again, it becomes a legitimate betrayal. It is your responsibility to live your religious beliefs like they are true.  3. Will this affect future romantic partners? Constant comparisons to a deceased spouse can be quite painful to an undeserving third party.  The only way out of this, IMO, is if you were lying at the time you gave your word. You did it to make your spouse happy, but you hoped one day to move on when you said it. This avoids the pain of points 1 and 3, but leaves you open to interpretation for point 2. It is also morally sketch, but that isn't the topic at hand.  People were particularly upset that I believe this to be true, even if the request was made on a person's death bed. They thought it unfair to ask such a thing during a vunerable time, which is not untrue. However, if you have the INTENTION of following through when giving your word, it is important to keep it.  Or at least honor it by holding a respectable mourning period.  As a side note: I am not a moral absolutist. Meaning OFC I think there are exceptions to this rule (literally listed a few). Please don't comment w "what if the vow was made at knife point" or "what if the person making them promise was abusive." Obviously there is nuance to the world.	1642790959.0	s9huas	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9huas/people_shouldnt_move_on_romanrically_after/	People shouldn't move on romanrically after promising their dead loved one they won't

55fnfe8k	Imagine you're hanging out at a friend's place, or over at a date's house, or at a dinner party, or whatever. Nature calls, and you blow up the toilet. Clogging ensues. There's no plunger, so you have two options (1) leave it, hoping you don't get blamed and forcing someone else to clean your mess or (2) admit to your crime and ask the homeowner for a plunger. Both are sh\*tty options.  Thankfully I've never actually been in this situation myself, and I think most of us know how to not clog a toilet. But it does happen by accident and I've definitely had this thought when unloading outside my own apartment.

c6m1y3bn	I noticed that it become quite a common  trend for some YouTubers to buy all kinds of stuff like expensive electronics, food, everyday items, cars or even a whole house to only destroy it in order to get viral.

In my opinion it is not only gives the bad example for the young people (Yeah, I know..

The fact that some of those people who been involved in such an activities later got into some campaigns like tree planting or sea cleaning won't redeem them in my eyes.

5qkh89ho	I preface this by acknowledging that I am guilty of this myself.   I see so many people trying to assign meaning to almost everything. Even going as far as fabricating things to get upset about (might be why subreddits like these exist).   People contemplate the meaning of life, they take on and internalize certain characteristics because someone else did it, and as we know, misery loves company.   People are outraged by a flight delay or sitting in traffic, whether someone holds the same beliefs as they, whether they like the same food, whether someone agrees or disagrees with their sexual preference etc.   Modern society has become a soft, fleshy, and fat shell of its former self. I'm not condoning any past prejudice behavior, society has evolved in a lot of good ways for the most part, but a side effect of that has been society turning to cookie dough.   Its easy to be outraged and question the meaning of life when there are no real problems in modern society. For the most part, if you cannot afford food, the government will help, if you don't have a roof over your head, there are shelters, you don't have to worry (for the most part) about getting killed by some predator roaming around.   Contemplating the "meaning" of life becomes a lot harder when there is absolutely no food available with winter approaching and not having any shelter.   Ancestors spent months on boats, being malnourished, dying of all sorts of diseases that now have cures, while modern society gets their undies in a bunch when the drive thru gets their order wrong.   I'm grateful for modern society but I can't help but think that the world would be a better, more fun place if we had a more old school, tough as nails, kill a rattlesnake with your teeth, gravel in the guts, no padded corners society.

akoko58x	This movie ruins so bad the meaning and rythm of the series I'm so sad.   The point of the movies is that they are only toys but they are so bonded and caring for each other as a gang it doesn't really matter if they're played with.  (Massive explications incoming)  When Andy gives the toys to Bonnie at the end of TS3 it is deep because Andy has grown up and doesn't "need" these toys anymore. But, he wants them to still be loved by someone, and still have a use. He'd rather know them in good loving hands rather than in the bottom of a box for years . The ending is really emotionnal and couldve easely been the ending of everything.  But no, the 4th movie comes in dares make us believe that "ok guys so Bonnie actually doesn't care about Woody and the others and she'd rather play with a stupid trash fork", also, Woody being Woody, tries to prove that fork that he can be a real toy if Bonnie sees him as one. So i'm not gonna lie I'm not fund of this character but at least his connection with Woody makes sense. But while you are gonna tell me "well you said it it doesn't matter if they're played with", the way 4 just puts it there like it's normal while TS3 ending was so uplifting just doesn't work with me.  But now you're gonna tell me that a pretty stupid looking and mean doll is gonna try to ruin all their plans booh and guess what ? I'm sure this character had more screentime than Buzz and Jessie combined. It's. So. Depressing.   Don't get me started on the ending. I do not accept it. Woody wouldn't leave all the others just for Bo Peep. Why ? Because while I love her, and her whole "strong independant woman" arc, we see Woody basically giving up on her in previous movies. She followed her way, that's all. He should have more reasons to be "in love" with Jessie than Bo peep who would only been that good old' partner. Having the single thought than Woody might not ever see Buzz or Jessie is, no. This is not real. You cannot tell me this movie was thought about beforehand and is not a massive cash grab over a popular franchise.  I feel like I need to end on the obvious point that despite my so low love for this movie, it is only my opinion and I am open for discussion, it's the point afterall.	1642798756.0	s9ks8s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9ks8s/toy_story_4_sucks_and_shouldnt_exist/	Toy Story 4 sucks and shouldn't exist

The movie provides several clues that Mike and Augustus’s families are well-off too. Charlie is the only one from a poor family. A loaf of bread to split along six people in his house is considered a “banquet.” All he eats every day is cabbage water because his mother can’t afford anything better.    He’s offered $10,000 (nearly $70,000 in today’s dollars) for a piece of candy that would turn his family’s life around and out of poverty.

Vietnam, Korea, the Middle East, Syria, and they're preparing for a battle in Ukraine.

4o2e6rrn	It started with David After Dentist. Any medical facility that releases a patient from their facility, while patient is still altered mental status from drugs that they administered, is wildly irresponsible. Friends and family who record their loved ones, inside a medical facility (Where privacy is expected and mandated by law for the providers), while they are talking nonsense because they are delirious from anesthetics, for social media points, are acting very selfishly.

42ozdoec	My partner always tells me to shut the door to the bathroom if we’re showering so that the steam will stay trapped in the room - thereby making it warmer when we step out. I’m willing to oblige, but personally I love the feeling of stepping out of a hot shower and suddenly being cold. Therefore I leave the door open when showering alone. Something about the juxtaposition of going from super warm to freezing cold is a great feeling for me.

No thank you, I'll just watch it at home where I can adjust the volume and pause whenever I need to pee.  Seriously, movies do not need to be this long. I watched all the Paranormal Activity movies the other day and they slowly kept getting longer and longer while simultaneously getting more and more boring.

GOTTEM" one liner that instantly obliterates and destroys the OP's argument. Or how in the other Reddit thread above, you have the argument that androids aren't for poor people, and then people in the comment section just reply "you must have an android lol, keep coping being poor while I use the superior apple device!!111!" or "found the peasant" without ever actually reading the contents of the post itself, and formulating an argument based off of that.  Just saying it out loud sounds fucking ridiculous. I mean seriously?

zpqxj	For well over a decade I've always seen people left and right complain about YouTube and ads. Especially now since they've increased the "skippable" ads from 5 seconds to 15 seconds.  It's pointless to get upset over having to watch a skippable ad though on a free platform, especially if you're not going to complain about the fact that there are streaming services out there that we pay for and still have to watch 2-3 minutes of unskippable ads, multiple times throughout even just one episode.  Now I get that these companies may use these ads to help keep costs down on subscriptions, but hear me out;  While I understand that no one likes ads whatsoever being thrown in their face when they're trying to enjoy something, I think that it's good to take a step back and remember that you're being shown ads that you can skip, on a website that is free to access nearly all of it's content, and that these ads (while not a whole lot) do also help pay these creators that you enjoy watching so you can continue to get more content from them and sustain the website that they call home. There's a lot of pros to YouTube's ads opposed to cons.  Now, the real enemy that people should be upset about, is paid for streaming services that you have ads that you can't skip.  I was watching a single episode of a show last night and had 4 ad breaks in the span of thirty minutes, all 1 minute and 30 seconds to 2 minutes long. I pay monthly for this service and still have to watch ads? In total I watched this show for maybe three to four hours last night. I spent between (roughly) 48 to 64 minutes total watching ads (the same ads at that) within the span of me watching my show. How is this not what people are complaining about instead??  Now while I get that most streaming services offer a version that doesn't have ads for a higher cost a month, it still feels bad that I'm paying this company each month to watch a few select things and am still being hit with ads that I can't skip for two minutes per ad break, with 3 to 4 ad breaks per 30 minutes.  So, all in all, when people complain about YouTube having upped their skippable ads to 15 seconds from 5 seconds before you can skip the ad, it just feels immensely stupid to complain about. It feels privileged and selfish to have any quarrels against considering the other streaming services that are out that that make us pay for them and give us no option to skip an ad. I think we should be grateful for YouTube's ad's when you compare them to other streaming services.  Feel how you want about YouTube itself and the people who are over it, because I'll admit that the company itself isn't the greatest company in the world, but they've given us this free to watch platform where we can find people we love to watch, that gives those people a place to create a career to continue to create free content for us to watch.  I'll gladly take a 15 second ad multiple times throughout a video to enjoy the entire website for free.	1642804240.0	s9mvay	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9mvay/complaining_about_ads_on_a_free_video_streaming/	Complaining about ads on a free video streaming service like YouTube is pointless when really we should complain about ads on streaming services that we pay monthly for, like Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, etc.
6qhtpwtm	 I saw a post where some women were talking about how birth control pills give them flare ups and messes up their cycle, and then the topic of how women are the only ones putting in the work in terms of pregnancy prevention came up.   These said individuals then suggested that men should get vasectomies done to lessen the "burden" on them. I empathise with them, and believe me that if there was a pill that men could take to prevent pregnancy, they'd take it in a heartbeat. But getting a vasectomy is equivalent to getting your tubes tied. And for most men, that's not an option. Especially, for people who people who plan on having kids in the future. I know it's reversible, but that may come with its own complications.	1642807463.0	s9o26k	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9o26k/you_cant_compare_getting_a_vasectomy_to_taking/	You can't compare getting a vasectomy to taking birth control pills

55mkqke8	And it shows how psychologically fucked many of us are down to our core.  How engrained are we in our consumerism that the only way we can give to those less fortunate is to buy something for ourselves and let some charitable organization receive a tiny kickback of the profits?  "If you buy this (Insert Item Here), we'll donate 5/10/20% of the proceeds to (Insert charitable organization here.)"  And then people have the audacity to talk about how they are helping out or doing their part when it is purely ego driven consumerist narcissist bullshit.  So I'll end with a solution. If you really want to help out, put your money and your time where your mouth is.  Go out and help the less forunate directly, donate directly to vetted outreach programs that are legitimate non profits, do a good deed for a stranger without putting it up on social media to be a fucking karma whore. Go volunteer at a soup kitchen, a veterans program, a care facility, an animal shelter. I could go on but I think you get my drift.  Those people are the real heroes. Not you with your special bracelet, or your new T-Shirt, or your 200k tik tok followers who watched you give 20 bucks to a stranger who is down on his luck. You are not a good person and no one should give a fuck that 2.00 of your purchase towards yourself went to someone who needed help.  I hate businesses that use these tactics to lure in buyers, I hate people that buy into it and act like they are suddenly a good person, I hate that we have accepted "Better than nothing" because people are selfish shitheads, and most importantly; I hate you for disagreeing with me.	1642810936.0	s9pbcm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9pbcm/i_dont_care_if_its_better_than_nothing_people_who/	I don't care if it's better than nothing.

c2klgjw6	I’m not American so I learned about her scandal at about the same time that I learned what legacy students are and I gotta say that as an outside looking in, it seems like both are really unfair (to other students), but one isn’t necessarily worse morally than the other  That’s why I think it was really unfair how she was singled out and attacked when rich kids all over the country have a huge advantage and everyone is somehow fine with that  So as I understand it “legacy students” are by default more likely to get in and if their parents also donate large amounts of money to the school it’s common knowledge that the kid will get accepted.  What Lori Loughlin did was illegal since she BRIBED people, I get that. But morally I don’t think it’s any worse than the system that is already in place and I don’t understand why people were so upset with her. It seems misguided to hate on one person when there are countless other rich people who also unfairly get their kids into university.

4wmoegib	I hate how 3D animation has taken over the animation world for children. It makes things look cheap, and feel less realistic. Not everything in life has rounded edges.   I just saw a trailer for a remake of The Little Vampire, which was one of my favorite childhood movies. But the thing is they botched the script, and the movie hadn't aged that much anyway. So like, why? Even after a short clip I felt like my head had been inflated.   What we don't need is children's programming being made so cheaply. Give something some quality, send it to a theater. It does no good to mass produce entertainment that has no wit for audiences of any age, because it will never be revisited time and time again, it will not grow with the viewer. No child understood the full extend of Lilo and Stitch, but watch it again now. It's like the fast fashion version of tv.   I understand that not all things can be works of art. But we are feeding some of the fastest produced with the least amount of though to our youngest and most moldable generation. And for what? It's not like there's not plenty of quality content out there for them. So 3D animators and script writers and producers and funders and Netflix: just stop. Or do better. No more half assed productions, not for the children.	1642813056.0	s9q1n4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9q1n4/3d_animation_needs_to_be_stopped/	3D animation Needs to Be Stopped

Yes, a car is a much larger investment and most people (myself included) can't pay the amount a car costs in one go, but that doesn't fundamentally change the definition of what it means to buy something. You are renting the car, until such time as you have rented it enough that the price you have paid is the price it costs, then and only then have you bought a car.

653p3vz6	I still think he's a good actor with a great sense of humor, and I enjoy the films he has been involved in, but I recently found out something a bit odd about him.  I just got into the Sopranos, and I'm a boob guy, so I looked up nudes of Aida Turturro (Janice Soprano) and found a few (they're quite nice, actually.) And I had discovered that Aida's jugs had been displayed on the silver screen in a 1998 film called "Illuminata"  And this film had been directed by her brother, John Turturro. And in this film, he directed a scene where his sister got groped and had her nipples sucked by her character's love interest.  Now, call me crazy, but I think that's a little creepy. He gave the greenlight on that, and was probably present when that particular scene was shot. I haven't seen the film, but I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume that that wasn't a scene that HAD to be shot for the film to make any sense. I'm glad it happened, because her tits are quite nice, however the circumstances under which they were exposed were rather dubious.

5hgr8xam	As a fan of video games, I am extremely concerned with the direction the industry is heading.  My main point of conversation is the quality of video games on launch. I won't even be touching on many of the other commonly talked about gripes, such as micro-transactions.  I loved when a game released and that was it. No updates, no DLC, no patches. What you bought is what you got. This in itself is not an entirely unpopular opinions. I've seen many others share the same sentiment. This sentiment usually follows on the heels of a massive flop of a release like Cyberpunk 2077, or more recently Battlefield 2042. I strongly hold the opinion that releasing a broken shell of a game and then fixing it later is not only and extremely poor practice, but close to morally wrong. It's a major pitfall of the industry today.  **The way that I show this belief is in never buying a game, no matter how improved it is, if it was released in shambles.**  This is the major double standard that gaming as a whole has. Games can be released in a horrible state (FF14 and No Man's Sky) and then be praised by journalism and gamers later on as the "golden standard" or "darling" of gaming. No, the golden standard is a game that releases amazing and stays amazing and you will not convince me otherwise. Developers should not be praised for patching in things that were promised on launch or fixing their mistakes. I came here to talk about this, because seemingly no one is.	1642821353.0	s9spue	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9spue/patching_a_game_after_launch_into_a_goodplayable/	Patching a game after launch into a good/playable game is not praise worthy.

3mnikjlc	It’s the stigma not allowing people with addictions to get treatment, while those exist for alcohol. If someone becomes and alcoholic their family may even just accept it as a personality trait “omg uncle Elmer is such an alcoholic lol” or just try to help them but opiate addicts often get left in the dust and whatever.  The supply of alcohol is regulated, produced by publicly viewable and thus publicly accountable companies who if a product kills someone will be held to account. While opiates have none of this. Resulting in, just like during prohibition, concentrated and stronger versions of the vice to allow more efficient storage and transport. So people wanting the opiate equivalent of sipping a beer or two are forced to do the equivalent of mainlining pure 95% ever clear. This increasing the likely hood of overdose and addiction.  Makes no sense why I’m shamed and called insane for doing 1 or 2 hydro morphone every two weeks or so then even putting it down for months while all my buddy’s who drink damn near daily are seen as normal.

21xkywdk	Okay, iconic soundtracks by Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer and others are good. But hearing them over and over and over again is really boring. And I probably will never understand why moviemakers and other Spider-Man media creators... and all the superhero media creators are so attached to orchestral music.   For example, hear [this classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3jnXxIH_s4). And [this forgotten one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzLflJhtGFs). And especially [this emotional masterpiece](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1g8l0Bbbij8) that made me write this post.

Yeah, I know, that posting YouTube links may be troubling for some people, but they describe everything in the best way.  When I hear rock or especially electronic Spider-Man soundtrack, I imagine myself not just a savior of the city, no... I imagine myself a mutant, a someone pretty... nasty, but nasty in a good, attractive way. And it's very, very sad that we don't see this Spider-Man.

8l9g7wcu	Don’t get me wrong I love winter weddings and would want mine in November or December, but choosing your wedding date for Christmas or New Year’s Eve just comes off conceited.

870qw0ld	Surprise surprise, I work as a college donation caller. It wasn't my first application but it was the one that got back to me and hired me the fastest. I needed a campus job, I took what I could get.  I get it, you absolutely DESPISE being asked to give MORE money to a college you already gave thousands to. But you don't have to donate, and you CAN be put on Do Not Call lists, or removed from the calling list entirely. At least, my college has both of those options. You can also just persist through the asks and they won't call you again until the next billing cycle thing.  Blocking donation caller numbers doesn't make them stop calling you. They just have to keep calling the blocked number.  Being an asshole doesn't make them stop calling you.  Telling them you're "not interested" doesn't make them stop calling you.  Just. Be as polite as you can that day (remember, these are college kids, anywhere from 18-21 at the youngest), ask to be taken off the list or put on the do not call list, and BOOM. No more missed calls from your university asking for money. It takes callers at least a minute to set that up, and then you're done. Calls where you say you won't donate can be 5-10 minutes. If you're busy, let them know.  You'll save SO much headache on both ends.	1642824274.0	s9tmn6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9tmn6/people_need_to_stop_being_so_rude_to_college/	People need to stop being so rude to college donation callers.

They could they be hacked, have slow reaction times and run someone over and/or crash into another car, a mapping error can cause a crash, and to top it all off cars trucks and road based transportation in general is quite possibly the biggest energy waster, money waster, CO2 emitter, and cause of premature unnecessary deaths that this world has ever seen.

No. They all have issues and they’re all bad.

9i6gscem	   tech innovation is exponential and unstoppable unless stopped by the innovators themselves i.e. us humans. Many people say love the planet because it is unique when actually it is not its just another rock among this vast stretch of space unless we include life that is(that may also be abundant but we don't know yet)  to me the fact that we have achieved so much that was by any means impossible to people of the past so I don't think anything is impossible given enough time to learn and implement new scientific methods to achieve it so being protective of the planet doesn't make much sense when there are infinite resources flying around this piece of rock  I also believe that the Great filter may not be nuclear war or AI but actually the fact that we love the planet too much and don't want to leave it  the fact that people still cherish things like gold, silver, platinum when they are virtually abundant in the the universe seems to be the limiting factor for our species  Why cant our monkey brains accept the fact that rather than some people having something and others having nothing is pointless when EVERYONE CAN HAVE EVERYTHING....  So why don't we stop giving a shit about the planet and start using EVERY RESOURCE ON THE PLANET FOR THE BETTERMENT OF EVERYONE  plus the fact that Stephen Hawking once said "humans should leave earth in the next century to survive"  Why cant we just everything go to space and have everything for everyone with billions of planets and stars??  sorry for bad english tho:)	1642826253.0	s9u7kt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9u7kt/there_is_no_point_in_saving_the_planet_when_there/	There is no point in saving the planet when there are infinite out there.

gtso8mp0	Recently, I was given the opportunity to take an extended absence from work, several months, without financial penalty. My wife and I decided it would make sense for me to take advantage of the time and be a SAHP to take care of our child, saving us money on daycare. I was a bit worried because I had heard so many horror stories about how difficult it was to be a SAHP. Every SAHP in our age range (late 20s & 30s) we knew complained constantly about how they never had time to do anything, were unable to keep up with basic chores, were burnt out and exhausted, etc. but I agreed anyway because I was looking forward to spending so much time with my child.  Well after actually doing the job I can now say I firmly believe many of those people complaining are just lazy. I grew up with a SAHP and saw how seriously she took it, so I went into it ready for difficult job. I worked hard at being a SAHP, had plans and goals for every day, kept my kid on a schedule. Guess what? I never had problems keeping up with our household duties or my parent duties. I did 90% of the laundry, grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, errands, scheduling, etc. for me, my wife and our kid and rarely found it hard to keep up with everything. I had plenty of time every day to play with our child, do developmental learning work, and take her on walks or to the park. Some days were tough, but never more so than a hard day at any other job. On top of all that, I never stopped exercising, doing my hobbies or having a social life. If anything, my time for those activities went up.   After thinking about it, I realized the difference between myself and other SAHP was I actually considered it a job, prioritized and held myself accountable, while they just made excuses. I would listen to them complain about having no time to do basic household chores and being “so busy” while they’re sleeping in and wasting half the day on Netflix or shopping. They say they don’t have time to do educational things with their kids or cook for their spouse but they binge reality tv and spend hours having boozy brunches every other day. Really what these people want is to be trophy husbands/wives, not equal partners with their working spouse.   Unfortunately, our society has this idea that SAHP are all martyrs and are above criticism. I’ve seen so many articles about how being a SAHP is equivalent to two or more jobs, how they’re so unappreciated and how you should never criticize a SAHP. Because of this, so many people are afraid to call out their significant other or hold them to any kind of standard. That really sucks because it delegitimizes being a SAHP and makes society look down on it when it should be treated like any other job. I think we need to treat being a SAHP like any other job, and that means calling out those who suck at it.	1642826448.0	s9u9m7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9u9m7/stay_at_home_parent_is_a_real_job_which_means_it/	Stay at Home Parent is a real job, which means it should be subject to real criticism.

igpipihy	Not sure if this is unpopular...  I want to preface by saying I don't hate the content of pop music. In fact, I love a lot of pop songs and pop artists.   The issue is not the music itself, but how how pop music as a whole has evolved. Ever since music has shifted from records to streaming, pop music evolved by mixing genres.  Pop music had another evolution when tik tok became very popular by making very short catchable hooks in snippets of songs. This led to the top 40 being filled with genre-bending one-hit wonders that are moderate until the catchy tik tok snippet comes.  That being said, a lot of amazing songs artists have came through this way, they are fewer and far between though! I do like seeing more independent artists and I do love the experimentation of genre mixing.  But pop music today is becoming less and less about popular catchy songs anymore, it honestly just seems like a completely outdated concept now.  I also want to say that any previous pop music eras are not particularly better per se, I just think today's pop music has transitioned into something else which I personally wouldn't classify as 'pop' music.  I would love to hear your thoughts on this though!

In my the sushi that can be found in my country you will eat ingredients that you'll never find in Japan.

6d5ub82p	First I'm just going to clarify the difference between graphics and art style, with Undertale as my example: Undertale has low-quality graphics, I mean look at it, but the character designs etc are really well thought out, so it has a great art style.  When Pokemon Legends Arceus was first announced, there were murmurings about how the trees didn't look great, and since then there have been other nitpicks when it comes to the graphics, like hisuian voltorb doing a jump that looked a little click-and-draggy.  But if you don't analyse it to the nth degree, this game has always looked like it's going to be beautiful!  I could understand complaints about the animations in Sword and Shield (indeed, this was a bandwagon I jumped in wholeheartedly), because "high quality animations" was the excuse they used for not including the national dex.  But now?  Give it a rest and enjoy yourself.  Yes, I know Breath of the Wild looks better even though it came out on the Wii U.  Yes, I know graphics that are pleasing to the eye can add to the magic of a game.  But I heard few of these complaints before the Sword and Shield controversy, and I heard NONE of them before the franchise transitioned to 3D.  Arguably back then, the graphics were lagging behind the rest of the gaming world even more than they are now, but the art style was so good that it didn't matter.  So let's realise what we're talking about here when we complain about 3D sprites - archeops's 3D sprite isn't badly rendered, its movements are fluid.  Not a graphical issue.  However, its feet now dangle pathetically, exposing it's big beige belly, decreasing the overall colourful effect of the original design.  THAT... is an art style problem!  And the new mon designs being over-designed?  Having listless expressions/poses?  Art style problem!  One that doesn't seem to be getting better.  The new leaked designs are awful to be honest.  When playing pokemon, how often have you thought "Yeah, Generation Blah was such a good gen because the trees were really well rendered"?  Pokemon is about the story, the gameplay, the world-building, and befriending amazing creatures.  Any graphical imperfections people have spotted in Legends Arceus aren't noticeable enough to impact your enjoyment of the game as long as you don't over-analyse it.  Overall, the game looks beautiful, except for the designs of the new pokemon, and even that is subjective.  (I've been vague about these designs in this post for spoiler reasons, but ew, I really don't like them.)  Finally, if anyone thinks these are actually popular opinions, let me assure you - I get downvoted on r/pokemon every time I express them.  So I came here, because I felt like whining to a different audience.	1642832145.0	s9vwn5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vwn5/pokemon_doesnt_need_good_graphics_however_the_new/	Pokemon doesn't need good graphics.

bjdmfkr8	Obviously depending on the type of work and the environments you're in make a large role into this, but this is from my personal work experience.  I've been working for a family owned hotel chain with 3 locations in WV for 3 years now, and it's been great. The owners are respectful, caring, and always willing to pay for your work and recognize when you go above and beyond. My starting pay was only $9hr but I was desperate and took it. It was made clear that the housekeeping job was part time, but for employees to get benefits and paid vacation they only need a yearly average of 30hrs per week. On top of this, as long as I was working she'd pay me as much overtime as I was willing to do, with the limit being 12hrs per day. As I was broke I took up that offer and they weren't lying. Within 3 months I was offered a managerial position and given a $1 raise for every position I learned how to do. This gave me a $3 raise in total for learning to supervise, work the laundry room, and run the breakfast bar. I was later pulled to work the Front Desk giving me another $1 raise and then another $1 for taking over the midnight shift as it's hard to find someone to do it. They later opened another hotel and I took over working night shifts at both locations, giving me another raise due to the extra travel. Other than the extra hours when I started, which I only did a couple days a week until my promotion, all I've truly done is the bare minimum of my job and taken the responsibility I've been given.   This leads into the laziness of my colleagues. Housekeeping is simple, you have a checklist of what you're supposed to do and people can't even do that. When we get new people, more often than not they regularly call off, they quit within the first week, or just half ass their job and get mad when we ask them to fix their mistakes. They complain they don't and can't get enough hours when all they have to do is ask for a list of extra cleaning. No one wants to put in the effort to learn extra positions like breakfast and laundry for the pay raise and none of it makes since to me. Whenever we have a snowstorm our owner allows us to stay the night at the hotel so we can still get our hours. She also provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner for us on these days. Yet only management usually stays and then everyone calls off because of weather and complains about losing hours when they finally come back to work. On top of this, the owner gives random raises to any employees she sees doing a good job and not causing issues. A friend who started the same time I did has earned a $1 in raises just because she cleans well and doesn't cause issues with management and other workers. You literally get raises for doing the bare minimum and not being an asshole, this is how low the bar has been set due to the fact we can't get any halfway decent workers.   This is really just a rant, because I'm frustrated with my workplace and the people who work at it. The two hotels I work at won the 1st and 2nd place for guest satisfaction for our brand. The guests that stay are typically business travelers and it is typically really clean. No drug or crime issues for all of my time working there. We have not even received an application for any position in over a month. And we have only hired one worker in the last 3 who has stayed more than a week. It's a really sad state to see things in and it's hurting everyone's moral.	1642832375.0	s9vyo8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9vyo8/i_feel_like_a_lot_of_people_refusing_to_work_are/	I feel like a lot of people refusing to work are just lazy.

d3bg9	Not sure how common this opinion is, I've never seen anyone discussing it.  In the past, you could simply right click an image, any image, and a "Search google for image" button would appear. Sometime during one of the past chrome updates, they removed this button and replaced it with "Search image with Google Lens."  Now, I get it: Google has this cool new technology and they need data and for people to use it. But here's the problem: Google lens (technology designed to bring information relevant to objects *inside* an image) and Google Reverse Image Search (technology designed to find similar images as a whole, and their sources) have two completely different purposes!  If there are images of five people and I want to know what shirt one of them i swearing, I would use Google Lens. If I want to see similar images (e.g more photos of those people, or more images of five-peopled groups), I would use Google Reverse Image Search. *The two are not the same*.  It's not that they "removed" the reverse image technology, but it's a lot less usable now. You need to click on 'search with google lens', scroll *all* the way down just to see the prompt "Didn't find what you were looking for? Retry with Google Images.", and depending on what image you searched, you could be bombarded with [a ton of advertisements](https://i.gyazo.com/17f1ee55bcb01e12536726e60a46549c.jpg) before you get to that button - which is finding similar images, rather than *product advertisements*.  Now, here's the clincher: I have absolutely no use for Google Lens, but I frequently reverse image search, usually for things like researching and to find sources. I understand the uses of Google Lens, and why someone else might use it a lot more, or why I myself might one day use it. But by *forcing* me to use it, you've essentially turned it into a version 2.0 of Google+. It stopped being a nifty cool feature I might use because it's relevant to me, and instead became an annoyance and impediment I completely ignore that slows me down when I'm trying to do something.  It's not like it's even remotely hard to have both services side by side; instead of adding the Google Lens button to the right-click menu, they chose to have it *replace* another feature, and what I could previously do en masse with one click now requires a lot more time overall when you're someone like me who uses such a feature a lot, on a consistent basis.

Maybe some analyst determined that audiences rate movies higher when they don't have to sit with the tension for longer than two minutes, but all the weight of a scene is completely wasted when the rug is pulled out from under you with an unexpected gag.

1xx56e6j	Morality and ethics are largely based in feelings. Sure, it makes sense why those feelings exist. Ancient humans with empathy were able to form larger, more cohesive societies. As a result, they were able to dominate the gene pool. Activity in area 40 of the brain was selected for. But nothing about that is inherently “good” per say  These feelings, which your conscious self has essentially 0 control over, are forces of social cohesion. They compel you to act in society’s best interests, which often diverge with your own. It’s a dog-eat-dog world; that society will not hesitate to tear you to shreds. How many times have you heard of someone being “thrown to the wolves”? Millions on social media eviscerate people for making often forgivable mistakes. Many of them then grandstand about “morality”  Read ethical works by aquinas, aristotle, kant, ross, bochenski, etc. Actually, don’t, if you value your time. There’s so much self-righteous grandstanding. Coupled with attempts to paint doctrines rooted in subjective feelings as objective truths   Sometimes, your best interests align with society’s. Often, they do not. I think in many situations, it’s best to ignore your feelings and make the “unethical” or “immoral” choice	1642840411.0	s9y01l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9y01l/morality_and_ethics_are_often_bad/	Morality and ethics are often bad
5cl0smw8	Not only are they never really encountered.  If you take the example of Pascals triangle:  You don't just compute all the n*(n+1)/2 Pascal triangle numbers in your head and just keep them in working memory.  I mean sure, go ahead. But how good do you think are your arithmetic abilities to catch up with super-exponential growth?   Not only that. As you utilize exclusively your working memory (not short term memory), your hippocampus won't have the occasion to pattern your tendencies and encode them as engrams such that they stick.  You just learn to forget faster.   (Practical example: the students starting exercise sheets 4 hours before deadline, then panicking due to having "forgotten" everything when the exam approaches. Well, duh...)  Sure, maybe some accordingly genetically configured people get to calculate a couple more than others, but never will they be able to calculate up to practically relevant sizes (e.g. when approximating equations or multiplying polynomials) unless they ironically spend good effort into the task of specializing only and only on that task.  Thereby potentially diminishing their performance in other abilities.  You could say well, the ability to quickly cycle through things rapidly without distraction without any training is already an indicator for a certain learning and figuring potential.  But that's not even what mathematicians are doing. If you've ever read about Henri Poincare or Godfrey Harold Hardy, they seldomly worked on problems more than 4 hours at a time (4h deliberate practise seems like a general flat-rate productivity cap).  And surely they weren't at a hurry, since they frequently followed study periods with mundane/basal activities such as going for a walk, letting "their consciousness" figure things out.  Their prolificness and tempo didn't come from them turboing their working pace.  Rather they intricately and diffusely worked out the intrinsic logic to the problem and efficient ways of representation, until figuring out the logic and progressing with problems became as simple as talking about the weather (and there is no point in trying to talk about weather at a 5000 WPM speed. Mental processing speed is expensive and follows a narrow normal distribution).  Next to the fact that quicker specialized processing automatically arises despite normal general perception speed from tightly and very sparsely and efficiently organized neural connections. It becomes "reflexive".  (Food for thought: Everything in some way is logic.  Particle A impacting particle B already encodes an implication. Anything that can be computed/measured, and weighted against a change of its state can be backtracked to a logical representation, with observation self-verifying the statements of the encoding logic.   Therefore, studying a subject focusing on logic should carry over skills to any other perceptional/logical subject.   That's why mathematicans also made good physicists, biologists, chemists, engineers, but someone good at IQ tests barely would make a good freshman math student.)  ...right.   Which opens up the debate wether quickly going through low-level predictable yet overconvoluted patterns can compete with seeing things from a general abstraction and back-tracking their imposed logical patterns as is done in mathematics.  If you look around, and notice a striking difference from a state where mathematics wasn't a thing, you may conclude a clear winner.  Apart from that, you can overconvolute any pattern into sheer absurdity.  I could ask: "If you can solve this sequence of 30 nested arithmetic progressions, you have 200 IQ!"  Or, I could pose the innocent question to finish a number sequence starting with 9 numbers needing a 10th, yet the underlying pattern is a quadribonacci sequence (current number = sum of all 4 preluding numbers).  Good luck.   That not enough: the method of inquiry imposed in IQ tests directly contradicts the way actual mathematics, physics, biology and chemistry e.g. are practised.  In these, patterns are conjured up from fundamental principles based on how linear/nonlinear they behave.  We can perfectly know, in an idealization, what distance s at time t a car with velocity v (negl. air resistance, lol) being constant starting at t = 0 would achieve:  We have a not changing rate over a uniform scale (time, quantized as second), therefore the distance is the velocity cumulated with respect to passed time (as you'd compute an area of a rectangle) i.e. s = v*t.  Simple logic figuring out equally accelerated movement, with higher mathematics taking up all other non-uniform cases.  Now get a high IQer on the task: give them a pattern of 100 measurements of the cars speed (including air resistance, measurement errors, car maneuvring errors, gear shifting) and let them figure out the next number coming at the next time stamp not recorded.  Godspeed. At that point that which makes someone allegedly "smart" degenerates to a gamble, a gamble that would never have been when figuring from abstract and associative/representative reasoning.  In that regard, approaching it from a logical standpoint seems like the most intuitive way rather than succumb to having to be a gambling extrapolation machine.  As a conclusion: if IQ tests claim IQ to be largely stable, what really stays stable is the utter irrelevance and unneccesity and inconsistency of it's design and purpose.  For being a predictor of mathematical ability it sure doesn't have a lot in common with professional mathematics.  It's almost like saying "Knowing numbers and basic arithmetic predicts professional mathematical performance."  Eh... yeah?  That being said, the lifelong stability of IQ is not unfounded: That which has no realistic relevance is seldomly used.  And logic and abstraction perhaps have the greatest relevance for anything perceivable.	1642840659.0	s9y20m	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9y20m/the_only_thing_stable_about_iqs_are_their_testing/	The only thing stable about IQs are their testing methods delivering unneccesarily convoluted and useless, impractical patterns no one explicitly ever encounters, barely even in academia
6m8an	Pinky rings are the worst offender, but I just cannot stand gold jewelry in general. The whole thing about it is "oooh, shiny!" Nevermind the fact that it's generally ugly as hell, nevermind the fact that 90% of it is in poor taste, it's a genuine feeling I have that you're either saying "look at what I can afford" or "my monkey brain likes shiny."  I am not nearly as bothered by silver, or by bracelets or necklaces. I can't explain it. Door knocker earrings are another big offender, and anyone who has one of those rings that's just their name is completely moronic based on experience. I've also never seen a diamond-centric piece and thought "oh, that's nice." It looks like sparkly trash.  I think my repulsion comes from a deep-seated judgmental response. It's an overpriced shiny rock/metal.

Star Wars just taught me to never really take them seriously.  So I’m just going by my subjective opinion and stating that yes Dre Parker and Mr Han outclass Daniel and Mr Miyagi. In story, characterisation, depth, themes and yes even fighting prowess.  I will say Cobra Kai has the benefit of having such a likeable protagonist as Johnny Lawrence and I have a soft spot for his and Miguel’s arc. So they get a bump over the original but we all know a 12 year-old Dre can wreck every single one of those Cobra kai kids in any form of martial arts.   So yeah that’s my two cents.

ig1bxf1z	We all feel, I feel.  We can feel a certain way, but we most certainly do not care.  What matters is how we feel to ourselves but not to others unless this person is the nearest one to you (husband / wife), this is how it should be, since feelings help us to navigate things; pain / pleasure. Be that what cannot be evidenced or something that directly causes this to happen or what is seen between people but not to those outside of a relationship.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  People however, still do not care.  Ask someone for an opinion on your issues inside a relationship, people will only draw from their own experiences and what they have been told by the same method, thus completely biased.  You could never fully comprehend the feeling or truth, however let us say you have both people together discussing their feelings, here a person on the outside looking in serves as a logical processor between two feeling people, the processor needs a result out of the combining energies.  What they do care about is invalidation / validation.  When you are trying to help someone who is in their feelings, never invalidate them, but always lead with reason and an outcome, a direction. These people need direction, they also need to feel safe / listened to, they also need to empirically be lifted from the ground that they fell down to, faith in what they are doing. Give them examples, show them the path. There are people who do not want to be lifted, these people.. are much harder to help.  &#x200B;  However even this process is not from caring about their feelings, it is just validating the feeling, but denying their furtherance as to keep the person down in the dumps.  This happens also with positive feeling where some people cannot stand if someone is having a bad day, they will invalidate them and live in their own feelings as if they are correct.  Emotional immaturity exists on both sides.  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I have experienced life for a long enough time to to know that people do not care about my feelings and I am glad it is this way, because my feelings lead me nowhere and mostly feelings want to comfort themselves, advancement does not come from feelings but from recognizing the feeling, why it has happened and how I can avoid or do better next time.  &#x200B;  Such as deleting my account on Reddit as it sometimes causes me anxiety with so much stupidity, but that's because I am imperfect.	1642847361.0	s9zo3z	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/s9zo3z/nobody_cares_about_your_feelings_other_than_you/	Nobody cares about your feelings other than you.
yx99q	Genetical looks are so much less important than what people generally believe. Many will often blame their failiure with love and life on their genetic looks. This is complete garbage thinking and often just an evasion from the fact that you need to change yourself.  Speaking to men, they will say they can’t get women because they are ugly. The real reason is because you are a loser with a loser attitude. Women care much more about character. That does not mean that you should be a «nice guy». It means be a man! Grow your confidence, charisma, work out, set goals and fight for your life.  Also, physical looks can be done a lot with. Get fit, shave, comb your hair, dress better, stop looking like a zombie in your face. Grow some passion in your life and confidence.   I think most people know that what really is setting them back is their failed mentalities, but if they admit that, then THEY have to change, and not the world. So it’s easier to blame the world for not accepting them.   Take it from me. I used to have this attitude. I thought I was ugly, and I was right. My mentality made me ugly because I had no confidence, dressed horribly, no charisma and a lousy personality. But as I changed myself, I became way more successfull. Now, I’m doing better with women than any of my attractive friends, even though many of them have better genetics. It’s about your character. Confidence!  This applies too for women. And for women it is probably more difficult because men are more judgemental phyiscally. But you can change that too. Dress better, get some charisma and femininity, get fit. If you dyed your hair blue, wear no makeup and are overweight, don’t blame the world, blame yourself.  Looks matter extremely little in this world.

9g2eea1n	  I’ve always been bothered when people said this. It’s patronizing - you don’t know what experiences the person you are talking to has had and you are claiming authority over them, saying those experiences were justified by some divine meaning you seem to be uniquely enlightened. You are also implying that people need to experience bad things to learn or grow. While you could learn or grow from bad things happening doesn’t mean you need them. Saying this you claim authority over someone’s pain and give it a meaning that it doesn’t need. Sometimes things are bad and they don’t have silver linings.  It also reinforces toxic positivity and toughness culture. Not everyone processes trauma the same way, some people never heal from trauma. What doesn’t kill you doesn’t make you stronger - it gives you lifelong mental health issues and may end your life. Many terrible things devastate and destroy peoples lives, and there is no reason or positive side to it. We didn’t *need*terrible events that occurred in history to learn or grow. has real consequences. There is no positive side to someone being raped, abused or tortured.  It comes from a place of ignorance and privilege. While everyone’s pain is valid, saying *everything* happens for a reason you imply that there is a reason that justifies terrible things like severe poverty, natural disasters, terrible cruelty, awful diseases…you may think there is a silver lining to you failing your driving test, and your sadness is valid, but sitting on the back of the thatexperience and  saying there is a universal reason that justifies All bad things is incredibly tone deaf.  It also is disempowering, prevents proper healing/grieving and healthy processing of emotions. You have no agency over what happens, and saying this to someone tells them that their ideas of agency are stupid and pointless. And it completely disregards the fact that spirituality is personal.   Basically people who say that are on a gigantic high horse and don’t realize it.	1642850914.0	sa0k9j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa0k9j/the_phrase_everything_happens_for_a_reason_is_rude/	The phrase “everything happens for a reason” is rude

jxpqi5p	   I don't know how else to say it. You use the "E" word around gamers on Reddit, you'd better be prepared for mass downvotes and even a brigade, but that's exactly what it is.  In particular I'm talking about the huge scandal that is Blizzard releasing FREE content in ALL of their games to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Diablo. How do you think fans react? Take a look at this pathetic trainwreck: [https://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5ltnh2/diablo\_3\_anniversary\_patch\_243\_celebrating\_20/](https://np.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5ltnh2/diablo_3_anniversary_patch_243_celebrating_20/) (That's one thread on Reddit's home for "Quality Gaming Discussion", there was another thread concerning this a while back that was equally garbage.)  So many people legitimately angry that totally free shit isn't to their liking and not only defending their shitty, childish reactions, but getting angry at the audacity of anyone pointing out that it's totally free content for a game that has released a shitload of free updates over the years. How many of them would even have been interested in returning to the game at all to experience the new stuff? I really doubt it's all of them. It's merely another excuse to be angry about something and to follow the circlejerk.  There's some people there (comparatively few, unfortunately) who are just disappointed, and that's totally fine. I'm talking about the people who act like they've been betrayed or "slapped in the face".  I really have to wonder how much time the whiners have put into the game before complaining about this. You'd have to be pretty passionate to be so offended by this free content, and being so passionate, I'd have to imagine you'd already gotten your money's worth. You know, that is if you'd actually bought and played the game rather than just jumped onto the latest hate-jerk bandwagon. What does it take to please people, or at the very least, have them acknowledge that they aren't OWED anything?  And let's talk about a few of the words "gamers" like to use excessively, as though they were magical spells or mantras:  * CONTENT * CONSUMER  I include these two together because they are a brilliant insight into the mind of the average Reddit gamer. "I NEED MORE **CONTENT** TO **CONSUME**". "How can I be expected to pay $20 for the new Necromancer character class when I've only gotten 800 hours out of Diablo 3 so far, and a new class will only give me 100 or so hours more?"  This, to so many "gamers" is:  * ANTI-CONSUMER  There it is. The magic word to make all bad things that scare you and make you uncomfortable go away. Developer releases some DLC for completely free that requires some grinding or a microtransaction to purchase? That must be **ANTI-CONSUMER** because these people now (pathetically) identify primarily as "gamers" and secondarily as "**consumers**". There's a certain kind of self-awareness-but-not-quite there that is really sad. So, if developer does something I don't like, they are **anti-consumer**, and don't you dare try to explain what that term actually means to me or I'll accuse you of loving to have developers "shove anything down your throat and begging them for more". No middle ground. No room for "Maybe it costs that developer money to put this free content out and the people who buy it aren't 'ruining the industry' but funding that free content you want so badly but aren't willing to either play the game or pay for it?"  Which comes down to the uncomfortable reality that so many of these people don't see games as a hobby or a pastime. They see them as not only a way of life, but a *right*. They see that optional DLC that they can "grind" for or pay a few bucks for as "anti-consumer" because they can't wait to consume it but don't want to *play* the game. Yes. We have gamers now who are unwilling to play games because the pleasure-centers of their brains are so over-stimulated that they *need* their next hit sooner, but don't believe they should either have to put any effort or money in to experience it. Rather than take a step back and examine their own behavior and motivations, they lash out against the developer, the publisher or even other gamers in order to resolve their cognitive dissonance.  They don't play games anymore, they *consume content*. I truly don't think they even know why they *want* all of the little free knicknacks other than the fact that they want *all* of the **content** because they can't stand the idea of being "incomplete" or "missing out" (or other players having a shiny skin they don't have). Part of this I blame on achievements.  Looking at the pervasive negativity and toxicity within gaming, they don't even enjoy it a lot of the time, or they have a mutual agreement to complain about it excessively. Why get so angry about a game when you can play another one of the quarter million games out there, most of which are cheap or free?  So many gamers appear to be miserable with the games they play. Even when they say nice things, it's begrudgingly. They just seem to be passing time, consuming their content and then feeding back into their negative circlejerks. This is so bizarre to me and I would donate money to a study into this phenomenon. It's fascinating.  I have another screed about how I think the inability of so many gamers to be happy with most games is because they are burned out on games (or a specific game, remember how Skyrim was almost universally praised but now it's shit all over? Could it be because people played hundreds/thousands of hours of it and now it just doesn't do anything for them because they've done it all 10 times and they want to blame the game rather than their obsession? Or because it's fairly old now and people can't or won't contextualise?) because they are addicted and can't experience the same "highs" anymore, so they blame the games rather than their own destructive behavior, then substitute more "content" for quality which might explain the obsession with "content", but this post is probably long enough.  It's definitely a conversation I'd like to have, though. How do you feel about all of this? **Gamers are acting more like they're entitled to something and childish by the year, and it's impossible to talk to them about it.**	1642852579.0	sa0z69	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa0z69/gamers_are_increasingly_acting_like_theyre/	Gamers are increasingly acting like they're entitled to something and childish by the year, and it's impossible to talk to them about it.

erxpd	I’m sure several people have come across this concept where the handyman tiktoker will dismiss an itemized bud or bill request. I thought if I saw just a few of them do it then it would be an outlier but I see if far too often. These videos wouldn’t pop up as often if people didn’t engage with them which means there are people out their who agree with them.  Just because you are good at something or have done it as a trade for many years doesn’t mean you get to stiff the requesting person with this mentality that they don’t deserve to know what goes into their project. Frankly if a handyman or construction person tells me this then I tell them I’m not interested in using them, and I encourage everybody to be that way.  There are a number of problems that contradict their logic of you don’t need to know what goes into it.  1. What happens if you as a contractor or tradey are no longer accessible to them. Are they just shit out of luck not knowing how many board feet their deck took to build or the route you took the plumbing or what circuit you tied into for the electrical. 2. How are they supposed to gauge or know what products you are using without a formal written out proposal detailing products and amounts. 3. How can they trust that you are doing right by them, which I think it’s by far the most important part.  Those may not be strong arguments to some, but if I’m inviting and paying a person to do work to my home I want to trust them, I want to know how to follow-up with them, and I want to know what was used in order to repair it myself in case the contractor is too tied up with other jobs or MIA. Lastly, with what little the average person knows about these types of things and the infrequent use of contractors means they wouldn’t know any better or that the contractor throws in a whole new set of tools to expense the job out without even telling you.  Here’s the other side of this though, as a consumer, be ready to pay for the labor charge on these bills. I commend guys and companies who break it down all the way to labor because then I know what’s going on. Home improvement or construction projects in general are not easy to complete without the right tools, preparation, and skill set. I will happily pay for all of the above as long as it is straightforward with me. I respect the skill sets that go into trades and the investment of the tools and time getting efficient with them. If they are fast and have done it for years with good results then we should be paying for their efficiency.	1642864366.0	sa4ji5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa4ji5/handyman_estimates_should_include_an_itemized/	Handyman estimates should include an itemized bill including labor.

We wouldn’t treat our partner, parents, grandparents etc… like that, so why is it ok to treat a baby that way?   The baby isn’t learning to ‘self-soothe’, that requires the ability to rationalise and self-regulate their emotions (which take years upon years to learn and utilise), they are giving up trying to communicate because they realise nobody is coming.

Similar to butterflies, they have gorgeous back-and wing patterns. They don't deserve their bad rep because turns out the whole "they eat clothes" is a myth for most species of moth.

It's all panicky and debate, I do have to admit though that the enemies, the bad guys are actually quite cool, especially the Weeping angels.  Only problem is that as soon as The Doctor raise his hand and said "Wait" the enemies just went full dummy.

Like I understand how people, especially my generation need to do this because then you can't get pr easily, (not that it was easier before) but in this present day, this means that you're basically a walking advertisement, regardless where you are. I remember the other day, someone in my uni group chat was promoting their shit ass music and honestly, i was so annoyed, it was like they made their whole personality into a business and it just felt very superficial. But then I'm not innocent either becuase even I have to do that and yet I'm just a writer, and this social media networking stuff, is supposed to help me network with other people in the industry but If im being honest, I haven't noticed any difference whatsoever.

apuiuyc4	Many people like to point at teacher pay as a huge problem in education. However what they do not say is what is too low in pay and what is appropriate for pay. It's a meaningless platitude, 'I'm going to say teachers should be paid more in order to show how much I value teachers.'  Thank god teachers are there to teach kids how to read, write, and do arithmetic. It really is a miracle so many people know how to read. Totally on board with that.  The problem is, if you get into specifics the majority of these people can not hold a conversation. They get defensive. When you ask questions on how much is enough and what would the benefit of paying teachers be, they get super defensive. 'Are you saying they shouldn't be paid more, you anti-intellectual monster who hates teachers?' 'You mean, I have to explain my position? That makes me super uncomfortable, because I haven't looked into this at all. I'm just agreeing with what everyone else says.'  When you ask this person how much teachers should be paid, they have no answer. They always just say more or 'It's a regional issue.' OK, how much should your region pay teachers? Then you're likely to get a non-answer that deflects away from the question.  [On average, public school teachers](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d17/tables/dt17_211.60.asp) get paid equal to or above the mean household income. Mean -household- income. They get paid way more than mean individual income. So it's actually a job that provides an above average pay in most cases. Are there outlier situations that can be rectified in certain counties and cities? Maybe, sure. But on average this isn't an issue in most areas.  Now, what are you saying if you think teachers should be paid more? Are you saying they would teach better if they were paid more? So, in other words, teachers care so little about education of children they're holding back based on how much money they make. I don't want teachers like that. Especially when they make average or above average income and get 2 months off per year. I also don't think that's the case.  Are we saying that the teachers we have are bad and we need higher pay to attract better teachers? That's one way to look at it. From the teachers I've talked to it seems like most teachers are pretty good.  From the teachers I know and have talked to about the subject they tell me that, sure, they'd want higher pay, who doesn't? However it wouldn't increase their ability to teach. The problem isn't the curriculum in most cases or how it's presented. The problem is the students.	1642871641.0	sa73so	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa73so/people_who_say_teachers_arent_paid_enough_dont/	People who say teachers aren't paid enough don't know what they're talking about

1u2dcemj	I've felt this way for a long time now, & I realize that I both could be wrong or could just be a little anal grammatically, but I can't stand when people put these two together in the same sentence.  To me, to say "please" is to be petitioning someone for something. It's a request. And petitions & requests are fine, but the second "thank you" is put in the same sentence (before I've decided whether to comply or not) it's as though to you the answer has already been decided, as if it really weren't a petition at all, but a command dressed up to look like a petition.  Including "thank you" is to say that you EXPECT me to do it, & has a very entitled feel about it. Imagine this: someone on yhe street walks up to you & says "Hi, I'm taking today to try to find people who might wanna donate $50 to the children's orphan home division.  (With no hesitation): Would you like a receipt for your donation?"   Now, initially, you hear what they're taking donations for, & if you're a person w/ a generous heart &/or a love for kids, maybe you're almost ready to grab your pocketbook. But then, before you've said a word about being interested, they've moved all the way to the end of everything with 'would you like a receipt', as if you had no real say in the matter anyways. They've ignored that the entire transaction hung on your decision to agree or disagree, & they've attempted to steal that from you. Saying "please & thank you" together is the same thing.   I hate when people say that.    Yes, we were taught to say "please" & "thank you". So say "please" when you're petitioning something of someone, and IFFFFFF they choose to comply with your request,  say thank you after they do, not before. Otherwise you're just invalidating the initial "please", & making you look spoiled, not polite.	1642872365.0	sa7dh8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa7dh8/its_actually_rude_to_use_the_expression_please/	It's actually rude to use the expression "Please & thank you"

Maybe it’s because out of now eleven films, only the original three are any good. I know blah blah Rogue One - it’s not a good movie because you like the last ten minutes.  And Clone Wars is fine but impossible to reconcile with the prequels. The Anakin and Obi Wan in The Clone Wars are just nothing like their live-action depictions. There is nothing about Anakin having a padawan that makes any damn sense with the films, and now it’s all wrapped up in The Mandalorian - which finally had a chance to do something different, but nope, we’re back to the original trilogy story/characters again.   The whole franchise is objectively a mess and if anything is toxic, it’s that Star Wars fans have the inability to handle criticism without acting like some big kid has come to take their toys away.	1642876068.0	sa8q1w	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa8q1w/star_wars_doesnt_have_a_toxic_fanbase_90_of_it/	Star Wars doesn’t have a “toxic fanbase,” 90% of it just sucks.

i10v706d	 I am specifically referring to the ideas surrounding cats. I get it. Cats are bad for wildlife. They are, after all, an invasive, predatory species. There's no reason to believe that they'd have a *positive* effect on native ecosystems. However, its annoying to me that people seem to assume that cats have an *equally* negative effect on every ecosystem they inhabit. In a place like New Zealand, for example, which lacked any native feline predators, cats are devastating. In a place like the UK, wild versions of your domestic cat have been hanging around the woods since before humans set foot there. Do cats *really* have an equally destructive impact in both countries? The idea seems absurd. Yet, I very rarely see people take geography and ecological context into account when condemning outdoor cats. Cats aren't invasive *everywhere,* and in a place like the U.S., while they may be technically invasive, wild birds have been dealing with predatory felines for a long time: cougars, bobcats and lynx are all native here.  I often see statistics like "cats in the U.S. kill xyz amount of birds a year." These headlines confuse me. In nature, animals die. Human beings have killed off wolves, lynx, bobcats, birds of prey in untold numbers. We literally go into the woods and "cull" animals all the time to control their populations to make up for this. Yet I have rarely seen an article continue on to say "this is xyz% of a sustainable take for this species in this location, or xyz% of how many would have died of predation before humans depressed the number of local predators." Usually they *do* go on to say "cats have led to the extinction of countless birds," disregarding the fact that many of those bird species were from an entirely different ecological context than the ones familiar to the article's intended audience.  So color me skeptical about how bad cats are in the U.S. and the U.K. I have a strong feeling that dense human populations, lawns, pesticides, insecticides, deforestation and other forms of human activity cause way more harm to local wildlife populations than cats by a wide margin. This is the Anthropocene, not the feline-o-cene. Yet someone with an ecologically barren lawn covered in pesticides will eat a beef-burger and snack on some cookies made with South East Asian palm-oil before shitting on their neighbor because they let their cat out, *and not feel in any way hypocritical.*  Still, all of this is only half my argument. There are DEFINITELY places where outdoor cats should seriously be illegal. Places like New Zealand or Hawaii or really anywhere where birds haven't been dealing with similar predators. However, **just because an animal should not be allowed outside does not mean that keeping it inside is humane or compassionate. Sometimes the best solution is to just not have the animal.**  I do not believe *any* mammal or bird larger than a hamster should be kept indefinitely indoors. I think the thought of chickens, cows and pigs who never get to experience fresh air or grass under their feet is innately depressing. Very few animal lovers would fault me for that. Cats though? People seem to think that every single apartment building in the human world is a great place for a cat to live the entirety of their lives. Most cats that I have seen indoors do not live in a home or apartment set up with their needs in mind. It's just assumed that if humans are fine with it, the cats are too. I mean, sure, the cats can't talk or consent and many (many is the key word) try to escape every chance they get. Yeah, I get it, *your* cat is different. She or he has lived their whole lives indoors and hates the outdoors, which has nothing to do with the fact that the cat has lived its whole life in an unnatural environment and everything to do with their innate nature. Sure.  You ever just see an indoor cat sitting on the windowsill, staring at an outside world it will never get to experience? I would literally never deprive *any* other animal of some fresh air once in a while. Not a dog, not a chicken, not a pig, not even a rabbit. Animals are meant to be outside. Just because we have brought them to environments where they shouldn't be isn't going to change their nature or their innate needs. What we have done is put ourselves in an impossible ethical dilemma due to our own selfishness. **My unpopular opinion is this: if you live in an area where outdoor cats are a serious threat to wildlife (and that CANNOT be everywhere, as the wild versions of our semi-domestic felines are native to both Africa and Eurasia and similar predators exist all over the world) well, don't get a cat.**	1642877817.0	sa9cqf	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sa9cqf/too_many_people_think_that_just_because_letting/	Too many people think that just because letting an animal outside is ecologically destructive, that keeping it inside is therefore humane.

As per the definition of the word Anniversary,  it is the date on which an event took place in a previous YEAR.

Anyways having morals can get in the way because if youre trying to make business decisions or career decisions, sometimes you have to use and step on people. Imagine if Bill Gates had some weird moral barrier stopping him from doing what he did...he would probably be some burnt out programmer nobody ever heard of.   Imagine if you refused to use Chinese slave labor because it was unethical as a big company. You'd be outmatched by the competition most likely.

b6g1ol61	I do want to be clear, Pixar has made some great movies. I love Moana, Coco, Soul, the Incredibles, and Ratatouille, and WALL-E and Inside Out are pretty nice too. But there's always been something about them that's never really clicked with me like it seems to with other people.   I think it's two things. First of all, I just don't like the aesthetic of a lot of their movies. There's just something about the way their characters are designed that I'm not a fan of. That's one big reason I liked, but never really loved Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life, Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story franchise. I do like their newer animation much better. Even though I didn't particularly enjoy Luca or Onward, I still like the animation quite a bit more than their older work.   The other thing is the worlds that the characters live in. Now again, sometimes they're really cool! I love Moana's world, and Ratatouille adds just a bit of something special to Paris that makes it interesting. Soul has an engaging world too. But I think that their worlds have just never been for me. I never understood the appeal of the city in A Bug's Life or the world of Onward, for example. They almost feel watered down for me, like something much more interesting is hiding under the surface.   And then there's Dreamworks.   I think a lot of people think of Dreamworks very badly. And I can understand that, they have made some terrible, terrible movies. Boss Baby and Trolls are both pretty recent and also both pretty bad, and they both got sequels that were even worse. But Dreamworks have also made some incredible movies.   And some of their films and film series have had completely undeserved bad reputations in the past. Shrek is not terrible, in fact, it's really, really good! And the second movie is even better! Despite the name, Kung Fu Panda is a shockingly emotional movie. It's got a ridiculous premise that is executed PERFECTLY. and Megamind is nothing like Despicable Me, they're just similar on the very absolute surface and were released at about the same time.   Here's the list of movies of theirs that I massively enjoy, in order of when they released them: The Prince of Egypt, The Road to El Dorado, Shrek, Spirit, Shrek 2, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit, Over the Hedge, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek 4, Megamind, Kung Fu Panda 2, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, HTTYD 2, Kung Fu Panda 3, and HTTYD 3.   They just have a lot of good movies. And personally, I think every single one of the movies I just listed out is better than any movie in the Toy Story franchise.	1642880952.0	saahar	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saahar/i_have_never_really_understood_the_appeal_of/	I have never really understood the appeal of Pixar as a studio, and frankly, I prefer Dreamworks over both it and Disney.

4y2r6jqn	I like to practice, and advocate for, safe driving. There is nothing lower in my opinion than people who run red lights or dangerously speed. If you run them, it kills innocent people. If you’re someone who regularly runs red lights, and an app tells you that there’s a camera ahead so you just don’t run that particular red light, you won’t get caught and perhaps change anything. I think it completely defeats the purpose of the red light camera. The same thing goes for apps that tell you when police are around. For the people that are actually responsible and caring citizens, there won’t be a problem with police in the vicinity. Those who practice dangerous driving should learn their lessons and not be aided in their bad habits by an app.	1642882115.0	saawj1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saawj1/maps_shouldnt_tell_you_theres_red_light/	Maps shouldn’t tell you there’s red light cameras/police up ahead.

I think there's something to be said for making it to that gray when I think of how many people we lose along the way. I think of it as a badge of honor, and if you are running from the reality it feels cowardly to me. Jamie Lee Curtis was rocking a gray pixie cut and she was smokin.

3wvb8zx6	There's a lot of stigma, it seems, with someone not knowing how to do basic household chores and cook basic foods. Honestly it's undeserved criticism for a good portion of the population who has this issue.   I'm 29M, and I was quite lucky that my parents (though mostly my mom) had me start cooking, doing laundry, and other basic household chores starting at age 6. By the time I was about 8 or 9 years old, I could make a full, fairly complex meal for my entire family with no instruction from any adult, just the recipe. I could do everyone's laundry correctly, sanitize cleaning surfaces, vacuum, etc.   My sister on the other hand, was the exact opposite. She got upset and called me one day because she didn't know how to cook hot dogs. She wrapped bacon in plastic and microwaved it, almost starting a fire. She forgot half of the ingredients in brownies and they came out as black bricks... twice. Her laundry folding was atrocious. My parents, for reasons unknown to me, didn't spend as much time teaching her these basics as they did to me. I think the fact that I was the first born had something to do with it and they were able to spend much more time teaching me, and I became pretty self-sufficient enough to help with these tasks once both parents started working full time.   The only thing that my wife knows how to cook well is stir fry, and that's it. It's good stir fry, but even with with recipe for anything else, something goes wrong. Her laundry folding is also terrible. Her parents were both working two jobs to keep the family afloat, so she was never really taught how to do these things. They basically lived on takeout meals because it was easier than cooking.   That being did, both my wife and sister can change a tire, put chains on tires, and assemble a piece of furniture (without instructions) with no problems. I can't do any of these things, no matter how many times it's been shown to me. For whatever reason I just can't seem to grasp these other "basic" things. And I personally don't think it's a big deal.  Should all people know the basics in order to be self-sufficient? Yes, in an ideal world, but for some it's harder than others. They can't exactly help that their parents either were too busy to teach them these things, or were super spoiled and mom and dad did EVERYTHING for them, or they just can't get a grasp on how to do certain things. I don't think I know ANYONE who can do *every* "basic thing" that adults should "know" how to do.	1642885964.0	saca1d	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saca1d/theres_nothing_wrong_with_not_knowing_how_to_do/	There's nothing wrong with not knowing how to do laundry, boil an egg, or other "basics" as an adult.
1rdgeiyo	So for seemingly most Americans, weddings are seen as “your most special day” when the bride and groom should get anything they want, indulge themselves, and it should be this expensive fairytale type thing.   The couple gets to be treated like celebrities or royalty, and they end up focusing on themselves rather than their guests.  As a result, it’s becoming more common to exclude children from wedding celebrations because they’re seen as an inconvenience on a day that should be all about “me.”   I grew up in a Mexican-American culture, so I view things a certain way. And to me, “childfree” weddings feel empty…off in some way.   Personally, I LOVED going to weddings as a kid. A whole day of hanging out with my cousins, aunts and uncles and other family, running around, and going wild on the dance floor? Hell yeah!  Honestly, thinking back, some of my favorite memories as a kid were at weddings. They were basically big family reunions.   My wife has a similar fondness. As a kid, seeing the bride was like seeing a real life princess. And during our own wedding, she made sure to dance with every little girl or boy who wanted to!  And I loved having kids at my own wedding. They added so much fun and life to the party, I wouldn’t have it any other way.  Obviously, my opinion is based on my experience. But to me, weddings without kids are just missing something.	1642886032.0	sacava	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sacava/childfree_weddings_are_not_nearly_as_fun_as/	“Childfree” weddings are not nearly as fun as regular weddings

BUT it does seem like there’s a specific type of gamer, one who spends a lot of time on places like Reddit, YouTube, or Twitter, who are simply *never fucking happy*.  Literally every time a video game comes out, without fail, you can find these jokers ranting and crying online. Everything is bad, everything is “not like it once was”, everything “would be better if they just listened to me”.  Heres an idea — any time a new game comes out, go to YouTube and search “*new game* review”, and you’ll be bombarded with 100+ videos that are all a different variation of “*EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THIS NEW GAME*.  Do people realize that they feel this way because they take video games way too seriously and have allowed to become the biggest part of their life? Video games used to be a dumb a little hobby and now every disgusting nerd treats them like a full-time job.

cr1wfb4r	I watched this movie with no pre-conceptions. I was only aware of its super high ratings on every site, and was told it is about to win a bunch of awards. I've watched around 25 movies of all genres this month, so I went into this with an open mind, but was really baffled by the extremely positive reception.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it was incredibly cliché in its plot. I found one critical review that hit the nail on the head, which concludes that it's exhausting to be "Sundanced to death". It's a perfectly cliché Sundance Film Festival movie: scrappy family, goofy humor involving sex, wanting to win a competition, boyfriend messes up and has to make up, anxiety about choosing between going off to school or staying with family.  The movie had a lot of bright spots for sure. It had decent acting, plenty of humorous moments, and it made a deaf family relatable, which was nice. However, it was basically Little Miss Sunshine 2.0. It's the perfect cliché indie feel-good movie, and it doesn't do anything to be different besides revolving around a deaf family. I gave it 6 out of 10 on IMDb: good but not great.	1642888537.0	sad6r0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sad6r0/the_new_movie_coda_is_only_getting_showered_with/	The new movie CODA is only getting showered with awards and praise because it is using deaf actors.

Our ability to make tools and buildings was the first step toward planetary destruction.  We made edged weapons and explosives; we became much more effective at killing.  We developed the plow; we destroyed natural areas and enslaved animals in an effort to grow food for ourselves at the expense of countless other species of plants and animals.  We built ships; we spread diseases around and could enact genocide and species destruction worldwide.  We developed medicine; we live longer and there are more of us, displacing other living things.  We discovered electricity; our greed for energy sources has decimated natural areas on land and sea and exacerbated war.  We built spaceships; now we can leave the planet to destroy other worlds.

I've played it you literally only can do two things: Roll and dodge the same easy to dodge attack thrown at you and toss can't-remember-the-name until the over and over(which is the quickest/most effective way to catch Pokemon), OR you can do the same boring turn based combat that has less moves and serves NO PURPOSE besides it HAVING to be there because it's a Pokemon game.  Go check out a really old Fan game called Pokemon Generations, the combat should be that. It should be more like an arcade fighter or Pokken, that would have been so much better than this pointless, tedious crap. There's literally NOTHING outside of that besides SOME trainer fights that again serve no purpose other than it's a Pokemon game.

4v92qojf	Morality is subjective, and the universe is indifferent to our existence.  If morality was objectively true, it wouldn’t vary the way it does from person to person or culture to culture.   If morality was objective, we would be able to make a moral statement, for example “murder is wrong” and then it would be testable and verifiably immoral to murder.   But we know thats not the case.   In the case of murder, some people think its justifiable to murder in self defence and doing so is moral, some even will say you are morally obligated to defend yourself and others, while others would argue that you should not kill another living thing under any circumstances.  Think of the worst thing someone could do, something you would never do, ill bet you can imagine someone doing it and justifying it too.  If morality varies person to person, how can we judge a persons actions as being “Good” or “Evil”? We would only be able to judge it against their own morality, which we may or may not agree with.

e05a8vdo	i love my hero academia. after the first episode, i was absolutely hooked. i love the characters, the story, the animation, the humor, and pretty much everything about the series. however, i refuse to say that the series is flawless because it definitely isn\`t. there are a couple of things i don\`t like about the series. and one thing i don\`t like is just how much it tends to drag things out.   this wasn\`t that much of a problem during the couple of arcs but it really started to become a problem during the shie hassaikai arc. don\`t get me wrong. this is by no means a bad story arc. actually, it\`s quite good as a matter of fact. however, my main problem is that it drags things out quite a bit. for example, when two henchmen try to get in the hero\`s way, emagichi volunteers to hold them back while the heroes continue on. we then get a full episode dedicated to just this fight. and keep in mind, each episode of my hero academia is 25 minutes long. that means a full 25 minutes of very little being contributed to the overall story aside from emagichi gaining confidence. what i would have done was cross cut between the heroes and the fight and just have that be a recurring motive for the next few episodes. but instead, the writers decided to just stop the plot to give us a cool fight scene. and then, there\`s the episode where we get kirishima\`s backstory. i do confess that kirishima has one of the best backstories on the show. however, again, a full episode takes place in his past. what i would have done would be to go the godfather part 2 route. half the episode would take place in the present day and the other half would be flashbacks. on my blu ray disc of the first half of season 4, this arc takes up pretty much the whole dvd. and guess what? on part 2 of season 4, it still isn\`t over as the first two episodes on part two are still part of the arc.  again, i love the show but, it really doesn\`t need to spend 15 episodes on arcs that could have been wrapped up in 10.	1642896882.0	sag79i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sag79i/my_hero_academias_biggest_problem_is_that/	my hero academia`s biggest problem is that storylines are dragged out for WAAYY too long

Just make your thing and post it onto your fan pages and repeat right? So where to people start this off from? Using their talents or hobbies and what they are passionate about.  So as an observer of this trend as a *creative* myself - I find these posts of some dog shit that someone's built for the sake of making *anything* and hoping some algorithm somewhere flies it into traction.   Or the alternative is someone's something they have tried really hard on, like heart and soul upon it and its labeled "just thing". Or "scribbles idk".  Like be proud of your shit!! It's yours, you made it, and you called it *done* enough to show others. Don't start by backhandedly opening yourself with the attitude "oh I don't mean it like for real".  If you want something, don't be half assed. I get an argument can be made for *nothings perfect* and don't wait for perfection to post. But don't defeat your ideas or trip them up out the door.

5lq06eaz	When I was a child, about 10 years old, I read the Hobbit and I fell in love with the book and the world Tolkien created. I tried reading LotR's afterwards, but gave up. Shortly after, the LotR movies came out and I fell in love with the world again and tried picking up the books again, only to be defeated by confusion and bored once again.  Yet after many reruns of the Hobbit (book) and the LotR movies, I still saw promise in the books because of how amazing the world is, so I have tried consistently to read the book series.   I've finally managed to read most of it, and now I have decided to give up because in my own opinion, they're not that great. Tolkien focuses so much on the world he's created that he leaves the character development to one side, it's very two-dimensional and well, simplistic. The movies pulled that side off so damn well in comparison, because they cut out all the needless rubbish and the sheer amount of names (people, locations, ages, and all sorts) one has to remember.  You can get to certain sections of the books, where it will be pages upon pages of dialogue, where the most you'll get outside of the speech quotations, is "<Insert name of one of the gazillion people in the convo> said... And then straight onto another lengthy monologue by another character. The lack of description, like "he boomed with a disconcerted look" (rather than just "he said"), or in character emotion and development, or the world itself (rather than just place names and their history) is a real sore point for me.  Then you have the sheer amount of songs, that especially if you listen to it as an audiobook, it comes across as more like the LotR Disney sing-along. It takes the seriousness that the movie encapsulated so well, out of it. Especially when you get to Tom Bombadil (I have given up reading the first book so many times because of that chapter you're introduced to Bombadil). Just oh my god, the seriousness of the themes it tries to portray, are totally undermined by the quaint, jolly and rather childish (like a fairly tale sort of childishness) parts of the book, which are numerous and ridden all over the books.  I was really wanting a deep exploration of what is good and evil, not a two-dimensional, black & white, portrayal of them, and how this and the ongoing events affected the characters. In the Movies, Aragorn has an internal battle about his role as the Heir of Insildur, whereas in the books, that's pretty much done and dusted by the council of Elrond, and the sword gets forged immediately and theres no internal conflict within Aragorn. He just accepts his place and gets on with it. He's not human, he doesn't have the depth that humans have, it's just like a Wikipedia entry on some historical figure. I've read history books that have humanised their figures better than this piece of fiction.   Then there is the waffling in, the sheer amount of waffling, some of the most impactful scenes in the movie happens in a few minutes, whereas the book will take dozen upon dozens of pages to make a SHALLOWER point of the same scene. It ruins the delivery and takes away the emotional impact and urgency of their situation - because most of it is filled up with histiography of the world, and maybe some comment about "How quaint and jolly Bilboo is in this situation" (in comparison to the movie, how the ring has affected Bilbo is MUCH LESS discussed and the focus is on how jolly he is - it discusses it, but because there is so much pointless content added to it, the impact is taken away).  If you like the book, that's fine, but after finishing the Two Towers, I am done with it. It's a waste if my time and a huge disappointment because it's a fantastic world, but it's lacking in character, because the characters in the world are stale... Tolkien placed too much on world building and not the actual characters within that world (he chose quantity of characters over quality of characters).	1642902866.0	sai7fw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sai7fw/the_lord_of_the_rings_book_series_arent_just/	The Lord of the Rings book series aren't just overrated, but are boring.

Same with dancing, playing an instrument, drawing, etc. I’m not saying to just straight up insult the person’s act, but people need to realise that they really aren’t good at what they’re going, or at least not as good as they’re making themselves out to be.

4vc94ka0	It’s been well supported that nurses face some of the highest rates of work place violence, however the blame for violence in the hospital setting is often placed on the victim, rather than the perpetrators. Of course some of this violence comes from people who are obviously not in control of themselves, such as dementia patients or patients with serious mental illness. These people should be exempt from this boundary. However if you are mentally sound and choose to assault a HCP you should be thrown out.Anyone who assaulted an employee at any other job would be denied services without hesitation. If you’re well enough to throw a punch you don’t need hospital assistance. I understand being sick and relying on others when you are typically independent is incredibly frustrating.

2voud1qq	Throw in a requirement that you’ve needed to have x number of years work experience if you’d like, but with MBA’s and the like becoming many companies’ minimum education level for any real growth, using someone’s undergraduate performance from 5, 10, or more years ago is unfair and unrealistic. A huge number of people aren’t working in the industry they studied for, especially with the drastic changes in the workforce over the past 10-15 years.   Very few people are the same person they were as an undergrad, and many are much more than their transcripts show. I am in favor of letters of recommendation/statements of purpose and the like and am not advocating for it to be free, but if you have the determination and are willing to pay for the program at your chosen institution, you should be able to sign up and earn your graduate degree.   Being 100% online with recorded lectures, there is no limit to how many students can be involved and if a student learns they can’t handle it, they drop out and the school still has the tuition they paid. Lessen the number of essays students need to complete and the workload of professors will not be a concern since they can simply use online tests that are automatically graded.   Yes I’m just a bit bitter. I’m not even close to the same person I was when I graduated and deeply regret not taking my undergrad as seriously as I should have. That said, I would like to continue my education and help improve my work performance and future possibilities, but GPA or GRE/GMAT requirements make it nearly impossible to meet what is needed.	1642906298.0	sajazt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sajazt/if_you_have_a_bachelors_degree_and_are_at_least_5/	If you have a Bachelors degree and are at least 5 years removed from graduation, 100% online Masters programs should not have admission requirements.

Often times he doesn’t feel like the main character and when the films are coming to it’s climax and they say stuff like ‘John wick is coming to get you’ or when they describe him as the ‘bogeyman’ in the third film I feel like it’s meant to be scary and unnerving when I’m thinking, ‘you could 100% talk him out of killing you’.

aaqcsqyv	Saw it one time and that was that.  DiCaprio has several films with better replay value:  1. The Wolf of Wall Street 2. Inception 3. The Revenant 4. Blood Diamond 5. Catch me if you can  That’s just to name a few.   Everybody knows how the movie ends based on the true story from 1912 and original movie from 1953.  Yes there were a lot of superb actors and James Cameron did a good job directing the film.  Celine Dion’s song was a sensation as well.  But here’s where the proverbial ‘ship hits the iceberg’ - take a closer look at the other classic films that debuted in the same year as Titanic:  1. As Good as it Gets (1997) 2. Good Will Hunting (1997) 3. LA Confidential (1997) 4. Men in Black (1997) 5. Donnie Brasco (1997)  That’s just to name a few.  How many movies on that list are you watching before Titanic in 2022?  Fun Fact: All 5 movies combined had a film budget of $220 million  Titanic’s budget was $200 million ($330 million in 2022 via inflation).  Yes they made it back 10X at the box office | Put that much money behind any film and it’s going to receive the proper marketing and promotion.   Keep in mind this is in the 90’s (no at home movie options and early dvd releases came until the 21st century).  Overall the movie is a good first watch; especially if you don’t know about the true story.  It’s not even a Top 5 Remake:  1. Ocean’s Eleven (2001) 2. The Thing (1981) 3. Casino Royale (2006) 4. The Departed (2006) 5. Scarface (1983)  That’s just to name a few.

While I understand some instances in a lot of dress codes are a bit extreme. (No visible straps. No showing shoulders. Etc) I think that a teacher that doesn't want you to be wearing something that violates the dress code is most of the time acting in good faith.   They're most likely just trying to protect you from other students being disgusting. I know people like to act like High schoolers don't sexualize each other but I know that's definitely not the case a lot of the time.   Am I saying the dress code is perfect? No absolutely not but the focus should be on removing silly and unnecessary rules like straps rather then acting like every teacher that cares enough to tell you to wear something less revealing/longer is a pedophile.

Someone with a very visible either disability or deformity will show up on my for you page and all the comments are “✨pop off queen✨” and “✨you go girl I wish I looked like you✨”. I’m not saying that positivity is bad but I feel like everyone is trying so hard to be politically correct that they just ignore an obvious part of someone. As someone who’s dealt with mean girls before too, these “compliments” are often sarcastic and just used to make fun of that person and aren’t truly genuine.	1642915618.0	sam4u5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sam4u5/i_hate_the_pop_off_queen_comments_on_peoples/	I hate the “pop off queen” comments on people’s cringey videos

tm1lu	I have noticed this thing on reddit the past 2 years, the concept of feeling like you are "the main character" usually in reference to some kind of negative behavior. I understand why it's grounded in that because of how selfish some people can really be, a lot of people too to be honest. But guess what, indeed you are the main character, you are the protagonist in your story, your life, your destiny, your purpose. Yes your life should be centered around you(around yourselves if you  are couple) and nothing is wrong with that. Because absolutely no one other than maybe the closest family members will ever care about you, your needs or your desires as much as you will. So yes behave like you are the main character be in control of your life absolutely nothing is wrong with that.	1642916421.0	samctm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/samctm/you_are_the_main_character_and_nothing_is_wrong/	You are the main character and nothing is wrong with thinking that.

Like if it has a yellow food coloring in it, ewwww... how can someone say that like beer and, at the same time, say that Heineken is good?

39izo5ei	Free from cringey thumbnails, choppy editing, and pesky sponsorships -- these YouTube videos are the internet equivalent of "from farm to table." You will be hard pressed to find the same level of sincerity and passion that so often seeps from these gems than you would in any 50,000+ viewed video (the disparity obviously could start at much lower viewed popular content, but generally speaking).   Not only will you find fresh faces sharing unfiltered perspectives, you could also find -- if you're persistent enough with your searching -- a prime candidate for some high quality, newly discovered by you, unintentional ASMR for when it's time to unwind and relax.

ihuf3usc	Often, they will only ever show you what a small minority of people think about something and that can generally play such a huge role in skewing things which is really dangerous.  Nothing should be declared/ruled out completely and should be taken with a grain of salt, especially considering that the overwhelming sample size on the majority of surveys tends to be nowhere near the full amount of people being requested to do it.  If we look at something like looking at the trends of what people are buying, you can make it more reliable data because it is something recorded without even having to ask people what they bought and I think we need to start realizing the differences to how different surveys are recorded because it is not always the case on the wider scale than what is always considered 'correct' on a mainstream scale.	1642919346.0	san5oc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/san5oc/surveys_should_not_be_considered_legitimate/	Surveys should not be considered legitimate unless everyone takes part in them.
a5w6nwth	When I got into my first programming class they just made way more sense to me. Especially with inequalities. As a dyslexic, signs like ≤  used to be confusing. I used to flip them around all time whenever I wasnt supposed to. But signs like <= are easier. Instead of relying on direction, its more orientation if you know what I mean. If you think of them as one sign instead of two, less than points out and vice versa for greater than no matter how you flip them around. Programming doesnt really have special thing for < or >, but it still better to me. And you can read them like it's own little language.  ! "Does not"  = "equals"  When you combine them !=, "does not equal too" Also I dont understand why they taught us to multiply with x either. I get why they dont start with teaching paranthese, but they could've have just told us to use • or * to lighten the transition from basic math to algebra. Or the "U" for union.

awbv6gqx	Whenever Deus ex is mentioned folks usually talk about how the original was so mighty and great, best game ever and that the other games were terrible, unplayable. And I disagree.   Outside of just being a Deus Ex game, all games include one very important recipe which I believe more games seriously need to do and that's Semi open worlds with hella tons of exploration. The fact you can just go in most buildings or people's apartments and loot is an underrated design.   The Deus Ex maps might be small but they have so much content inside them, it's why I believe they will always ultimately be better than open world games. Sure having a massive map sounds great but if the map is devoid of content it's essentially worthless. No Man's Sky has an entire universe to explore and that gets real old, real fast.  As somebody once said it's better to have a puddle as deep as an ocean than it is to have an ocean as deep as a puddle.   I'm not sure of this so do confirm but I believe Deus Ex popularised this formula before the likes of Dishonoured and Prey, both of which are also amazing games because of this Semi-open world design.   Anyways back to the games themselves, there's something great about not having any limits on morality in your game, you have the intense vibe of shadow illuminati doing evil shit with the fate of humanity on the line, bringing up questions about what it means to be human and whether we are truly free or can be trusted with said freedom.   Then the next moment you're breaking into a random dude's apartment, smashing his head in with a baton and ransacking his shit with absolutely no consequence on the story.   Human revolution and Mankind divided brought a more realistic look into this cyberpunk kind of world and again brought up this huge moral issues about our humanity and whether we should continue down this road and breaking free from the unseen chains of those who rule above us.   Only for the next minute to stab the living hell out of your old work colleague with your arm swords all the while crushing random civilians by dropping printers and what not on them. The games truly didn't give a damn what shit you got up to and it was fun.   That's all a game really needs to be, fun. Not every game has to be deep and interesting as little nightmares or graphically and hands on with Red dead's horse ball technology.   If you haven't tried this games then I encourage folks to try them, if you wanna continue sucking the long rod of nostalgia then play the original. Games are about having fun, if you want some fun I recommend these games.	1642921848.0	sants0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sants0/deus_ex_invisible_wars_deus_ex_human_revolution/	Deus Ex: Invisible wars Deus Ex: Human revolution and Deus Ex: Mankind Divided were all great games and arguably didn't deserve the hate.

c31sp2do	i'm sick of "a certain millionaire"  complaining about birth rates.  In vitro is expensive. I'm sure a lot of couples forgo the idea of having a second child when faced with fertility issues becasue they prefer to use the money on their existing kid as opposed to pay for the chance of having another.  Many couples forgo having a second child becasue their experience with their first child was too demanding (the couldn't get childcare, they lost out on promotions/oppotrunities). So now that the 1 kid is older and they feel "over the hump"  they don't want to go through it again.  Those are tangible blockers to higher birth rates which can be magically 'dissapeared' with money.

So many people are claiming to be introverts nowadays. Is it like a trend or something now?  I know extroversion is usually chalked up to someone who gains energy through social interaction while introverts have to unplug from socializing to reenergize. So when you put it that way, it does sound kinda negative. It makes extroverts look like draining energy vampires and it makes introverts look like the prize. I figured that is why so many people identify as introverted bc energy vampirism kinda makes you look like a miserable, annoying and empty parasite that no one should be friends with.

8lsscjyh	Whenever you look at films or series that involve scientists or geniuses, it's always the same. They are constantly portrayed as aloof, quiet introverts unable to relate to others and usually have some kind of underlying mental issue. The imitation game and a beautiful mind are the prime examples of this. It's damaging, since most of the time this type of lifestyle is also vastly romanticised and people get this stereotype of "genius = introvert". Because of this, people who turn these portrayals into role models tend to forget the value of social interaction and become emotionally immature as a result, unable to fully enjoy their lives. It also leads to "smart" people having a higher chance of being ostracized from society as a whole, naturally so when those people weren't able to learn how to properly interact.   My dream is to pursue a career in the STEM field and most people I know who also have the same dream have been affected by this stereotype, me included. Of course, in reality it's very important for one to have adequate social skills to be successful in STEM since one has to know how to give proper presentations/find sponsors etc etc, but how are we supposed to know that if the role models that we have admired all throughout our childhood have been "romantic tragic geniuses"?

bzgorpu	Since reddit is mostly North America based, alot of people don't know how school is outside of America and spoiler alert, school system is basically the same everywhere in the world. The 3 tier school system of elementary school, middle school, and high school is widely practiced around the world. They may have different names for them or be distributed differently (less elementary school, more high school etc...) but the general idea is th same and what you learn in each education level.. My point is, this isn't a US onlyissue imo.  As to the problem, we learn alot of jargon in school specifically from elementary school to high school and to an extend in college because of mandatory requirements. For example, you have to take X number of science credits or fiveristy credits or writing credits etc... Even if you don't need them for your job. I get schools want you to have a basic understanding of the world but I feel like sometimes these requirements go beyond basic understanding and get too technical for people who don't need them.   Be honest, how much stuff did you learn in school that you don't remember at all? I think not only we are forced to learn too much jargon, but also the way school is structured, we also don't learn anything and we are often memorizing things for the short term just to get through a class/exam and we forget the material quickly afterward because we have another exam coming up that we need to memorize a bunch of other stuff for.  I don't know what the solution is, but I definitely think the current system promotes not actually learning anything that will stick with you after you finish your class and move on. But I do think a big part of the problem are closed book quizzes and exams as they are today because all they do is force students to cramp weeks of material for a 2h test and after that they will never come up so you don't need to waste mental space on them and as such you will forget them very quickly which serves absolutely no benefit except ticking a box for graduation requirements.    I honestly would have loved to remember more concepts and materials from my  chemistry classes or biology classes because at the time I found the topics interesting but since I don't actually ever need them in my line of work and daily life I completely forgot about them!	1642944632.0	satopj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/satopj/i_think_the_current_school_system_around_the/	I think the current school system around the world is bad because it promotes short term memorization of the material being taught.
xs0re	Many praise that Legends looks so bad especially compared to New Snap, so I searched for some screenshots. The water, ocean parts look way better in snap, but plain grass fields are in my opinion pretty spare compared to Legends. Way less grass and light effects, and the trees in legends that get hated on because they "look like straight out of a N64 game" do not look particiular worse than the ones in new Snap in this biome:  [https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/247315201081212930/934802408092086312/unknown.png](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/247315201081212930/934802408092086312/unknown.png)	1642945042.0	sattmw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sattmw/pokémon_legends_has_more_grass_and_looks_better/	Pokémon Legends has more grass and looks better than Pokémon New snap
5v50g47n	I’m currently 6 episodes into centaurworld and I have to say I’ve yet to laugh at a single “joke” in the entire show. My friends recommended that I watch it and I’ve only ever heard good things about it but watching it feels like the writing was done in a single day and all of the budget went into the animation. None of the characters are likeable, the songs aren’t memorable and I don’t think there are any jokes, just “isn’t that quirky?” Moments. I get it, it’s supposed to be childish and goofy because that’s the whole point of the story but it’s gotten to a point where I’m starting to find the characters annoying.

hp9cxqpy	Over the years I've seen a lot of people talk crap on both of these games, and maybe it's cause I grew up with them, I genuinely liked both of them. Let's start with Need For Speed Carbon. I LOVED the soundtrack, the cars, the characters, bosses and even the minor, but still interesting story. I know a lot of people were unhappy with the game and called it the failed copy of NSF Most Wanted, but I genuinely enjoyed the game. Gosh, just the boss battles in canyon were awesome, and it's honestly a shame it got overshadowed by NSF Most Wanted. Same goes for NSF: The Run. I loved the entire story line, and the whole concept of driving through the entire USA. It was awesome. The soundtracks for both of those games were amazing as well. Those 2 should get more attention.	1642946454.0	saua0t	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saua0t/nsf_carbon_nfs_the_run_are_not_that_bad/	NSF Carbon & NFS: The Run are not that bad

The green Mission Winnow logo? Awesome, it's a nice shade, and adds contrast to a car that's 90% red. And always has been.   The gradient from Rosso Corsa to burgundy red? That also looks very nice, and it's a nice shade of burgundy. I won't dispute the people who said it looks like the car got burnt, or soiled itself. But the gradient is subtle way of including just a smidgen of contrast.   And with a bit of yellow on the car from other sponsors, it's not that unreasonable to keep the car mostly red with subtle amount of other colours.	1642947232.0	saujht	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/saujht/the_2021_ferrari_f1_livery_looked_nice/	The 2021 Ferrari F1 livery looked nice

3m69bhnz	People seem to be getting the impression that unless you’re a millionaire in some highly developed country that your life is utter shit. No, it’s not. Yes, 9.2% of the human population is in *extreme* poverty. And yes, the world is nowhere perfect for everyone but it’s definitely manageable for the average human. Healthcare in all countries is at it’s peak since the dawn of humanity. There’s hasn’t been a war between major superpowers in nearly over a century. I live in a 3rd world country and 99.9% of the people I see aren’t miserable, they’re a happy people, they eat 3 meals a day and have access to clean water. In most countries, including a lot of developing ones, being poor still means you are able to sustain yourself. Yes, people struggle to make a living but that’s all part of human life. A life without struggle and hard work isn’t an achievable one. Every time I see any post or comment mentionig someone working or being employed for a long period of time everyone seems to portray them as poor and heavly exploited laborers regardless of what said post is about and everyone assumes that everyone hates their jobs. In reality, most people in these developed countries are likely paid well enough to survive and live healthy. I honestly cannot understand how people say that any country that isn’t Scandinavia is such a shitty place where living is a daily nightmare. This is just insulting to actual people who are starving and barely eat. Being a human has never been easier. Now, I’m not saying people from developed countries can’t complain. Of course a lot can be fixed. I’m just thinking that people are can be very ungrateful for the decent life their ancestors worked so hard to give them and that the world isn’t an utter hellhole.

mf38v	My belief is that professional athletes don’t effectively represent their teams unless they have an established connection to the area they are in before they are serving. It is different from high school and college sports because those players do usually come from the regional area (except for some larger colleges) and have opportunities to participate on their campus outside of being a member of a sports team. Professional sports teams do trades for strictly business reasons instead of preserving the regional identity of the team, leading to a bunch of rich athletes claiming they are authentic to the area when they are not.  Each professional sports team should have a recruitment territory that gives them an equal opportunity to recruit promising and talented players. This means teams with smaller populations would get larger recruitment territories. There could be some overlap in larger metro areas where there are multiple teams serving the same sport (e.g. New York City for football). All recruited players must live in the boundaries of that area for three years within the last ten, with the option to count your home and college addresses. The general idea is that it would make each team more representative of the area its serving and thus inspire further loyalty from fans.	1642958160.0	sayh8j	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sayh8j/professional_athletes_should_be_recruited_by/	Professional Athletes Should Be Recruited By Region Instead of Freely Drafted

4fl7bj5q	I remember when I was a teenager, around 15 I think, I went to this birthday party and a few kids were doing drugs, alcohol, marijuana, and inhaling glue to be exact. At the time, I used to train Taekwondo, was in a pretty good shape, and I strayed away from drugs because my parents frame them as this demonic substance that once you fool yourself and "try", it just snowballs and goes downhill from there.   As I grew older, my moral convictions changed, and I did try a few drugs just for the sake of it, and then I found myself a junkie struggling between financials, my mental wellbeing and physical wellbeing, I remembered my parents' words and how true they are. They turned out to be, indeed, as demonic and bad as my parents describe them. Over at r/addiction, you see many posts of people saying that it's not worth it, it's not enjoyable, it's deadly, it is this and that, and after recovering from a few addictive substances I had in the past, I completely agree. I keep interacting with people who are under the influence of drugs, a classmate who smokes a joint everyday, a flatmate who drinks to death in the weekend, and these interactions are by far the most dysfunctional, irritating and annoying interactions I've ever had with a person. The agitation, the broken communication, the decoherent narrative all remind me of how bad drugs are.  I still go to some parties right now as a 25 years old guy, and I still see people using drugs and frame them as this majestic and beautiful thing that you have to try. You also see movies and such glorifying them but the reality is, they're just not worth it at all. As a person who broke free from all addictive substances (even caffeine), I have never in my life felt better.

None of their behaviors should be a surprise, and if they are maybe you should have invested some time getting to know them.  The only valid reason to share a life with someone is you make each other's lives better. These kinda of posts don't make me think "ugh, all (insert any/no gender) are the same, your person sucks, I feel for you!"  Instead I think you're someone who married out of wanting the social validation just like you're seeking it with your post and on top of that you exhibit poor judgment.	1642960449.0	sazdh6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sazdh6/spouse_complaint_posts_are_so_cringe/	Spouse complaint posts are so cringe

fryw6jjy	I can’t count how many times I’ve ran into other women who are like “omg porn is bad it makes killers, it makes men hate women, it rewires their brain” etc etc   I DO agree that pornography does have effects on the psyches, especially when you’re exposed to it younger. There’s also lots of porn where it’s meant to simulate rape, break in, etc. So I totally get it and agree that porn isn’t free of faults or implications. There needs to be in improvement in the porn industry.   It just seems like every person I run into a person who says these things use shame to drive the message rather than just say the message. Instead of saying something like “the porn industry can effect blah blah and people should be aware, especially people with addictions.” They say “if you watch porn then you’re then this, if you’re boyfriend watches it then he doesn’t value you and he hates women”  I feel like if they really cared they wouldn’t be using shame based assumptions to get a message across, especially people with literal ADDICTIONS.	1642960938.0	sazku7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sazku7/most_people_who_shame_people_about_porn_usage_do/	Most people who shame people about porn usage do not care about changing or making the porn industry safer/better.

gavlmaco	He was touted for the role years before but turned it down. Don't get me wrong malik's performance was a revelation and sorta oscar-worthy (i actually thought bale or cooper deserved it more that year). But SBC looks more like mercury, has more of the body type, and is just as talented as, if not a more talented actor. I think malik got so much praise for the role because it showed his versatility and range, whereas maybe the SBC version wouldnt have gotten so much acclaim because he is naturally more eccentric and flamboyant like mercury was.

I think rejecting someone because of their looks is justified as long as you're not an asshole to them about it, and I think what's actually shallow is dating someone you're not attracted to, because more often than not you're either confusing platonic and romantic feelings or you're in a relationship out of loneliness and desperation.

Well yeah, that’s the point, most people consume this kind of media to disconnect from real life or I should rather say as a form of escapism. Its not always supposed to be realistic, its supposed to be entertaining and engaging. Not saying that both cannot coexist, they definitely can because crazy things happen irl also, but in fiction something dramatic has to happen to keep the story moving and hold the audience’s attention which may sometimes seem unrealistic.

3wvd69al	I don't care if the people in it are just out for a profit, whatever. The fact is, there are better medications available around the world that so many people can benefit from and now have access to. The US is so ruled by Big Pharma that blocks access to millions of people by delaying FDA approvals or jacking up prices to the point where hardly anyone can afford them.   The process to get FDA approval is incredibly expensive and takes over a decade, so many safe and effective medicines that are approved and used in other countries won't even try for FDA approval in the states anymore.   Living in the states means you have to pay an outrageous amount of money for a medicine that is no longer the best option available.   Nowadays, you can go online and order the medications you need for hardly any money. I know this is not always safe and you need to take precautions, but there are legit ways to access medications online now and it's a wonderful thing.

9kh259qj	I am not a big anti-makeup kinda person, I think makeup in general is a lot of fun and a cool vehicle for expression, and I really don't care if someone wants to wear a full cakey face every day or never touches the stuff or anything in between. That being said, personally I can never take nose contour seriously. It's in such a prominent position on the face that it always looks like someone got chocolate ice cream smeared on them instead of a natural shadow, especially when you see it in person. Cheek and jaw contour don't really have that problem because they're actually following natural hollows/shaded areas of the face to at least some degree, but when you try to give yourself that little button nose by contouring around the tip, I'm sorry, but it just looks like you got a weirdly specific suntan. Ultimately I don't care if people like how nose contour looks and still do it, I would never say this to anyone's face because it's just a useless little personal opinion, but I don't think I'll ever see a nose contour that doesn't make me giggle a little bit to myself at how obvious and wrong it looks.	1642973793.0	sb4lgu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb4lgu/nose_contour_never_looks_good/	Nose contour NEVER looks good

bt1tajmy	All the videos and streams that are on YouTube and Twitch's servers take up a MASSIVE amount of data, and servers to host and store such a large amount of data cost a MASSIVE amount of money.  What this essentially means is that only a massive corporation can afford to start a video/livestream service and keep it alive without going bankrupt. THIS is the reason why almost all potential competitors to YouTube (like Vimeo, Dailymotion, Mixer, BitChute, ZippCast, etc) end up either forgotten about or shut down entirely. The only reason Twitch managed to rise up is because they're backed by Amazon.  Huge corporations do not give a crap about their customers, except for squeezing as much money out of them as possible. That is a fact we all can't deny; after all, it's only human nature. I'd probably be a scumbag too if I was a rich corporate suit, and YOU'D probably be a scumbag too (don't deny it).  This is why YouTube and Twitch treat their content creators like shit (demonetization and strikes for no reason, etc) and do stupid things like removing the dislike button and trying to force Google+ on all their users: they're sitting pretty with their precious monopoly that they know they will NEVER LOSE.  And if YouTube and Twitch do end up going away one day, they're just going to be replaced by another big corporation like Apple who will end up doing the same shit that they do now.	1642975119.0	sb547i	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb547i/youtube_and_twitch_are_going_to_suck_forever/	YouTube and Twitch are going to suck forever

It's also weird when parents think they deserve the utmost praise or that having a kid is something special. Something like 80% of the population has kids eventually.

I’m not attracted to her physically ( she’s beautiful but is underweight ). I also like her personality and wanted to ask her out in a friendly way in order to have a clearer idea if i’m interested or not.  I simply wrote “if she wants to change her body, i’d gladly help her” I didn’t even said it is something she has to do.  People started going crazy.   I then tried to reply to the comments. Most of comments were personal insults. Anyway, i replied saying “we all have preferences. This doesn’t make us assholes.”  Also, it’s not like “you’re not like this, so it’s a no”.   But it’s like “you’re not like this, but i don’t care about it, cause you’ve got other good sides”.  I guess all other girls and guys fall in love with the personality alone, and don’t need even a bit of physical attraction.

9lbw7zxf	The good old "Raising the minimum wage will force shops to close" statement is absolute horse shit.   If your business relies on low wages to exist in the first place, it shouldn't be in business to begin with.   You are confirming that for your business to exist in a segment of our economy you are relying on worker exploitation(paying your employee fuck all)  Business owners are for free market till it comes and bites them in the ass. Then when workers start finding better paying opportunities, your business chokes, and it's suddenly has nothing to do with your poorly managed business, it's the economies fault.

8vpk9ika	I was looking up if some obscure finnish music I'm into is in the public domain and I was flabbergasted when I saw that finnish copyright law says that the copyright of a work lasts the author's lifetime+70 years, which is ludicrous. It means that a dude can make a copyrightable work in his twenties, live to his eighties *and only then* will the 70 year waiting period start ticking down, which means that from the work's conception/publishing it can take *130 years* for it to enter public domain. At least american copyright can expire if it's been 95 years from publication but is otherwise the same.  How can anyone who isn't rich enough to afford the royalties or one of their loyal sycophants, be for this? Either make it only last the author's lifetime (because what are they going to do with it when they're dead?) or make it some (relatively) short amount of time *since publication*.	1642976154.0	sb5jdl	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb5jdl/copyright_lasts_way_too_long/	Copyright lasts way too long

4pnouofc	I've seen way too many posts on another subreddit from those that range from 16 to 24 asking about stuff that, honestly, sounds like a joke. Saying they love someone after 2 months (you don't even know that person yet), that they can't understand why the other person all of a sudden stops talking to them, what should they do if the other cheats, etc.   Those that are in high school, I'm sorry this isn't the 1950's anymore, high school sweethearts rarely exists nowadays so that person is not your true love. Those that are in college, you're in college, yes it does happen you find your future spouse there but remember, college is the time to enjoy your last years before adulthood so people are still not really looking for serious relationships.   If someone cheats on you and you're asking what to do, easy answer, can you ever trust them again? 9 times out of 10, answer is no so you know what to do.   I get it, we all have our first puppy dog love but sometimes young adolescents need to know you're young and your lives are not even close to being decided yet for career or where you'll even be.	1642980005.0	sb6zii	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb6zii/high_school_and_young_adults_shouldnt_be_asking/	High school and young adults shouldn't be asking for dating advice
gbkrgdx8	I’ll say for some cases but not all.   Usually there’s two type of friendzoning:  Realizing someone you thought of as a close friend only wanted to get with you feels really uncomfortable. Like when you think someone is just genuinely nice and cares about you, only to realize they were nice because they wanted more… and then they treat you different after because you won’t give them what they want. It sucks and it hurts when someone completely cuts you off because you don’t want to sleep with them so you’re not worth their time anymore  Or when you care about someone who cares about you and you have to turn them down because you don’t feel the same, there’s such immense guilt because as some point you wish you COULD feel that way so you don’t hurt them but you just can’t. It changes an entire relationship. I still feel guilty about times I’ve had to respectfully say I’m not interested in a relationship with a person.   People always get mad/hurt about being friendzoned and act like the person was purposely trying to make them feel bad but that’s not true. Just because someone wants to be your friend and not more doesn’t make them a shitty person. Having to see the disappointment when someone puts themselves out there is hard, especially when they’re a close friend. I’ve been on both sides and honestly, both hurt just as bad.   And before anyone says “if you feel bad just date them”, lying about your feelings to someone to make them feel better for a short period just to break their heart later is worse than being honest	1642980132.0	sb71bw	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb71bw/friendzoning_someone_is_just_as_hard_as_being/	Friendzoning someone is just as hard as being friendzoned

daybdv51	There was an extract from a newspaper I read a few years ago where a comedian quipped: 'young people think that just because they can dress, walk, and drive by themselves, they've got the whole world figured out', and despite it being a joke, to be honest I've always felt that way. I simply couldn't relate to or care enough about the banal things people in my age group talked about, and the certainty in which some of them expressed themselves was something I didn't understand. Generally speaking, most of the time my friends, and their friends, just sat around listening to terrible music, texting their next hook up, and engaging in recreational drug use.   Which is why for me it was always refreshing talking to somebody with a bit more life experience, gaining an insight from certain past transgressions, and how they learned or moved on from their mistakes. I've got a bit of a soft spot for old people (70+), I love just spending a bit of time with them, and sometimes ask how things were like when they were younger, their recollections are a brief glimpses from another time.

cuzpuwik	I've watched a close relative go through all kinds of treatments for breast cancer over the past 8 years. She has a huge community of people who love her, and with the best intentions they'd always say something along the lines of: "You can beat it! You're so strong!" and "Kick cancer's ass! I know you can!" And every time they'd find a new tumor on her body, after supposedly "wiping out" all of her cancer, she felt absolutely devastated that she wasn't able to clear the cancer from her body, and would beat herself up over the fact that she wasn't strong enough to beat the cancer herself.   Obviously, that wasn't her fault. And obviously, everyone who had told her to keep fighting, all of the narratives that hospitals push to stay strong, they all mean well. But the truth is, whether you beat cancer or not, whether you learn how to walk again or not, and whether you are able to recover from any other medical condition or not, none of it is representative of how strong you are, or how hard you fought.  I am not at all trying to downplay just how terribly great the emotional turmoil is to face something like this, and of course everyone who goes through these things has to be emotionally strong if they want to get through it. But the matter of whether or not they were physically fighting hard enough to "beat" whatever they're facing just isn't accurate. Either their body takes to the medication and the therapy and the other treatments, or it doesn't. They don't have any stake in whether it actually ends up working or not.	1642982531.0	sb7we0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb7we0/people_cant_fight_medical_conditions_or_diseases/	People can't "fight" medical conditions or diseases.

Listening to the same fragment of butchered remixes of songs over and over and over with brain dead teenagers dancing or doing some other dumb shit.

8t5z3c6v	Yes, it was a dick move and he said some pretty reprehensible things but his kid had a life threatening reaction to something they sold him. 9/10 parents are going to go apeshit over this because their brain is going haywire from their kid almost dying.  Also, that they refused to tell him who made the smoothie and whether or not it might have peanuts in it. The guy is trying to figure out why his kid is turning blue and they won’t tell him. Imagine your kid is having a deadly reaction and you think it’s peanuts but you don’t know and the only people that can tell you for sure simply won’t because they’re afraid of getting in trouble.   People on Reddit seem more upset about the fact that he said the magic no-no words than the fact that a restaurant served a common dangerous allergen to someone who specifically asked for it to be excluded.  I really don’t see how it’s any different from someone saying “please don’t come near me if you have the flu” and you doing it anyway because you don’t know or care about their reasons.  Part of being a restaurant and selling people food is basic good safety.  Someone shouted at some high schoolers because they almost killed his kid by being negligent about what they put in food. Big deal, they’ll get over it and they needed to be shouted at anyway based on their total disregard for other people.  It’s one thing to accidentally serve someone something they are allergic to, it’s another thing to withhold that information during a life threatening medical emergency.  The real pieces of shit are the kids that filmed the guy trying to figure out why his kid is dying and then blasted him on the internet for it.

dhydzj9j	no one wakes up with the want to be angry, just like no one wakes up with the want to be depressed.   they both stem from deep emotional and chemical imbalances. trauma, abuse, neglect feed into creating an angry person just the same as they do a depressed or anxious one.   until we start to treat them with compassion, the cycle of pain and hurt will continue.   don't tell someone "anger gets you nowhere", they know, they can't help it and need understanding as opposed to judgement.	1642987832.0	sb9qun	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sb9qun/telling_someone_not_to_be_angry_is_like_telling/	telling someone not to be angry is like telling someone not to be depressed.

A grown man doing fucked up sexual shut with a young body.  Abuse like that skews their outlook on things and how they perceive people. The list goes on.

All their characters are lovable in one way or another and the characters that you hate such as Danzo have reasonable reasons for their actions. The series also posesses great symbolism through Obito's mask and sharingans overall. It also has many interesting connections to hinduism, which is quite rare to find in series that has great popularity worldwide. Overall, Naruto illustrates many unique themes through the "infinite tsukyomi" and Pain's "world-wide" terrorization which it helps stick out against ATLA or any other high rated television series.	1642991587.0	sbb0k4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbb0k4/naruto_is_peak_fiction/	Naruto is peak fiction

You can fight tooth and nail back into a game but then there other team wins an OT toss and because they get a touchdown you don’t even get a chance to rebuttal?! WTF kind of rule is this!?

We’ve been slowly updating things and now it’s time for my most detested activity, painting. I’m too obsessive, it’s never perfect enough and I dwell on mistakes. Ugh. It needs to be done though and I recognize that; so no complaints from me, despite all the bitching I’m doing here.  So “we” picked a nice looking grey for the first room and probably others. There’s going to be an accent wall with some color soon so my opinions may change. I think it looks good so far, I do! I’m just not super stoked about it. SO says it’s more of a *warm* grey and is really happy with it. I think it’s certainly not as warm as the old beige was. The name of the grey paint color is actually “whiskers”. Appears more light than I make it sound. It’s probably important to note that I’m colorblind, specifically deuteranopia – issues with red and green.  SO is concerned that I don’t like it but I just think it hits different for me. Claims the beige is something old ladies like. I say maybe I am an old lady!

One hypothesis for the origin of life on earth is panspermia. I personally do not subscribe to this hypothesis, I believe that life began due to the abiogenesis of organic matter. How? I have no idea, but it to me is the most likely hypothesis, but I don't see why we should not cultivate bacteria and other simple organisms that would likely thrive in Martian etc environments and see where evolution would take them.

Personally I’ve been low calorie dieting and fasting on and off for around 18 years with regular exercise and my last InsideTracker results showed my biological age compared to people 10 years younger than me so this does work (it also reflects in how old people assume I am which is usually at least 8 years younger).  Aging can be delayed, we don’t have to accept it and live our lives thinking that it’s normal to unhealthily age. Newest research shows that it may be possible to actually arrest aging completely on a cellular level so the longer you delay your death, the higher chance you have of living longer.	1643000469.0	sbdvpp	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbdvpp/you_shouldnt_just_accept_aging_it_can_be_delayed/	You shouldn’t just accept aging, it can be delayed

14qwub	yes i enjoy sex and i love my partner and its usually fun because we do it together. but in terms of getting the job done? its so much easier to just masturbate. aint no one that can do it better than you can on yourself. you know exactly how you like things and how to pace it. adding another person can make it intimate but man like first off we aint got that physical stamina to go at it long enough to really get a top tier orgasm. yeah you can like break and try something different but theres only so many times where you're kinda done with trying and had your fun even if you dodnt cum. and lkke you gotta worry about the angle and position too.. bleh.   sure you practice and it gets easier and you learn o more about your patner over time but things like 69, regular oral, or even just masturbating together are still intimate and you dont need to worry about getting the right angle or the physical energy required and have a much better overall experience.	1643001135.0	sbe38y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbe38y/penetrative_sex_is_too_much_of_a_chore/	penetrative sex is too much of a chore

80t722rn	I might get flamed for this, but so be it.    Valorant isn’t a good game. It’s objectively designed horribly. Being an amalgam of features from both CS:GO and Overwatch all in one, the game gets overwhelming at many points in time.   The whole “precise gunplay” deal is a truckload of bullshit. There’s nothing precise about it. The spray patterns are never predictable enough to land a headshot every single time, and some guns are straight up busted under a run and gun situation.   Don’t even get me started on the in-game store. Blows my mind how Riot makes money. The most recent package of weapon skins totals up to almost 100 dollars. 100 dollars for some shitty little nerf blaster lookin ass gun skin that makes your bullets look like used tampons. It’s hilarious how they get away with that, and even more hilarious that people dump money into it constantly.   TL:DR; valorant sucks.

did5v9wc	Now before you start your judgment, I do NOT advocate training students how to shoot a gun. Teaching young people how to shoot in a classroom setting would be incredibly dangerous and irresponsible in itself. However, being that it’s is a “god given right” to own a firearm in the US, the people should know the repercussions of doing dumb shit with a gun.   With that being said, there are many people (including children) that die from gun related accidents every year that are completely avoidable with proper safety knowledge. I’ve personally introduced many people to firearms and it is unbelievable the things they find acceptable that could actually kill another person. I’ve seen people look down the barrel of a loaded gun, people shoot when another person is down range, and even people point a loaded firearm at me with a finger on the trigger. The worst part is, they see nothing wrong with their actions and some find it quite comedic. I also know many people that have died from accidental gun deaths, one of which a boy shot his girlfriend in the head with a rifle while playing with it. (His family tried to sue the manufacturer despite him literally putting the barrel to her forehead)  So if any 18 year old in the US can purchase a gun, why don’t we teach them the wrongs and rights of owning one? Learning to be safe could save lives…  (And yes, I’m quite aware that if no one owned a gun, less people would die to accidents, but that is quite a far step for American culture.)	1643005942.0	sbfim7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbfim7/firearm_safety_should_be_taught_in_american/	Firearm safety should be taught in American schools
foqlbbp1	I watched the recent Spider-Man and objectively it’s a good movie. Great CGI, good character development, good writing...but oh my god it’s soo boring.   It’s the same action movie formula as previous iterations:  -Everything is relatively normal -Problem occurs because of some unaccounted for thing or some unattended consequences -Hero must save the day -they get the shit kicked out of them -insert cameo somewhere -Hero learns some valuable lesson or must make a sacrifice -The story ends and everyone is saved   Action in movies isn’t inherently bad either! I appreciate well put together action that feels consequential (Dune as one recent example where violence and action feel devastating all the way through). But for Marvel movies, while not solely being restricted to Marvel, this is the main problem: action in these movies are predictable and stale. It doesn’t feel new.

xbszgs4	The NFL overtime rules are just fine.   I see people complaining that both quarterbacks should be able to get the ball in overtime. If you want your quarterback to have the football, play some god damn defense. This is professional football at the highest level, and just as much emphasis should be put on defense as there is on offense, especially in an overtime situation. Overtime shouldn’t be an offensive shootout- it should be a continuation of the team game of football.   For those that would say that NFL overtime games are essentially decided by the coin toss, don’t let the game get to overtime! So many other plays influence the outcome of a game and reducing the perceived outcome to a coin toss is overly simplistic.   Side note: I think the college overtime rules are fine for college, because the overall game has much less emphasis on defense (especially compared to the NFL).	1643008408.0	sbg73s	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbg73s/the_nfl_overtime_rules_are_just_fine/	The NFL Overtime rules are just fine.

But do we really need those 4 hours of homework?

fs4t7	I’m nowhere near a gym rat, actually I’d love to go to the gym more often, but often times you have to wait sooooo, long for a squat rack or a bench press to become free at busy gyms, it adds a lot of time to your workout.  Making the workout unpleasant and often discouraging.   I am constantly seeing people hog up barbells in a squat racks and bench presses with ten pound plates or twenty pounds in plates on each side for a total of 65-85 pounds.   While that maybe heavy to some, that exercise could easily be done with dumbbells, freeing up the squat rack or barbell.   So if you are doing exercises at a weight that can be done with dumbbells, than you should do so.

i2ziw245	I really don't understand when people say they want a big Sudan or a coupe. I personally thing that, unless you want a car with a lot of space, a small hatchback is far better at doing everything. It's small (good for the city) but not too small so you don't have space for anything (they are actually surprisingly spaceous), they have some power in them, it's way easier to maintain, most of them come With a lot of good features, really affordable, suuuuuuuuper fun to drive around (especially with friends) and they are very cozy and have something like a personality to them. Kinda like a small house. So many people that either can or will buy their first car (especially car enthusiasts) always want to buy a huge sportscar or their parents tell them to buy a long sedan, they get overwhelmed and can't maintain it, they find it hard to learn and eventually sell it. I always recommend to new drivers to get a small affordable car and if they don't like it, its not as much of a economic problem to upgrade from a small car to a bigger ont than the other way around. In conclusion, if you are not a car guy with experience in what you like or someone that does crazy big car trips frequently (which even then I think a small car can handle it) don't go immediately on a big car	1643010902.0	sbgul1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgul1/smaller_cars_are_far_superior_than_bigger_cars_in/	Smaller cars are far superior than bigger cars in almost everything
z3ldk	I saw a post recently regarding a video online about a some market traders beating an orangutan to death for taking fruit to feed her babies and of course the comments that followed were "humans are the worst".   I usually see similar themes and posts about how evil humans are and how animals are sooooo much better. It's so frustrating to hear because what do you think that orangutan would have done if it caught a human stealing it's food from her babies? Do people really think it would have politely shared it's food with us and we would have had a nice Thanksgiving meal? That shit would have tore our faces off so fast.   Another comment in the same thread mentioned a horse casually eating a baby chick right in front of the mother hen like nothing while the hen is going crazy. No one called horses evil. God forbid a human did that.  I read a story from India about a dog killing a baby monkey. The monkeys went down to the village and killed all of the puppies by dropping them off a cliff and when they ran out of puppies they started attacking children. Are monkeys evil too?  It only seems like in these situations everyone likes hate on humans but ignore when animals commit heinous and horrific acts as well If anything I think humans are by far more compassionate than animals.	1643011107.0	sbgwc1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbgwc1/humans_are_not_evil_and_tend_to_be_more/	Humans are not evil and tend to be more compassionate than animals.

Honesty is when you break something and instead of hiding it, you tell your parents/friend right away.  Honesty is when you own up to your mistakes.

cl7wpa2	Car accidents are called accidents for a reason, and to scream at and insult the other driver is never necessary unless until they deny responsibility or attempt to flee the scene. In my experience, at-fault drivers are apologetic and honest. Attacking someone without giving them the opportunity to accept responsibility is unfair and immature. Accidents happen, and they sometimes have severe consequences. But at the end of the day, they’re accidents. If you wouldn’t scream at a stranger for bumping into you, you shouldn’t scream at a stranger for accidentally wrecking into you— especially without understanding what exactly caused the accident (it’s acceptable to be angry at someone for driving drunk, texting and driving, etc) and  allowing them to admit guilt is irrational.	1643017594.0	sbij39	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbij39/confronting_someone_with_anger_after_a_car/	Confronting someone with anger after a car accident is irrational and immature, even if that person is at fault.
9492atcw	If you watch the episode “The Surplus” it really shows how manipulative they are of Michael. Jim takes advantage of Michael just wanting friends and Pam flirts with him and flaunts her body to try and tease his favor. Jim redeems himself in later seasons but Pam only gets worse. Jim supports her through all her art school, which she fails, and she can’t return the favor when he starts Athlead. Not to mention the wack plot in the final season with the camera man. All in all, I guess a relationship that’s built off making a move on an engaged woman doesn’t have the greatest starting point to jump from. That’s why the episode with Roy’s wedding shows how much better off he is without Pam because Pam truly enjoyed being in a relationship with him just so she could feel like she was the better person in the relationship and focus on his flaws instead of her own. Good job Roy, he’s better off.	1643018010.0	sbimre	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbimre/jim_and_pam_are_not_actually_a_good_couple/	Jim and Pam are not actually a good couple

569vk6ey	British TV shows often get remade and butchered. The comedy doesn’t play for British jokes when converted to an American production. The number of pointless remakes I think we can all agree on is endless, but I don’t think you should even be allowed to make a newer version til the overseas version has done a complete run on a leading network. “What’s the point in remaking it then?” Exactly - if you don’t have a solid reason to remake it, then don’t. Truly convince me as an audience member why I should attempt an American remake when I either loved or hated the original international version.  The British version of Ghosts was wildly better but a lot will only watch the poorly done US remake. Call Me Kat is absolute garbage whereas it’s original UK concept Miranda is side splittingly funny.   Sure we have a rare successes like The Office and Shameless but I still think the original versions should’ve been aired fully on mainstream/leading TV. The Office worked cause it really did decide to completely reimagine the characters and it understood it wasn’t trying to remake the exact jokes of its original.	1643018426.0	sbiqhi	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbiqhi/remakes_of_international_tv_shows_shouldnt_be/	Remakes of international TV shows shouldn’t be allowed unless the original has been aired on a leading network in that country

ic30jxcy	Throughout the entire show she acts like her word is more important and that what she says is what should be done. She treats people with love and respect but the second things go south or they start making decisions for themselves she starts to get aggressive. Superman wants to keep kryptonite available so that he can be stopped but she only sees the fact that her husband can now be killed rather than the fact that her husband could be the one killing. She gets angry at her son Jordan because he took a girl over and then mad at her husband because he allowed such a thing. I get that this guy is only 15 and shouldn't be having sex but getting angry and causing an argument over such a thing isn't going to solve a single problem. In Season 2 she's just in a mood, no idea why yet but the fact that she's disregarding everyone around her just because she's in a mood is stupid because if somebody else happens to be in a mood and gets angry at her she would play victim.   Basically, she's just that kind of person who is happy go lucky until something goes wrong in which case they turn into the devil incarnate. She treats her family like crap, she treats her husband like crap, she treats most people around her like crap. The only reason she's important is because she married superman, if that wasn't the case you would just view her as somebody with a big temper.	1643019581.0	sbj0w4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbj0w4/lois_from_superman_lois_is_a_horrible_person/	Lois from Superman & Lois is a horrible person

4vs18fzg	As a person who has love for style and over the years tried many styles (leather jacket cool, bussiness casual, streetstyle) but I just found my love for functional clothing (often identified as techwear although techwear also has other implications). It is so nice on the skin, is warmer, elastic, breathable, wears out slower, can be pretty affordable (when compared with brand clothing). It just has so much advantages against cotton, standard poly, wool etc. And it CAN be made into nice fashionable clothing (doesn't have to be bright colors and sportish style). Thankfully a lot of businesses started making functional button downs, stylish sweaters, or even jackets.

Coffee provides a great source of energy that can be very low calorie. For me it’s part of my morning routine that indicates I am becoming productive.

Women and men in the comments kept debating whether she was wrong or he was wrong, and throughout the comments I've noticed that mainly people call out others so called "hypocrisy" and then contradict themselves by being hypocritical and say things that makes their points null and void.

391r0bys	I hear a lot of people in real life, but especially on reddit, wistfully long for the days of pensions where a company would cut you a check from its pension plan after you retired til the day you died.  That is just fucking absurd. Do you not realize all the downsides of pensions?  1: If the company mismanages the pension, you're potentially fucked. And this has happened.  2: You have to stay with the same company, in some cases most or all of your career. Bear in mind that the very same redditors who MOAN about not having pensions anymore will turn around and advise you to switch companies every two years to get more pay. Hate to break it to you, but these positions conflict.  3: The contributions are roughly the same. You had to pay into pension plans JUST like you pay into your 401k/Roth IRA.  4: This way I carry my retirement and savings on my back with me wherever I go. I change companies? I'm fine. I move across the country? I'm fine.  5: I have more control over my financial planning and retirement. You wanna do FIRE? Good fucking luck doing that with a pension plan. Many pension plans historically didn't have an OPTION to retire early unless the pension fund was losing solvency (in which case you're getting pennies on the dollar) because the entire fucking point of the pension plan was to basically shackle you to that company.

fhxqvtk0	I think it’s so annoying when peoples entire social media accounts are just dedicated to certain fictional characters. Posting them every minute or so like anyone actually cares.  No one gives a single fuck if you love childe from genshin impact. It’s so annoying to have to just scroll through my feed or some stories and see 20 picture of the same boring character. I’ve even seen people fucking cry on their stories about these characters. It’s okay to be a fan of characters but damn tone it down. Worst part is I would feel rude if I unfollowed because they’re all people I know irl, and act more than decent in person.

149on6	Traditional sports and games have detailed rules publically available. People can check whether a certain situation in a match happened according to the rules. Also, they can verify whether the rules aren't rigged for one side.  Most e-sports are programs where the players send inputs, and the programs somehow decide who wins. Understanding roughly how an e-sport works isn't difficult, but that its source code isn't available means that there may be undiscovered bugs that may create unexpected behavior, and the program can be rigged to favor one side, which may be slight enough that it wouldn't be detectable.  The source code of an e-sport is the rules, and if a sport should be taken seriously, it should have publically available rules. The creators of the e-sport may worry that the source code could be taken and used in a different e-sport or game; that could be a problem, but it would be a much smaller problem if e-sports commonly had public source code because it would be easily discovered by looking at the code. The creator of the e-sport could release detailed documentation instead of the code itself, but then bugs could invalidate some matches because they would be against the public rules.	1643033461.0	sbn2ve	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbn2ve/all_big_esport_games_should_have_public_source/	All big e-sport games should have public source code.

If you do not know how many ppl actually disliked that comment, you might be more inclined to give it a second though and not just press the dislike button out of reflex.  Other than that it doesn't add anything in my opinion. The comments get less visible because you have to click on them to see them. You could still do that with no negative dislikes.

hj2uwizo	For gore videos or obscene videos depicting real acts of violence to be made people have to be hurt, and people who view or possess these types of videos create demand for it. Demand for these videos incentivizes people who have these videos to distribute them on the internet.   Victims who are featured in these types of videos are likely going through the worst moment of their lives and every time someone views these videos it’s like they’re being re-victimized. For example, there was a video of a kidnapping victim (racially motivated crime) being beaten and taunted on video that was circulated on social media. That was likely the worst moment of his life especially considering the fact he has the mental age of a child. Every time that video is viewed or shared online he’s being victimized all over again.   If they don’t survive the production of the video then for their family and friends every time the video is viewed or shared it’s like their loved one is being killed all over again. For example, there was a video of two tourists being decapitated in Morocco. The video was very graphic and was widely viewed and distributed on gore based websites. For the family of the victims every time the video was shared or viewed online it was like their family members were being killed all over again.   Viewing or sharing gore based videos or videos that are obscenely violent causes harm to victims and their families. People who view or share these videos should be held responsible for the damage they caused to the victims and their families.	1643036288.0	sbo1yx	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbo1yx/anyone_who_views_possesses_or_distributes_gore_or/	Anyone who views, possesses, or distributes gore or obscenely violent videos should be arrested and imprisoned

9xmvh	Every time I see a fight video coming out of a highschool nowadays they are increasingly brutal. I see more and more tactics that are borderline attempted murder. Head stomping, suplexes into concrete, eye gouging, biting, etc. I personally feel that this is for a few reasons.   1. The stakes are too high.  -  With schools implementing "zero tolerance" policies for fighting, emotionally charged young people know that once they're in a fight, or they reach they're breaking point, no matter what happens the consequences are the same. In other words, if you're getting expelled or suspended you might as well get your money's worth.   2. The taboo of fighting makes them unfamiliar with the consequences.  - if you've never been in a fight in your entire life because you've been trying to abide by the rules, you have no reference for consequences of certain things. If you've never been punched in the head then you cannot understand how much worse getting kicked in the head could be.   3. Your reputation hinges on 1 fight.  - if you're a young person who's found themselves in a fight, you have to win. You're only going to do this once and if you lose, you're forever a lover.    I think if we could reduce or remove some of these, we would see an increase in fights but the level of violence within would be greatly reduced. The sane level of this is to lower the consequences of fighting in schools. The less than sane version would be to teach boxing and/or wrestling to familiarize the youth with violence and its consequences. The craziest level would be for the schools to organize safe fights between consenting students. Headgear, mouthguards, gloves, a soft surface, and a referee would allow these kids to fight (which I feel they're going to do anyways) in a much safer, lower stakes, environment.	1643038079.0	sbootc	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbootc/kids_should_be_allowed_to_fight/	Kids should be allowed to fight

People also state that his fighting style was boring, but never seen to take into account that when he wasn't doing much in the cage, his opponent wasn't either.  He defended of multiple occasions, has some pretty nice knockouts under his belt, and got there in the first place.   If anything, you have to give some credit to him for even bothering to hold the division up when he could have just relinquished the title and gave up.

Why would people who get so much money spend it all in such a short time? After contemplating it, I think I understand.   After winning the lottery most people begin spending like crazy. Other people start treating them differently and they get used to the lifestyle that comes with wealth. The problem is, lottery winners don't actually know how to earn money. (at least not that much money). They only know how to spend it. They upgrade their lifestyle and go into a deficit, slowly (or quickly) draining their bank account.

6ykftjgi	I don’t mind the smell at all, really. I have a few hits of a cigarette every once in a blue moon, but my close friends who smoke cigarettes frequently often have annoying habits.  Always begging someone to stand outside in the cold with them while they smoke, making us pause the show/movie so they can go outside and smoke, and holding everything up so they can go smoke before we do anything.  We’re all about to leave to go somewhere? Hang on, John needs to smoke. Let’s all stand here. Uber is here? Guess they’re waiting, John needs a cigarette. Lighter? Lighter? You got a lighter? John needs a lighter right now.   I’ve generally noticed a complete lack of care for holding up entire groups of people so they can have the damn cigarette and they always wait until the most inconvenient time to decide that they need one _right now._  God forbid they don’t get the cigarette? Or have to wait five minutes? Better bet they’re in a shitty mood and will talk and talk and talk about how bad they want a cig until they get one.

5xc2v	Like 99% of people who have watch movies, I've been exposed to Martin Scorcese's filmography. By now, I've seen almost everything he's done. While I do like his movies and I am not saying they are themselves bad, I think the man is a so-so director at best and absolutely horrible at the worst times. I love his screenwriting though, and consider it as important a part of Americana as the Superbowl, Hemingway or jazz.  But I've just watched The Departed for the 3rd time in my life and finally realized what makes his movies fall short of greatness for me. Lack of in-scene continuity, edits too quick to make any kind of impact in story-telling, split diopters for no discernable reason, scenes that linger so long they test the ability of the amazing talent he has been blessed to work with over his career.   I'm sure my cricisims aren't anything he hasn't had throw his way before, but the idea that they can be ignored so that he can be considered one of the greatest directors of all time is ridiculous to me. I don't know what kind of director he is behind the scenes but I assume he's great to work with. But his final product doesn't reflect that assumption. He seems to get away with poorly executed concepts simply because of how good they are on paper. I find myself having to force my perspective in order to enjoy his movies and overlook the nearly-amateurish way he constructs a scene.  He would better serve the film industry he loves so much as a screen-writer, rather than a director and I wish I could see someone else take the helm behind the camera in his projects. Maybe use him as an assistant director? But certainly don't let him in the editing room.	1643042395.0	sbqapm	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbqapm/scorcese_is_a_terrible_director_and_should_be_a/	Scorcese is a terrible director and should be a full-time screenwriter.

lj1p6lw	Bear with me on this, But if you tweak just a few minor details in the overall writing it becomes a completely different narrative.   Firstly: there should be a group of underground batshit hedge wizards and witches that use Lunas family magazine to spread info and gather safely out of government eye that would eventually play a major role in an upcoming Civil War that nobody else is remotely aware of. Secondly: The drama in the woods is entirely too dragged out and mostly feels forced overall, leave the two friends at school to develop stories separately. Like what if Ron and Hermione establish renegade networks that trickle into government positions, or even potentially get brainwashed along the way I don't know just literally anything that gives more character development than sitting in a tent. Thirdly: this is where I'm gonna stop even though I have a lot more, But Harry should have lost the last battle due to intervention of grindewald saving voldemort and running away together after escaping prison instead of being killed in an insane state, somehow grindewald becomes a new form of horcrux starting a new arc in the series where a magic Civil War breaks out between those in power and the various factions of wild/civilian witches&wizards.

aem5e5	I am in no way defending Carrie’s overall treatment of Aidan! This is from a recent rewatch. Spoilers for those who haven’t seen seasons 3 & 4 of Sex and the City.  Spoilers:  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  In season 3, we know that Carrie cheats on Aidan and he (rightfully) dumps her. When Carrie bumps into him in season 4, she wants him back.   The time frame here is this:   4x6: Carrie and Aidan try the friendship thing, the episode ends with them getting back together  4x12: Aidan proposes to Carrie and buys the apartment next door  4x13: Aidan moves in  4x15: Aidan and Carrie break up for good   &#x200B;  In 4x15, Carrie says “Aidan, you’re pushing me”, after she had asked him for more time to process things and potentially set a later date earlier in that same episode. Bear in mind, we’ve never seen Carrie live with a guy and since SATC seems to be set in eternal summer, Aidan has only been living with her for a few weeks/maybe a month. Carrie asking for more time doesn't seem that ridiculous of a request. When Aidan wants to get married right then and there in 4X15, it's totally understandable why she doesn't. Even if Carrie wanted marriage, we all know she would want Samantha/Miranda/Charlotte/Stanny there. Aidan is only thinking about himself here.   I don’t like Carrie, but I do agree that he was being too pushy. I mean, they had just moved in after he proposed and they hadn’t lived together long enough to see if they were even compatible at cohabitation. When Carrie says “why can’t we just live together?” and Aidan whines in response that he doesn’t want to, it comes off to me as pushy and disregarding of her feelings since they’ve barely lived together a month and she’s having other issues.   I like Aidan, but he wasn’t always the angel everyone makes him out to be (unless you’re comparing him to Big).

Defending team has an 80% chance of getting the ball back with the chance to win/tie. The offensive team has to score in some way, which happens only 40% of possession.

68rvi	While working I burn through thousands of hours of music each year. When I need an instrumental playlist for focusing I'll look through "focus" playlists on Spotify or Youtube. Over the past year or so, it's become increasingly difficult to find any instrumental playlist that isn't overrun by "lo-fi beats" and I hate it.   I get it, they're easy to make, musically neutral, and help to fuel a never-ending stream of ambient background noise, so I appreciate it to an extent. But it's gotten to the point where "Music for Coding" is the same as "Instrumental Study", or "Focus Mode".  The scratchy record hiss, lazy piano riffs, and the same three sounds used over and over and over with trite "soulful" samples is so overdone and has saturated the "focus" genre across platforms that it's inescapable without a concentrated effort to avoid it.  Yes, this opinion is entitled, yum-icking, unnecessary, and unappreciative towards artists who churn out music for little pay for a modicum of my enjoyment. But here it is.	1643047287.0	sbs7l5	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbs7l5/focus_music_is_now_synonymous_with_lofi_beats_and/	"Focus" music is now synonymous with "Lo-fi beats" and I hate it

brdk7cvr	It is unbelievable to me that people use some of these unironically. Most of them are incomprehensible because 1, they use letters that are so common it could mean absolutely anything, and 2, for some god awful reason they're almost always used at the beginning of a sentence so you have to struggle, and scavenge for even a hint of context to make it make some sense. Really, without googling it, what do you think "iirc" means? If i have to pause reading, go to google, and search what a random abbreviation you put it the text meant, then sorry but you failed the point of language and communication.   The other reason i hate them is because it's so easy to just write the whole thing. How hard is it to write "if i remember correctly" especially in a time when auto correct has reached a point where it can (in my experience) predict your next word 60 percent of the time?  When you compress a sentence to the point when people aren't sure what it originally meant, i think it's just time to stop using it. I don't know about you, but "shaking my head" and "smacking my head" have different connotations to me so i can't tell if someone's smh is condescending or more like a "im not mad I'm just disappointed".   And still, that's assuming you already vaguely know what it means. Because if you don't, smh can be "smashed my headphones", "some metalheads" , "sarcastic moving hand" , "scared my heart off" , or a typo of "smash".

Parents who choose their kids’ outfits every day have always left a bad taste in my mouth. Children are not dolls to play dress up with, they’re their own people who should be allowed to present themselves how they like.   The same goes for haircuts, I think a kid should have the right to refuse a haircut if they want to, and have any hairstyle they want.

Social media site designers know that most of their users will never scroll through every available post in a given day, and know that no one likes all the pages they follow equally. With that in mind, the dreaded algorithm is designed to show the most interesting posts first to give the users that dopamine rush that will keep them coming back for more. Everyone has their own list of things they want to see at the top of their feed, and for most, your latest MLM pancreas cleanse blast isn't at the top of that list.

2mo860mb	I'm not saying that acting isn't a difficult skill. But a B+ actor can look good with an amazing script and an A+ actor will look terrible when the plot and dialogue suck.  I hear a lot of people grade actor peformances in TV shows and movies when they are really referring to the script which is why I think this is unpopular.  Further evidence: shakespeare plays are immortalized because of the scripts (granted they couldn't record video in that time). Old movies are recognized for their memorable quotes. TV shows and movies can be very successful with animation (of course voice acting is a skill its own right, but you see less of the actor). If you watch a table read of a solid TV show, that alone can be very entertaining. Some of the best movies are based on books.

You might not make it, the market might not make it or hell the world might not make it. But even if it does, what the hell are you going to spend it on? Travel? Yeah sounds fun, but wouldn't it be more fun to travel now. And have you seen old people on vacation? I'd say a third of the time they look miserable because their back is acting up or they just can't do anything because they are old. They can't go windsurfing (or at least not as good as now), so just go now.  If you can save money, why not buy a house or condo now? It's a bubble? Ok just wait it out or just say fuck it, or do my plan, live at my place until the next bubble.  Heck spend the money on anything that makes you happy now instead of for a rainy day that might never come.

hk2c90n3	This is for the US. No idea food prices in different countries.   Also yes, there are outliers. I don’t need to list out every possible situation of why someone may not have the means to cook, or the 10% of the US in a food desert.   If I cook with chicken it’s usually between $2-4 for a full plate. Meals are  only expensive if you’re doing some lavish gourmet meal. Pretty much only steak or a nicer type of fish will cause a meal to break $5. Only cook with chicken thighs because much tastier and cheaper than breasts.   Spicy Thai chicken thighs and rice noodles   Creamy onion gravy over fried then baked chicken.   Mahi mahi and cauliflower   French chicken   Pork belly  Baked pork loin  Hash browns, biscuits, eggs and some type of meat/cheese  Creamy chicken Alfredo   Steak, potatoes, onions and stuffed mushrooms (this will be about $8-12 depending upon cut and size of steak)  Etc etc. most veggies for me are onions, mushrooms, potatoes, corn, cauliflower, garlic.   The Amount of oil/butter/spices per meal is marginal cost increase. Mere cents.   Most fruits costs the same as a candy bar. Eat a snickers or eat an apple or an orange.   Unless you’re buying organic or going to Whole Foods or a high end grocery store, cooking is not expensive and usually only takes about 30 minutes of effort, but that can be enough for one meal or three days.   Before you disagree, before you get Reddit upset and argue this as if I just insulted your mother, just google prices from Walmart, aldi, target or a similar type of store near to you.  See how cheap a bag of potatoes are, or a frozen bag of corn, or a dozen eggs, or a frozen pack of chicken thighs, etc etc. if you say cooking is expensive please tell me what store you are utilizing to get high prices.	1643055678.0	sbvh3p	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbvh3p/only_people_that_have_never_cooked_think_cooking/	Only people that have never cooked think cooking is expensive

16xkeq	To be born into abject poverty, at least in a developed country, really teaches someone the importance of having to make something of yourself and the value of working for things on your own. Of course, you don't have to be born into poverty to realize this, but it's the quickest and most memorable way to get the message and to fully comprehend how bad things can get if you don't try. It also discourages wasteful behavior later on in life.   I've noticed that people from middle and upper-class upbringings tend to get really caught up on first-world problems or sometimes have a lot to fall back on and this hinders their ability to solve problems when the going gets tough, whereas someone who was born into poverty might have a little more know-how on how to rectify such situations as they are used to going without.  I'm not suggesting that being born into poverty is a good thing or a thing that all people born into poverty generally have a better conception of the importance of hard work, but I am suggesting that being born poor gives you a leg up in terms of one's worldview and perspective on the importance of moving forward later on in life.	1643057395.0	sbw4cn	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbw4cn/being_born_into_poverty_is_actually_a_blessing_in/	Being born into poverty is actually a blessing in disguise.

9h6w2kvc	The spidey-sense isn’t full proof. If it was full proof, all 8 of the solo Spider-Man movies would be ten minutes long because Peter would be unstoppable. How many times has Peter been hit with stuff, been unable to counter something on time, or been duped into making a bad decision throughout the movies? Dozens. You mean to tell me that the man who’s a trained ninja that can move in bursts faster than people can think cant get the slip on him? Even if he couldn’t, the spidey sense alerts Peter that dangers present, it doesn’t tell Peter how to react to said danger. If Batman counters the web, peters open for a takedown. Yeah, peters shown crazy amounts of strengths, but Batman’s legitimately defeated Wonder Woman in the past, an Amazon with a similar stat line as Spider-Man and she doesn’t have a weird weakness like kryptonite.	1643057921.0	sbwbfy	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbwbfy/batman_is_defeating_spiderman_100_of_the_time/	Batman is defeating Spider-Man 100% of the time
16xkeq	Let me just start by saying that I am not 'anti-Elon' or just generally pessimistic and looking to insult the aspirations of a successful entrepreneur. He's a really interesting guy with more brainpower than he knows what to do with and deserves to see all of his ventures succeed given the probable value that they will yield for humanity.  That said, I cannot help but look at the broken promises of Tesla's automated driver tech over the last few years (and its rising price), the pitfalls and shortcomings of The Boring Company and their tunneling projects, the whole 'going to Mars in the next ten years' projection from SpaceX, etc., and just think that it seems like Musk's professional activities are always long on ambition and short on specifics. This is the case especially for that Neuralink business that he touts as well, which states that it will be using artificial intelligence to augment human cognition with a neural interface.  It just seems that the speculative nature of a lot of his ventures, the massive amounts of investor money being funneled into them, and the commensurate media and public attention that they gain is a little concerning as the results that these ventures produce are somewhat falling short of expectations. I get that Theranos was based on technology that literally did not exist, and than Musk does have some long-term potential for a lot of his businesses which do *have* documented successes, but I can't help but draw the comparison that maybe he is trying to deceive the public into thinking he can do *all* of these things and that the capital these ventures employ is inconsequential and he can just ride on potential.	1643056947.0	sbvy81	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbvy81/elon_musk_is_just_as_unscrupulous_as_elizabeth/	Elon Musk is Just as Unscrupulous as Elizabeth Holmes

57dld2mg	Often when a TV show, album, movie or video game is delayed - an influx of angry fans quickly flock online to complain about how this is outrageous and that they should of put back the release date in the first place. Some “fans” go too far and send death threats, or (debatably) even worse.  When a project is released to a new deadline, occasionally, it ends up like complete dogshit. I’m going to use Cyberpunk 2077 as an example, in which on release many loyal fans defended the game - claiming the idiots threatening the developers are the reason the game was rushed.  This is completely *WRONG* and to even suggest this, absolves the developers of criticism they rightfully need to receive. Even if this were the case, as horrible as it is to receive threats of violence, if you release a product early because of troll comments - you should not be in the entertainment industry.	1643059737.0	sbx0d6	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbx0d6/fans_are_too_often_blamed_for_when_a_product_is/	Fans are too often blamed for when a product is rushed.

48keklt9	Sometimes things can be overpriced, but in some cases the materials are more expensive because of the higher quality.  Personally I don’t have a set amount that I want my ring to be, but I know that some cheaper rings are cheaper because the metal and stone will be more prone to scratching or look bad after a period of time.  Also, real diamonds sparkle when the ring is polished.  I wanted a ring from Swarovski or Pandora for a long time before I realized they tarnish and the glass will scratch even though I like the look of their rings.  I also wanted a cubic zirconia ring and I still like them but I realized the quality isn’t the same.   But also, when I get married I would prefer to pick the ring with my fiancé before he proposes (or he may not surprise me, I’m fine with him asking me casually).  I don’t think expensive engagement rings are bad, but I admit that I think it’s wasteful to spend money on a ring beforehand just in case she says no or doesn’t like the ring just for the “surprise.”   But overall I do think the negative attitude towards expensive engagement rings comes from people who can’t afford them or are jealous.  It also comes from men who don’t wear them so they don’t care as much about how it looks over time.  If you can’t afford it, maybe ask your fiancé to pay half?	1643061419.0	sbxphq	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxphq/people_who_make_fun_of_expensive_engagement_rings/	People who make fun of expensive engagement rings or the people who have/want them do so because they generally can’t afford them.

2qc897go	Shakespeare was a playwright! Plays are meant to be watched and enjoyed on a fun night out, not read and analyzed in a classroom. I think it's awesome to read shakespeare and analyze it if that's what you want, but it's dumb that we're forced to do it in school. If schools want to teach shakespeare, the students should actually watch the plays (or be in a production themselves) instead of just reading through the scripts. English classes always made it seem like Shakespeare was this highbrow, overly complicated, no-fun-allowed peak of literature, when they were originally written to entertain the public, the poor in particular. Shakespeare is crass and funny and the language isn't even that confusing once you get used to it, and I'm sad that so many people think it's boring. I really think more people would like Shakespeare if school taught it differently.	1643061934.0	sbxwv9	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbxwv9/people_only_dislike_shakespeare_because_of_how/	People only dislike shakespeare because of how it's taught in schools
i5uxx73v	I did it.  I finally did it... I bought a couple of new TVs for the house.  The problem was, they were 4k TVs with that idiotic looking motion clarity technology (or whatever it is), the technology that makes foreground objects move in super-crisp resolution, all the way freeze-framing the background.  It's ridiculously unnatural looking and I hate it.  The human eye doesn't see like that.  We don't see "people" in the foreground as ultra-4k clarity down to your pores while everything else stays abssolutely static in resolution.  Our eyes are constantly shifting and readjusting for optimal clarity and situational awareness.  I was going to come to reddit to find a "help" sub and ask "How can I make my TVs not look stupid".  Fortunately Samsung built that feature right in - they call it "filmmaker mode", and it takes all of that ridiculous image correction out of the equation and makes your television look exactly like what it's supposed  to look like - a television.	1643062175.0	sby043	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sby043/4k_tvs_with_all_of_that_picture_correction/	4k TVs with all of that picture correction nonsense look stupid.

fl7s0	A lot of posts on Reddit revolve around "I'm not what my parents expected and that makes them sad, they are horrible people."  It's normal for parents to create narrative and build a world view of how they want their childs life to go. From the first day they hold their child they can't help but dream of what the future will hold. For the majority of parents this will fall within what is seen to be socially normal. Go to school, get a good job, get married, have babies etc etc. With their children being the most important thing in their life these hopes and dreams become deeply entrenched.  If their child doesn't follow the path they have imagined then it is normal for their world view to be challenged, and it is ok for parents to struggle with that.  What isn't ok is to try and force the path they dreamt of on their children when it becomes apparent that isn't the path the child wants to follow. They should support and love no matter what, whilst still being upset for the future they dreamt of but won't see.	1643063048.0	sbyca0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbyca0/being_upset_your_child_is_different_to_what_you/	Being upset your child is different to what you imagined is normal and acceptable
7mjnl5g8	He was in a competetive environment & had reason to suspect that he had been sabotaged. Initially, he respectfully demanded an explanation from Gary Busey, who didn't show due respect by looking Meat Loaf in the eye when questioned. He merely went about his business and walked straight passed without stopping to address the issue, as if to say "...your problem, not mine".  That rude response is what triggered Meat Loaf into his apparent "meltdown", but Gary Busey continued to add fuel to the fire by standing his ground when confronted & remaining adamant, which is fair enough...but he also knew Meat Loaf was on edge & chose a defensive stance, rather than a compassionate  one. This further enraged Meat Loaf who had every right to continue to remain angry even once the bag had been found, since the details of its disappearance remained unknown.   After the matter, Gary Busey went on record to insult Meat Loaf by claiming that "he had stolen his own integrity".

dra9ct01	This gatekeeping is extremely common on Reddit.  "OCD is not about being neat and tidy. OCD is believing your whole family will die if you don't flick the light switch 50 times."  "Depression is staying in bed for weeks at a time."  ~~Too~~ So many people default to listing off the most extreme symptoms of mental illnesses when asked to describe what mental illness is "really like," as if they believe that only those extreme cases are real mental illness and everything else is fake. It's like they forget that mental illness has levels of severity. You do not need to display these extreme behaviors and tendencies to have a mental illness. Sometimes, OCD does include keeping things clean and neat. It's not always "believing your family will die," sometimes it's just feeling a compulsive "itch" to do something for no reason. And some people with depression may hardly show any outward symptoms.  Yes, there are plenty of healthy people who treat mental illness like it's some sort of trend or personality trait, or who believe their normal emotions are mental illness. But only discussing extreme cases of mental illness could invalidate people with less-severe cases, causing them to believe their symptoms are not "real" enough to be real mental illness.

g5e73hoj	Please, don't play the victim and keep thinking people don't answer you because you're ugly, fat, old, toothless... because of your "race", religion, nationality or whatever... or because people are arrogant, impolite... That's just how these apps work, nothing personal. So stop feeling bad and thinking people are bad... and even condemning whole groups like "the girls/gays in this town are disgusting, they don't answer me".  If you are resentful and hurt like that, I have some news for you: **people don't answer you simply because not answering is the most normal thing in this world and it happens to everyone, you're not exclusive.**  A famous Brazilian youtuber did a 7-day experience on Tinder, he showed that the vast majority of girls didn't answer him... and he is VERY handsome (he was actually a model).  [https://youtu.be/mnHOte\_Z1OA](https://youtu.be/mnHOte_Z1OA)  Some people think it's more polite to say "sorry, you're not my type" - I think that's way more arrogant, nobody likes to be rejected point-blank. If you have no intentions to go out with people, either you dump them (more chances to worsen their self-esteem) or fool around with them with empty chats (that will create empty expectations). Just do your maths: silence is better - you finish then and there, no dumping and no expectations.  In fact, answering has its risks: some people cannot deal with rejection. They may find you arrogant, insist, stalk, even harass you and try to revenge. I've come across some crazy people on these apps who created fake profiles to stalk me... So I can say: instead of dumping someone or going on with some lame talk for the sake of "friendship", I think it's better to just stay quiet and end there - that's just easier and may prevent all the hassle.	1643066329.0	sbzkdu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sbzkdu/not_answering_people_on_dating_apps_is_not_rude/	Not answering people on dating apps is not rude and no one should feel annoyed about it

I think part of being a game developer, especially indie devs, is being able to write a good story. In my opinion, Scott is borderline incapable of this. His games have plot hole after plot hole, and in order to fill those plot holes he makes more games that just make more plot holes. Sometimes it even sounds like he barley knows the story or answer to his fucking games. Being a game developer definitely isn’t easy, I don’t think FNAF was even really meant to have a full fledged story at first, but after his games gained traction he could have planned out a story that made sense.	1643087658.0	sc5wj2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sc5wj2/scott_cawthon_is_kind_of_a_shitty_game_developer/	Scott Cawthon is kind of a shitty game developer.

To double-triple check my finding, the very same day we went to the supermarket and bought 1.5L bottles of regular Coca-Cola, Coke Zero, Pepsi and Pepsi Max. We put them all in the fridge and the next day we did a blind taste testing.   We pretty much came to the same conclusion. Pepsi Max was the superior drink out of the four, followed by regular Coke and Coke Zero, with regular Pepsi was at the bottom.   It changed my life and views about cola drinks. You should do a blind taste test too and not just go by your views, but by taste buds.

ay5nv89z	I too have in the past considered most animals to be dumb and 2 dimensional. However, after living in the bush with no electricity, running water or any other modern luxury, except a small hand held radio, for some years, I realised that the animals around me were infact quite intelligent and brilliant in their own way. Except turtles, my god, are they dumb. Cute though. Let me explain: I spent most of my time outside, either with my chickens or with the random kangaroos that originally emboldened themselves by breaking into my hut and stealing my wheatbix, Despite my 3 dogs. After a while of watching my chickens, i realised that they weren't empty minded idiots and infact were quite aware of their surroundings, not only of inanimate objects or things that moved or made noise, like cars, but of each other and other animals. The rooster, Mouldyhead as we affectionately called him, knew exactly how much his hens had eaten in any given amount of time and would spend a majority of his time finding food and taking it to the hen who had consumed the least. He knew well before us that our oldest hen, Milly, had reached her final days and he was far more keen a guard chicken than my even German-shepard. We also noticed after some time that they methodically comb areas in a specific search pattern, but depending on which chicken and what "rank" they held, for lack of a better term.  And that's just one chicken. Even the wasps that made my roof their home would do a similar thing, while searching for nesting materials, would search an area in a beautiful, almost programmed fashion, zig zagging from left to right and either lowering or increasing their height with each pass to the point that you could tell that they hadn't missed a single square centimeter of their target area. The kangaroos, which i now respect in a much more intense way, were a brilliant judge of character, and one we named radar, was after only a couple weeks, able to request different types of food with the gestures he made, bringing his little paws up to his mouth (actually might have been a girl, pretty faced wallaby). He loved sweet potato and would often tap on the metal bin which held our root vegetables. It became clear to me that the more time I spent watching any particular animal, the more I would understand their subtle genius. Whether these things be instinct or deliberate calculations didn't seem clear at first, but now i believe that a great deal of it was deliberate. They aren't just rooting around in the dark, grasping blindly. They are thinking a great deal. I believe that we do not attribute their actions with intent because it is extremely difficult for us to judge anothers intentions without facial expressions, words or gestures designed to communicate. Take for instance, the story of the king (from somewhere in either Africa or the middle east) who buried his treasure out in the desert and to find it, he took with him a camel and it's baby. He slaughtered the baby at the location of the treasure he had buried, making sure the mother watched, and from that day, the camel never forgot the location of its dead baby, taking the king back to his treasure many many years later (I think it was 30). We do not understand the function that allows some animals to remember the location of things like this, it may be instinct, it may be intellect, but either way, it is brilliant. This kind of information is extremely easy to find, if you don't believe me, do a small amount of exploring, or research for yourself. It is very easy for us to dismiss things like this, as it makes our lives a little less guilty.	1643096475.0	sc89ja	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sc89ja/people_who_greatly_underestimate_an_animals/	People who greatly underestimate an animal's intelligence, are themselves, an idiot.

3q0emdkm	This might be a bit of a niche post but here we go. The common consensus is that the series lost its horror factor and and went full action around Re4, but IMO classifying even the first game as “horror” is a bit of a stretch. Are there startling moments? Yeah (Dog hallway), are there unsettling aspects? Sure (Lisa), but I wouldn’t say any of it was even slightly scary. Maybe that stuff made you turn off the tv when you were like 10, but as an adult it’s just kinda eh. I’d classify RE1 as an action thriller at most, for gods sake the endgame is you blasting bug monsters with a grenade launcher then you use a rocket launcher to blow up a 8ft tall tube guy.   RE2 and 3 aren’t any better, in fact they’re worse since they give you a bigger more badass arsenal to blast zombies with. And yeah the bosses mutate and become grotesque abominations, but then they keep mutating and IMO it gets to a point where it’s so ridiculous I’m nowhere near scared, just mostly confused at what I’m looking at. Not to mention all the cheesy dialogue in the American dubs. Now of course RE7 came out and THAT game can be called horror (at least in the beginning) along with RE8 and the Big fetus section. I just hear people say the later RE games lost the horror but I think it was never there in the first place.

4cj4a0e2	I hear it all the time. "This room looks so aesthetic" "Wow, the colors you chose really makes this look aesthetic."  Something can't be "aesthetic". Something can only be of a certain aesthetic. It's a noun and not an adjective and it doesn't describe things in a set way. There are infinitely many aesthetics and they are used to categorize all kinds of visual, audible or even imaginary information based on what emotions it conveys/it is supposed to convey. A room can't be aesthetic, however it can resemble the aesthetic of an 80's interior design.  I believe that the wrong usage of the world is rooted in the vaporwave style with many pieces of art featuring the word "aesthetic" often with spaces between each letter. If you don't know the word, it being there without any context might make it seem like it was an adjective resulting in people using it as such. It's not something that makes me wanna smash my screen when I see people use it like that but it is certainly a minor annoyance.

hl963eku	One the arguments is about respect. You do not need to call someone by Mister or Misses in order to show respect. My wife is a teacher and they even call each other that. She addresses her principal and her school psychologist as Mister (insert name). It is so incredibly cringe. Are we to say that she can't "respect" her peers if she called them by their first name? That's nonsense.  As someone who has worked in corporate for 8 years now, I have worked for managers, directors, VP's, and even a member of the executive team for a publicly traded company, I have never ONCE called them by anything other than their first names. Yet we all have mutual respect for each other. Only time I have used anything else is when the person is a doctor or has a PhD. I'd call them by Dr. (insert name) but this has to do with their pedigree, which they've spent years and years perfecting. Most of these teachers only have up to Masters, which plenty in the corporate world has as well.  In the same manner, a high schoolers, who is only within a few years to being adults don't need to do the same with teachers. I've seen videos of teachers been offended by it. That's stroking their egos. A student not calling you Mr. or Ms. is NOT disrespecting you. They can easily disrespect you even if they DO call you that. For most high schoolers, they may even be at an age where they are working a part time job. I'm almost certain that they would not call their managers by anything other than their first names.	1643118681.0	sce7l7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sce7l7/making_high_schoolers_call_teachers_by_mister_or/	Making high schoolers call teachers by Mister or Miss/Misses is outdated and just strokes the teacher's ego

6gw59n4h	For reference I’m in my ealry twenties. Ever since I graduated college the general idea with adults I have noticed is that they always claim they don’t have the time to do anything fun or interesting.   So many people try to act so responsible to the point where it makes them come off as boring.  When we were youth this soul sucking energy didn’t really exist. I don’t know how to explain but everyone seemed genuinely more hopeful. Where did the idea come from that once you turn 21 you aren’t allowed to have fun and have to have a pessimistic attitude about everything.  Everyone is so caught up in their job or other responsibilities they forget how short life truly is and that it should at least tried to be enjoyable. I don’t know it just frustrates me because I still feel like a kid at heart and nobody I know really matches that energy. It’s depressing honestly.

9jvo0hx4	Especially in situations like college housing pairings. It’s not fair to either party. It’s so difficult to be forced to live with a roommate who has a severe peanut allergy and to have to be extremely careful about every single thing you bring into the house. No more favorites like peanut butter, Reese’s, many takeout places… all because of THEIR allergy. Furthermore, it sucks to be the person with the allergy and have to expect their roommates to change literally overnight or else they could die. I don’t want to be responsible for accidentally killing someone and such a sudden shift is hard to have thrust upon you. If a student’s issue mandates everyone else change their lifestyle habits and be extremely cautious, they should be in special accommodation housing with other people who have the same or similar allergies.

ijsdn	I work as a gig and rideshare driver and have avidly avoided going into the grocery delivery gigs for this one reason. Apparently your average American would rather YOU (Driver) carry their purchase of 2-3 water cases that weigh almost 15-20 something pounds each for the low cost of a barely 3 dollar tip for your hard work.  Whenever I get grocery orders on my actual food delivery gigs I always decline them now because somehow every other order is gonna be one of those customers.  I mentioned this now because I saw on my Amazon drivers group someone hauling about 5 packs of water bottles not from Nestle or Arrowhead but those expensive @ss FIJI water bottles cases which are apparently $30 each somehow... Which also reminded me of the time those SMART Water bottles came out and everyone started buying them from Best Buy at almost $3-5 dollars a bottle...  It doesn't even make financial sense either. Your average American Joe spends about $100-200+ a year on water bottle cases alone, $16 Billion on the national level and that's not to mention the tons of possible ecological impacts with plastic water bottles being one of the number one pollutants found in litter everywhere.  I've asked some people I know that ONLY drink bottled water and they apparently don't trust your local water sources and especially water filtration systems... That's fine I guess but they don't even have water gallons either... That's even weirder to me. Like an American will eat God knows what and then lecture you on the dangers of filter water or anything else that can help against the climate crisis...  Got to admit though, these water companies have done an amazing job of selling their "clean" water propaganda and labeling. Every bottle you find tells you all about their process and how much healthier their water is for you despite being higher in acidic in their pH values due to the cleansing after-process needed to keep water safe during it's shelf life. Sure it won't kill you but the idea that's it's totally "clean" water isn't true no matter what.  I guess for a lot of people it's more about convenience which pisses me off even more. I carry my reusable water bottle everywhere with me, holds 40oz+ and I have a larger canister in my car for those hot summer days to refill on my work days. I love the bottle not just because I'm a hippie earth loving tree hugger but it legit doesn't make sense to me anymore to have to buy water bottles by the case. I absolutely abhor it in my household because my Mom has her reusable bottles and I do as well but my Dad legit with the access and the many times I've implored him to just use a bottle so he doesn't have to spend more money out of the convenience he spites us by buying bottles everyday. Not only that he leaves them everywhere which pisses me off even more because while I do recycle I try not to even use if I can reuse so I don't have that much to recycle to begin with (which should be the goal...)   I have 2 filtration systems. I have a PUR water filter on my kitchen sink and while it does pour out slowly in order to filter everything properly, I love it because I don't have to get from the gallon as my big ass water bottles used to finish a full water gallon and didn't leave much for everyone else as I exercise a lot and work a lot so the first thing I do when I leave and return home is fill up and hydrate. I also have another more portable 2 gallon tank with its own faucet in my room so I don't wake up anyone sleeping in the room near the kitchen. Much more cost effective after the initial investment and I don't feel guilty about wasting water or plastic anymore. PLUS you can get similar water filters that are compatible with your system as a cheaper cost that the originals and they last almost as long as them too. Each filter should run you about 3-4 months at most before needing replacement, your standard 3 pack should last you about 10 and a half months at about $25-35 dollars a pack which would save you maybe hundreds to thousands of dollars every year depending on your water use. Better yet you don't need to recycle because you're already reusing and reducing at the same time. So no need to clean and prep for a visit to the recycling yard (which not everyone does either btw)  It just makes sense to me. It's even better when you get into the alkaline craze which I admit a bunch of it boasts some miraculous properties but it's still a good alternative or at least it can't hurt, don't quote me on that though as I still have trouble understanding the craze with alkaline water popularity.  Just don't fall for one of those door-to-door salesmen trying to trap people into a super expensive water filtration systems directly installed into their house because I've had one of those guys almost get my family a long time ago once.    I don't mean to be the Waterboy in this instance but it does annoy me seeing people walk out of Costco with their carts full of water bottle cases looking dumb hauling 50-70 lbs of water into their cars while I have to wait for their parking space to get my $5 rotisserie chicken or my dollar hotdog or pizza.  Sure some people could argue that while you saved here you spent there but every little bit makes a difference.   For the record I'm not trying to start a huge protest over water bottle companies or anything I'm just saying it doesn't make sense to me and it might be an unpopular opinion of mine. Nestle is still evil though.	1643121264.0	scf4cg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scf4cg/buying_water_bottle_cases_when_water_filters_are/	Buying water bottle cases when water filters are easily accessible and cheaper makes no sense.

3xalz	&#x200B;  His life consisted of peak experience after peak experience. After quitting heroin, his peak experiences derived from alcohol and food, and  constantly traveling the world. He was always indulgent as hell. He never tried enjoying life from an unpretentious, calm way. It was always "I have to be the coolest person ever experience the biggest, most awesome peak experiences ever." I know part of this is an assumption on my part, it's unpopular opinion, not dissertation station.   But I don't just think it's a problem with him, most Americans think life can only be enjoyed if you're eating the most exotic food, having the most extreme experiences, etc. It's engrained in our culture and media. Though he traveled the world over and over again, it's ironic he never picked up different ways to approach life from eastern cultures especially.   Sure his gf of the time was bad to him, but consider that most people might be hurt by something like that, very badly, but would find a way to move on, but not him. Ultimately I don't know why that was the final straw, but there was more underneath and I would say it's that he was ultimately a shallow person who did not know how to enjoy life in moderation. Perhaps he had an oversized ego that shatters easily because without substance to his personality there's not much left to keep his self esteem standing. I expect a lot of negative votes and trolls because that's how this sort of thing usually goes.	1643123099.0	scfr8b	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scfr8b/anthony_bourdain_killed_himself_ultimately/	Anthony Bourdain killed himself ultimately because his approach to life was wrong.

bx5qtqda	There is a very prominent narrative in america that you should look for a job you love and are passionate about, and accepting work in a field that doesnt light up your soul on a daily basis is resigning yourself to a miserable existence. I have found that this isnt really true. The most important thing is loving the people that you work with, being fairly compensated, and feeling well supported and valued by the leadership system. I've worked in a few fields that I loved (coffee when I was younger, and public health when I was older), and both attempts were generally ruined by things like malicious managers, poor work life balance, mean coworkers, poor communication, etc.   Now, I work in software. This was never what I imagined myself doing, and the work itself is only just fine. But I love my coworkers, I feel invested in by the company, my manager is kind and a strong leader, and I have plenty of room for growth and reason to believe that I will continue to grow in the company. I am well compensated and my employer regularly incentivises me to stay, and the work culture is fun. Suddenly, it stopped mattering that I'm wasn't passionate about software. The most important thing about your job isnt the actual work that you do, it's everything else.   &#x200B;  \--> This is probably not true if your work is something like being a nurse that is really time consuming and exhausting.

7d5ao7fr	Although everyone's life story is different and our highs and lows come at different times in our lives, it seems like lots of adults genuinely just forget what being a teenager was like. For the majority of people I know, myself included, it was anything but the totally happy, carefree time portrayed in the movies, where all you have to worry about is getting a milkshake with your girlfriend or sneaking out to have a drink with your friends. A lot of us were working almost full-time from the time we were 15 or 16 years old in addition to school. Let's be honest: high school fucking sucked for a lot of us, too. Adolescence is for a lot of people a time of extreme angst, depression, and uncertainty, as well, even if a lot of it blows over in the end. Not to mention that teenagers are usually entirely at the mercy of their parents, and it's an uncomfortable truth that a lot of families are abusive and dysfunctional, more than we like to admit. It's definitely not easy to be an adult and pave your own way, but there are pros and cons to all situations. So many people I know act like being a teenager was wholeheartedly better than being an adult, but there are ways being an adult is obviously better than being a teenager; for example, lots of adults live with their SOs and get to see them every day. It's also a freedom we take for granted that we can spend our days off as we choose, or what we do after we get off work, for example. Of course, we have lots of other obligations, but nobody short of the law can actually force us to do anything we don't want to do. If you want to stay up all night browsing Reddit or laze around all day the next day, you have nobody to answer to. Being a teenager wasn't all good and being an adult isn't all bad.

eekaf0du	I think this way, because for example every post about my country Finland is just caricatures of what we are depicted to be, but they don’t accurately represent the majority of the residents here.  I feel like this kind of content is entertaining to some, because it’s kind of patriotic and makes you feel proud of being a citizen of that country.  For example Finns love to circlejerk the bullet points that it’s really cold here, we go to the sauna often, are quiet or “unsocial” or we have Sisu or that Finland is the happiest country in the world.  Non of those things are in anyway special to our specific country, Sisu (*a Finnish concept described as stoic determination, tenacity of purpose, grit, bravery, resilience, and hardiness*) will die along with our veterans and the last stat about happiness doesn’t exactly mean that much when you think about it, it’s just an emotion that can easily change day by day.

flhty	NO, I'm not trying to imply religious texts are works of fiction. Let's get that clear.   I think everyone needs something to have faith in, something to believe in and something to live by. Something that provides them a moral code even.   Conventionally, that would be religion. Some people vibe with that, and some people don't. And both are fine.   Some people find meaning in the media they consume, and if they're exposed to it at a young age (or even then), they might derive their morality and ethics from said media.   And that's completely fine, in my opinion. The only trouble is if they take away a harmful message from it. But that's also an issue with religion, so no stones can be thrown that way.   Someone who has faith in Marvel/DC/insert superheros here might strive to be as good as the heroes they watch/read. Learning responsibility from Spider-Man, Iron Man might help them through alcohol addiction issues, etc.    Someone who watches My Little Pony might become kinder and more open to others because of it. I think that's what the show's about, I haven't actually watched it.   Someone who likes Doctor Who might hold faith in the Doctor. They might do their best to follow their values of being kind, standing up for those that need it and share that sense of wanderlust and love for the world they live in.   And again, people can easily internalise harmful messages too.   Someone who reads Divergent might think that people can and should be separated by arbitrary personality traits.   The older Disney films might teach that women are to be passive and exist only as prizes for men.

Life is unfair and they just happened to get the good end of it. What do you expect them to do? Reject the money and good future?   When tiktokers actually try to do something that requires talent like singing or acting, people get even more mad. What? So it's bad that they have no talent but cringe for them to try to get one? It's just pure jealously over the fact that tiktokers got lucky and others didn't. People need to stop comparing themselves and stay in their lane  Edit: no one cares that you personally dont watch tiktok. Coming on this post and telling everyone how dumb you think the app and the people who use it are makes you look immature. People use the app for a ton of things (cute animal videos, comedy skits, sharing hobbies, etc) so trying to boast how you're not as sTUpId as those darn zoomers to enjoy such "dumb" videos makes you look insecure and #not-like-the-other-social-media-users	1643127902.0	schjjg	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/schjjg/people_need_to_get_over_the_fame_tiktokers_have/	People need to get over the fame tiktokers have

c6fx8gar	disclaimer: I may not be able to give good examples on how this could be applied, so please focus on the main idea, and please excuse my english.  for example, if someone stole from a store, and lets say the punishment is a couple of months in prison, we should work on improving their ethics during their time in prison. when they get out we put them under observation.  lets say they do it again and we arrest them. the punishment this time is 5 years. but we also have something called "obligatory period". we work on their ethics again. if we think we're almost sure they won't do it again, they get out at the end of the obligatory period. if they don't show any sort of improvement at all we extend the obligatory period. and so on.  so even if we take for example a person who raped a couple of children. and let's say the initial punishment is 20 years. they might get out after lets say 3 years if they show enough improvement.  but of course long-term or maybe even permanent observation after getting out is necessary in both cases  AGAIN, DISCLAIMER: I may not be able to give good examples on how this could be applied, so please focus on the main idea.	1643128746.0	schuuu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/schuuu/we_shouldnt_judge_criminals_completely_based_on/	We shouldn't judge criminals completely based on how bad their actions were, but rather more on how much time they take to become normal people

7dmynz0j	A more honest description of most products that market themselves as “eco-friendly” would be “marginally less eco-harmful than similar products”. The result of the vast majority of consumer products is a net environmental negative, where the environment is worse off than it was if the product was never produced. Buying “eco-friendly” toilet paper made from bamboo? Great, but don’t describe it as “eco-friendly” when a natural forest was cut to grow the bamboo, the bamboo was processed in a factory powered by fossil fuels, and then packed on a container ship and sent halfway around the world before you wipe. You can’t describe a cobalt based battery in an electric car as environmentally friendly when the net impact of that battery on the planet is negative. Sure, it might be less destructive to the environment than a diesel truck, but it’s still destructive. Destructive in that it is the result of metal mining, fossil fuels were used in its production, and undoubtedly have a hand in generating the electricity used to power it. This is obviously an incredibly complicated issue and I’m moving beyond just a discussion of the “eco-friendly” terms, but point being, let’s just be a bit more honest with ourselves about exactly how “friendly” we can ever be to this planet.	1643130205.0	sciep3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sciep3/calling_consumer_products_environmentally/	Calling consumer products “environmentally friendly” and “good for the environment” is a lie.

c47h3w81	Nothing marked me more frustrated than hearing people curse like a 6th grader who just learned curse words.

If someone drops the word fuck in a sentence more than once it just sounds like they can't think of anything else. The creativity is lacking and when you finish with "like, fuck man, like...yeah" you sound like an idiot. Why can't you try to say something that doesn't sound like you're actively being aggressive or interesting?

guzod59o	Throughout the course of history, access to information and knowledge was a privilege of the upper class and elite. It was only 120 years ago when having the ability to read became more common than not in the USA. For the next century, access to the frontiers of information remained centralized in the universities. The internet was originally invented for use between universities, so that they could send each other information electronically. Little did they know at the time that this information highway would be onboarded by the average man and woman. Access to ideas is no longer the rarity it once was. While it made sense for most of history to defer to the Ph D, this is increasingly becoming less sensible. Aside from the narrow pocket of focus in which the Ph D has specialized, they are hardly more likely than a random passerby to be well read. When I see Ph D put in a Twitter name, it doesn't mean anything to me unless you specify exactly what your research is for. If you would have people defer to your judgment on general topics due to your Ph D, then you would be unfairly claiming intellectual maturity. To be fair, this applies to almost all professional designations. However, Ph Ds are the most likely to put Ph D in their name and are most likely to expect general deference. A deference which, while it should exist to an extent, does not come close to a garuntee of intellectual superiority.	1643132226.0	scj65f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scj65f/the_level_of_deference_owed_to_ph_ds_is/	The level of deference owed to Ph.

My advice is: get to know people, gain their trust, get friends. When you are getting bullied, you have a backup. Another one would be to ruin your bully's reputation, so that they lose their social status in front of everyone. If nothing else helps, and you've asked them to stop. Punch those suckers.

3fi0jgh	The reason people are so divided on whether it’s okay to “ghost” is because people are using that word in radically different ways.   People often say that ghosting is fine if you’ve only had a few dates, or have just been talking on a dating app ... but those aren’t established relationships where you can have any expectation of continued contact anyway. If you stop responding during those early/casual stages, that’s perfectly normal. Someone who barely knows you doesn’t need a paragraph about how the timing isn’t right.   It’s only “ghosting”- called as such because you suddenly disappear out of someone’s world- if you were already part of their life. This term makes sense if you had reason to expect consistent contact from them, like you were texting every day or seeing each other consistently. It makes no sense otherwise.   This obviously isn’t restricted only to serious, long, or monogamous relationships. Even a FWB could ghost you, if you’ve been in a routine or have seen each other frequently for a while. Friends can ghost you too. Anyone who would need a proper reason to suddenly disappear from your life and refuse to answer any message or call. Someone who, if they stop responding suddenly, you would feel the need to check on.   But if you didn’t have an established, consistent, and active relationship of some sort, then you weren’t ghosted. They just stopped responding.	1643134237.0	scjyk8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scjyk8/the_word_ghosting_should_be_reserved_for_when_you/	The word “ghosting” should be reserved for when you were actually in a relationship.
22dosi5t	 People always try to tell me I’m weird because I’m not proud of my country. I find some things to be great about it, somethings I don’t like. But “proud” isn’t a word I’d use. I often find pride to be a negative trait. It’s a deadly sin for a reason. And I’m not necessarily void of it. I often feel proud of the things I’ve accomplished, whether that’s good or bad. But I had nothing to do with the status of my country or how it is today. I didn’t choose to be born in my country. And also it’s just lines man made on a map. I think showing some type of favoritism towards your people, culture, race, ethnicity, etc is such a weird concept and it’s just a catalyst to divide. I may have more in common with someone half way across the world then I would someone with the same passport. When I watch sporting events like the Olympics and people are so wrapped up in their country winning, I can’t help but feel like it’s strange. If someone’s from my country won, it was a win for them. Not a win for me or the country. For me to take some ownership of the win because we happened to be born in the same country just makes zero sense to me. My identity is far beyond what country I’m from.

62f46t77	This will upset true believers and those who claim to have had wild success, but none of the established diet programs are designed for you to truly succeed. You will cherry-pick elements of the diet that you like and ignore others, causing you to go through the following stages:  Stage 1: You feel great about your initial success, and get cheered on by a welcoming community of fellow believers who swear that their lives have changed forever, and who shout down anyone who questions the orthodoxy. Your posted successes help to recruit more believers to buy into the program.  Stage 2: You hit a plateau or gain a little weight. You feel guilty and frustrated. Hare-brained advice that you solicit from your fellow believers encourages you to restrict even more. You ignore the sabotaging  impact this advice has on your physiology, because you really want to have the same success as your fellow believers claim. You want to post that beautiful downward weight-loss graph so badly! You may or may not bounce back into Stage 1, but you'll be back!  Stage 3: You eventually move on, because that program "doesn't work for you anymore." You are now absolutely certain that any failure is the fault of the program or to some undiagnosed hormonal issue. You don't want to hear that the severe restrictions you imposed on yourself might have sabotaged you. After regaining much of the weight (and about 80% of dieters do that within a year), you find the next magic solution that will get the job done quickly. And the recruitment cycle continues.  I'm not saying that long-term weight loss is impossible. But just imagine a diet company having the courage to promote a long, slow, difficult, and sometimes lonely process that will lead to long-term change. I doubt they would get many recruits.	1643135457.0	sckflt	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sckflt/you_will_likely_fail_at_every_commercial_diet/	You will likely fail at every commercial diet plan that you try

5sqrg1mu	We recently had a strike here for our grocery stores where the workers and union were fighting for better wages, sick time, healthcare and a few other things. All over Nextdoor people expressed support for these workers, people honked feverishly when driving by-and that’s great. However these same people will walk into another business where workers are being treated even worse and shop or eat there without a care in the world. Even if employees express how they feel on a public platform, the place has high turnover or there is visible animosity between workers and managers these people will patronize the business because there is no one putting the business on blast about their bad business practices because why should anyone just believe the workers directly? Don’t act like you care about lower wage workers when there is a strike but continue to shop at a business that constantly has staffing issues or staff that have come together to publicly discuss how badly they are treated.

Yes, but they are still cute, while Charmander is probably the 2nd least cute first stage starter only behind Snivy, but Snivy is still better because it easily has the most personality out of any starter Pokemon.	1643136800.0	sckxo1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sckxo1/charmander_is_the_worst_first_stage_starter/	Charmander is the worst first stage starter

asubitpz	For US streaming services you know exactly what you're getting into with TV-G through TV-14, but it's the wild west when the rating hits MA and without the aide of third party sources. With TV-MA it's impossible to know if you're getting two f-bombs, a bloody shooting, and a mild sex scene with no nudity, or a gore-fest orgy with lingering nudity and f-bombs as conjunction; Think of it this way, Marvel's "Luke Cage" is the same rating as "The Boys" and "The Witcher". I personally can't handle the latter two, but Luke was fine.   The FCC released a statement [here](http://www.tvguidelines.org/resources/Release_091621.pdf) in September that all services *should* display (which if I understand lawyer lingo means "ought to not have to") the rating and content guides for shows *at the time of playback* but I feel this isn't enough. In my opinion, the content guide would be more useful on display at the video description.   In addition, a new rating system needs to be modernized for today's streaming. TV-MA just doesn't cut it anymore for the reasons listed above, but having age-based ratings doesn't either - the ratings need to be more clear up front about content or MA should be broken into tiers.	1643138589.0	sclm40	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sclm40/tvma_is_too_broad_and_tv14_too_rigid/	TV-MA is too broad and TV-14 too rigid
fdnr9xla	It sucks but if your life is at risk for eating anything that can easily be cross contaminated in a food rush, you shouldnt be going there. Fast food workers and restraunt workers, especially now, are under staffed and under paid. For the most part theyre not going to have the time to pick apart the menu items for you when they can have to attend to many other customers. Its too easy to forget small requests when youre overwhelmed with customers.   After hearing about that man who assulted a teenage girl for a smoothie he ordered at a place he knew used peanut butter in many other smoothies for his son, with a severe food allergy, my blood boiled. I've worked in fast food before and I've had customers threaten violence for far less so its hard to sympathise with him.   Abosuletly the employees should of taken the procautions, but, from what im hearing, the man never told them it was for a food alleregy, he really expected them to just read his mind. The man should of never put his hands on that girl, he should of been with his son at the hospital and taken the steps to sue the chain.   That man is an awful father and cannot do the bare minimum to protect his son. He could of safely made a smoothie for his kid at home where he knew there would be no peanuts.

7ioezbd2	If you are like me chances are you have been inundated with a barrage of Mobile Phone Spam Calls and Text Messages, the problem is at least in the United States is that Mobile Phone Spam is treated as a misdemeanor and carries a $10,000 Fine. I believe that is merely a slap on the wrist, I believe that most spam farms are monetarily operated by cryptocurrency and not physical cash. If anything they should not be allowed to use cryptocurrency to pay off any fines. The fines should be increased ten-fold depending on the severity of the spam context, for instance if it is related to financial, warranty or advertising wire fraud (which a good percentage of them are) the fines should easily top $500,000 in legal tender on top of serving a sentence of up to 15 years in prison, failure to pay the fine will be seen as an act of contempt and will result in additional fines and or time in prison.

9yyb32uj	There seems to be a trend in recent years where Hollywood and the media try their best to make most of the villains in TV and film seem as human as possible. Making the viewer feel more sympathy for them.  Usually these characters get the short end of the stick their entire lives, which causes them to eventually snap. Or they become part of some radical ideology that KINDA makes sense when you think about it. But 9 times out of 10, the villains are often portrayed to be the victim and society the REAL monster.  What happened to psychos being psychos? Take the Joker movie. I don't want to feel sorry for the joker, I want to be shocked by his cruelty. I don't want to see a good man driven to his wits end, I want to see a naturally homicidal maniac who kills people for fun.

hrig2r1c	Most people find it annoying when you pick out your outfit for the day, decide which shoes to wear, but happen to pick the wrong socks. You don’t realize they are the “wrong socks” until you leave…then all of a sudden you start to feel your socks slowly slide off your heels with every step until both socks are bunched up at the arches of your feet leaving your heels completely exposed inside your shoes. As soon as an opportunity presents itself you fix your socks and breathe a sigh of relief, but as soon as you start walking again, without fail your socks fall right back down to the middle of your feet with your shoes on. At this point you just accept fate and reside to wearing your socks halfway off your feet inside your shoes for the rest of the day!   While most would find this occurrence devastating, I would consider the feeling “awkwardly comfortable”. When my socks fall down in my shoes, I don’t think how annoying it is, I wonder how far will my socks slide down before they stop and how long will I leave them there before I decide to fix them. I’ve become so accustomed to the feeling of my socks being halfway down in my shoes so long that when I fix them I just wait for them to fall back down again because I miss the feeling of my socks being down in my shoes.  I have been on a search for the perfect socks that no matter how many time i fix them they slide back halfway off inside my shoes when I walk. I love the feeling of my socks being halfway off inside my shoes but not as much as feeling my socks slide down…I love the moment I feel my sock slipping past my heel and making it’s way to my arches….I only pull my socks up to repeat this process.  The majority of people HATE this feeling…because socks are meant to stay up, not fall halfway off your feet when you walk. I really don’t care about that, I actually enjoy feeling my socks slide off my feet inside my shoes, I will wear my shoes looser and my socks smaller just to achieve this. I wonder if I am alone in this 🤔😂	1643142586.0	scn494	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scn494/i_enjoy_the_feeling_of_my_socks_falling_down/	I enjoy the feeling of my socks falling down inside my shoes

5pm2d651	Time is money and people who waste it acting befuddled in processing their payment should financially compensate the people behind them.   How many times have you waited in a line to make a purchase, things are moving along until that one idiot's turn comes up and they act perplexed when it comes to payment. They take forever to whip out a credit card or fumble for change or act confused in how to use the point of sale system like they've never done it before. People should have their cash or card at the ready as if they were about to pay the fucking soup nazi with the same fear of repercussions if they mess up in the process.   How would this work? I don't know maybe something like a timer starts once all items are scanned and after 30 secs (which is being generous) if no payment has been initiated then a financial penalty starts accruing that would then be equally distributed to the number of people waiting in line behind the goober as a discount applied to their tab.  Obviously there would be exceptions like for senior citizens, foreign tourists, children or in self-checkouts where it's not practical to have your payment in hand while your trying to scan your own items. But it's not fair to everyone to have their time wasted because the person in front of them was busy diddling their phone or is too stupid to efficiently execute a basic activity and so they should be disincentivized financially for their ineptitude.	1643142969.0	scn9e4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scn9e4/people_who_take_too_long_to_pay_for_things_should/	People who take too long to pay for things should be financially penalized if there is a line behind them.

ke24s	So I'm back at college after a break for a few years. I got a job in my field just prior to graduation and am now comfortable enough in my career and finances to finish off my degree. I'm lucky enough to have a Community College nearby for me to be able to take two of my final three required classes. I attended this same Community College about eight years ago and have noticed a major increase in younger students who have really high opinions of themselves and anger toward the professors.  Because it's a Community College many of the people around me are first or second year undergraduate students who are mostly doing general education classes and lower level major classes.  I swear, the way these students talk it's as if they believe they are already graduate students. They already believe because they enrolled as a certain major that they are essentially an expert in that field. I'm currently in Physics 1 and more than a few of the students have already decided that everything from the professor's expectations, to his heavy accent is a problem.   Some quotes I've heard already:  >"The professor is bullshit, I'm about to drop and find a Engineering Program that's worth my time."  >"This stuff isn't even important and he wants us to write it out on the lab? WTF"  >"I didn't know we were supposed to do that. If my grade isn't fixed by tomorrow I'm filing a complaint."  >"Why would I need a graphing calculator? I'll just use Desmos."  >"How is this dude a professor? You can barely understand him."  >"He just looks for points to take off. Fuck that. He wants to grade for completeness and not accuracy."  >"I'm going to grill him tomorrow. Because we're adults and we're allowed to have opinions on how he's teaching."  There's more I've just managed to black it out. This is two weeks in and these people haven't even touched the surface of what upper division classes will be. Like bruh, the dude is a PhD in Physics and you're out here in Physics 1.

18spdsd	Players simply are the most toxic, and sometimes vile, people to exist in a social setting. They literally tear others apart over anything and everything. Call people horrendous names, abuse game mechanics either because they can or just to mess with other people. Along with simply being a poison to games the majority of the time in how they interact with the game.   Take OW for instance, right now its in long term maintenance mode which is a factor as to why the game is dying out. Yet the players are horrendously toxic, and simply abuse toolkits to easy mode the game, and in turn say what they think an edgelord would say constantly. That in reality would make the edgiest of edgelords blush given its simply being hateful and racist.   Then New World, while it had it's initial flaws, was set up to go well, until the players in the game abused duping bugs so bad. That they permanently destroyed the economy in the game to the point where they simply would have to relaunch the game with fixes in place to salvage it. I think honestly the game is just going to crash and burn thanks to this.  Then finally we can look at WoW, which has an outstanding structure, and has a lot of lore and the like. Yet due to recent events, and the evolution of modern social media behavior, has simply caused a decline in active players. As from my experiences of playing, the number one reason why people quit is due to social interactions in game. Like its horrible how badly players troll others, ruin aspects of the game cause there is no consequence. Then just rinse and repeat till the cows come home or they get IP banned, which still doesn't stop them entirely.   All in all how the game is designed does play a huge factor in how the game will turn out. As in the case of wildstar it was simply tuned towards the top 1% of players, and meant the more casual crowd was turned away and cause the game to crash due to that. Yet players also dictate a lot how a game will go given the above examples I provided. In that it scares me how badly people behave right now, how quick to anger they are. How much they seem to enjoy inflicting misery unto others, along with just generally being unfun to be around or play with. Which right now sadly makes up a lot of the players bases in a lot of MMO's, save for the ones like FF that bans players for bad behavior and toxic behavior. I guess with the new requirement for TPM's for windows 11 may bring players in line more. As now they can have their machine banned which means they can't just make a new account. Yet in the end of it all players seriously can destroy an MMO, which is just common place right now sadly.	1643147166.0	scotbu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scotbu/players_are_the_reason_why_mmos_are_dying/	Players are the reason why MMO's are dying

4n94f0ns	I'd like to preface this post by saying that I love his works and can fully appreciate how influential he was to future generations of horror writers. He does however have a very noticeable trait of over explaining things with adjectives to an almost ridiculous degree. Nowhere is this more apparent than in his very influential story "At the Mountains of Madness".   I recently read this story for a second time and it was honest to God making me laugh at certain points because of how extremely over the top his layering of adjectives is. Almost every single sentence would have several adjectives fully fleshing out nearly every aspect of the thing being described. Almost every single benign object or thing in the story. Every stone must have an eon-dead hideousness. Every breeze must have a terrible alien insideousness only fathomed by eons past. Shit like that. Then in a following sentence he breakds down the entire history of said rock, giving an entire picture of its shape (again having a sinister alien shape to it) and age. This goes on for dozens of pages.   A lot of his works could be shortened considerably and still be just as endearing if they were stripped of a LOT of their adjectives.   Let me make up a paragraph describing what I mean. Here is how H.P. Lovecraft would have written a paragraph about himself walking to the store:  "Upon exiting the opaque and vaguely sinister frame of the oaken ashy door of my decrepit, eon-darkened apartment building, the sinisterly ambiguous breeze of the eon-dead winds of an arctic storm struck me as if sent by an eon-dead unknowable horror from icy depths forever dead and hidden from mortal men. These depths, horrible and diseased in their implication, once held court to a most terrible ancient race of blowing beings to evil and mind-destroying to describe. Beings whos mere mention bring up only the most dark, terrible thoughts in me as I began walking down the crumbling walkway towards the dimly lit corner store. The ancient primordial cold slapped me in my teary eyed face, a face which had not yet adjusted to the unfathomable emptiness of that awful cold breeze...."   And so on. I could keep going but you get the point.   This is a style of writing that only H.P. Lovecraft was really made famous for, and I don't think he's a very good writer because of this. He peppers adjectives into his stories so liberally because he isn't confident in explaining to the reader exactly what he was envisioning with the stories. When in reality, the insane amount of adjectives seems to confuse the reader more than helping them see what he was talking about. I found myself re-reading a lot of portions of his stories to try and cut out the fluff. He should have done that himself, but in my belief could not do so because he didn't think people would understand what he was talking about.   Could any of you understand what the hell i was talking about in my theoretical "walking to the store" post?  In the end, people still loved his work. I do do. There was supposedly a movie being made about this story but I can see why the project was scrapped. It's such a fantastic premise for a story. A hidden ancient ruin of a civilization high up in the mountains, and only recently discovered and explored by man. Two unfortunate men who discovered a far more sinister and horrifying secret buried in the ice of an ancient ruin. But once you cut out the adjectives you begin to see that the majority of the book is just explaining and explaining and explaining and explaining. Not good for movies.   So it is my opinion that H.P. Lovecraft was not a very good writer but a passionate one.	1643147622.0	scoylr	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scoylr/hp_lovecraft_was_not_a_very_good_writer_due_to/	H.P.

3syj0r3f	Love the characters, love the ideas, always been a big fan and been watching since the day it aired, BUT... it's just not laugh out loud funny with its jokes and is perhaps stronger with its visual and reference gags.  I think at a push I could argue that across an entire season there are less verbal jokes that land than there is in one entire episode of certain classic Simpsons. I'm well aware of the writing staff history of both shows and why they work so well, but I just don't think that it comes close to being one of the 'funniest' shows and I actually feel like the writers failed in that department with regards to the standards *they* were hoping to set.   Also, I dare say, there is a hint that some of the voice acting, maybe even just the casting, didn't channel that correct energy for the characters (but that's a hard one to judge or imagine, so I'm going to stick to judging the writers!) But it's worth pointing out that with cartoons, sometimes the voice alone can make me laugh. But for some reason, except for perhaps Zapp and the Prof occasionally, these don't.   Certain characters, despite enjoying them on screen and as part of the gang, have absolutely zero going on for me in the humour department. The first that come to mind are Hermes and Amy, who really leave me hanging with so many quips and one liners that it does kind of leave scenes falling flat.  I'm not saying it doesn't have some great lines, Fry, the Prof, Bender and Leela, and of course Zapp all have many laugh out moments, along with many others. I just wouldn't rank it as an all out 'funny show' and I feel its emotional moments are far more memorable and impactful than it's overall sense of humour.

e05a8vdo	back in 2018 when i was still in high school, we had a bit of downtown in the class on friday so i got to making conversation with my teacher about a lord of the rings event that i would be attending with my mother, aunt, and cousin. i am a huge lord of the rings fan and so was that teacher so we had a great conversation. i eventually told her that i really didn\`t know which i like more, the books or the movies. the teacher was quick to say "herequeerandgreat, the books are always better".   although i really didn\`t know my answer at the time, i have recently come to the conclusion that i like the peter jackson trilogy more then the books. to preface, i have indeed read the books. i listened to them on tap and they are good. however, they are not flawless. there is alot of really unnecessary plots and fluff thrown into the books. not to mention, so many characters that it\`s hard to keep track of. the audiobook for return of the king that i listened to was a full eight hours in length.  the movies on the other hand are not only essential viewing for any fantasy fan but for any movie buff in general. peter jackson did an amazing job with these movies, keeping the good parts and doing away with the not so good parts. the trilogy excludes parts that could be considered filler and keeps the story mostly straight. sure, the films are quite lengthy but, with a story as epic as lord of the rings, that can\`t be helped. but, the movies were only as long as they needed to be. and then, there\`s everything else that makes the movies good. the acting is top notch, the music is beautiful, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the quality is just really good. it\`s my favorite trilogy of all time and is one of the few examples i can think of wherein the adaptation is better then the original source material.

80t3t8zj	I think sites that allow you to gift significant sums of money for individuals such as streamers should require the spender to confirm this via 2FA. There are many reasons I feel this needs to be in place:  &#x200B;  1. You could accidently input the incorrect amount. 2. Your child or someone not yourself could use your account without your consent making this purchase. 3. You may feel overwhelmed emotionally by an individual to donate large amounts of moneys.  The last point is something I feel strongly about especially in reference to streamers. Donating to a streamer you enjoy is perfectly fine, however. I feel that there are some that might skew this momentary means of satisfaction and being noticed at the detriment of their own personal welfare. Having some method of confirmation will give the spender a moment to think about their purchase and weigh the options they have.  When I watch large streamers and see viewers sometimes spend hundreds of dollars to the streamer for a brief moment of recognition I worry that although some may have this purchase well within their financial means, others might be viewing this spending as more important than their own personal wellbeing.	1643150976.0	scq71f	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scq71f/sites_where_you_can_gift_or_donate_significantly/	Sites where you can gift or donate significantly large sums of money should require 2FA to confirm the transfer of such a large amount.

tf24i	I’m American but visit the UK pretty often. Despite how much it’s memed, I actually love the food there.   It gets a bad rep for being bland or boring, but that’s not been my experience.  The “pub food” culture is great. Shepards pie … Fish & Chips … it’s the epitome of comfort food.   “Sunday Roasts” are the tits. Roasted beef or lamb, roast potatoes, veggies, Yorkshire Pudding, gravy…. What more could you want?  British style Indian food and Kebabs are super good  You can get delicious meat filled pasties everywhere for like 1 GBP.   If you go to a decent place the seasoning level isnt bland.   Not to mention you get to eat all of these in adorable pubs that have been in operation longer than the US was even a country.   Yea they have some boring stuff and it’s not always  the healthiest, but so does everywhere. They’ve mastered the art of simple, cozy cooking that always hits the spot.	1643153459.0	scr404	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scr404/british_food_is_actually_pretty_awesome/	British food is actually pretty awesome.

aaqcsqyv	They’re both amazing movies easily in the top 5 all time conversations.  But this theory that Godfather 2 is better than Godfather 1 is asinine.  Think about all the quotable lines from part 1. The romance that part 2 did not display. The rise of a Don that did not want to be a Don initially.  Godfather 1 had a Sonny hot headed and ready for whatever, whenever.   Let’s just forget about Fredo for argument sake; He was an idiot in both films.  On the flip side Tom was equally good in both films so we can call that one neutral as well.  Marlon vs Robert? Now this is where the real separation is in both films. Think about it? Who’s been quoted and imitated more for the last 50 years!  Love Dinero the Raging Bull Casino hero! But Brando was iconic is his role of Vito Corleone. Sleeping with the fishes, Horse head in bed, don’t ever take sides against the family,we could go on and on…  Now that “This is the business we’ve chosen” line is a great one! But Godfather 1 has at least 5 of those.  Last but not least; the ending - Just an avalanche of great cinema from Part 1. Even in Part 2 they had to bring back a flashback from the greatness of Godfather 1 (Michael joining the army).  Still love both films but please stop with the GF2 better than GF1 narrative.	1643153646.0	scr6cs	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scr6cs/godfather_1_is_way_better_than_godfather_2/	Godfather 1 is way better than Godfather 2

10wx1y	Everyone's situation is unique.  I am 38, moved back to my family home five years ago. Why? Several reasons, one being that my sibling is severely disabled and as my parents age, they needed my support.  I have a roof over my head, food on my plate, security and safety. I work full-time during the week, manage the household chores, care for my sister on the weekends.  But if all you knew about me was my age and that I lived at home, assumptions would be made.  Maybe life hasn't worked with you, maybe you're struggling with addiction recovery or unemployment. Maybe you've gotten out of an abusive relationship.  And sure, there are people who aren't necessarily living at home for any of the above reasons. But even so, judging a person for their journey is unnecessary and unkind.  The next time you hear of someone in their 30s, living with their parents, maybe consider there's a reason why, whether you deem it 'worthy' or not and the last thing that anyone in such a situation needs is your negativity and judgement.  And if you're like me, just living life in a way that works, don't beat yourself up.

I understand people who haven’t been around pro athletics may not realize this, but many of these leagues are built on them. When your favorite player recovers 8x faster than a normal human, it’s not just diet and PT. Yes, Barry Bonds used anabolic steroids in his career.

38o5ez5w	R6 Extraction has been getting a lot of heated reviews on YouTube mainly from R6 Siege players. Such as calling it a game that fails before it even takes off. In my opinion, this is because Siege players just wanted it as content for R6 Siege instead of a separate game. Additionally, R6 Siege has one of the most toxic communities in video games. So toxic, they had to remove the "vote to kick" button entirely because experienced players would kick new players instantly. Even more toxic, they had to rework the entire team kill penalty because the community always found away around it to get new players banned.   As someone that enjoys Co-Op games, R6 Extraction is really fun to play with others. It may not be the best game, groundbreaking, or a heavily competitive live service game. But it's a fun, simple multiplayer game that feels like a breath of fresh air in never ending competitive attempts with games coming out these days like xDefiant.	1643155116.0	scrppa	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scrppa/r6_extraction_isnt_a_bad_game_and_the_reviews_are/	R6 Extraction isn't a bad game, and the reviews are biased by an already hostile community

bqiae	The obnoxiously loud Harley Davidson motorcycle interrupting your quiet cup of coffee on the patio. The lowered Honda Civic blasting so much bass out their windows it makes your body shake.  In motorcycle school, you are taught to make yourself known as visibly and audibly as possible for safety reasons. Wearing colourful or reflective gear helps your presence be more known especially in lane change situations where a car might not see your comparatively smaller profile and then merge into you. Same with having a bike that can be heard loud and clear.  Now I see it from a safety perspective.  I've heard enough stories from people involved in motorcycle accidents where the other car driver says "I couldn't see them, I didn't know they were there". I've also seen enough times where a bike revving at a stoplight gets other driver's eyes to look at a mirror, check their surroundings, or turn off a turn signal that may have potentially resulted in a collision with the biker.  Rev those engines. Blast that music. Make your presence known, and make those around you be more aware of their surroundings.

Just seems like he's one of the scapegoats for the MLB's oversight.   This is like the sticky substance that they're now cracking down on. Baseball has these dirty little secrets that everybody knows about, and when they get one whistleblower they act all high and mighty like they are just absolutely appalled at how anyone could ever cheat the integrity of the game. When said secret comes out, they point fingers at the players who took advantage of a broken system that they created.   Baseball fans, is it normal for the MLB to piss on your backs and tell you it's raining? I'm a football fan, and at this point, the NFL makes no bones about who they are. They're peices of shit. When Colin Kaepernick had that workout with those teams present, everyone knew it was just for show, and the league did very little to act like they were seriously considering giving him another chance.

ijhbrbb	People that hate on ice age baby are on the right track about the fact that the design is quite ugly but I think it's odd that no one talks about how hideous everything else in that movie is. Ice Age has one of the ugliest cast of characters I've ever seen in an animated movie. Every character is so stylized they look deformed, textures remind me of muddy rags, and the animators never learned how to make hair look like hair so hair is gross and wire-y. You could say it was just old animation in a time period when tech was limited but I strongly disagree. Everything is clearly intentional, the basic proportions of the humans are all wrong for stylistic purposes. And the style is ugly and grungy. That is actually what the creators WANTED to do with Ice age, to make it ugly in a comedic way so you'd laugh at the goofy misshapen characters and their idiotic behaviors. And that's all fine and good but let's not pretend like Sid isn't heinous, that Diego's freakishly human face isn't disturbing, that Manny's fur doesn't look like plastic sheets, or that the trees don't look like dirty polygonal toothpicks.

Anything healthy can be called privilege nowadays. If you did not suffer severe trauma, you were privileged, apparently. It’s come to the point where I once said something that, in short, meant “Kids shouldn’t be exposed to their parents fighting” and someone answered me with something along the lines of “If you think fighting is a problem, you lived a very privileged life! I once met a kid whose mother stabbed their father in front of them”. I am not exaggerating at all, this interaction actually happened. *No*, the fact parents fighting is what I consider bad for a child does not mean I had a privileged life, it just means that the life of the kid who saw their mother stab their father was really f*cked up.   We should *not* be levelling things by the bare, bare minimum. Healthy should be seen as normal, and anything bellow healthy as something to be addressed / fixed.

In order to torture someone, you would need to have a properly intact body or the torture has to stop, as you do not have a body/soul to continue torturing. If the body isn't being tortured. Now, seeing as hell lasts an eternity, and in order for torture, you need a stable enough body or you cannot feel pain, you would have to have a constantly repairing-itself body.

aa0rfcsz	The fact is the vast majority of society is so far from a healthy natural attainable phys1que due to the general lazy comfortable lifestyles we live,  that I find it absolutely ridiculous and even comical how much emphasis is put on the idea of mental health issues due to social media influencers and media.  Even if influencers and movie/TV/music stars had a perfectly attainable healthy in shape phys1que that required a simple healthy diet and mild exercise routine, it would barely make any different to people's mental health and perception, because they are not even willing to put the effort in to reach that or anywhere close.  People have mental health issues today about their out of shape bodies because they aren't being taught discipline and knowledge needed to be healthy. Not because they are trying desperately to reach impossible perfection. If they were the average person would certainly look a lot bloody better than they do now. And half of most modern countries wouldn't be dangerously overwe1ght.  Sorry, kids aren't trying their desperate hardest to reach unattainable looks and getting depressed because they can't reach it. They're just ugly and fat and undisciplined and unknowledgeable and feel depressed and shit because they know they look awful and not even realistically good.

11ows6	Not saying it wasn't a hard unnecessary foul. Just stating that Caruso can be a flopper, and he probably wasn't anticipating such a hard foul from Allen so he did some acting in the air upon initial contact. Once Allens 2nd arm swung through it emphasized the flop and ended up twisting Caruso into an awkward position, thus a very hard fall.

I'll have you cremated(if it's my choice) and have a spectacular memorial with pictures of you when you were alive and at your happiest.   It's a very weird concept of viewing dead loved ones, and I get it, all cultures religions and personal choice is different from everyone else. But I feel like it's such a weird stigma to want to view them while they're dead. The whole concept of "celebration of life" can be achieved without an actual lifeless body.   I told my wife to cremate me, and I will have her cremated. There's nothing she can do to change my mind. She actually agreed with me after I explained why.

9864mb6y	I bought a 2022 Kia Rio 5-Door; it’s a new car but has enough old school specs that make sense for overall safety. All of my basic car controls have manual knobs I can use with muscle memory without going through multiple touch screens on my center console. I have to engage most features manually. The automatic features include my phone connecting when I get in the car and the seats detecting a passenger next to me.   I have to manually engage my headlights every time I get in the car. This helps me double check that I’m lighting my line of sight correctly. On my way home at 7:30pm, a teenager in a Mercedes was driving without any lights on. At the next red, both me and another mom on the other side of her car had to spend a whole minute getting her attention because she was scrolling through her phone. We got her to turn her headlights on before the green light. Though it initially seemed like a nice feature to see my gauges right away, I realized not being able to see my gauges in the dark was always a prompt for me to turn my lights on if I ever forgot in my 2010 Honda.  And I could’ve added a technology package to my car and gotten the auto braking, lane assist features, and other shazam for under two grand. I chose not to because I’ve watched friends with those features act carefree while their cars drifted because the cars were “programmed to correct it anyway”. I chose old school headlights to protect other drivers from becoming blind at night.   Not everything has to be automatic and made easy to disengage the driver from understanding what’s on and what’s off in their car. And please for the love of all that is creamy: 1) Please remind your kids not to use their phones at intersections. 2) Take a second to check that your brake lights work properly. 3) Leave enough room in front of the other car when you’re changing lanes. 4) Use your turn signals. 5) Don’t weave through a school zone because you want to go at 50mph while everyone is doing <20mph.  Not everything should be in the most modern state possible. I just can’t stand “convenience” features that are sold at a premium on all cars just to enhance lack of awareness… and can’t stand some of the horrible drivers that have grown even more in number these days.	1643163391.0	scumxy	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scumxy/all_cars_should_keep_some_things_forever_old/	All cars should keep some things forever “old school”.

dgvcs275	Every time I go to a restaurant with people and we're given the option of a table or a booth, the vast majority of people seem to want the booth.  Makes no sense.  In a booth, only two people get an aisle seat, and everyone else is trapped inside the booth.  And no one can control their own distance from the table; whereas with a traditional table you can slide your chair to the appropriate distance.  And the area under a booth table is never adequately clean, unlike traditional tables.

df1zzvtn	As I understand it, the word "stupid" was once a diagnosis in psychology. The word was used to identify a person as having a deficit in intelligence to the point that they could not be afforded basic human rights. This also applies to the word "dumb" which was used to identify someone who has auditory disability, along with vision impairment, which made it difficult to communicate...  Of course, there's the R-word, but everyone seems to have figured that one out.

8l448b6b	That’s a completely unpopular opinion I guess but I finally have to say this: Big Tabac is evil and in no way care for the well-being of their consumers BUT all this witch hunt we’ve had for decades leave the people who still smoke standing alone in the rain.  I smoke and I love nicotine. I’m well aware that I’m addicted but I have no problem with it. It helps me to think and calms me. The same goes for a good cup of tea, coffee, sports or a big glass of water. I just have a problem with the way we produce cigarettes. I like cigarettes but I hate that on this day and age, they still are as poisonous as they can be and I blame the uneducated public, doctors, companies and the governments for this. It’s a complex problem but to say it more precisely: Cigarettes are toxic, every nicotine substitution on this planet is shitty, there are still no nicotine pills, or some kind of tasteful, less harmful cigarettes on the market since people just naively assume that every smoker on this planet who smokes does it willingly with the thought „I smoke and idc if I get cancer“. Every doctor on this planet is focused on just telling people to stop but no one is asking why people smoke. As if nicotine has no positive effects at all! That’s a falsifiable claim at best. Instead of society just telling people to „lol just stop smoking“, one needs to acknowledge, that it’s not the nicotine that’s the main toxin but the rest of the stuff inside cigarettes, heck most people don’t even know the nicotine’s mostly just the addictive part and tar etc. is the real bad guy. This clenched view on cigarettes leads to NO real R&D into cigarettes (or nicotine in general), leaves every smoker on their own and is a complete dishonest representation of the main problem. This alone leads to more smoker deaths than is necessary and it just makes me really angry.	1643164266.0	scuxm4	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scuxm4/the_witch_hunt_on_big_tabacco_is_hurting_more/	The witch hunt on big tabacco is hurting more people than helping on this day and age

Grandma down the aisle seeing those condoms will be judging you; Cashier will begrudgingly check you out. But not before making some comments about burying your Peter Pan in some buried treasure.

For all of you saying "it's plastic! it's unhealthy!", I also don't care. Besides, if you're eating cheese, you probably aren't too concerned with health at that moment.

Anyone who goes to a high school knows you don’t get to dress like a stripper, that 14 year olds aren’t ripped/stacked, and that no one gets murdered every day lol. But no one would want to watch a show that’s just 8 hours of silently sitting in classes and seeing your friends for only 15 minutes at lunch. That would be a boring ass show.   Also, teenagers know what sex and drugs are. Sure it’s a bit excessive sometimes but it’s nothing new. A little creepy that adults are playing 16 year old who always have sex but it’s not necessarily a bad influence to teens. Maybe to little kids but that’s not the target audience. Sure, some of these shows should be set in college just because of the age of the actors playing them, but (majority of) teens know teen dramas are total nonsense when compared to the real world and aren’t basing their lives on those of the fictional characters.	1643169184.0	scwlor	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scwlor/teenage_dramas_arent_a_bad_influence_the_targeted/	Teenage dramas aren’t a bad influence.

c9uv3vlf	Like I understand if a guy has more than 2 edits saying thank you and then making a paragraph and shit, I have done that myself.......and it's cringe  But hating on some random dude just because he made an edit saying *"thank you for the award/upvotes"* is just fucking bullshit  And yes in the end it may just be a useless comment with useless awards and upvotes which you will probably forget about eventually, but just because it's useless doesn't mean you can't be proud with it  Plus, I also agree that the people who did award or upvote you most probably won't come back to see your *"thank you"* edit, but it feels good knowing that you could say thanks either way  But just don't edit your top comment making a 30 line paragraph saying how your meme reached r/all and how thankful you are to the people who made that happen  (source: trust me bro)	1643172961.0	scxs3x	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scxs3x/there_is_nothing_wrong_with_an_award_speech/	There is nothing wrong with an award speech edit......most of the time

58q9akic	No problem with setting equal playing fields for all, however, i believe all these DEI initiatives  across companies and organizations is causing serious resentment for the cause that may have not existed otherwise.

40ayap50	There are *far* too many people who say shit like "X is far more likely to be abused (just an example), etc." when it's all subject to area, time, place, region, and other things have to be taken into account. Spouting off and saying "X is three times more likely to be whatever"  without saying before  actually backing it up and saying why it's important.  It creates a solid backing and it prevents the whole "my issue is more important than yours." That constant battle to for some reason invalidate real struggle just because they aren't yours is confusing. I know the whole "in a perfect world this would happen" bullshit however, it will be this fact alone that tears us to pieces and then not even the remains will be viable for use.	1643174584.0	scy9l2	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scy9l2/generalizations_will_be_the_end_of_us/	Generalizations will be the end of us

3la3lxqr	I already do not like nuts to begin with (no, I’m not allergic, I just don’t like them) so this sort of helps my stance on this but there is nothing worse than biting into a nice, chocolatey, yummy looking brownie and then boom - random chunks of graininess ruining the smooth, buttery, luscious texture of the brownie. I know some of y’all are going to say that it adds crunch, and I do like a nice layer of crunch. However, nuts do not satisfy the crunch factor. They just make it grainy. You can’t even taste nuts in brownies so they don’t add anything other than a weird texture.  If you want to add a nutty flavor to your brownies, I would personally prefer peanut butter. The texture isn’t ruined and it actually adds flavor. I love the combination of peanut butter and chocolate so I wouldn’t mind a brownie with peanut butter. I just think straight up nuts in brownies should be abolished.	1643175940.0	scynql	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scynql/nuts_do_not_belong_in_brownies/	Nuts do not belong in brownies.

3la3lxqr	I know a lot of people hate flying, but I love it. The sound of the engine is super relaxing as well as the occasional dings. Also listening to music, watching a movie, combined with the relaxing engine sound just gets me super in the zone lol. Not to mention the excitement of going on vacation. Everything about flying is enjoyable to me and if I have to get up early to catch a flight, it’s one of the only things I have absolutely no trouble getting up for.  But night flights hit different. They are weirdly even more relaxing, I guess because the lights inside the airplane are more comforting at that time (plus they’re usually purple, my favorite color) and it gives off sleep-inducing vibes.	1643176783.0	scyvyh	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/scyvyh/flying_on_airplanes_is_relaxing/	Flying on airplanes is relaxing.

3kcudivo	For most of the existence of modern humans we did not live long past peak fertility. I was looking at a study of adult mortality in patagonia that suggested most people who made it out of childhood were dead by thirty-eight.  I think this implicit suggestion that we should seek to lead more complicated longer lives, peak later, and cling to life is madness.  We spend decades in school and chasing promotions in a life cycle that makes no sense. By the time a surgeon is ready to begin their career most hunter gatherers would be grandparents and living the last few years of their life.  I don’t want it.

cvlqyvot	A lot of times on social media I see people deride “tryhard” or “sweaty” gamers, people who have put a lot of effort into the games they play and are consequently good at them. Generally the critique goes something along the lines of “I work all day and just want to come home and relax and instead I just get stomped on by some sweaty basement dweller.” Usually the implication being that the opponent has avoided having a life in order to gain the ability to endlessly dunk on noobs and that because there’s nothing constructive to gain from gaming this is purely a bad thing. Personally I disagree with this sentiment. For one, it is definitely possible to be very good at a game and have a life. I'm pretty involved with the gen 3 competitive pokemon community and used to be top 30 in the world (it's a small community so not super impressive but still took a fair amount of effort). I also work full time as an engineer and while I am fairly introverted I do have a friend group outside of the game that I love and spend plenty of time with, and most of the people I know from that community despite having stupid amounts of useless knowledge about the game also manage to have active social lives and are either making their way through college or have full time jobs.  I also disagree with the idea that it is fully nonconstructive. Yes the idea of getting even a livable wage from competitive gaming is a pipe dream for the vast majority of people and unlike sports you’re not exactly going to get fit from gaming either but not everything you do needs to be in pursuit of something. Sometimes just having fun is good enough and competitive gaming can be extremely fun. Seeing the hard work you put in pay off is rewarding even if it’s not adding to your bank account, and the mental aspect of outsmarting an equally competitive opponent or theorizing new strategies is an amazing feeling. Furthermore, I’ve met a ton of my closest friends through gaming communities which is a whole reward in its own. To make a comparison to a more socially acceptable hobby, if you want to be an excellent piano player you have to put a significant amount of hours into that as well. You are not likely to earn money from it and it’s not going to help you get fit either. Yet no one will question the effort you put into that even if you’re styling on your friend who just learned chopsticks. What makes games different?  Another misconception I see a lot is people conflating tryhards with toxic players. I think anyone who goes out of their way to trash on someone just because they’re bad at the game is a dick. I’ve always been of the opinion that new players are the most important players in any gaming community because they are your chance to keep the game alive and as they improve they are often sources of innovation in your game’s metagame. Scaring them away with your shit talk is not just being an asshole but actively harming your community. That being said these people typically aren’t as common as they are made out to be among the most competitive players. Generally when I’m laddering anonymously the most toxic people I come across tend to also not be very good at the game. A lot of toxicity in gaming comes from people who can’t accept fault from their losses and instead try and blame their opponent's "lame" playstyle or luck or what have you. My personal favorite is the people trying to blame their loss on you playing bad (??). This isn’t exactly an attitude that’s conducive to improvement. From the noob side of things I've also been trying to learn a platform fighter called rivals of aether and when going in to the discords, the people who are most passionate about the game tend to be the most helpful and supportive while the most toxic people tend to be the ones who find my main "lame". Even though they're currently better than me I suspect these people fall in to that same scrub category I find laddering in pokemon.   It’s ok to not want to be involved in competitive games. They can be stressful and they’re not everyone’s cup of tea but they can also be fun, rewarding, positive places and it’s ok to put effort into them if it’s something you’re interested in. Moreover the only way to stop getting stomped is to put forth your own effort, and if you're expecting people to go easy on you and let you win when they're better at the game then I hate to say it but maybe competitive games just aren't your thing.   TLDR, you can be good at games and have a life, having fun is a fine reason to put effort into something, and toxicity doesn’t necessarily go hand in hand with being good at games.	1643179133.0	sczjja	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczjja/its_ok_to_be_a_tryhard_gamer/	It's OK to be a Tryhard Gamer
3a1sujv4	I cant believe how many favorite series have been ruined by this, i.e. Doom or Code Geass. You watch a show and after it, lets say a new season comes out, but as an alternate timeline. That first story you've watched is thrown out of the window never to be seen again, the story that got you into this show, the characters that you love, gone , forever... But hey new timeline , same or reworked characters of the show , new story, thats cool right? No. I would prefer a show ending rather than having an alternate timeline. Of course there are good shows that have alternate timelines , but they're only good when it is heavily implied and/or it makes part of the original timeline and the stories connect. It honestly breaks my heart when instead of ending a show the producers prefer killing it by a new story with the same/reworked characters.	1643179472.0	sczms0	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczms0/alternate_universestimelines_in_movies_shows/	Alternate universes/timelines in movies, shows, animes, games,etc. ruin the entire story

Like, all I have to do is casually mention in passing that I need something, and then next time I open my phone there are 10 ads on 5 different social media apps giving me THE EXACT THING I NEED!   This kind of marketing is saving us hours of researching and google searching for the perfect solution to our problems or the perfect item for our shopping needs. Our phones are literally doing us favors left and right without us even asking for it… that’s better than most boyfriends!

5evkm	Yes this is reference to Pokemon Arceus.   I've seen a lot of people in the past few days saying, "this is the developers problem and not the Publisher."  I think the publisher is liable for the problem with the games they publish, to a certain degree. They allow games to make it to the market in bad, unfinished, or dismal states due to not caring.  This isn't to say GameFreak or DICE aren't to blame for their mistakes, they totally are. I just also want to say that a publisher is also responsible.  If we blame EA for lootboxes in BF2, we have to blame Nintendo for shipping a game in the state they did.	1643179819.0	sczq25	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczq25/if_we_blame_ea_for_the_things_they_force_upon/	If we blame EA for the things they force upon their devs to shove in to games, we should also blame Nintendo for allowing their developers to phone in so many cherished franchises.

gll43pjr	My 2 favorite shows at the moment are Succession and Ozark. But I cannot stand how much they rely on f-bombs in their dialogue. Literally every second line has one. And it's not as though they use them to convey extreme emotion like fury or fear. Even in the most innocent and wholesome lines, someone has to swear and it's just annoying. Also, it's kind of a lazy way of telling the audience that the show is serious(kind of like how Euphoria relies on excessive nudity to convince you its a mature show).  As an example of a show that uses its f bombs very strategically and impactfully, watch Bojack Horseman.	1643180100.0	sczsua	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sczsua/too_much_swearing_cheapens_the_dialogue_of_a_show/	Too much swearing cheapens the dialogue of a show

3f2xxq64	Recently, I have been accused of approaching some discussions on hot button issues with a bad faith argument when I am genuinely trying to understand someones reasoning. When I point out any inconsistencies I see in the reasoning presented or even simply probe further, I get reply's that I am acting in bad faith and I have even had people say they regret "platforming" me.  I see people using this takedown (e.g. accusing my argument of being bad faith) as a shield for their own inconsistencies/cognitive dissonance. Its much easier to attack someone else or point to made up flaws in their rehtoric than it is to have a coherent position on an issue that isn't predicated on emotions and group validation.	1643181339.0	sd04ek	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd04ek/people_saying_an_argument_is_bad_faith_are_almost/	People saying an argument is "bad faith" are almost always actually communicating "I can't handle disagreement on a topic I feel strongly about".
e93ej	Obviously if you are like injured and die alone because you can’t get help or something, that sounds like an awful way to go but if you’ve lived a full life and want your final moments to be alone and with your own thoughts I think theres nothing sad about that. This came up recently because a member of my family passed away after a very long life and when they were in the hospital and we knew it was nearing the end one of my cousins said someone should be with them when they die. I simply asked do we know if they want that? And basically everyone in my family acted like that was a crazy and insensitive question. I found that unfair because I’m not sure I would want a bunch of people around me when I go. Birth, childhood, school, marriage, careers, parenthood, sports, etc all involve other people so for your final act if you want to go at it alone I think there’s something cool about that.	1643181772.0	sd08e1	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd08e1/the_idea_of_dying_alone_isnt_as_depressing_as/	The idea of dying alone isn’t as depressing as people make it out to be because it’s one of, if not the the only major life events you get to do alone.
pwlam	Disclaimer: I don't agree with the mindset of "salaries should not be discussed", I think it's absurd when employers "forbid" it and employees should be able to discuss it if they wish to.  &#x200B;  However, I don't think that two people working in the same position, even given that they have the same amount of experience, getting different salaries is a bad thing. From the employer's perspective it of course makes sense to try to pay people as little as possible - they're here to make a profit after all, and if one of those two people who have identical backgrounds was better able to "sell" their skills or to ask for a raise more convincingly - that is part of their skillset and good on them.  &#x200B;  To reiterate though I believe salaries should be discussed, as employees new in the profession won't know what the "normal" wages are so they won't ask for raises to not seem cocky.	1643182104.0	sd0b7n	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0b7n/i_dont_think_inequal_pay_for_people_in_the_same/	I don't think inequal pay for people in the same position is a tragedy

9s5omqu5	There's a thing or too voxel games can learn from **Roblox's** old **High Scalability Terrain**. You could place up to **3 dimensions** of voxels at once by simply dragging your mouse around (and q key), and use different variations of **every available block**! The textures would also tile across multiple voxels at a time, which was new during the early 2010s. They also had a nice eye drop tool, which worked with the terrain. There weren't any slabs, unfortunately; and the number of materials to choose from was lacking.  In case any of you are asking, this was before Minecraft World Edit was released.'

1iv7qtdh	I think this has been the case since forever. Most marriages lasted long in the past because most people did not have a choice or a chance to leave. Nowadays, it is easier to leave and that is good because you don't need to be stuck in a toxic relationship. I think most marriages in the past also wouldn't have lasted long if there was an option to leave. What I am trying to say is that most relationships don't work whether it was in the past or in the present. Most people will fall out of love after a certain time, any gender, and want novelty. Most people would want excitement and the rollercoaster of feelings. Most people do not recognize that daily life is always going to be boring because you keep doing similar things everyday.   There are very few cases where people were happily married till death did them apart, but most relationships would end after a while. Some people say things like it is an experience or you learn something, but I am a human man, not a chapter or a ride. Feelings get hurt and sometimes they never heal.   Personally, I believe that it is a waste of time to invest in long-term relationships because it is more than likely that it won't be long-lasting. The point of long-term relationships is for them to last, so there is no point in putting effort when it is more likely to not last.	1643182674.0	sd0g9a	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0g9a/most_longterm_relationships_are_unstable_and_wont/	Most long-term relationships are unstable and won't work

4r8h5uy2	I'm going to use "no way home" as an example, but this rant goes for any film that is a part of a multi film series.   No way home is currently at 93% on rotten tomatoes. But it doesn't function as a film, unless you're already a fan of Spider-man and the MCU, it just is a 2 and a half hour reference that you don't get.  I'm speaking as somebody that has seen all of the MCU and all previous Spider-man films, so I was in on the reference and really enjoyed it. But to give it 93% and say its "film of the year" is ridiculous when you have to of watched 30 films prior to it in order to even know what's happening.  I feel like the film should be taken as part of a series. You wouldn't reccomend series 4 episode 8 of a series you like to somebody that has never seen it? You would recognise that unless you're entrenched in the story and characters that it doesn't work as an individual piece of media.	1643183223.0	sd0l4l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd0l4l/any_film_that_is_part_of_a_series_should_be_rated/	Any film that is part of a series should be rated against the series as a whole and should not be a part of any film of the year list.

5z7ralbt	This is prolly all introverts opinion as I’m usually quiet but am talkative. Although I have enough extrovert qualities to have convos with anyone it’s usually me listening. Ik as animals we love to seek information but most convos to me are just complete nonsense to the point I find it usually exhausting to respond to or even approach someone about something that I could possibly address myself, hence introversion. If there’s nothing good to say then why say it? Why say? This applies to any space that is not exclusively about discussions as the person to me comes off as entitled to be spoken to, even if it’ll obv make the situation worse. Added to most humans’ historically bad use of terms and labels, plus their need to be validated/verified, and it’s no wonder why misinformation and some negative emotions spreads the way it do in the social media era.  Also when there’s silence some have a extreme problem with it. You can see how uncomfortable some get just within seconds in the aftermath of a conversation but without any departure. Some may try to start up another convo or speak to someone else (even other animals) which is fine but I remember seeing comments saying they can’t imagine anyone not talking for a day. A day?

There are top comments shaming/wishing/making fun of the death of other people, or in general whatever the greatest suggestions of sabotage is. This is somehow normal on this platform while at the same time daring to question the thread narrative gets you downvoted into oblivion.  I don't care if you're pro this or that, or whatever the "other side" does. Sabotaging and wishing upon death and or violence will never be a long term solution. Ultimately your group will share the same fate if this is how you play the game.  Being a long time user I remember reddit as a fun, exciting, and making common sense kind of a place.

emxjbde	This is a very specific take, so before all the haters chime in, note that I’m NOT saying that family, in and of itself, is a bad thing. For background, I have a very warm, welcoming, and loving Mexican family, a great relationship with my relatives, and nothing bad to say about being Mexican in and of itself. THAT BEING SAID, my beef is with this entrenched cultural concept that “la familia” is, or should be, everything. It’s not and it shouldn’t be, either.  You see it everywhere in Latin culture. The idea that “family is first”, or “everything for the family”. You ever seen the Pixar movie Coco? It has a pretty good depiction of what “familia” means in Mexican culture. Help your family, help your elders, and who cares if you’re good at the guitar. It’s this idea that you, the individual, have no separate identity unless it is connected to someone else in your family. E.g. What are you doing to help your cousin Junior stay out of trouble? When are you gonna come and do that chore for abuelita? When are you gonna help your aunt in Mexico, whom you’ve never met, apply for citizenship so she can come over to the States?   For the most part, your entire cultural identity lives and dies by the family. You could be independently successful, or stuck in a rut, and none of it matters because you’re supposed to be there for family, and family is supposed to be there for you. And this kind of thinking is wrong.   If I’m being brutally honest, I think the reason why Mexicans are given this unfair stereotype of being “lazy” or not the “best and brightest” is because their entire cosmos, aspirations, and ambitions are entirely rooted in family. And what does that actually look like? It means going over to abuelita’s house, your tio’s house, your cousin’s house, etc. and bullshitting over some carne asada, some beers, and really doing nothing with your life for a couple hours while you play loteria or talk gossip. See, for all the praise that “familia” gets, it really never amounts to anything. In fact, to an extent it’s actually pretty harmful at times.   When a family crisis presents itself, there is this expectation that all hands are on deck. Let’s say cousin Joey just got arrested for his second DUI. Joey doesn’t have any money for a lawyer, so there is this expectation that the familia will cough up the cash to help him pay for his legal costs. But you were saving your hard earned money for that future home renovation you were planning. So why should you have to suffer for cousin Joey’s stupidity? Well, because…familia. And when you’re in a similar crisis, like a DUI, the familia promises that cousin Joey will be there for you, too, no questions asked.   Except, as most promises of this nature go, you already know that cousin Joey has no money to his name and is never going to bail you out of whatever rut you might find yourself in. So you’re effectively guilt tripped into making a charitable donation to his legal defense knowing full well you’re never going to see that money back. And that’s basically what this concept endorses. La familia almost rewards laziness to a degree. It encourages you to set aside your plans, aspirations and goals if it means attending another family get together where you all eat food, get fat and do nothing except chill. So for all the alleged “cultural richness” that being Mexican is supposed to entail, it’s actually pretty hollow. Many Mexicans would benefit from realizing that they’re spinning their wheels investing so much time and resources into it when they could be doing something else more individually beneficial.	1643192988.0	sd2y3l	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd2y3l/as_a_mexican_the_concept_of_la_familia_in_latin/	As a Mexican, the concept of “la familia” in Latin culture is overrated and, frankly, more harmful than helpful.

If the kid from the diner was a girl, the old man would have been perceived as a discussing pervert. But because he’s gay, were expected to emphasize with him, even though the scene was bordering on paedophilia. And the rest of the characters were all just caricatures of people.

8xvhypbt	I know a lot of people who go to the tanning bed and say things like “I know it’s bad for you but…  -it helps my seasonal depression  -it will prevent a sunburn on vacation  -it helps my skin”  And other stupid “justifications.”  If you want to go in a tanning bed, fine. I don’t care. If you just like laying in the warmth, if you just want to be tan, whatever. You don’t need to justify it. I used to use one myself. I even worked at a tanning salon.  But don’t be ridiculous with why it’s okay health-wise “for you”. You know it’s awful for you and there aren’t benefits that make it more healthy than risky. Just say you don’t care about the risk and move on.	1643203125.0	sd5sl8	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5sl8/any_real_or_perceived_health_benefits_of_tanning/	Any real or perceived “health benefits” of tanning never outweigh the risk.
4pwul47y	Don’t people realize that there may be a reason. Most western countries criticize companies for child workers and often destroy companies reputations and income which leads to them shutting down. The child workers lose their jobs and go back to having no food or shelter and no means to support themselves or their family. People say that they can get an education but the sad reality is that in some countries educations is useless. If anything it’s better for them to start working at young age so that they save up enough so that the next generation may be able to do something with an education.	1643203270.0	sd5udj	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd5udj/child_workers_are_good/	Child workers are good

This be who you want to be thing is getting annoying it doesn't bring players together to face challenges because they can just make McFreestyle that can do everything alone and solo everything or builds that do not synergize with one another. Selfishness is too much of a thing in MMORPGs nowadays as well though not sure how that can be solved unless you have players put into a predicament to group and do things together.

b85rz18v	Spaghetti, tagliatelle, rice/ramen noodles etc. are stupid and unnecessarily difficult. Trying to disperse anything (sauce, pieces of meat and vegetables) through them evenly while cooking is a nightmare, and eating them is a hassle too. Maybe they are ideal when using chopsticks (I don't know, I can barely pick up sushi), which would excuse the Asian varieties, but for a fork-knife-spoon, smaller, rounder shapes (penne, farfalle, dumplings, gnocchi...) are much better. They aren't easier to make either.

550ymxn2	I used to work at a sushi place and for every sushi place I go to if you order rolls, they cut off both ends and throw them away.   At the end of the day that’s a lot of food that people might want to eat, even if it doesn’t look exactly like the rest of the roll pieces, they are just as tasty. Just a waste of great food in my opinion.   At least give me the option to eat them. Sushi is expensive and usually unless you order a lot of rolls you are still a little hungry at the end, but not enough for a full roll.   Obviously, any business can do what they want and I know sometimes it may make it so they can get more money, but as a customer it would be nice.	1643205803.0	sd6ou3	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd6ou3/it_would_be_nice_if_sushi_places_gave_you_the_cut/	It would be nice if Sushi places gave you the cut off ends of the rolls you order

ac3agw2y	I'm going to Mortuary School. My goal someday is to open an exclusively green funeral home and open my state's first and only natural burial cemetery.   Here's my issue with embalming. I understand that it has it's place in the world; corpses who have to travel long distances, corpses that are severely decomposed, ect. But to take a corpse and embalm it for **no reason** is so wrong to me. This adds hundreds, if not thousands of dollars to your bill. And it's completely unnecessary if you don't need it. Ice can preserve a body until it's needed for a service in the same way, and it doesn't make your loved one's corpse look like a horror show wax figurine.   Every unnecessarily embalmed body I've seen has instilled a kind of sadness in me. Why is it that we're doing this as a regular thing? Why is every funeral home doing this instead of only a select few offering this service? Why are we so obsessed with trying to make our loved ones appear to be asleep instead of accepting the reality of death?  When we die, we don't look like we're *asleep.* We look dead. And there's something that happens when we realize this; the grieving process changes when we accept this. It gets easier. We see that our loved one is gone. The person that was there is there no longer. When we accept that, it's easier to accept that they're gone.   I think if all funeral homes had green, no embalming options, this would save grieving families thousands of dollars, ultimately will save our planet, and help the grieving process exponentially.   Embalming has it's place: but it should be a rarity, not a common reality.  Whatever you decide to do with your future corpse is okay. I'm not here to judge you. As long as you're actively thinking about what you want done, I'm a happy camper.	1643208063.0	sd7h9c	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd7h9c/embalming_should_be_saved_for_rare_cases_not_the/	Embalming should be saved for rare cases, not the go to for all cases.

She was considered to be one of the most beautiful women in the world when she was in her 20s. Now she’s still above average, and vastly above average for her age. Well duh. She was always that way.

azuj214o	I’ve been seeing a lot of news lately about how the US is considering stationing troops in NATO countries within Eastern Europe & the Baltics, as well as the fact that they just gave NATO a full super carrier and accompanying strike group, for “training purposes”. This is the complete opposite of what the US should be doing. This will only make Europe think the US will come to their defense whenever shit hits the fan. We all know the US wants the EU improving their defense capabilities, so that they won’t need to rely on us as much, for literally everything. Not coming to their defense will force them to reevaluate their choices, and if they get whooped by a weak Russia, they will, more than likely, invest heavily into their defense. This isn’t the US’s war, we shouldn’t be getting involved, we shouldn’t be sending a single soldier, a single carrier, or plane, to defend Ukraine and the rest of Europe. Sending basic equipment and forcing sanctions is the most we should be doing. As every foreign country says “the US isn’t the world police”, so, let’s stop acting like we are, and fix the problems within our own borders.   TLDR: This isn’t the US’s war, Europe should be able to handle a weak Russia on its own, and if they can’t, they’ll learn something and invest into their defense. Unless Russia makes a direct threat to the US, we shouldn’t get involved.	1643212366.0	sd92s7	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd92s7/the_us_should_use_this_ukraine_vs_russia_squabble/	The US should use this Ukraine vs Russia squabble as an opportunity to force the EU to finally increase their defense spending to a respectable level.

A pet is an animal, a living thing that needs to be cared for whether it grew up being neglected or was bred for the purpose of becoming a pet.  I don't care if people want to make a living breeding pets of a certain breed so a person can have their perfect companion for a significant amount of time. It's a very substantial commitment, and the idea that taking on a pet has to be some selfless act of heroism where you save a pet from a shelter or take in a stray is rediculous.	1643212534.0	sd94zu	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd94zu/theres_nothing_wrong_with_buying_a_purebred/	There's nothing wrong with buying a purebred animal instead of adopting.

But besides a few outlying moments, I just couldn’t play for more than an hour at a time. I found it a chore to go through the dungeons and solve puzzles. I found the gameplay to be monotonous and too linear. The combat felt stale and uninspired. The only thing holding the game for me was the story, but the gameplay just wasn’t for me. I love breath of the wild, but I think anyone can agree it’s not a traditional zelda game.

bblb6981	Everyone seems to want strips of bacon with their breakfast, but I think bacon as a side by itself  is underwhelming. Its great added to a burger, sure, but on its own bacon fails. It feels so one noteish. As a side meat, usually at breakfast, sausage in the form of links or patties is the superior option because its a delicate mix of meat and spices that work together and provide a complex flavor profile. Bacon is just bacon. Also its an overload to the taste buds when eating a stick of bacon on its own -- like taking a sledgehammer to the tongue. It should be subtle mixed with other flavors. I do love bacon, but only to improve the flavor of other foods. When you add the bacon to other foods it extends itself through those foods and leaves the taste buds satisfied and the brain becomes satiated. But when eating just a strip of bacon on its own it feels like its over so soon because its working on its own. This is why people always want more bacon. The fat is meant to carry flavor, but its arriving empty-handed, so we reach for more in compensation.	1643212830.0	sd999y	/r/unpopularopinion/comments/sd999y/bacon_is_not_good_by_itself/	Bacon is not good by itself

People finger point at Mao for killing 10 million people during the Great Leap Forward when he ordered birds hunted down so they stop eating rice. Resulting in lotus infestations and famines. Stalin is similar with the Ukraine famine in the 30s. Although Stalin eventually did some more... direct things.  However, there are countless examples throughout history where capitalism “regimes” also implement some shit policy which results in the death in millions. Such as the bengal famine, as Churchill stopped sending food to the India. Or the Belgians murdering 10 million Congolese under Leopold, as those not farming enough were killed.  Don’t get me wrong, Churchill is a war hero, but western logic suggest Churchill is much of a genocider as Mao.
