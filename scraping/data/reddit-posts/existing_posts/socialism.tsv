15gzlx	My mother who is a maga head doesnt know shit about gun defense and self defense while thinking she knows everything about it because she shoots in a range. She doesnt even keep a firearm on her person yet says if she gets attacked she will just shoot them (her gun is either in a safe or in a soft case in her car door rarely coming out). She doesnt seem to realize that even with a firearm on your hip you need distance to be able to draw aim and fire effectively. There are tons of tests showing this (look up gun vs knife if your interested) and I sent her a link to one. She refuses to watch it yet maintains her position. These people's ignorance is only matched by their arrogance. I was never saying guns aren't effective tools for self defense you just need distance or need to be able to create distance to use it well over 10' is about the distance where guns are most optimal, but here is the thing most attackers arent gonna telegraph to you that they have malicous intent until they are close enough to attack. If they do that before or are like overly flamboyant about it then you might be living in an action movie. Not even to mention how it takes a lot of training to draw aim and fire quickly and effectively period. The people running the tests also have the benefit of anticipation. Not a luxury you are likely to have in real life. You would think that if they love their guns so much they would know how to use them properly as a weapon.	1642656309.0	s8b6q0	/r/socialism/comments/s8b6q0/i_honestly_cannot_believe_how_ignorant_the_right/	I honestly cannot believe how ignorant the right is.

b2qzt55v	Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is a founder of Turkey. He created secular laical Turkey republic. He didn't believe religions. He is an atheist or deist. His quotes:  "My people are going to learn the principles of democracy, the dictates of truth and the teachings of science. Superstition must go."  "Everything we see in the world is the creative work of women."  "Religions have been basis of the tyranny of kings and sultans."  "We did not win the war with prayers, but with the blood of our soldiers."  "Unless a nation's life faces peril, war is murder."  "I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap."  "We do not consider our principles as dogmas contained in books that are said to come from heaven. We derive our inspiration, not from heaven, or from an unseen world, but directly from life."

2wh1r5c8	Disclaimer I don't know much about economy. I was reading the my country's leaked budget and I was shocked by the fact that the expected tax revenue from salaries is equal to that of the expected tax revenue from profits. Is that fair? Especially as I understand when we talk about taxes on profits we are talking about taxes on corporations and companies while taxes on salaries are as the name implies taxes on workers. Their is also the fact that the minimum wage fell from 600$ to 30$ due to currency devaluation, and that before the economic crisis in 2019 60% of the gdp was profits, I assume this hasn't changed.	1642786525.0	s9g5vi	/r/socialism/comments/s9g5vi/how_can_this_tax_plan_be_fair/	How can this tax plan be fair?

hw4uco59	I guess there could be a lot of different examples of this, but one situation in particular prompted this for me.   I got in the mail a tax bill recently, from the state I live in. This has happened every single year for the past few years, and I really don't know what I'm doing wrong but that's beside the point. I owed my state \~$400 in taxes, which they upped to \~$450 because of "interest".   My immediate reaction was very much a "taxation is theft" type reaction. The more I thought about it though, it's really not the taxes that I'm bothered by. I value social programs and, if I really didn't pay my fair share, I want to make that right. What's really bothering me about it is the knowledge that this state decided to go after me for a relatively small amount of money, probably because I'm an easy and vulnerable target without the time, energy, or means to double check their work. Meanwhile, I'm 100% sure there are others that have gotten away paying way less than they should, if they paid taxes at all.  I just think the general conditioning that capitalism has given me over my life time makes my natural reaction to these sorts of things be anything other than blaming the ruling elite. How do you, for lack of a better term, unlearn it better? And how do you help others do the same?	1642792113.0	s9i9xq	/r/socialism/comments/s9i9xq/do_you_ever_struggle_with_unlearning_capitalist/	Do you ever struggle with unlearning capitalist conditioning?

15gzlx	Ive recently began reading The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Fascinating stuff, I'm about half way through. I tell my MAGA mother this and she initially things its great that I'm reading it. I mention that is seemed really rough for African Americans when Malcolm X was growing up. She then proceeded to call African Americans today snowflakes for still fighting for social equality. By her own logic Malcolm X and Doctor King were snowflakes because they had no idea what it was like to be a slave in the south. so I explained to her sarcasticly that with that the civil rights act shouldn't have need to be written because the Emancipation Proclamation got rid of all discrimination towards African Americans. Completely ignoring the fact that Jim Crow laws were in place for 100 years by the time the Civil Rights act was written. Been just over half that time and people are still fighting for change. I tell her these things and she just shuts out. Completely closing her mind. Not to mention that she is and has always been a glaring hypocrite. She called Malcolm X very intelligent and then when I tell her that he and Dr. King were socialists (Malcolm X even describing himself as a Communist) she ignores that to. It is clear to anyone that social equality takes time to be established because the racism before the Civil Rights Act was part of the foundation of this country. To take that away not only takes times but a constant pressure.

cjblfiti	 Today marks 85 years since Venezuela’s first oil workers’ strike ended. The protest is considered the start of the country’s anti-imperialist struggle against foreign companies’ theft and exploitation. Workers demanded sovereignty over the country's oil resources and fair royalties. This would be the main reason Venezuela became a key fixture in Washington's foreign policy.

11jauw	What do you think are the most obvious ways in which Westerners and those in the imperial core are hurt by capitalism? To put it another way, what are the easiest things to point Westerners to in terms of ways capitalism is directly wrecking things around them? In the past, there have been issues like the draft for the war in Vietnam in the U.S.A. that were very obvious examples of capitalism's harm, examples that could be used to successfully build class consciousness and radicalise many young people. What are some modern equivalents to that?  Climate change is one issue that comes to mind, but it's a lot less immediate (even if it is huge in the scale of its destruction and very obviously fuelled by capitalism) than something like one's friends being forced to die trying to kill poor Vietnamese for daring to stand up against imperialism and global capitalism.  This isn't to say that pointing out the extreme destruction caused by imperialism in the developing world can't be an effective tactic when building class consciousness in the West, it's a large part of how I became a socialist. I think, still, that it's obviously important to also have lots of more obvious and close-to-home examples to give people.	1642889891.0	sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/	Most Obvious Ways Westerners Are Hurt Under Capitalism

cjblfiti	   https://reddit.com/link/sauvi3/video/dw5ogbu57gd81/player  On January 23, 1958, a civic-military uprising ended the US-backed regime of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, considered Venezuela’s last dictatorship. Corruption and brutal repression marked this period.  After the dictator fled the country, crowds danced in the streets of Caracas.  However, the celebrations did not last long. With US support, the country's traditional political forces signed a deal to alternate power, beginning 40 years of pseudodemocracy and neoliberal rule.  This period was broken with Hugo Chávez’s 1998 historical popular election.

But what it seemed like is the political party 'Labour' had a leader that understood the workers and wanted to cater to them as if one of them. And since that's a threat to the system collective, a smear campaign was ran and just made him look like a useless fool. Were as you'll get politicians like the prime minister, who is able to ascend to such a position and needs no such assistance with his image.  I guess what I'm asking is what are other socialist's opinions of Corbyn, and what do you think what happened to him and his image portrays where the "left wing" is at in the UK politically? Since now they have a lord leading the party.

My girlfriend is a nurse, and I hear and read stories from nurses about how horrible they are treated by hospital administrators, the great exodus from patient care ect. Then I realized it wasn’t just nurses, but almost all healthcare staff.   I know unions can be an amazing mechanism for creating more equality in the workspace and I feel a calling to shift towards this area of life. But I don’t know what to do from here. What areas of study or focus helps a union leader or worker? Administration? Accounting? Marketing? Or getting real life experience in the field so you have first hand knowledge of the issues and try to organize or join an organization later?

kxyst	 I'm making a communist reading list and I have most of the classics in there, but I was wondering if anybody had some good reccs for something with a more modern view? Something that takes into account things like the internet, gig economy, the service sector, working from home, globalisation etc and applies communist thinking and organisation to them.

5iszam0e	I was just talking to my father about sports and he was telling me about how he liked sports and getting angry at the other team. He said that the competition was the best part. I told him that I didn’t like that about sports, why must we beat each other up. He said life’s a competition.  And now I ask the entire world, why must life be a competition? We have plenty to go around for everyone. We don’t need to compete for anything, we could all work together for self actualization. There is no reason we need to fight each other for basic needs or rights. It feels like we are wasting so much potential talent simply because they don’t have the money or the start in life that others do? Imagine if newton had been a poor boy that couldn’t afford private school, would he still have invented his laws and calculus?   We can do better than competition, it’s called working together and embracing what makes humans special and that’s our ability to communicate and collaborate.	1643003289.0	sbeqb7	/r/socialism/comments/sbeqb7/why_must_life_be_a_competition/	Why must life be a competition?

it6w5zft	Hello, this might be a pipe dream of mine, but I've recently looked into the possibility of digital city spaces. Essentially, the digital space I want to create would act as a means of organizing and teaching socialist political philosophy and economy. It would also be a means of learning how to practically apply socialism both in the physical and digital world. I've just started thinking about how it might be done, but I think it might be interesting to test the waters and see how we can positively use the internet and modern technology to more rapidly build socialism. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts, and if anyone is interested in maybe starting something like that then feel free to DM me.	1643035037.0	sbnmef	/r/socialism/comments/sbnmef/project_for_a_digitial_socialist_city/	Project for a Digitial Socialist City

6p6u2juc	Americans die from no healthcare, nothing is done to change that. Americans die from gun violence, nothing is done to change it. Americans die from opioid epidemic, nothing is done to change that. Is it surprising that we don’t care about covid deaths and our government lets us die? We’ve been trained to accept people dying preventable deaths for the economy our entire lives. Other countries make commercials about helping hungry Americans while we deny and ignore our issues.   Other countries are more concerned with the well-being of Americans than Americans themselves. We deny and ignore every crisis that kills us or ruins our people’s quality of life. If you speak about gun, covid, or lack of healthcare deaths, you’re mocked by your fellow citizens and even government. People die driving on ice to make it to their jobs because a non-essential business refuses to close for one day to protect its employees, while state services and buildings close and put out “do not drive on roads” warnings.   Are we just desensitized to death? Why do so many Americans not care?   I’m sorry if this is the wrong sub but I feel like anywhere I go, I’ll probably get attacked by chuds who think we should die for their Big Mac, or centrists who say “only fat people will die.”	1643043487.0	sbqpt0	/r/socialism/comments/sbqpt0/do_americans_just_not_care_about_americans_dying/	Do Americans just not care about Americans dying?

5bxup	Lenin says that “without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.” Taking this lesson seriously, I developed this [introductory syllabus on revolutionary Marxist theory](https://emptyhandshistory.com/marxist-reading-group-introductory-syllabus/) for Ithaca DSA’s Marxist Reading Group, which has been meeting for almost a year. The study group’s purpose is to sharpen our theoretical tools and collectively develop the knowledge that we need in order to build a new world. The syllabus provides a background in classical Marxist theory written by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Luxemburg, as well as select pieces by Trotsky, Gramsci, and Mao.  Participants are expected to do around 20 to 30 pages of reading for each session. We meet every other week on Zoom, although we hope to begin meeting in person soon (Covid permitting). This is not like a university class; we read and discuss the theory together, help each other understand it, and apply it to our own lives and political work.  Each session is led by two co-facilitators (rotating each meeting)  who facilitate the conversation around discussion questions that they have developed—usually three main questions, ideally referencing specific points in the texts. They will sometimes give brief framing thoughts at the beginning of the session. The final discussion question typically relates the text to our own political work so that we can collectively draw out lessons from it.  Check out the syllabus below, with links to readings. Feel free to ask any questions about how we run the group!  ## Unit One: Classical Marxism (Marx and Engels)  *All page numbers here are from the Marx-Engels Reader (2nd edition, edited by Robert C.

The leader of this coup was president until 2014 when he was ousted by riots when he tried to make himself president for life.

These past few months in history we have been learning about life in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Communist Russia.   Our history teacher told us that communism was more extreme than fascism and that fascists hated communists although they were "essentially the same". As she is from the Netherlands you would've thought she would know what nazism was.   Our CSPE (Civic Social and Political Education) teacher told us that all communists were dictators.   What should I do about this if I can do anything?

11jauw	What do you think are the most obvious ways in which Westerners and those in the imperial core are hurt by capitalism? To put it another way, what are the easiest things to point Westerners to in terms of ways capitalism is directly wrecking things around them? In the past, there have been issues like the draft for the war in Vietnam in the U.S.A. that were very obvious examples of capitalism's harm, examples that could be used to successfully build class consciousness and radicalise many young people. What are some modern equivalents to that?  Climate change is one issue that comes to mind, but it's a lot less immediate (even if it is huge in the scale of its destruction and very obviously fuelled by capitalism) than something like one's friends being forced to die trying to kill poor Vietnamese for daring to stand up against imperialism and global capitalism.  This isn't to say that pointing out the extreme destruction caused by imperialism in the developing world can't be an effective tactic when building class consciousness in the West, it's a large part of how I became a socialist. I think, still, that it's obviously important to also have lots of more obvious and close-to-home examples to give people.	1642889891.0	sadowt	/r/socialism/comments/sadowt/most_obvious_ways_westerners_are_hurt_under/	Most Obvious Ways Westerners Are Hurt Under Capitalism

cjblfiti	   https://reddit.com/link/sauvi3/video/dw5ogbu57gd81/player  On January 23, 1958, a civic-military uprising ended the US-backed regime of Marcos Pérez Jiménez, considered Venezuela’s last dictatorship. Corruption and brutal repression marked this period.  After the dictator fled the country, crowds danced in the streets of Caracas.  However, the celebrations did not last long. With US support, the country's traditional political forces signed a deal to alternate power, beginning 40 years of pseudodemocracy and neoliberal rule.  This period was broken with Hugo Chávez’s 1998 historical popular election.

But what it seemed like is the political party 'Labour' had a leader that understood the workers and wanted to cater to them as if one of them. And since that's a threat to the system collective, a smear campaign was ran and just made him look like a useless fool. Were as you'll get politicians like the prime minister, who is able to ascend to such a position and needs no such assistance with his image.  I guess what I'm asking is what are other socialist's opinions of Corbyn, and what do you think what happened to him and his image portrays where the "left wing" is at in the UK politically? Since now they have a lord leading the party. It's not exactly appealing to the workers.	1642961265.0	sazpj7	/r/socialism/comments/sazpj7/for_brits_was_corbyn_stitched_up/	For Brits: Was Corbyn Stitched Up

My girlfriend is a nurse, and I hear and read stories from nurses about how horrible they are treated by hospital administrators, the great exodus from patient care ect. Then I realized it wasn’t just nurses, but almost all healthcare staff.   I know unions can be an amazing mechanism for creating more equality in the workspace and I feel a calling to shift towards this area of life. But I don’t know what to do from here. What areas of study or focus helps a union leader or worker? Administration? Accounting? Marketing? Or getting real life experience in the field so you have first hand knowledge of the issues and try to organize or join an organization later?  I know it’s extremely difficult to unionize and it means putting your life out there, but I feel like change is needed and there are many things more important than myself.	1642969768.0	sb30zc	/r/socialism/comments/sb30zc/i_want_a_career_working_with_or_in_a_union_any/	I want a career working with or in a union, any ideas on skill sets/college majors?

5iszam0e	I was just talking to my father about sports and he was telling me about how he liked sports and getting angry at the other team. He said that the competition was the best part. I told him that I didn’t like that about sports, why must we beat each other up. He said life’s a competition.  And now I ask the entire world, why must life be a competition? We have plenty to go around for everyone. We don’t need to compete for anything, we could all work together for self actualization. There is no reason we need to fight each other for basic needs or rights. It feels like we are wasting so much potential talent simply because they don’t have the money or the start in life that others do? Imagine if newton had been a poor boy that couldn’t afford private school, would he still have invented his laws and calculus?   We can do better than competition, it’s called working together and embracing what makes humans special and that’s our ability to communicate and collaborate.	1643003289.0	sbeqb7	/r/socialism/comments/sbeqb7/why_must_life_be_a_competition/	Why must life be a competition?

it6w5zft	Hello, this might be a pipe dream of mine, but I've recently looked into the possibility of digital city spaces. Essentially, the digital space I want to create would act as a means of organizing and teaching socialist political philosophy and economy. It would also be a means of learning how to practically apply socialism both in the physical and digital world. I've just started thinking about how it might be done, but I think it might be interesting to test the waters and see how we can positively use the internet and modern technology to more rapidly build socialism. I'd love to hear the community's thoughts, and if anyone is interested in maybe starting something like that then feel free to DM me.	1643035037.0	sbnmef	/r/socialism/comments/sbnmef/project_for_a_digitial_socialist_city/	Project for a Digitial Socialist City

Americans die from opioid epidemic, nothing is done to change that. Is it surprising that we don’t care about covid deaths and our government lets us die? We’ve been trained to accept people dying preventable deaths for the economy our entire lives. Other countries make commercials about helping hungry Americans while we deny and ignore our issues.   Other countries are more concerned with the well-being of Americans than Americans themselves. We deny and ignore every crisis that kills us or ruins our people’s quality of life. If you speak about gun, covid, or lack of healthcare deaths, you’re mocked by your fellow citizens and even government. People die driving on ice to make it to their jobs because a non-essential business refuses to close for one day to protect its employees, while state services and buildings close and put out “do not drive on roads” warnings.   Are we just desensitized to death? Why do so many Americans not care?

5bxup	Lenin says that “without revolutionary theory there can be no revolutionary movement.” Taking this lesson seriously, I developed this [introductory syllabus on revolutionary Marxist theory](https://emptyhandshistory.com/marxist-reading-group-introductory-syllabus/) for Ithaca DSA’s Marxist Reading Group, which has been meeting for almost a year. The study group’s purpose is to sharpen our theoretical tools and collectively develop the knowledge that we need in order to build a new world. The syllabus provides a background in classical Marxist theory written by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Luxemburg, as well as select pieces by Trotsky, Gramsci, and Mao.  Participants are expected to do around 20 to 30 pages of reading for each session. We meet every other week on Zoom, although we hope to begin meeting in person soon (Covid permitting). This is not like a university class; we read and discuss the theory together, help each other understand it, and apply it to our own lives and political work.  Each session is led by two co-facilitators (rotating each meeting)  who facilitate the conversation around discussion questions that they have developed—usually three main questions, ideally referencing specific points in the texts. They will sometimes give brief framing thoughts at the beginning of the session. The final discussion question typically relates the text to our own political work so that we can collectively draw out lessons from it.  Check out the syllabus below, with links to readings. Feel free to ask any questions about how we run the group!  ## Unit One: Classical Marxism (Marx and Engels)  *All page numbers here are from the Marx-Engels Reader (2nd edition, edited by Robert C.

There was a coup in the 80s that killed the world renowned revolutionary Sankara and undid all of his policies under a veil center-left capitalism. The leader of this coup was president until 2014 when he was ousted by riots when he tried to make himself president for life. All I know next is the military took power and were threatened with crippling sanctions by the African Union if they didn't hold elections to put civilians back in power.

These past few months in history we have been learning about life in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Communist Russia.   Our history teacher told us that communism was more extreme than fascism and that fascists hated communists although they were "essentially the same". As she is from the Netherlands you would've thought she would know what nazism was.   Our CSPE (Civic Social and Political Education) teacher told us that all communists were dictators.   What should I do about this if I can do anything? I have pushed back on some of the points they've made but to no avail, the shitty PowerPoints aren't editted.	1643058252.0	sbwg06	/r/socialism/comments/sbwg06/being_taught_misinformation/	Being taught misinformation

6nr01joh	Hello. So ive been meaning to make a psot on this Social Credit meme on chinas government. Like its everywhere. Play Red Sun in the Sky and your social credit increases by 300 points. Suck Xi Jiping Dick and you get social credit score of 5 million. When thats not what social credit is. its not a ranking of people who are loyal to the party thats just blasphemy. What social credit actually is, is just a credit system to track and reward good buisness practices. Social credit is just a way to moniter corporations. Like paying taxes, food safety in restaruants, paying wages, stopping embezzlement and fraud and ip stealing. Whenever china reigns in capitalism they are seen as authoritarian monsters. When here in the usa we have literal credit scores. Credit scores here in the usa measure if you can get a house or a car. Not the case in china. Social credit regulates those who can start buisnesses and makes them not shady. Imagine not allowing companies to poison your food or dodging taxes or embezzling money. How is this shit bad? How is this a bad thing. Xi Jiping starts to build socialism like mao by reinvesting in chinas infrastructure and by trying to loosen the grip of american corporations and hes a boogeyman.  China has huge social welfare and has little homelessness and less hunger. Now in terms of poverty they do manipulate the standard of poverty. According to the latest data supplied by the World Bank, only **0.6 percent of** the Chinese population lived below the country's official poverty line of having less than $2.30 at their disposal per day. And you and I know that 2.30 dollars a day is not enough to live on. Then again chinese socialism makes living incredibly cheap. Food costs 100 a month. And wet markets allow for fresh food. 90% of chinese own their homes which means they dont pay a landlord(Mao is smiling in his grave). How many of americans can say they own their homes. Not many. Also free healthcare and college so who knows maybe you dont need a huge salary cause everything is either cheap or free. Such an oxymoron to say the poorest people in china are homeowners. are you Fucking kidding me?  So i find this social credit meme a bizarre aspect of cold war rhetoric. its "look at authoritarian communist china. They reward people for being obedient and ranks them in a hierarchy." look china has some spyware they do on citizens. Im not naive. But even if that was true about social credit it would be no different than credit scores. They dictate whether you can get a cellphone contract, internet, a car, a loan for housing and a credit card. This is the free america? Where ot ranks people (not buisnesses like china) on whether they are worthy enough to get a loan to pay for something that should be free?  This feeds the cold war narrative. And people eat this shit up. Uncritically. Its so bad the western left is divided on china where you have one side who believes china is the bulwark of socialism and the other who think its an authoritarian state capitalist country where the cops gun you down on sight(chinse police dont carry guns on them). And its not true  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzDE2LGSmJnw53WrZ7mM\_Aw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzDE2LGSmJnw53WrZ7mM_Aw)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88v\_r9osaAU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88v_r9osaAU)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social\_Credit\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Credit_System)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-0jD5aebc8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-0jD5aebc8)  [www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaIZ9KGlgts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaIZ9KGlgts)  So heres just some basic videos and a wiki links. Jason From Living in china defiently breaks the western view of china. hes an expat and he literally just shows his life. Doesnt really post anything about socialism or says political lefty shit. Hes a vlogger. and thats fine. but its absurd that a dude just broadcasting his life in china and showing china not to be a hellhole makes a huge difference. Remember the more leftists that believe the red scare the usa will have already won.	1643062133.0	sbxzjc	/r/socialism/comments/sbxzjc/chinese_social_credit_meme_helps_push_cold_war/	Chinese social Credit Meme helps push Cold War rhetoric

6138zfjn	The  FGR published today an informative note on the processes against  citizens accused of various crimes related to the events of July 11,  2022.  From the note it follows that:  "In  a tendentious way, the manipulations and opinion patterns continue,  which seek to accuse Cuba of human rights violations, trying to  delegitimize the criminal proceedings initiated to investigate conduct  that constitutes a crime, in accordance with current laws."  "Once  the investigation was concluded, the Prosecutor's Office received 117  preparatory phase files corresponding to the events of greatest  connotation, with 790 people indicted for acts of vandalism, which  attacked authorities, people and property, as well as serious  disturbances of order. 21% of these people had criminal records.  Of  these, 110 files have been presented to the courts, with 710 defendants  for trial, 69% of them insured with the precautionary measure of  provisional prison.  Of the total  number of defendants in these files, 115 are between 16 and 20 years of  age, against whom it was decided to bring criminal action before the  courts, due to the seriousness of the acts committed and their proven  participation:  • 55 are between 16  and 18 years of age, of which 28 are insured with the precautionary  measure of provisional prison. Based on the possibilities offered by the  law and as a result of the practice of the evidence in the oral  proceedings, the acknowledgment of the facts, the repentance shown and  the condition of students, the Prosecutor's Office modified 18 of these  accused. request for sanction, for others of less severity."  "The  decision of the Prosecutor's Office to uphold the accusation before the  courts, in all cases, was based on the evidence provided, including the  statements of witnesses and victims, expert reports of videos published  in different media and other occupied media, which allowed the  identification of those accused in acts that typify crimes of public  disorder, incitement to commit a crime, damage, robbery with force and  violence, attack, sabotage and sedition.  The  decision to prosecute for the crime of sedition, although severe  penalties are foreseen, corresponds to the level of violence shown in  the vandalism that in a tumultuous manner caused injuries and endangered  the lives of citizens, officials and members of the security forces.  order, by attacking them with the use of sharp, blunt and incendiary  objects, with the serious disturbance of public order and the deliberate  purpose of subverting the constitutional order.  In  different localities, official institutions, hospitals, exchange houses  (CADECA), commercial establishments and fuel stores were stoned; Many  of them, as a result of the violence generated, were looted and their  goods were stolen, causing considerable damage; They were also besieged,  overturned and damaged means of transport."  "As  for minors under 16 years of age, in Cuba these are not subject to  criminal law. In the investigations, the participation of 27 was proven,  to whom the established legal procedure was applied: 10 were interned  in training schools comprehensive and behavioral, for intervening  together with adults in the commission of these acts; individualized  attention was applied to 17 at the school of the National Education  System where they are studying."

hoxfd	There is a crisis in Ukraine.   On the one hand, there is a buildup of arms and mobilization of troops on the nations eastern border by the rightwing capitalist oligarchy that is Russia, that currently sits atop the long dead corpse of the Soviet Union. From the western border we have the medley of capitalists and reactionaries of NATO pouring arms and ammunition into Ukraine both to its government and to an assortment of various militias, several of them Ukrainian fascist groups that oppose other Russian fascists.   What we have here is two sets of imperialist camps vying for power over a poor Eastern European nation. Not power for the people, not power to build socialism, but merely power to enforce different flavors of subjugation under capitalist autocrat boots.  Comrades, the position of the worldwide Internationalist Socialist movement is not to side with the capitalists of our own or any particular nation in such reactionary and imperialist affairs. It is to not pick the lesser of two imperialist evils. The position of all Socialists is to stand with the proletarians of all nations and declare that we will not stand for war. We must have solidarity with the proletarians of the NATO nations, the proletarians of Ukraine, and the proletarians of Russia who all will be the ones dying in war rather than the wealthy plutocrats of the NATO or Russian war industries and all their other fellow capitalist cronies.   Some sentiments from some of our intellectual predecessors:   “Wars throughout history have been waged for conquest and plunder. In the Middle Ages when the feudal lords who inhabited the castles whose towers may still be seen along the Rhine concluded to enlarge their domains, to increase their power, their prestige and their wealth they declared war upon one another. But they themselves did not go to war any more than the modern feudal lords, the barons of Wall Street go to war. The feudal barons of the Middle Ages, the economic predecessors of the capitalists of our day, declared all wars. And their miserable serfs fought all the battles. The poor, ignorant serfs had been taught to revere their masters; to believe that when their masters declared war upon one another, it was their patriotic duty to fall upon one another and to cut one another’s throats for the profit and glory of the lords and barons who held them in contempt. And that is war in a nutshell. The master class has always declared the wars; the subject class has always fought the battles. The master class has had all to gain and nothing to lose, while the subject class has had nothing to gain and all to lose—especially their lives.” - Eugene Debs, The Canton, Ohio Speech   “The madness will cease and the bloody demons of hell will vanish only when workers in Germany and France, England and Russia finally awake from their stupor, extend to each other a brotherly hand, and drown out the bestial chorus of imperialist war-mongers and the shrill cry of capitalist hyenas with labor’s old and mighty battle cry:  Proletarians of all lands, unite” - Rosa Luxembourg, Junius Affair  —  Let our calls to all who are involved in this conflict be clear and united:  No War In Ukraine, Workers Of The World Unite!	1643142487.0	scn2wt	/r/socialism/comments/scn2wt/internationalism_not_campism/	Internationalism, Not Campism
2ky76j4h	Hi! I've been reading about marxism, anti-capitalist theory and socialism for maybe a year now? but I'm definitely still learning more and more everyday but something that still is not clear to me is how to delimitate who's opressed and who's an opressor and how difficult it can be to separate society in this binary way. It is easy if it's someone who's a billionare of course but what about people who own small business? or bosses for example that both exploit their employees but also are exploited by their executives and so on?

ywj9gvz	This man and government have failed its people and my generation with its promises and dealing with this pandemic. We are homeless, in debt, enslaved, imprisoned and heading towards a future of extreme suffering and loss of our ecosystem. If we go to war their gonna ask for troops but they won’t get much considering how many wars we’ve been in and the lack of faith in the government especially with arms executives demanding more war so when that fails they will bring back the draft and when that happens this country will see the rage of its youth in full force.	1643152811.0	scqviw	/r/socialism/comments/scqviw/i_truly_feel_if_biden_brings_up_the_draft_to_deal/	I truly feel if Biden brings up the draft to deal with Russia we will have uprisings in the streets

3oias	They are struggling. All their lives they have been taught that Capitalism is good. They strive to put a name to it, to pinpoint who is responsible. They think there must be some evil mastermind lurking in the shadows. Some Soros or Gates. It's never their boss, never their neighbor, who is responsible, never the nice guy from high school that works in a bank downtown. So they blame a supervillain and a cartoon conspiracy because cognitively they can't admit the whole economic system is wrong.	1643193587.0	sd33en	/r/socialism/comments/sd33en/people_that_use_concepts_like_new_world_order/	People that use concepts like New World Order can't admit Capitalism is screwing them
