ashi42u0	Hi, I am an anarchist/libertarian socialist and I am trying to understand Anarcho-capitalists more. Essentially my question is what is the basis for your version of anarchism? From traditional anarchists, it is clearly the "abolition of unjust hierarchy".   We agree that the state is an institution which uses force and violence to maintain political power in a given area. Even in democracies, citizens have much less political power than the rich and the politicians they vote in are notoriously corrupt and usually don't accurately represent their constituents.   Where we disagree is obviously on the issue of capitalism. For traditional anarchists, capitalism perpetuates a system which creates more of these unjust hierarchies and give bosses, CEOs, and owners far more power than the worker (leading to coercion and exploitation). Because it is a central part to leftist anarchists thought, it's hard for me to wrap my head around why capitalism isn't identified as a system which creates unfair power structures by you guys. Is this due to a belief that capitalism doesn't create inequality or is it due to a foundational principle different from the "abolition of unjust hierarchy"?  I know there probably won't be any minds changed but who knows!   Tl;Dr why do anarcho-capitalists defend capitalism when it is a critical enemy to the goal of traditional anarchism?	1643060903.0	sbxieq	/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/sbxieq/honest_question_from_anarchocommunist/	Honest Question from Anarcho-Communist

4daw99fa	I‚Äôm all for deregulation of everything. However, my sister says that regulation of drug prices is good since it forces companies to not over charge for life saving drugs. And this would save lives since many poor people would be able to afford the now ‚Äúcheaper‚Äù drugs. Since the drug companies have a patent on it, there is no way for competitors to make the drug.
