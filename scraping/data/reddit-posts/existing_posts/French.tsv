inqlzsh0	Hi! I'm interested in doing the Explore program in Canada (been wanting to do it for years, and finally have the time to!). I was wondering if I could get some insight from other people who've done it around my age (23y/o). After searching through some Reddit posts and hearing what people have to say, right now my top 3 choices are:  1. Université Sainte-Anne, Nova Scotia ([info](https://englishfrench.ca/event/universite-sainte-anne/)) 2. French Immersion School, Western University (Trois-Pistoles, QC) ([info](https://englishfrench.ca/event/french-immersion-school-western-university-trois-pistoles/)) 3. Université du Québec à Chicoutimi ([info](https://englishfrench.ca/event/universite-du-quebec-a-chicoutimi/))  in that order, but this order is flexible and I'm open to other areas too. I can only do the summer session, though, which I think is different than most of the posts I've seen. I've heard from some people that I might not enjoy myself as much if I'm around people who are a lot younger. For example, I've heard amazing things about Saint-Anne, but it's 16+ for the summer session and I'm not sure of the proportion of older vs younger students. I wonder if anyone who did it beyond 21 could give me some insight?  Also I've heard host families are the best way to learn French, but I'm a tad nervous because I've heard it can be really hit and miss about your luck of how the host family welcomes you, and would you get to meet as many people in the program?  Finally, would there be enough time to do a part time job on the side? I might have to continue with some (remote) stuff in the summer.  Any advice would be much appreciated!  Ps. For reference, I'd call myself around A2/B1 French and looking to get to at minimum B2.	1642376490.0	s5p1jf	/r/French/comments/s5p1jf/canada_fsl_explore_program/	Canada FSL Explore Program
5n7ohec8	I’m looking for a French immersion study abroad program for my daughter for the summer. She’s 16 and will be a senior in high school next year. She has been to Paris before but open to anywhere in France. Everything I find online has so many mixed reviews it’s hard to know what would be good! She’ll finish up her fourth year of French this year and would love to spend 2-6 weeks in a program.

fh0pavtd	I studied French at the Alliance Francaise from 2017-2019. I did all the courses offered, A1-C1. Instead of taking the DELF at each level, I decided I'd wait to take the DALF after I finish the highest level because, at that point, the lower ones wouldn't matter... I regret not taking them now. I took the A1, did pretty well, and decided I'd wait to take the C1. I planned on taking the DALF 3 months after I finished the C1 course, in March 2020. It got postponed to June and then just cancelled because, yknow.  I finally took it in December 2021, two years after finishing the course. I didn't stay in touch with the language as much as I should have and definitely did not prepare well enough. I was still hoping I'd at least pass, but I didn't.  I'm not sure what to do next. Do I take a step back and attempt the B2 instead? Do I retake the C1 after 3-6 months of preparation? Would it be stupid of me to give myself 6 months and attempt the C2?  If anyone has had a similar experience or could offer some guidance, I'd appreciate some advice.

25frc765	I'm watching a French movie on Netflix with French subtitles ("How I Became a Superhero").  At one point I was very confused about which character was which, because someone was referring a police lieutenant as "le lieutenant" even though she was female.

diqssv6t	Hello all. I am looking for any tips anyone might have in regards to getting pronunciation correct. When I was about 5 years old I had incredibly bad speech impediments that I had to go to speech therapy for. Could not say my w's, l's, th's, ch's, sh's and worst of all my r's that took 3 years of multiple a week sessions to help correct. As I'm Canadian I spent 10 years learning French and still have never been able to get the correct pronunciations down no matter what teacher I had.   I've been trying to learn French more now with Duolingo and Rosetta Stone to start but it's frustrating as I've never been able to do the guttural R sound - never been able to roll my R's either. Does anyone have any tips or tricks on how to get that sound correct as I'm feeling at a loss here.

cledv	Bonjour à toutes et à tous, I hope this little guide helps new learners, just like it helped me. Knowing English and Spanish, I found it weird in the beginning how the French negation requires a second word in a different part of the sentence, sometimes not used at all, and I was always using it the wrong way. A friend of mine explained it perfectly and I hope this helps for anyone here struggling:  Brief history: PAS means “step.” In old French, it was used to emphasize a phrase.  * “I can’t move” « je ne marche » * “I can’t move a step!” « je ne marche pas! »  Eventually it became the standard and now a grammatical rule. So for English speakers, think of the word: SHIT. When you really need to emphasize something, you don’t just say “I can’t see,” you say “I can’t see shit!”  STRUCTURE: Subject + negation + verb + (emphasis). The second part of the negation, the emphasis, *comes after the verb*.  * I can’t see shit, I can’t hear shit, I don’t know shit. * Je ne vois pas, je n’entends pas, je ne sais pas.  For French, the emphasizing word is necessary. Now, sometimes you omit the “pas” when there’s a second negation, just like you would in English. For purposes of this example, our use of “anything” is the French word “nothing” - « rien *»*  * “I don’t know *anything” - « J*e ne sais *rien »* * “I don't understand *anything" - «* Je ne comprends *rien »*  You don’t say “I don’t know shit anything” just like you won’t say « Je ne sais pas rien ». Instead, you replace the emphasizing word (shit) with the second negation (nothing/anything); in French, you replace the “emphasizing” word (pas) with the second negation « rien »  Finally, a word starting with "not" in French simply uses the pas. *« pas de problème »* ; for that there is no equivalent, so just remember it; it's pretty simple.  It’s a hilarious example but laid it out perfectly for me to understand sentence structure with negations, so I hope this helps you too :)	1642762380.0	s985fz	/r/French/comments/s985fz/a_little_guide_to_how_the_negation_works_ne_pas/	A little guide to how the negation works: ne + pas

5cvv5	Hey everyone, I'm getting started with learning French and I'm looking for some French song recommendations! I enjoy synthpop and new wave, such as Depeche Mode, TR/ST, New Order, and The Knife. On the flip side, I also really like relaxed, spaced-out stuff like Sunset Rollercoaster's entire discography, as well as bossa nova (Stan Getz/Joao Gilberto etc), jangle pop (think Camera Obscura), and dreampop (like Slowdive).  On the jangle pop side, I like Doggy. Here's Je suis né sur un bateau: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFuANhfFBiw  Onto the synthpop/new wave/coldwave, I like the two below:  Opéra De Nuit - Ami ! Amant !:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxoICiLKFYA  Alain Bashung - Alcaline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAi-wRUCEKw  And a bit more on the bossa nova and jazzy side, I dig Coralie Clément's L'ombre et la lumière: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZVpTvDj_A  So yeah, if anyone has any recommendations, I'd seriously appreciate it!

67pkz	I've been searching off and on for a little while for how the Deaf or Hard of Hearing would refer to our struggles. I find a lot about the various sign languages, which is something I should learn more of, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for.   I'm still stumbling through the hearing world because I have some hearing.  I haven't seen disabilities in general covered in the classes/lessons/apps I've used, and I have no idea how to describe my own issues.   I started learning before I started losing my hearing so I sound *okay* if I speak slowly (in either language, I make audible mistakes speaking English now too). I'd like to be able to explain that I can't understand or I jumble up my words because I can't hear/struggle with audio processing rather than simply not knowing the words. Sometimes it's both :P.  Also if anyone has focused resources or experience learning like me, I'll happily take the advice. I feel like my writing/speaking is lagging so far behind my reading skill partially because I can't hold normal conversations.	1642873822.0	sa7wom	/r/French/comments/sa7wom/deafhard_of_hearing_descriptions/	Deaf/Hard of Hearing descriptions

arejw1h	A little introduction Hello everybody! I’ve been passively following this subreddit for a couple of months now, to remind myself to study french, and I finally decided to pick it up.  To be completely honest I’m not 100% new to french, as I studied it in middle school (very lazily, but still, I studied it). Plus I’m italian and I can speak english to a above-mediocre/mildly-advanced level.    I don’t have much time as of right now, but I’ve made my new year resolution to learn a third language, and I chose French! However some question came up to mind immediately:  How do you approach a language as a bilingual? Is it ideal to incorporate both your already spoken languages to your daily practicing? Should I start watching French movies/tv shows with alternating english and italian subtitles?  Because I started with reading a little bit about how some the grammar works and I downloaded Duolinguo just to get dome work done, even if it’s not much, however I did all of that strictly in italian. I’m just afraid my learning process might become too one-sided, but at the same time I thought to myself thst as long as I study it, there shouldn’t be any problem. What do you recommend I’d do?   Also if you could recommend some pieces of media (music/shows/movies/…) in French for a beginner, i’d really appreciate it!  Merci beaucoup!    TL;DR:  I want to learn french as an itaisn who also speaks a bit of english. I wanted to know if i need to practice this new language both in english and italian, or if it’s ok to just do it in one language. also if you have some music/shows etc.  that can really benefit for a beginner, I’d really appreciated it if you dropped them down below	1642895766.0	safszl	/r/French/comments/safszl/how_to_approach_a_new_language_as_a_bilingual_and/	How to approach a new language as a bilingual and other questions about French

a0n8w9v4	In about a year and a half, I might be going to France for a year or two during university! The uni teaches in English, so school wise I don't need to know any French, but I figured for living there it would be good to start preemptively learning on the side/when I have time to get ahead. + For personal interest reasons, I've been slightly interested in learning French for a bit, so I figured this would be a good chance/justification to do so!   I did see the resource tab, but was wondering what people found they had the most success in/what helped them the most with learning? Currently I know essentially no French, but I do know conversational Japanese and took a couple of years of Spanish, which I'm hoping could help a little!

qgx9k	I've been learning French for several years and this is a question that still bothers me and which I've never bothered to find a straight answer for. I'm reasonably familiar with the various ways to express obligation (e.g. falloir, devoir), but as a native English speaker I've always wondered this:   In English, if I want to express that someone is obligated to *not* do something, I can say "You must not do that!" And if I want to instead express that someone is *not obligated* to do something, I can say "You (don't have to/don't need to) do that." As an example of the contrast here--  * "You must not brush your teeth before dinner" means that in no circumstances should you brush your teeth before dinner, whereas * "You don't have to/don't need to brush your teeth before dinner" means that it might still be permissible to brush your teeth before dinner, but it's not an obligation.  My question is simply if there is any way to explicitly distinguish these two meanings in French. I *think* I've seen things like "*Il ne faut pas te brosser les dents avant le dîner*" used for both senses above (please correct me if this is wrong!) but I wasn't sure if there was a way to make it clear which meaning is to be taken, besides context. I had previously tried to construct sentences like "*Tu dois ne pas faire cela!*" but from what I understand that isn't really a comfortable or correct way of phrasing things. Any help would be much appreciated.	1642972894.0	sb48zr	/r/French/comments/sb48zr/obligation_with_negations/	Obligation with negations

Could I perhaps get a second opinion on this:  &#x200B;  Bonjour Anna,  Je m’appelle Laurie et je suis votre partenaire pour le «Projet d’éxchange virtuel».  Quand voulez-vous vous rencontrer?

Are there major errors? Is the tone ok? Should I maybe send both versions or just the French one?  I enjoy French but I am admittedly not the best student. She's an intermediate English learner, so I don't think she will be too critical either way but I don't want to make a bad first impression.  &#x200B;  Any advice?

I am trying to aquire a french book that my girlfriend desperatly needs for a small paper she is writing and we cant find it anywhere. The title is  "Le français en Belgique : une langue, une communauté" by Paul Aron published in 1999(or 1997 there are two diffrent dates in the sources we found). Although I think there where other authors involved two.  I would be imensly greatful if those among you, able to use the french languge, could check some french book stores or similar to help me find it   Thanks a lot guys!!!	1642795366.0	s9ji8x	/r/French/comments/s9ji8x/help_needed_sourcing_a_french_book/	Help needed sourcing a french book
5cvv5	Hey everyone, I'm getting started with learning French and I'm looking for some French song recommendations! I enjoy synthpop and new wave, such as Depeche Mode, TR/ST, New Order, and The Knife. On the flip side, I also really like relaxed, spaced-out stuff like Sunset Rollercoaster's entire discography, as well as bossa nova (Stan Getz/Joao Gilberto etc), jangle pop (think Camera Obscura), and dreampop (like Slowdive).  On the jangle pop side, I like Doggy. Here's Je suis né sur un bateau: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFuANhfFBiw  Onto the synthpop/new wave/coldwave, I like the two below:  Opéra De Nuit - Ami ! Amant !:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxoICiLKFYA  Alain Bashung - Alcaline: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAi-wRUCEKw  And a bit more on the bossa nova and jazzy side, I dig Coralie Clément's L'ombre et la lumière: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZVpTvDj_A  So yeah, if anyone has any recommendations, I'd seriously appreciate it!

67pkz	I've been searching off and on for a little while for how the Deaf or Hard of Hearing would refer to our struggles. I find a lot about the various sign languages, which is something I should learn more of, but it's not exactly what I'm looking for.   I'm still stumbling through the hearing world because I have some hearing.  I haven't seen disabilities in general covered in the classes/lessons/apps I've used, and I have no idea how to describe my own issues.   I started learning before I started losing my hearing so I sound *okay* if I speak slowly (in either language, I make audible mistakes speaking English now too). I'd like to be able to explain that I can't understand or I jumble up my words because I can't hear/struggle with audio processing rather than simply not knowing the words. Sometimes it's both :P.  Also if anyone has focused resources or experience learning like me, I'll happily take the advice. I feel like my writing/speaking is lagging so far behind my reading skill partially because I can't hold normal conversations.	1642873822.0	sa7wom	/r/French/comments/sa7wom/deafhard_of_hearing_descriptions/	Deaf/Hard of Hearing descriptions

arejw1h	A little introduction Hello everybody! I’ve been passively following this subreddit for a couple of months now, to remind myself to study french, and I finally decided to pick it up.  To be completely honest I’m not 100% new to french, as I studied it in middle school (very lazily, but still, I studied it). Plus I’m italian and I can speak english to a above-mediocre/mildly-advanced level.    I don’t have much time as of right now, but I’ve made my new year resolution to learn a third language, and I chose French! However some question came up to mind immediately:  How do you approach a language as a bilingual? Is it ideal to incorporate both your already spoken languages to your daily practicing? Should I start watching French movies/tv shows with alternating english and italian subtitles?  Because I started with reading a little bit about how some the grammar works and I downloaded Duolinguo just to get dome work done, even if it’s not much, however I did all of that strictly in italian. I’m just afraid my learning process might become too one-sided, but at the same time I thought to myself thst as long as I study it, there shouldn’t be any problem. What do you recommend I’d do?   Also if you could recommend some pieces of media (music/shows/movies/…) in French for a beginner, i’d really appreciate it!  Merci beaucoup!    TL;DR:  I want to learn french as an itaisn who also speaks a bit of english. I wanted to know if i need to practice this new language both in english and italian, or if it’s ok to just do it in one language. also if you have some music/shows etc.  that can really benefit for a beginner, I’d really appreciated it if you dropped them down below	1642895766.0	safszl	/r/French/comments/safszl/how_to_approach_a_new_language_as_a_bilingual_and/	How to approach a new language as a bilingual and other questions about French

a0n8w9v4	In about a year and a half, I might be going to France for a year or two during university! The uni teaches in English, so school wise I don't need to know any French, but I figured for living there it would be good to start preemptively learning on the side/when I have time to get ahead. + For personal interest reasons, I've been slightly interested in learning French for a bit, so I figured this would be a good chance/justification to do so!   I did see the resource tab, but was wondering what people found they had the most success in/what helped them the most with learning? Currently I know essentially no French, but I do know conversational Japanese and took a couple of years of Spanish, which I'm hoping could help a little!   I've started with duolingo for now/have been thinking of making little quizlet sets for numbers/basic adjectives/colors/etc to start out.

Example:  Dans la rue/dans le carton = in the road, in the box  Dans l'avion/l'escalier= on the plane/on the stairs  So, why can't I say dans le tableau (on the table) instead of sur le tableau?

I'm looking for ways to stay beyond my 90 days, and one I've been considering is enrolling in a language school and getting a student visa through that. To qualify, I know programs must amount to more than 20 hours a week for 3+ months. Does anyone have experience getting a visa this way?

qgx9k	I've been learning French for several years and this is a question that still bothers me and which I've never bothered to find a straight answer for. I'm reasonably familiar with the various ways to express obligation (e.g. falloir, devoir), but as a native English speaker I've always wondered this:   In English, if I want to express that someone is obligated to *not* do something, I can say "You must not do that!" And if I want to instead express that someone is *not obligated* to do something, I can say "You (don't have to/don't need to) do that." As an example of the contrast here--  * "You must not brush your teeth before dinner" means that in no circumstances should you brush your teeth before dinner, whereas * "You don't have to/don't need to brush your teeth before dinner" means that it might still be permissible to brush your teeth before dinner, but it's not an obligation.  My question is simply if there is any way to explicitly distinguish these two meanings in French. I *think* I've seen things like "*Il ne faut pas te brosser les dents avant le dîner*" used for both senses above (please correct me if this is wrong!) but I wasn't sure if there was a way to make it clear which meaning is to be taken, besides context. I had previously tried to construct sentences like "*Tu dois ne pas faire cela!*" but from what I understand that isn't really a comfortable or correct way of phrasing things. Any help would be much appreciated.	1642972894.0	sb48zr	/r/French/comments/sb48zr/obligation_with_negations/	Obligation with negations

arejw1h	A little introduction Hello everybody! I’ve been passively following this subreddit for a couple of months now, to remind myself to study french, and I finally decided to pick it up.  To be completely honest I’m not 100% new to french, as I studied it in middle school (very lazily, but still, I studied it). Plus I’m italian and I can speak english to a above-mediocre/mildly-advanced level.    I don’t have much time as of right now, but I’ve made my new year resolution to learn a third language, and I chose French! However some question came up to mind immediately:  How do you approach a language as a bilingual? Is it ideal to incorporate both your already spoken languages to your daily practicing? Should I start watching French movies/tv shows with alternating english and italian subtitles?  Because I started with reading a little bit about how some the grammar works and I downloaded Duolinguo just to get dome work done, even if it’s not much, however I did all of that strictly in italian. I’m just afraid my learning process might become too one-sided, but at the same time I thought to myself thst as long as I study it, there shouldn’t be any problem. What do you recommend I’d do?   Also if you could recommend some pieces of media (music/shows/movies/…) in French for a beginner, i’d really appreciate it!  Merci beaucoup!    TL;DR:  I want to learn french as an itaisn who also speaks a bit of english. I wanted to know if i need to practice this new language both in english and italian, or if it’s ok to just do it in one language. also if you have some music/shows etc.  that can really benefit for a beginner, I’d really appreciated it if you dropped them down below	1642895766.0	safszl	/r/French/comments/safszl/how_to_approach_a_new_language_as_a_bilingual_and/	How to approach a new language as a bilingual and other questions about French

a0n8w9v4	In about a year and a half, I might be going to France for a year or two during university! The uni teaches in English, so school wise I don't need to know any French, but I figured for living there it would be good to start preemptively learning on the side/when I have time to get ahead. + For personal interest reasons, I've been slightly interested in learning French for a bit, so I figured this would be a good chance/justification to do so!   I did see the resource tab, but was wondering what people found they had the most success in/what helped them the most with learning? Currently I know essentially no French, but I do know conversational Japanese and took a couple of years of Spanish, which I'm hoping could help a little!   I've started with duolingo for now/have been thinking of making little quizlet sets for numbers/basic adjectives/colors/etc to start out.

Plus I’m italian and I can speak english to a above-mediocre/mildly-advanced level.    I don’t have much time as of right now, but I’ve made my new year resolution to learn a third language, and I chose French! However some question came up to mind immediately:  How do you approach a language as a bilingual? Is it ideal to incorporate both your already spoken languages to your daily practicing? Should I start watching French movies/tv shows with alternating english and italian subtitles?  Because I started with reading a little bit about how some the grammar works and I downloaded Duolinguo just to get dome work done, even if it’s not much, however I did all of that strictly in italian. I’m just afraid my learning process might become too one-sided, but at the same time I thought to myself thst as long as I study it, there shouldn’t be any problem. What do you recommend I’d do?   Also if you could recommend some pieces of media (music/shows/movies/…) in French for a beginner, i’d really appreciate it!  Merci beaucoup!    TL;DR:  I want to learn french as an itaisn who also speaks a bit of english. I wanted to know if i need to practice this new language both in english and italian, or if it’s ok to just do it in one language. also if you have some music/shows etc.  that can really benefit for a beginner, I’d really appreciated it if you dropped them down below	1642895766.0	safszl	/r/French/comments/safszl/how_to_approach_a_new_language_as_a_bilingual_and/	How to approach a new language as a bilingual and other questions about French
iodkh3av	I only know the alphabet, colors, shapes, numbers, months, days of the week, few dozen verbs in the present tense, and a few other lists of vocabulary. The gist is I only have the ability to understand baby songs and media, anything else is above me. They're annoying as hell and discouraging me from continuing to learn (even though I'm make no or slow progress). How can I keep learning despite I'm not able to enjoy it since I'm such a beginner?	1642900763.0	sahiqy	/r/French/comments/sahiqy/i_can_only_understand_children_songs_and_its/	I can only understand children songs and it's annoying!

a0n8w9v4	In about a year and a half, I might be going to France for a year or two during university! The uni teaches in English, so school wise I don't need to know any French, but I figured for living there it would be good to start preemptively learning on the side/when I have time to get ahead. + For personal interest reasons, I've been slightly interested in learning French for a bit, so I figured this would be a good chance/justification to do so!   I did see the resource tab, but was wondering what people found they had the most success in/what helped them the most with learning? Currently I know essentially no French, but I do know conversational Japanese and took a couple of years of Spanish, which I'm hoping could help a little!   I've started with duolingo for now/have been thinking of making little quizlet sets for numbers/basic adjectives/colors/etc to start out.

Example:  Dans la rue/dans le carton = in the road, in the box  Dans l'avion/l'escalier= on the plane/on the stairs  So, why can't I say dans le tableau (on the table) instead of sur le tableau?  Similarly, I see en being used when I would've used dans.

zdy2quz	Hi all,  Currently an American living in Paris (for the 90 days allotted to tourists). I'm looking for ways to stay beyond my 90 days, and one I've been considering is enrolling in a language school and getting a student visa through that. To qualify, I know programs must amount to more than 20 hours a week for 3+ months. Does anyone have experience getting a visa this way? If so, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that process, what schools are good to apply to (I know programs are typically expensive. Cheaper the better!), etc. Thanks!	1642958024.0	sayfcj	/r/French/comments/sayfcj/language_program_student_visa/	Language Program | Student Visa

qgx9k	I've been learning French for several years and this is a question that still bothers me and which I've never bothered to find a straight answer for. I'm reasonably familiar with the various ways to express obligation (e.g. falloir, devoir), but as a native English speaker I've always wondered this:   In English, if I want to express that someone is obligated to *not* do something, I can say "You must not do that!" And if I want to instead express that someone is *not obligated* to do something, I can say "You (don't have to/don't need to) do that." As an example of the contrast here--  * "You must not brush your teeth before dinner" means that in no circumstances should you brush your teeth before dinner, whereas * "You don't have to/don't need to brush your teeth before dinner" means that it might still be permissible to brush your teeth before dinner, but it's not an obligation.  My question is simply if there is any way to explicitly distinguish these two meanings in French. I *think* I've seen things like "*Il ne faut pas te brosser les dents avant le dîner*" used for both senses above (please correct me if this is wrong!) but I wasn't sure if there was a way to make it clear which meaning is to be taken, besides context. I had previously tried to construct sentences like "*Tu dois ne pas faire cela!*" but from what I understand that isn't really a comfortable or correct way of phrasing things. Any help would be much appreciated.	1642972894.0	sb48zr	/r/French/comments/sb48zr/obligation_with_negations/	Obligation with negations

My high school offers 5 levels of French, although I have yet to take any of them (I only recently decided that I would want to learn French).

Je prends des cours, mais ces cours sont pour le niveau intermediare au lycée, et je dois les cours avancé. Malheuresement, il manque de l'argent pour prendre des cours hors de lycée.

51r5gi5g	Merci en avance. Chaque jour en voix haut je lit pour une heure ou demi heure. J'essaye lire comme un "vrai francophone" lol et ne pas prononcer le "ne" quand c'est possible. Mais "Quand c'est possible" ça c'est souvent très difficile à deturminer et il n'y a pas de règle stricte pour vous aider.  ".. et pourtant elle ne pouvait s'empêcher d'y penser."  Cette phrase n'a que le "ne" et pas un deuxième article (pas, plus, rien, jamais, etc) à indiquer une négative et justement on devrait prononcer (même en voix haut avec les amis) le "Ne", Non ?  J'espère que ça c'est bien vrai et je sais qu'il y a  d'autres cas où l'on prononce le "Ne" dans une phrase mais honnêtement je n'ai pas beaucoup d'expérience avec les phrases dans lesquelles il n'y a qu'un seul article négatif.

J'ai l'impression que l'on peut entendre mon accent australien et cela me rend folle parce que je dois parler français tout le temps et j'ai l'impression d'avoir perdu l'accent et le vocabulaire.

126q7b	I recently encountered a wonderful article. I would love to find the relevant book that contains the article. Thank you so much!   This is the content of the article.**‘Il ya autant d’avantages que d’inconvénients d’aller étudier à l’étranger’.**  **Etes-vous d’accord ou non ? Discutez.**  Selon moi les raisons pour lesquelles une personne doit aller à l’étranger sont innombrables. Parmi les arguments principaux de ceux qui soutiennent de l’étude dans un autre pays est qu’en se forçant à habiter à l’étranger, on doit parler la langue à tous moments qui entraîne une amélioration vaste des aptitudes linguistiques.  Si on va à l’étranger, on apprendra beaucoup en ce qui concerne la culture, les gens et aussi simplement la vie quotidienne des étrangers. Quand on se plonge dans les habitudes des habitants d’un pays étranger, on le trouvera beaucoup plus facile de comprendre les gens de ce pays.  En allant à l’étranger pour étudier, on peut élargir ses horizons pour l’avenir, parce qu’en gagnant une abondance d’expérience d’habitant à l’étranger, la candidature d’une personne plaira plus une entreprise internationale que celui de quelqu’un qui ne suis jamais allé à l’étranger pour étudier.  Cependant, sur l’autre côté, il y a des inconvénients d’aller étudier à l’étranger. Dont un est le fait qu’il prend souvent plusieurs semaines à adapter à la vie différente, et donc ses études n’ont pas la priorité absolue pendant ce temps.  Souvent quand une personne étudie à l’étranger, il y a un grand nombre d’autres personnes qui font la même. Donc il y aura beaucoup de gens de la même nationalité qui signifie qu’il est moins d’un défi d’habiter là.  Un autre problème des études à l’étranger est qu’il coûte très cher. Si on va à l’étranger, on doit louer d’hébergement et payer pour la nourriture et tout de ceci sans parents pour payer pour vous.  En conclusion, d’après moi, les avantages d’aller étudier à l’étranger l’emportent largement sur les inconvénients. L’étude à l’étranger est une excellente chose à faire pour améliorer considérablement ses aptitudes linguistiques et j’attends avec impatience le faisant pendant mes études à la fac.	1643120776.0	sceydc	/r/French/comments/sceydc/need_help_finding_document_il_ya_autant/	Need help finding document: "‘Il ya autant d’avantages que d’inconvénients d’aller étudier à l’étranger".
62beyehq	Currently living in France and took some language courses until I made it past A2.

Même s’il n’aime pas être sur tes genoux, si tu d’abord mets un coussin que j’ai fait pour lui, ça va, il est très content et il y dort pour des heures.

I didn't quite understand the function of que here as a translation like "It's \*that\* the language (and the language) aren't ordinary objects of study" didn't really seem to fit in with the context. So I went to an online Swedish-French dictionary and looked up definitions for que, thinking there might be some translation I didn't know about and found the above mentionted sentence as the last listed use for que. It simply translated it as "It's wrong/an errror to believe" and gave the comment "No equivalent in Swedish". And so I got really curious about the function of que here. Would it signify the same thing as "C'est une erreur de croire"? Is the use of que in this sentence the same as the one from the text I was reading or was my translation correct even if I don't understand why it works in context?

1z3xit	I'm taking a French immersion course that started just a couple weeks ago and am very new to the language. The teacher taught us that every noun needs to have "un determinant" with it or it will be grammatically incorrect. E.g. "chat" is incorrect. "le chat" is correct. Then when we were talking about pronouns and we needed to clarify with the teacher between "il" and "ils" because the pronunciation is the same, she asked us to say "avec s" or "sans s". Here, I noticed that the letter "s" (which I presume to be a noun) does not have "un determinant" when we say it. According to what we learned, I thought it should be correct to say "avec **un** s" or sans **un** s". Which is grammatically correct?  I know this is very nitpicky but I am a school teacher in Ontario and potentially I will be asked to help with spelling words from students.  If a student has written in Francais - "La piscine" like this: "La piscin", would I say "Vous ajoutez **un** e" or "Vous ajoutez e"? Which is the grammatically correct way? Also, are all letters feminine or masculine or does it depend on the letter?	1643249073.0	sdmwxx	/r/French/comments/sdmwxx/using_un_determinant_articles/	Using "un determinant" (articles)

3w04coo7	I'm trying to understand when a partitive article turns into 'de' in the negation. For example: we say "Il y a des nuages", but in the negative, it becomes "Il n'y a pas de nuages" as I understand.     However, I thought that this only applied to the article which the negated verb is acting on, in this case avoir is being applied to des nuages. Hence I wrote "Il ne faut pas apporter des shorts", because the negative is applied to falloir, and apporter, which I see as the relevant verb for les shorts in this case, is not in the negative. However, my teacher said it is wrong and it should be "Il ne faut pas apporter de shorts". I am a bit confused, so I thought, okay, maybe the rule applies as long as there is some negation in any part in the entire phrase.     Yet when I use deepl to translate "I don't need to wear shorts", it gives me "Je n'ai pas besoin de porter des shorts". Now it's back to des shorts. My guess it's because there's already a de in the sentence , but at this point it's just wild guesswork for me.      Can someone explain to me this in a unified way?	1643258891.0	sdq4ld	/r/French/comments/sdq4ld/question_on_negated_partitive_afticle/	Question on Negated Partitive afticle

10l2kq	This isn't an excuse to learn swear words to impress friends or something. I'm aware that I've found it harder to understand people speaking casual French than I should because whenever I listen to them, there will be that one word that's either offensive or slang (not casual French, but, like, youth slang or something) that I won't understand which will cause the whole sentence they say to become meaningless.  E.g. If I was talking in English and said, "That guy can go screw himself" and I didn't know what the word "screw" meant, then I wouldn't understand the sentence, and it would seem like I understood a lot less than I actually did.	1643299059.0	se1lcx	/r/French/comments/se1lcx/is_there_a_way_to_learn_bad_words_in_french_so/	Is there a way to learn bad words in French so that you understand when people are saying them to you?
h9fsmxq	I saw something that made me think along the lines of "How to make them mine?", and I'm wondering whether "Comment les faire miens ?" would be a good way of saying that. Google Translate suggests so, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. How idiomatic is it? Do you know of a better way of saying it?   Then there is "Qu'ils deviennent miens.", which, according to [Reverso Context](https://context.reverso.net/translation/english-french/make+them+mine), means "I want to make them mine." However, GT translates that as "Let them become mine". I have a feeling that GT's translation of the latter sentence is more accurate -- at least word for word. Moreover, in sentences like that one, is there usually no "Je veux" or something preceding "que"? It looks like imperative to me, and maybe just "que" suffices, for some reason.	1643306026.0	se49d3	/r/French/comments/se49d3/how_idiomatic_are_comment_les_faire_miens_and/	How idiomatic are "Comment les faire miens ?" and "Qu'ils deviennent miens"?

Would it be accurate to translate "J'aime la façon dont vous vivez" as "I like the way (in which) you live" and "J'aime ta façon de vivre" as "I like your way of living"? Yes, both have the same meaning, as far as I can tell, but there are nuances as far as the language goes.  Then there is "Je l'aime beaucoup"... Am I right in thinking that, without context, there's no way of knowing whether it means "I like it/him/her a lot" or "I love it/him/her a lot"?  https://context.reverso.net/translation/french-english/J%27aime+la+fa%C3%A7on+dont  https://context.reverso.net/translation/french-english/Je+l%27aime+beaucoup  (...And some Google Translate exploration.)	1643468552.0	sfjuyx	/r/French/comments/sfjuyx/jaime_la_façon_dont_vs_jaime_ta_façon_de_and/	"J'aime la façon dont..." vs. "J'aime ta façon de...", and something concerning "Je l'aime beaucoup"

bzoz5yds	So I studied French at school till last year and after that, I completely dropped it except revising occasionally.But now I want to pick it up again from where I left off. I've done French at basic A2 level and would like to study further on my own and give the DELF exams. Looked up a couple of websites but they start from the most basic courses and I feel that would be a waste of time. So, I was looking for some resources or sites that allow you to pick up from where you left and learn the grammar further instead of starting from the base .

gm81kxdx	Hello! I hope this is an appropriate post for this sub. I'm self-learning French from the US while by quarantine. I took it in high school, but we all know how good American foreign language education is, lol! My level is probably a soft A2, but I struggle ⠀with verbal expression and don't have the grammatical concepts down. What I've been doing is texting with native speakers I met on a conversation exchange website. I've been heavily using the dictionary during these exchanges, but it seems to be really helping my vocabulary and knowledge. Occasionally I send recorded audio messages in heavily accented French, but I don't feel like I could actually have a coherent conversation yet about anything beyond basic stuff. I've also been watching EasyFrench on YouTube and occasionally perusing Netflix for easy-to-understand series, which I watch in French with French subtitles, and I write in a journal in French every day. I supplement with Duolingo, although I'm finding it somewhat too simple. I'd like to find a resource with some vocab I could study and with explanations for the grammatical concepts. So, a good A2-level textbook or website would be ideal. It doesn't have to be free, but that would be a bonus. I'm noticing patterns when talking to native speakers, but I want to ensure I'm actually understanding the concepts as well. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, any critique on my self-learning techniques would be welcome and wonderful. Thank you so much!	1643472226.0	sfl455	/r/French/comments/sfl455/selflearning_french_looking_for_a_good_textbook/	Self-learning French; looking for a good textbook .

Should I take B2, C1 or C2 considering that I don’t want to study that much since I know the language and I spent almost all my life speaking it?

h9fsmxq	My ways of learning French include exploring grammar, articles about subjects that interest me on French Wikipedia etc., online newspapers, song lyrics, listening to radio, adding common phrases (like "afin de") to a text document, playing around with Google Translate and various dictionaries (Wordreference, Wiktionary) and similar tools (Reverso Context) as well as practicing memorizing the words for numbers, days, months and so on.   However, I'm very interested in music, and it recently hit me that I'd really like to start reading French music reviews. I tried googling "music reviews french", but the search results didn't seem very relevant. Do any of you know where I should look? I don't really care who the reviews are written by, as long as they are written in French. It would be a bonus if the authors are passionate/knowledgeable about their subject matter.   Something like allmusic.com, metal-archives.com or sputnikmusic.com in French would be very good!  Update: After submitting my post here, I found r/AskFrance, so I made a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskFrance/comments/sgd5e4/where_can_i_find_french_music_reviews/) about music reviews there too.

cjjm6qjl	So this is a bit of a rant, but as per the title, after studying incredibly hard for a year, I have achieved B2 and passed the Delf in November. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that learning from B2 onwards will be more organic, like listening to original french resources in radiofrance or tv5 monde, reading real novels etc., not necessarily using the C1-C2 coursebooks.    And yet, I put on the interviews with french candidates for presidency listed on radiofrance, and hardly understand what is being said half of the time. I pick up a book from 'Hercules Poirot' series, and have to identify half the phrases by context. I put on dix pour cent on Netflix, and same story happens. Obviously, understanding half is better than none, but it still annoys me.   Honestly, I have been told that going from 0 to B2 is easier than going from B2 to C1, but damn is it hard. It was my goal to be comfortable communicating and writing in french in a professional environment, but it seems to me that any less than C1 won't cut it. And that, I now think, is going to take another year.   P.S. I know a lot of people are generally interested in Delf stories, but there really was no magical recipe for it. I put in ca. 700 learning hours distributed among all tested skills, of which 100 were individual tutoring, and passed the exam with 70% overall mark.	1643575351.0	sgiema	/r/French/comments/sgiema/after_passing_delf_b2_in_a_year_i_now_feel/	After passing Delf B2 in a year, I now feel discouraged

3fgxfwit	Saluut les gars!   Je vais tenter de réussir le DALF C2 ce vendredi. J'apprends le français depuis environ 6 ans et j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir passer 5 mois à Paris au total. J'ai travaillé en tant que vendeur SNCF ce qui m'a poussé à améliorer mon expression orale.   J'ai déjà fait le DALF C1 il y a presque 3 ans (c'était avant d'avoir décroché le job d'été à la SNCF) et j'ai eu 93/100. En plus de ça j'ai déjà réussi le C2 en allemand donc j'ai un peu d'expérience avec les épreuves de langues étrangères à ce niveau-là. Malgré tout cela je me sens un tout petit peu (lisez beaucoup) stressé et je me demande s'il y a des gens ici qui ont déjà passé cette épreuve qui seraient en mesure de me donner des conseils.   J'ai notamment un peu peur de la production écrite parce que je ne sais pas si j'aurai assez de choses à dire étant donné qu'il faut écrire 700 mots. Est-ce que vous avez des idées sur comment écrire 700 mots sur un sujet qui ne m'intéresse pas? Je crains de tomber sur une problématique qui concerne l'art ou une problématique bidon à mon sens et je me vois en difficulté à m'étaler sur le sujet.   J'ai acheté le cours DALF C2 sur français avec Pierre et je connais le format de l'examen. Je révise également le livre de grammaire niveau perfectionnement (par CLÉ) et j'essaie d'élargir mon vocabulaire en lisant des articles ou en regardant des documentaires quasiment tous les jours. J'ai aussi le livre de vocabulaire pour les niveaux C1 - C2.   Quelles seraient les activités complémentaires à faire selon vous?  Est-ce qu'il y a des conseils que vous auriez aimé recevoir quelques jours avant la passation de l'épreuve?

Has anyone had a similar issue?	1643671738.0	shfpnr	/r/French/comments/shfpnr/mistake_on_delfb2_certificate/	Mistake on DELF-B2 certificate
j4k9g4pr	Hello! My great grandfather was French Canadian, and from what I understand their parents were from France.   I want to start learning French, what’s the best way to do it? (I’m American and as of right now, cannot travel to France to learn from the French). I know there are several programs you can buy, wondering if anyone has any experience with them and can guide me in the correct direction.	1643676190.0	shhauq	/r/French/comments/shhauq/im_of_french_decent_and_want_to_learn_french/	I’m of French decent, and want to learn French.
c2bakt53	Hi all,  I was looking for some advice, I feel there's a gap in my learning journey. I've done as much grammar and basic knowledge, and I have a large vocabulary but I feel I have no idea how to construct sentences on my own. There's textbook French and there's spoken french where words are joined or glossed over and I feel I have no real way of grasping at what's being said or how to construct sentences In a way that doesn't sound like a textbook. Has anyone else found this and how do you overcome it?  Thanks in advance	1643678359.0	shi3b9	/r/French/comments/shi3b9/gaps_in_learning_journey/	Gaps in learning journey

dy0bsq36	I'm currently sitting between A2 and B1.  I'm really keen on doing some exchange programs in France but since its undergrad most programs are solely in French. They require minimum B2.  I need some advice on how to do it to give me some confidence, because right now I struggle to believe that I can learn french to a level where I could study engineering in french, without living in a francophone country.  I have at least a year+ before I can even apply to these programs so I have time, but I just don't know how to best utilise it.  To get where I am now i've just been watching french youtube videos and practicing once a week for 30 mins speaking with my language exchange partner.  I don't feel this is enough alone to get me to a level where I can study in french at university. I've looked at taking  classes at Alliance Française but they go at an extremely slow pace, I'm considering getting a private tutor instead.

26tp4ho9	Even if you are beginner, lets say A2, try to learn as much as you can your prepositionnal verbs : which one goes with à and de (sometimes both). That will help you a long way in your study because a lot of grammar rules are working with thoses (y/en, pronoms relatifs, etc...). Maybe do a little notebook with verbs + prep as soon as you meet a new one.    For those of you that are advanced level, let me know if you did learn them, if it help you or held you back not to know them.

9qbzffa5	Boujour mec, just been listening to some music today and I'm a little confused by the lyrics. The line is at the start is «Moi je suis né, pour n'être avec toi» and in my mind I first thought that read as «I was born, so not to be with you» but hearing the rest of the song and looking at deepl translation it actually is «I was born, so to be only with you» and I'm just wondering if I'm missing something with how I've translated it or is there a rule like other words where the négative also means thé positive. I sweat I know of other contexts in french that have the same pattern although I can't remember any atm, so any other examples you guys can think of would be greatly apprecaited to get m'y head round this.

a90mkexd	I'm in my fifth year of learning French and am supposed to translate this French story. I understand most of the words just fine, but when they're put together they make no sense. I've checked translations as well and I'm wondering if maybe it has to do with colloquialisms. Does this make sense to anyone? I should also mention that if it matters it's a Mauritian fable, so that might be why it's a bit confusing? Here's the ending passage (from what I've gathered at first, it's about a guy who really likes eggs and has big pockets to put them in):  Il continue quelques pas et poutte ! Un deuxième œuf tombe. Il regarde les filles qui se regardent et là aussi silence !  Quelques pas encore en avant et poutte ! Un troisième œuf tombe. Il s’arrête et dit aux filles :    \- Est-ce que chez vous aussi les garçons pondent des œufs ?    \- Non répondent-elles ici ce sont les poules qui pondent des œufs.    \- Comme les hommes sont différents, dit le garçon, voyez-vous chez nous ce sont les garçons qui pondent surtout quand ils sont entourés par des filles.

hy7xb	tl;pl: AJA que le mot anglais "cricket" (l'insecte) ne se traduit pas par "criquet" en français, et que "grasshopper" ne signifie pas "sauterelle" comme je l'ai cru depuis des décennies.  For context, I'm a native French speaker and amateur entomologist. All of the entomological "work" I do is in English however, as well as all of the knowledge/jargon I've accumulated on the subject in my head. I was just in another thread about locusts and was thinking about the biblical plague and couldn't remember what they were called in the Bible. So I went to look that up and, from there, learned a few surprising things.   As a preface: most people don't know what a cricket is, what a grasshopper is, what locusts are, or what the hell a katydid even is. The same confusion/amalgamation exists in French but with different words. There are important morphological distinctions between those.   Ce qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est que je pensais (à tort, bien que de bon droit) que le mot anglais "cricket" correspondait au français "criquet". Ben en fait, non. Pareil pour "grasshopper", qui ne correspond pas à "sauterelle" contrairement à ce qu'il serait légitime de penser.  Properly, a French "sauterelle" is an English "katydid" and refers to the [Tettigoniidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae), and a French "criquet" is an English "grasshopper". You'd think something that "hops" in English is something that "saute" in French. And they do hop and sautent, of course... but that's not how vocabulary works. Meanwhile, an English "cricket" usually refers to what we call a "grillon" in French. Some types of crickets like the cave cricket or camel cricket (the [Rhaphidophoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae)) have a French equivalent (grillon des cavernes ou sauterelle cavernicole), while others such as the Jerusalem cricket (the [Stenopelmatidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenopelmatidae)) don't (makes sense since they're not found anywhere where French is spoken). The true crickets ([Gryllidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllidae)) are just referred to as "grillons".  I also learned a totally new word, "[sauteriau](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauteriau)", which is used to refer to certain grasshoppers that aren't locusts (FYI all [locusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust) are grasshoppers but not all grasshoppers are locusts).  Et puis enfin, il y a le mot "[courtilière](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpa_gryllotalpa)" dont j'avais oublié l'existence. Je l'ai reconnu tout de suite mais me suis aussitôt rendu compte qu'en fait, je n'avais jamais vraiment su de quoi il s'agit. J'ai donc appris qu'il s'agit en anglais du "mole cricket" que je connais bien ([Gryllotalpidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpidae)). Les jardiniers parmi vous auront raison de dire que je ne devais pas beaucoup jardiner lorsque j'habitais dans un lieu francophone, sinon je l'aurais su. Mais maintenant, je m'en souviendrai !  It all gets a little more complicated by than that, because in both languages, these common names can overlap different insects, and those overlaps don't necessarily match up between English and French. These minutiae will be of little interest to most of you as they're largely academic, and you'll probably keep calling these insects by their more vernacular and ambiguous names, but I thought I'd share anyway because it was fun for me to learn this today. :)  FR3 aurait pu en faire un épisode de "C'est pas sorcier" dans le temps !  P.S. it turns out the translation of "locust" is "locuste" in French. That's to be expected, since the word entered the English language from French.   P.P.S. based on what I learned today, the French Bible incorrectly refers to "locusts" as "sauterelles" 😉 P.P.P.S. j'espère que les non-francophones apprenant le français qui liront ceci apprécieront que j'aie un peu alterné entre l'anglais et le français, histoire de faire travailler un peu les neurones.	1643754370.0	si7jld	/r/French/comments/si7jld/a_story_about_the_names_of_certain_insects_in/	A story about the names of certain insects in French and English, and how there's always something new and interesting to learn

3dgr6vfu	First time posting so forgive me if this is against the rules, i did read through them and did not see one regarding this.  I have a friend who is pregnant, her first language is french. I have been looking for poems/sayings in french that I can get on a customized gift for her, the problem is that Im just finding poems that children would sing/say to mothers. I would like something more motherhood related. I am afraid to just translate an english saying/poem to french as it may not give the same sentiment in french or sound as nice.  Are there any proverbs, poems, quotes that are specifically about being a mother/a mothers love for her child?	1643413077.0	sf44ap	/r/French/comments/sf44ap/french_proverbs_for_mothers/	French proverbs for Mothers

hcovw	I have often heard that you need a B2 if you want to study in France and you need a C1 if you want to work in France. In fact I have many friends who are working in french speaking environments and have only acquired a B2 (but speak nearly fluently). I have heard that quite a few universities actually require a C1 certificate, even for undergrad.   &nbsp;  I think this raises the question regarding what the use of a C2 is? I think it's great for personal verification that you have mastered some aspect of the language, but from a practical standpoint, what is it for?

Now, I'd like to study in a student friendly city like Lyon maybe. In my research I found alliance francaise usually don't offer cheap accommodation.   However, what I found was universities offer reasonable accommodation in France. Hence I'd like to study French preferably in a university.

h9fsmxq	I'm trying to get a better grasp of the nuances when it comes to those phrases.   Would it be accurate to translate "J'aime la façon dont vous vivez" as "I like the way (in which) you live" and "J'aime ta façon de vivre" as "I like your way of living"? Yes, both have the same meaning, as far as I can tell, but there are nuances as far as the language goes.  Then there is "Je l'aime beaucoup"... Am I right in thinking that, without context, there's no way of knowing whether it means "I like it/him/her a lot" or "I love it/him/her a lot"?  https://context.reverso.net/translation/french-english/J%27aime+la+fa%C3%A7on+dont  https://context.reverso.net/translation/french-english/Je+l%27aime+beaucoup  (...And some Google Translate exploration.)	1643468552.0	sfjuyx	/r/French/comments/sfjuyx/jaime_la_façon_dont_vs_jaime_ta_façon_de_and/	"J'aime la façon dont..." vs. "J'aime ta façon de...", and something concerning "Je l'aime beaucoup"

I've done French at basic A2 level and would like to study further on my own and give the DELF exams. Looked up a couple of websites but they start from the most basic courses and I feel that would be a waste of time. So, I was looking for some resources or sites that allow you to pick up from where you left and learn the grammar further instead of starting from the base .

gm81kxdx	Hello! I hope this is an appropriate post for this sub. I'm self-learning French from the US while by quarantine. I took it in high school, but we all know how good American foreign language education is, lol! My level is probably a soft A2, but I struggle ⠀with verbal expression and don't have the grammatical concepts down. What I've been doing is texting with native speakers I met on a conversation exchange website. I've been heavily using the dictionary during these exchanges, but it seems to be really helping my vocabulary and knowledge. Occasionally I send recorded audio messages in heavily accented French, but I don't feel like I could actually have a coherent conversation yet about anything beyond basic stuff. I've also been watching EasyFrench on YouTube and occasionally perusing Netflix for easy-to-understand series, which I watch in French with French subtitles, and I write in a journal in French every day. I supplement with Duolingo, although I'm finding it somewhat too simple. I'd like to find a resource with some vocab I could study and with explanations for the grammatical concepts. So, a good A2-level textbook or website would be ideal. It doesn't have to be free, but that would be a bonus. I'm noticing patterns when talking to native speakers, but I want to ensure I'm actually understanding the concepts as well. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, any critique on my self-learning techniques would be welcome and wonderful.

h9fsmxq	My ways of learning French include exploring grammar, articles about subjects that interest me on French Wikipedia etc., online newspapers, song lyrics, listening to radio, adding common phrases (like "afin de") to a text document, playing around with Google Translate and various dictionaries (Wordreference, Wiktionary) and similar tools (Reverso Context) as well as practicing memorizing the words for numbers, days, months and so on.   However, I'm very interested in music, and it recently hit me that I'd really like to start reading French music reviews. I tried googling "music reviews french", but the search results didn't seem very relevant. Do any of you know where I should look? I don't really care who the reviews are written by, as long as they are written in French. It would be a bonus if the authors are passionate/knowledgeable about their subject matter.   Something like allmusic.com, metal-archives.com or sputnikmusic.com in French would be very good!  Update: After submitting my post here, I found r/AskFrance, so I made a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskFrance/comments/sgd5e4/where_can_i_find_french_music_reviews/) about music reviews there too.

cjjm6qjl	So this is a bit of a rant, but as per the title, after studying incredibly hard for a year, I have achieved B2 and passed the Delf in November. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that learning from B2 onwards will be more organic, like listening to original french resources in radiofrance or tv5 monde, reading real novels etc., not necessarily using the C1-C2 coursebooks.    And yet, I put on the interviews with french candidates for presidency listed on radiofrance, and hardly understand what is being said half of the time. I pick up a book from 'Hercules Poirot' series, and have to identify half the phrases by context. I put on dix pour cent on Netflix, and same story happens. Obviously, understanding half is better than none, but it still annoys me.   Honestly, I have been told that going from 0 to B2 is easier than going from B2 to C1, but damn is it hard. It was my goal to be comfortable communicating and writing in french in a professional environment, but it seems to me that any less than C1 won't cut it. And that, I now think, is going to take another year.   P.S. I know a lot of people are generally interested in Delf stories, but there really was no magical recipe for it. I put in ca. 700 learning hours distributed among all tested skills, of which 100 were individual tutoring, and passed the exam with 70% overall mark.	1643575351.0	sgiema	/r/French/comments/sgiema/after_passing_delf_b2_in_a_year_i_now_feel/	After passing Delf B2 in a year, I now feel discouraged

3fgxfwit	Saluut les gars!   Je vais tenter de réussir le DALF C2 ce vendredi. J'apprends le français depuis environ 6 ans et j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir passer 5 mois à Paris au total. J'ai travaillé en tant que vendeur SNCF ce qui m'a poussé à améliorer mon expression orale.   J'ai déjà fait le DALF C1 il y a presque 3 ans (c'était avant d'avoir décroché le job d'été à la SNCF) et j'ai eu 93/100. En plus de ça j'ai déjà réussi le C2 en allemand donc j'ai un peu d'expérience avec les épreuves de langues étrangères à ce niveau-là. Malgré tout cela je me sens un tout petit peu (lisez beaucoup) stressé et je me demande s'il y a des gens ici qui ont déjà passé cette épreuve qui seraient en mesure de me donner des conseils.   J'ai notamment un peu peur de la production écrite parce que je ne sais pas si j'aurai assez de choses à dire étant donné qu'il faut écrire 700 mots. Est-ce que vous avez des idées sur comment écrire 700 mots sur un sujet qui ne m'intéresse pas? Je crains de tomber sur une problématique qui concerne l'art ou une problématique bidon à mon sens et je me vois en difficulté à m'étaler sur le sujet.   J'ai acheté le cours DALF C2 sur français avec Pierre et je connais le format de l'examen. Je révise également le livre de grammaire niveau perfectionnement (par CLÉ) et j'essaie d'élargir mon vocabulaire en lisant des articles ou en regardant des documentaires quasiment tous les jours. J'ai aussi le livre de vocabulaire pour les niveaux C1 - C2.   Quelles seraient les activités complémentaires à faire selon vous?  Est-ce qu'il y a des conseils que vous auriez aimé recevoir quelques jours avant la passation de l'épreuve?

There's textbook French and there's spoken french where words are joined or glossed over and I feel I have no real way of grasping at what's being said or how to construct sentences In a way that doesn't sound like a textbook.

dy0bsq36	I'm currently sitting between A2 and B1.  I'm really keen on doing some exchange programs in France but since its undergrad most programs are solely in French. They require minimum B2.  I need some advice on how to do it to give me some confidence, because right now I struggle to believe that I can learn french to a level where I could study engineering in french, without living in a francophone country.  I have at least a year+ before I can even apply to these programs so I have time, but I just don't know how to best utilise it.  To get where I am now i've just been watching french youtube videos and practicing once a week for 30 mins speaking with my language exchange partner.  I don't feel this is enough alone to get me to a level where I can study in french at university. I've looked at taking  classes at Alliance Française but they go at an extremely slow pace, I'm considering getting a private tutor instead.

That will help you a long way in your study because a lot of grammar rules are working with thoses (y/en, pronoms relatifs, etc...). Maybe do a little notebook with verbs + prep as soon as you meet a new one.

I sweat I know of other contexts in french that have the same pattern although I can't remember any atm, so any other examples you guys can think of would be greatly apprecaited to get m'y head round this.

I should also mention that if it matters it's a Mauritian fable, so that might be why it's a bit confusing?

All of the entomological "work" I do is in English however, as well as all of the knowledge/jargon I've accumulated on the subject in my head. I was just in another thread about locusts and was thinking about the biblical plague and couldn't remember what they were called in the Bible. So I went to look that up and, from there, learned a few surprising things.   As a preface: most people don't know what a cricket is, what a grasshopper is, what locusts are, or what the hell a katydid even is. The same confusion/amalgamation exists in French but with different words. There are important morphological distinctions between those.   Ce qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est que je pensais (à tort, bien que de bon droit) que le mot anglais "cricket" correspondait au français "criquet". Ben en fait, non. Pareil pour "grasshopper", qui ne correspond pas à "sauterelle" contrairement à ce qu'il serait légitime de penser.  Properly, a French "sauterelle" is an English "katydid" and refers to the [Tettigoniidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae), and a French "criquet" is an English "grasshopper". You'd think something that "hops" in English is something that "saute" in French. And they do hop and sautent, of course... but that's not how vocabulary works. Meanwhile, an English "cricket" usually refers to what we call a "grillon" in French. Some types of crickets like the cave cricket or camel cricket (the [Rhaphidophoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae)) have a French equivalent (grillon des cavernes ou sauterelle cavernicole), while others such as the Jerusalem cricket (the [Stenopelmatidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenopelmatidae)) don't (makes sense since they're not found anywhere where French is spoken). The true crickets ([Gryllidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllidae)) are just referred to as "grillons".  I also learned a totally new word, "[sauteriau](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauteriau)", which is used to refer to certain grasshoppers that aren't locusts (FYI all [locusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust) are grasshoppers but not all grasshoppers are locusts).  Et puis enfin, il y a le mot "[courtilière](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpa_gryllotalpa)" dont j'avais oublié l'existence. Je l'ai reconnu tout de suite mais me suis aussitôt rendu compte qu'en fait, je n'avais jamais vraiment su de quoi il s'agit. J'ai donc appris qu'il s'agit en anglais du "mole cricket" que je connais bien ([Gryllotalpidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpidae)). Les jardiniers parmi vous auront raison de dire que je ne devais pas beaucoup jardiner lorsque j'habitais dans un lieu francophone, sinon je l'aurais su. Mais maintenant, je m'en souviendrai !  It all gets a little more complicated by than that, because in both languages, these common names can overlap different insects, and those overlaps don't necessarily match up between English and French. These minutiae will be of little interest to most of you as they're largely academic, and you'll probably keep calling these insects by their more vernacular and ambiguous names, but I thought I'd share anyway because it was fun for me to learn this today. :)  FR3 aurait pu en faire un épisode de "C'est pas sorcier" dans le temps !  P.S. it turns out the translation of "locust" is "locuste" in French. That's to be expected, since the word entered the English language from French.   P.P.S. based on what I learned today, the French Bible incorrectly refers to "locusts" as "sauterelles" 😉 P.P.P.S. j'espère que les non-francophones apprenant le français qui liront ceci apprécieront que j'aie un peu alterné entre l'anglais et le français, histoire de faire travailler un peu les neurones.	1643754370.0	si7jld	/r/French/comments/si7jld/a_story_about_the_names_of_certain_insects_in/	A story about the names of certain insects in French and English, and how there's always something new and interesting to learn

C'est un peu bizarre, parce qu'on a appris que les suppositions prennent toujours le subjonctif (par ex. supposer).

4n4k0	Bonjour! Je suis désolé pour écrire en anglais mais J'ai le trouver très difficile expliquer quoi je disant en français.  At what point do you start getting used to the subject pronouns coming before verbs? That always trips me up. Just more and more exposure needed to get better with it? For example, je le mange. In my head, I currently think "ok, I eat and then the le makes it I eat it" but doing that really trips me up when listening and then missing pronouns. I'm guessing at some point I just get used to it better? Thanks!	1643344986.0	seid5i	/r/French/comments/seid5i/getting_used_to_pronoun_order/	Getting Used to Pronoun Order

h9fsmxq	I'm trying to get a better grasp of the nuances when it comes to those phrases.   Would it be accurate to translate "J'aime la façon dont vous vivez" as "I like the way (in which) you live" and "J'aime ta façon de vivre" as "I like your way of living"? Yes, both have the same meaning, as far as I can tell, but there are nuances as far as the language goes.  Then there is "Je l'aime beaucoup"...

gm81kxdx	Hello! I hope this is an appropriate post for this sub. I'm self-learning French from the US while by quarantine. I took it in high school, but we all know how good American foreign language education is, lol! My level is probably a soft A2, but I struggle ⠀with verbal expression and don't have the grammatical concepts down. What I've been doing is texting with native speakers I met on a conversation exchange website. I've been heavily using the dictionary during these exchanges, but it seems to be really helping my vocabulary and knowledge. Occasionally I send recorded audio messages in heavily accented French, but I don't feel like I could actually have a coherent conversation yet about anything beyond basic stuff. I've also been watching EasyFrench on YouTube and occasionally perusing Netflix for easy-to-understand series, which I watch in French with French subtitles, and I write in a journal in French every day. I supplement with Duolingo, although I'm finding it somewhat too simple. I'd like to find a resource with some vocab I could study and with explanations for the grammatical concepts. So, a good A2-level textbook or website would be ideal. It doesn't have to be free, but that would be a bonus. I'm noticing patterns when talking to native speakers, but I want to ensure I'm actually understanding the concepts as well. Does anyone have any suggestions? Also, any critique on my self-learning techniques would be welcome and wonderful.

h9fsmxq	My ways of learning French include exploring grammar, articles about subjects that interest me on French Wikipedia etc., online newspapers, song lyrics, listening to radio, adding common phrases (like "afin de") to a text document, playing around with Google Translate and various dictionaries (Wordreference, Wiktionary) and similar tools (Reverso Context) as well as practicing memorizing the words for numbers, days, months and so on.   However, I'm very interested in music, and it recently hit me that I'd really like to start reading French music reviews. I tried googling "music reviews french", but the search results didn't seem very relevant. Do any of you know where I should look? I don't really care who the reviews are written by, as long as they are written in French. It would be a bonus if the authors are passionate/knowledgeable about their subject matter.   Something like allmusic.com, metal-archives.com or sputnikmusic.com in French would be very good!  Update: After submitting my post here, I found r/AskFrance, so I made a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskFrance/comments/sgd5e4/where_can_i_find_french_music_reviews/) about music reviews there too.

cjjm6qjl	So this is a bit of a rant, but as per the title, after studying incredibly hard for a year, I have achieved B2 and passed the Delf in November. I don't know why, but it seemed to me that learning from B2 onwards will be more organic, like listening to original french resources in radiofrance or tv5 monde, reading real novels etc., not necessarily using the C1-C2 coursebooks.    And yet, I put on the interviews with french candidates for presidency listed on radiofrance, and hardly understand what is being said half of the time. I pick up a book from 'Hercules Poirot' series, and have to identify half the phrases by context. I put on dix pour cent on Netflix, and same story happens. Obviously, understanding half is better than none, but it still annoys me.   Honestly, I have been told that going from 0 to B2 is easier than going from B2 to C1, but damn is it hard. It was my goal to be comfortable communicating and writing in french in a professional environment, but it seems to me that any less than C1 won't cut it. And that, I now think, is going to take another year.   P.S. I know a lot of people are generally interested in Delf stories, but there really was no magical recipe for it. I put in ca. 700 learning hours distributed among all tested skills, of which 100 were individual tutoring, and passed the exam with 70% overall mark.	1643575351.0	sgiema	/r/French/comments/sgiema/after_passing_delf_b2_in_a_year_i_now_feel/	After passing Delf B2 in a year, I now feel discouraged

3fgxfwit	Saluut les gars!   Je vais tenter de réussir le DALF C2 ce vendredi. J'apprends le français depuis environ 6 ans et j'ai eu la chance de pouvoir passer 5 mois à Paris au total. J'ai travaillé en tant que vendeur SNCF ce qui m'a poussé à améliorer mon expression orale.   J'ai déjà fait le DALF C1 il y a presque 3 ans (c'était avant d'avoir décroché le job d'été à la SNCF) et j'ai eu 93/100. En plus de ça j'ai déjà réussi le C2 en allemand donc j'ai un peu d'expérience avec les épreuves de langues étrangères à ce niveau-là. Malgré tout cela je me sens un tout petit peu (lisez beaucoup) stressé et je me demande s'il y a des gens ici qui ont déjà passé cette épreuve qui seraient en mesure de me donner des conseils.   J'ai notamment un peu peur de la production écrite parce que je ne sais pas si j'aurai assez de choses à dire étant donné qu'il faut écrire 700 mots. Est-ce que vous avez des idées sur comment écrire 700 mots sur un sujet qui ne m'intéresse pas? Je crains de tomber sur une problématique qui concerne l'art ou une problématique bidon à mon sens et je me vois en difficulté à m'étaler sur le sujet.   J'ai acheté le cours DALF C2 sur français avec Pierre et je connais le format de l'examen. Je révise également le livre de grammaire niveau perfectionnement (par CLÉ) et j'essaie d'élargir mon vocabulaire en lisant des articles ou en regardant des documentaires quasiment tous les jours. J'ai aussi le livre de vocabulaire pour les niveaux C1 - C2.   Quelles seraient les activités complémentaires à faire selon vous?  Est-ce qu'il y a des conseils que vous auriez aimé recevoir quelques jours avant la passation de l'épreuve?

"Que les choses ont change, que les fleurs ont fane"  GT translates the above to: "that the things have changed, that the flowers have faded"  Is it more accurate to interpret it as: "things have changed, the flowers have faded"?

dy0bsq36	I'm currently sitting between A2 and B1.  I'm really keen on doing some exchange programs in France but since its undergrad most programs are solely in French. They require minimum B2.  I need some advice on how to do it to give me some confidence, because right now I struggle to believe that I can learn french to a level where I could study engineering in french, without living in a francophone country.  I have at least a year+ before I can even apply to these programs so I have time, but I just don't know how to best utilise it.

26tp4ho9	Even if you are beginner, lets say A2, try to learn as much as you can your prepositionnal verbs : which one goes with à and de (sometimes both). That will help you a long way in your study because a lot of grammar rules are working with thoses (y/en, pronoms relatifs, etc...). Maybe do a little notebook with verbs + prep as soon as you meet a new one.    For those of you that are advanced level, let me know if you did learn them, if it help you or held you back not to know them.

9qbzffa5	Boujour mec, just been listening to some music today and I'm a little confused by the lyrics. The line is at the start is «Moi je suis né, pour n'être avec toi» and in my mind I first thought that read as «I was born, so not to be with you» but hearing the rest of the song and looking at deepl translation it actually is «I was born, so to be only with you» and I'm just wondering if I'm missing something with how I've translated it or is there a rule like other words where the négative also means thé positive. I sweat I know of other contexts in french that have the same pattern although I can't remember any atm, so any other examples you guys can think of would be greatly apprecaited to get m'y head round this.

a90mkexd	I'm in my fifth year of learning French and am supposed to translate this French story. I understand most of the words just fine, but when they're put together they make no sense. I've checked translations as well and I'm wondering if maybe it has to do with colloquialisms. Does this make sense to anyone? I should also mention that if it matters it's a Mauritian fable, so that might be why it's a bit confusing? Here's the ending passage (from what I've gathered at first, it's about a guy who really likes eggs and has big pockets to put them in):  Il continue quelques pas et poutte ! Un deuxième œuf tombe. Il regarde les filles qui se regardent et là aussi silence !  Quelques pas encore en avant et poutte ! Un troisième œuf tombe. Il s’arrête et dit aux filles :    \- Est-ce que chez vous aussi les garçons pondent des œufs ?    \- Non répondent-elles ici ce sont les poules qui pondent des œufs.    \- Comme les hommes sont différents, dit le garçon, voyez-vous chez nous ce sont les garçons qui pondent surtout quand ils sont entourés par des filles.

It’s weird; I’m great at understanding native speakers when they talk to me or when I read their words but for some reason I always feel like I butcher the grammar of the language when I try to express thoughts in my own words and because of this I think native speakers have little patience with me and switch to English.  I can’t really blame them for that. But nonetheless, if I do happen to speak to someone who hears me out and doesn’t interrupt me and switch to English after a minute, I’d like to express my gratitude.	1643723824.0	shvjo9	/r/French/comments/shvjo9/how_can_i_say_thank_you_for_listening_to_me_as_in/	How can I say « thank you for listening to me » as in, thank you for listening to me try to speak your language?

hy7xb	tl;pl: AJA que le mot anglais "cricket" (l'insecte) ne se traduit pas par "criquet" en français, et que "grasshopper" ne signifie pas "sauterelle" comme je l'ai cru depuis des décennies.  For context, I'm a native French speaker and amateur entomologist. All of the entomological "work" I do is in English however, as well as all of the knowledge/jargon I've accumulated on the subject in my head. I was just in another thread about locusts and was thinking about the biblical plague and couldn't remember what they were called in the Bible. So I went to look that up and, from there, learned a few surprising things.   As a preface: most people don't know what a cricket is, what a grasshopper is, what locusts are, or what the hell a katydid even is. The same confusion/amalgamation exists in French but with different words. There are important morphological distinctions between those.   Ce qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est que je pensais (à tort, bien que de bon droit) que le mot anglais "cricket" correspondait au français "criquet". Ben en fait, non. Pareil pour "grasshopper", qui ne correspond pas à "sauterelle" contrairement à ce qu'il serait légitime de penser.  Properly, a French "sauterelle" is an English "katydid" and refers to the [Tettigoniidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae), and a French "criquet" is an English "grasshopper". You'd think something that "hops" in English is something that "saute" in French. And they do hop and sautent, of course... but that's not how vocabulary works. Meanwhile, an English "cricket" usually refers to what we call a "grillon" in French. Some types of crickets like the cave cricket or camel cricket (the [Rhaphidophoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae)) have a French equivalent (grillon des cavernes ou sauterelle cavernicole), while others such as the Jerusalem cricket (the [Stenopelmatidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenopelmatidae)) don't (makes sense since they're not found anywhere where French is spoken). The true crickets ([Gryllidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllidae)) are just referred to as "grillons".  I also learned a totally new word, "[sauteriau](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauteriau)", which is used to refer to certain grasshoppers that aren't locusts (FYI all [locusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust) are grasshoppers but not all grasshoppers are locusts).  Et puis enfin, il y a le mot "[courtilière](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpa_gryllotalpa)" dont j'avais oublié l'existence. Je l'ai reconnu tout de suite mais me suis aussitôt rendu compte qu'en fait, je n'avais jamais vraiment su de quoi il s'agit. J'ai donc appris qu'il s'agit en anglais du "mole cricket" que je connais bien ([Gryllotalpidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpidae)). Les jardiniers parmi vous auront raison de dire que je ne devais pas beaucoup jardiner lorsque j'habitais dans un lieu francophone, sinon je l'aurais su. Mais maintenant, je m'en souviendrai !  It all gets a little more complicated by than that, because in both languages, these common names can overlap different insects, and those overlaps don't necessarily match up between English and French. These minutiae will be of little interest to most of you as they're largely academic, and you'll probably keep calling these insects by their more vernacular and ambiguous names, but I thought I'd share anyway because it was fun for me to learn this today. :)  FR3 aurait pu en faire un épisode de "C'est pas sorcier" dans le temps !  P.S. it turns out the translation of "locust" is "locuste" in French. That's to be expected, since the word entered the English language from French.   P.P.S. based on what I learned today, the French Bible incorrectly refers to "locusts" as "sauterelles" 😉 P.P.P.S. j'espère que les non-francophones apprenant le français qui liront ceci apprécieront que j'aie un peu alterné entre l'anglais et le français, histoire de faire travailler un peu les neurones.	1643754370.0	si7jld	/r/French/comments/si7jld/a_story_about_the_names_of_certain_insects_in/	A story about the names of certain insects in French and English, and how there's always something new and interesting to learn

I’m laughing because I identify as non-binary and this is just such a funny thing to struggle with. My teacher said it will get easier, I just have to memorize them.

4xtcgi2q	Hello, I'll have to take an exam on French next year spring because I will apply for a PhD program in philosophy in Japan and they ask for a second foreign language test.  The problem is, I'm Chinese and I speak only Chinese, English, and Japanese. And those languages do not count as a "second foreign language“ in the application. So, I'll have to take the French exam offered by the university. I have no idea how hard would the exam be but at least it seems that the exam will be focused on grammar and reading, in the form of the multiple-choice question.  Another problem is, I will never use French, whether in my daily life or in my academic life (I study Anglo-Saxon philosophy). Neither am I interested in French. All I want is to pass the exam.   So here's my question:  Can I learn the grammar and reading part of French without the speaking, listening and pronunciation part of French? I know that there might be a strong argument against this way of learning because pronunciation may help you to memorize words faster, etc. But I wonder if it would actually be faster and easier to learn the grammar and reading part only?	1643782035.0	sih9qr	/r/French/comments/sih9qr/can_i_learn_the_grammar_and_reading_part_of/	Can I learn the grammar and reading part of French without the speaking part of French?

dzd2j	Here are two vowel sounds that I hear very frequently from English speakers speaking French:  1. Many say "l'amour" the same as "la mort." (Which, take it from me, can be confusing. I once told someone that French was la langue de la mort.)   The words amour, bonjour, pour and so on, don't typically end with the same sound as mort, fort, port, etc.  [Go to a page where you can listen to pour.](https://forvo.com/word/pour/#fr)  [Go to a page where you can listen to port.](https://forvo.com/word/port/#fr)  Many of these words are super common, and getting them a bit better will give you an immediately better accent.  2. Many make diphthongs more often than they should. It's a myth that French (even European French) doesn't have any diphthongs, but it definitely has fewer than English.  A diphthong is combining vowel sounds. For example, when we say "say" in English, we sort of say seh at first, and then quickly blend into ee. We end the word with our mouths making an ee sound, which is different from how we started.  In French, they sort of stop at the eh part. So when you say aller, it doesn't go from eh to ee. It stops at the first vowel sound. So you start it as you'd start with an ay word in English, but then STOP before it changes to the ee. Whether you're making the é or the è, you stop before it becomes a different vowel sound.  I imagine that different regions might do all this differently, so I'm open to correction.  People talk about getting the R right, but I'd worry more about stuff like this, which can actually lead to confusion if you get it wrong.  \[Of course, I could write all this in IPA or whatever, but I thought that maybe writing it out would help people who aren't comfortable with that notation.\]	1643878508.0	sjeg7y	/r/French/comments/sjeg7y/two_pronunciation_tips_especially_for_english/	Two pronunciation tips (especially for English native speakers)

d72jmmuy	I was recently watching a video about French luxury brands and their history, and saw a few phrases/words that I couldn't seem to find translations for that make sense in context:  1) << *Mais il y a un roi qui a fait passer cette passion pour le luxe au niveau supérieur : c'est Louis XIV bien sûr, aka le Roi Soleil. Louis XIV c'était une vraie «fashion victim». Regardez-moi ce style de malade :*   *culotte rouge, rappel de couleur avec les épaulettes et les chaussures la petite moustache de hipster*   *et même pas besoin de porter sa couronne sur la tête tellement il était cool.>>*   In this context, what would <<*rappel de couleur>>* and <<*fashion-victim*\>> translate to? I've seen meanings of <<colour reminder>> for the former, and nothing but the direct English translation for the latter, neither of which fit in very well.  <<*Et comme aux États-Unis les directeurs de ces entreprises sont des multimilliardaires*   *qui passent leur temps à jouer  à qui a la plus grosse*\>>  In this context, what would <<jouer>> translate to? I've seen play, act, perform, still doesn't really fit in well...

8n64tbb8	Hi everyone, I will be moving jobs soon into a French company that uses a lot of outside organizations that conduct trainings for their new employees. The company, while international, still heavily leans towards French. I’m looking for suggestions on how I can better prepare and still keep growing this specific area of French.   The job will be biology/biotech related and my hiring manager know that my professional vocabulary and French is sufficient for the job but that I might struggle with very particular vocabulary in our field (ex: specific machines that I never learned how to use in English). However I still want to prepare as much as possible to prime myself for these trainings/shadowing interactions I’ll be going through for the first 3-6 months of starting.   Here’s my current strategy, feel free to offer suggestions or experiences that helped you in a similar situation: • watching YT videos of people explaining protocols/how to use specific machines in FR (usually big biotech companies will have educational videos, or other education YT videos will upload them) and note down specific vocab + example sentences on flash cards. Example of a YouTube search would be “comment utiliser un autoclave”   • read articles about the topics as well to find more example sentences as well as related vocab  • practice aloud forming specific questions such as “comment vous savez quand le cycle va finir?” Or “si j’ai un problème avec l’écran de le motor de la centrifuge, comment je le régler ? "  • practice again sentences around the realm of "I’m sorry, i can speak and understand French but I might ask you to repeat yourself or speak slower if I don’t understand something clearly. " because I get really really anxious and sometimes forget to explain this to others if I’m having a very technical conversation   Any other suggestions, resources, or encouragement are appreciated!

hy7xb	tl;pl: AJA que le mot anglais "cricket" (l'insecte) ne se traduit pas par "criquet" en français, et que "grasshopper" ne signifie pas "sauterelle" comme je l'ai cru depuis des décennies.  For context, I'm a native French speaker and amateur entomologist. All of the entomological "work" I do is in English however, as well as all of the knowledge/jargon I've accumulated on the subject in my head. I was just in another thread about locusts and was thinking about the biblical plague and couldn't remember what they were called in the Bible. So I went to look that up and, from there, learned a few surprising things.   As a preface: most people don't know what a cricket is, what a grasshopper is, what locusts are, or what the hell a katydid even is. The same confusion/amalgamation exists in French but with different words. There are important morphological distinctions between those.   Ce qui m'a le plus surpris, c'est que je pensais (à tort, bien que de bon droit) que le mot anglais "cricket" correspondait au français "criquet". Ben en fait, non. Pareil pour "grasshopper", qui ne correspond pas à "sauterelle" contrairement à ce qu'il serait légitime de penser.  Properly, a French "sauterelle" is an English "katydid" and refers to the [Tettigoniidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tettigoniidae), and a French "criquet" is an English "grasshopper". You'd think something that "hops" in English is something that "saute" in French. And they do hop and sautent, of course... but that's not how vocabulary works. Meanwhile, an English "cricket" usually refers to what we call a "grillon" in French. Some types of crickets like the cave cricket or camel cricket (the [Rhaphidophoridae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhaphidophoridae)) have a French equivalent (grillon des cavernes ou sauterelle cavernicole), while others such as the Jerusalem cricket (the [Stenopelmatidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenopelmatidae)) don't (makes sense since they're not found anywhere where French is spoken). The true crickets ([Gryllidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllidae)) are just referred to as "grillons".  I also learned a totally new word, "[sauteriau](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauteriau)", which is used to refer to certain grasshoppers that aren't locusts (FYI all [locusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locust) are grasshoppers but not all grasshoppers are locusts).  Et puis enfin, il y a le mot "[courtilière](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpa_gryllotalpa)" dont j'avais oublié l'existence. Je l'ai reconnu tout de suite mais me suis aussitôt rendu compte qu'en fait, je n'avais jamais vraiment su de quoi il s'agit. J'ai donc appris qu'il s'agit en anglais du "mole cricket" que je connais bien ([Gryllotalpidae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryllotalpidae)). Les jardiniers parmi vous auront raison de dire que je ne devais pas beaucoup jardiner lorsque j'habitais dans un lieu francophone, sinon je l'aurais su. Mais maintenant, je m'en souviendrai !  It all gets a little more complicated by than that, because in both languages, these common names can overlap different insects, and those overlaps don't necessarily match up between English and French. These minutiae will be of little interest to most of you as they're largely academic, and you'll probably keep calling these insects by their more vernacular and ambiguous names, but I thought I'd share anyway because it was fun for me to learn this today. :)  FR3 aurait pu en faire un épisode de "C'est pas sorcier" dans le temps !  P.S. it turns out the translation of "locust" is "locuste" in French. That's to be expected, since the word entered the English language from French.   P.P.S. based on what I learned today, the French Bible incorrectly refers to "locusts" as "sauterelles" 😉 P.P.P.S. j'espère que les non-francophones apprenant le français qui liront ceci apprécieront que j'aie un peu alterné entre l'anglais et le français, histoire de faire travailler un peu les neurones.	1643754370.0	si7jld	/r/French/comments/si7jld/a_story_about_the_names_of_certain_insects_in/	A story about the names of certain insects in French and English, and how there's always something new and interesting to learn

4rpyf6a9	I’m about one week into my French 101 college course and I’m really struggling! I cannot seem to understand gendered nouns and I don’t know why or how they are gendered. I’m currently making flash cards with different colors (blue and pink) to indicate the gender, but oh my goodness, I am lost. Any advice? Resources? I’m laughing because I identify as non-binary and this is just such a funny thing to struggle with. My teacher said it will get easier, I just have to memorize them. She said it’s hard to learn because we don’t use gendered words in English. I really want to do well and I know that once it “clicks” it’ll make sense. I’m so happy I found this group.

4xtcgi2q	Hello, I'll have to take an exam on French next year spring because I will apply for a PhD program in philosophy in Japan and they ask for a second foreign language test.  The problem is, I'm Chinese and I speak only Chinese, English, and Japanese. And those languages do not count as a "second foreign language“ in the application. So, I'll have to take the French exam offered by the university. I have no idea how hard would the exam be but at least it seems that the exam will be focused on grammar and reading, in the form of the multiple-choice question.  Another problem is, I will never use French, whether in my daily life or in my academic life (I study Anglo-Saxon philosophy). Neither am I interested in French. All I want is to pass the exam.   So here's my question:  Can I learn the grammar and reading part of French without the speaking, listening and pronunciation part of French? I know that there might be a strong argument against this way of learning because pronunciation may help you to memorize words faster, etc. But I wonder if it would actually be faster and easier to learn the grammar and reading part only?	1643782035.0	sih9qr	/r/French/comments/sih9qr/can_i_learn_the_grammar_and_reading_part_of/	Can I learn the grammar and reading part of French without the speaking part of French?

dzd2j	Here are two vowel sounds that I hear very frequently from English speakers speaking French:  1. Many say "l'amour" the same as "la mort." (Which, take it from me, can be confusing. I once told someone that French was la langue de la mort.)   The words amour, bonjour, pour and so on, don't typically end with the same sound as mort, fort, port, etc.  [Go to a page where you can listen to pour.](https://forvo.com/word/pour/#fr)  [Go to a page where you can listen to port.](https://forvo.com/word/port/#fr)  Many of these words are super common, and getting them a bit better will give you an immediately better accent.  2. Many make diphthongs more often than they should. It's a myth that French (even European French) doesn't have any diphthongs, but it definitely has fewer than English.  A diphthong is combining vowel sounds. For example, when we say "say" in English, we sort of say seh at first, and then quickly blend into ee. We end the word with our mouths making an ee sound, which is different from how we started.  In French, they sort of stop at the eh part. So when you say aller, it doesn't go from eh to ee. It stops at the first vowel sound. So you start it as you'd start with an ay word in English, but then STOP before it changes to the ee. Whether you're making the é or the è, you stop before it becomes a different vowel sound.  I imagine that different regions might do all this differently, so I'm open to correction.  People talk about getting the R right, but I'd worry more about stuff like this, which can actually lead to confusion if you get it wrong.  \[Of course, I could write all this in IPA or whatever, but I thought that maybe writing it out would help people who aren't comfortable with that notation.\]	1643878508.0	sjeg7y	/r/French/comments/sjeg7y/two_pronunciation_tips_especially_for_english/	Two pronunciation tips (especially for English native speakers)

For example:  > Nobody wants to do it. >  > ~~Personne ne veulent le faire.~~ >  > Personne ne **veut** le faire.  >   &nbsp;  > Everybody wants to do it >  > ~~Tout le monde veulent le faire.~~ >  > Tout le monde **veut** le faire. >   &nbsp;  Additionally, "une minorité" is also 3rd person singular:  > ~~Une minorité des française n'aiment pas ça.~~ >  > Une minorité des français **n'aime** pas ça.  &nbsp;  However, "la plupart" and "la majorité" and are plural:  > La plupart des française **n'aiment** pas ça. >  > La majorité des français ne **font** jamais ça. >  &nbsp;  **edit:** Please see the comment by u/Graciously-64 for a very helpful clarification on "la minorité/majorité de"	1643955332.0	sk664s	/r/French/comments/sk664s/quick_tip_personne_and_tout_le_monde_are_treated/	Quick Tip : "personne" and "tout le monde" are treated as 3rd person singular

8n64tbb8	Hi everyone, I will be moving jobs soon into a French company that uses a lot of outside organizations that conduct trainings for their new employees. The company, while international, still heavily leans towards French. I’m looking for suggestions on how I can better prepare and still keep growing this specific area of French.   The job will be biology/biotech related and my hiring manager know that my professional vocabulary and French is sufficient for the job but that I might struggle with very particular vocabulary in our field (ex: specific machines that I never learned how to use in English). However I still want to prepare as much as possible to prime myself for these trainings/shadowing interactions I’ll be going through for the first 3-6 months of starting.   Here’s my current strategy, feel free to offer suggestions or experiences that helped you in a similar situation: • watching YT videos of people explaining protocols/how to use specific machines in FR (usually big biotech companies will have educational videos, or other education YT videos will upload them) and note down specific vocab + example sentences on flash cards. Example of a YouTube search would be “comment utiliser un autoclave”   • read articles about the topics as well to find more example sentences as well as related vocab  • practice aloud forming specific questions such as “comment vous savez quand le cycle va finir?” Or “si j’ai un problème avec l’écran de le motor de la centrifuge, comment je le régler ? "  • practice again sentences around the realm of "I’m sorry, i can speak and understand French but I might ask you to repeat yourself or speak slower if I don’t understand something clearly. " because I get really really anxious and sometimes forget to explain this to others if I’m having a very technical conversation   Any other suggestions, resources, or encouragement are appreciated!

But I am currently trying to find a good piece of media to watch to get into it as I tried one movie and it was a bit too confusing to start out, I am quite young so I am not the most intelligent (13) and some good reccomendations to get into this method. I have no experience with any languages other than English as I'm in Australia.  Tips are very appreciated .  I am very sorry for the formatting and even wording if this question as I am extremely tired right now and looking back on this tommorow it'll look like I was drunk. Thanks.

cakth9nf	Someone asked about this a few days ago, which inspired me to write this post.  Here are three online word games you might like:  1. [Wordle](https://wordle.louan.me/) \- the French exact version of the now super famous English Wordle. 2. [Sutom](https://sutom.nocle.fr/) \- the concept is pretty similar to Wordle but the number of letters vary. Sutom is Motus spelt backward. Motus used to be a famous TV show where participants had to guess 10 letter words. The color code is the same as in the TV show. 3. [Mots fléchés](https://www.20minutes.fr/services/mots-fleches) \- Mots fléchés are like crosswords but the definitions are written inside squares. 20 minutes is a free daily newspaper given in subway stations, etc. (*This is more advanced*)  Enjoy!  Edit : Suggestions of other games given to me in the comment section (thank you!):  4. [Bomb party game](https://jklm.fun/?fromOldGames)  5.

I figured I would give you guys my selection of french films, as I think some of you could be interested !  - Five : A great fun movie about a group of 5 friends getting into some deep trouble. - 99 Francs : Jean Dujardin at his best/weird. Awesome weird psychedelic movie about la société de consommation. - OSS 117 (1&2) : Jean Dujardin again. Comedy spy movie, very absurdly funny. Probably hard to understand for a non french I guess tho. - Asterix et Obelix Mission Cléopatre : A french comedy classic. Just watch it if you haven’t already !! - Intouchables : Good stuff, you probably already know about it haha - Les petits mouchoirs : Comedy Drama about a group of friends going in vacation. It’s clever, it’s funny, it’s sad. Great stuff. - Grave : Gory/shocking movie about cannibal college students. It’s great hahahaa - BAC Nord : Police movie about a trio of cop in marseille. Came out in 2020, took my breath away ! - Les Choristes : Beautiful movie about a class of boys in a tough boarding school with a new teacher coming in.  Animated films :  - Azur et Asmar : Big coup de ❤️ for me. Best animated film ever. A tale of 2 brothers set in arabic lands filled with fantastic and mythical elements, and a quest to save the djinn fairy. INCROYABLE. - Persepolis : Incredible life story about a girl living in Iran during the war.  That’s it for now ! I’ll update it if I think of anything else.

Thought I could get some unbiased opinions from native francophones.  This all stems from this [post from a hockey sub.](https://reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/sklkxb/_/hvllu18/?context=1).   The claims of the commenter are that:  - *N’entends-tu pas le prof ?* is wrong. While I agree that *Entends-tu le prof ?* is also correct, I don’t see an issue with the former. - Familiarity with the person to whom you are speaking means you can drop the subjects of the verbs with the example *N’entends pas le prof ?* - *Allons-y ?* as a question is also used as an example of the last point. I would find it way more natural to say “On y va ?”   I feel like I’m taking crazy pills.
