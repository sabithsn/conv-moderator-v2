dpvaw7o	Hi everyone, I am a grad from computer engineering and have been working for 4 years now in both start ups and corporate in various roles, most recently tech sales. I got inspired by the question I always find here about CS vs CE so I made a tiktok account to answer questions about tech in egypt and how the work life is here and how to prepare for it, my format is basically AMA and I relate the answers to egypt and my experience.

7ucybjle	I’m 20f & i’ve never had a boyfriend. I’ve been told many times that i’m fairly good looking & fun to be around and many showed interest but for some reason they never really do any effort for us to be anything..   لا عمري ارتبطت ولا صاحبت ولا اي حاجة ونفسي اعرف ازاي اصلا اتنين بيتصاحبوا؟ كل اللي حواليا بيصاحبوا ويفركشوا مرتين تلاتة في الشهر وانا لوحدي عمر ما حد فكر يصاحبني. السؤال بقى هل العيب فيا؟   هل انا المفروض اروح اقوله مثلا نرتبط ولا بتقضوها تلميحات ولا اقوله نخرج ولا هي بتيجي ازاي عشان انا فترة المراهقة كلها راحت ومعيشتهاش. يا ريت الولاد يقترحولي كيف اصطاد رجلاً. I’m not trolling I’m genuinely concerned at this point, keep in mind that yes most 20 year olds nowadays already have exes.	1642988284.0	sb9w6y	/r/Egypt/comments/sb9w6y/how_do_you_girls_date_in_egypt/	How do you girls “date” in Egypt?

8151p6d8	Ok, the fact that people are making such a big deal out of this movie to the point that it is being discussed at مجلس النواب is literal proof that we are spiraling way down. Seriously? It's just a fucking movie. Instead of promoting young entrepreneurs or discussing things that actually matter, we're sitting here judging a NON-EGYPTIAN MOVIE, on national fucking television.   The problem will always lie with الامر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر an ideology that will consistently set us back, while the entire world is moving forward. You can have your beliefs about LGBTQ+ or sex, etc etc, its your right, but keep it to yourself. Why take time to judge others when they have done absolutely nothing wrong to you. Thats it, the value of time, a concept that people in general even me sometimes fail to understand. If you spent two minutes of your time cussing out someone on the internet and god-forbid something happens and you die, you will beg to take those two minutes back to say goodbye to your family/friends or whatever it is that you wanted to do.  Learn to be kinder people, we are all humans, yes we have different beliefs, but thats what makes us unique, because we can learn from each other. You like something, do it, if you don't acknowledge, ignore it, and teach your children to do the same. Again, it's your right, but keep it yourself, and if you really feel the need to let your beliefs out, then provide ADVICE, not attack someone else for simply being them.  Edit: for those asking this post is not about the movie, but its called اصحاب ولا اعز (Perfect Strangers)	1643015193.0	sbhxkm	/r/Egypt/comments/sbhxkm/a_small_rant_about_people_in_this_country/	A small rant about people in this country

8m8q3ery	Hey Guys. I think a few of you are confused 🤔 as to what Netflix is.  Netflix isn’t one of your constitutional rights and it’s not a public service.  It’s not القناة الاولى.  What it is, is a private corporation that offers a subscription service to its catalogue of films, some of which it produces.  YOU PAY 💰 💰 💰 NETFLIX MONEY TO CONSUME THEIR CONTENT.  So… I guess… just don’t give them your مية و خمسة و ستين جنية كل شهر if you don’t like what they have to offer?!  This would be like me travelling abroad and visiting a strip club, paying to get in, only to come screaming out that they have naked women in there trying to shove their asses 🍑 in my face.  AND THEN THE NEXT DAY I STILL VISIT THE SAME STRIP CLUB, PAY TO GET IN, ONLY TO COME OUT SCREAMING AGAIN.   Surprised. That. They. Still. Have. Naked. Women. In… THE STRIP CLUB.  I guess what I’m trying to say is…  I know everyone has different opinions on just about everything, that’s FINE.  Your values matter, they really do.  But they only matter to YOU.  I don’t give a f*ck about your values and I don’t expect you to give a f*ck about mine.  The world is a big place and you can’t please everyone. If Netflix tried to make films everyone found agreeable, we would probably end up with a ton of cat 🐈 🐈‍⬛ 🐈 movies — and nothing else.  Feel free to never watch Netflix again.  Personally, I’ll keep enjoying Mona Zaki’s awful acting.	1643042010.0	sbq5ra	/r/Egypt/comments/sbq5ra/netflix_is_not_one_of_your_constitutional_rights/	Netflix Is NOT One Of Your Constitutional “Rights”

h1klkmag	Hi, so it's been roughly 1 year since I landed here and to this day I haven't made any connections mostly due to the language barrier and mindset barriers as well    although I like talking with the gatekeeper next to my house he listens a lot to me and offers advice he's a cool old man, usually I shown him illustrations , maps and writing of my novels since I'm a Sci-Fi fantasy writer   I tend to keep to myself a lot mostly because I'm extremely passionate towards these things, I can go on so many hours of talking on how beautiful the cosmos of the galaxy is and how mysterious the unknown is! It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

2ayng7zo	انت كواحد ليبرالي شايف ان الديمقراطية هل الحل و مافيش خلاص الا بالفلقسة الكاملة لعقيدة الغرب (الليبرالية) و بتطالب الناس تنزل مظاهرات و تحرق كاوتشات و تضرب بعض بالطوب و تخاطر بحياتها عشان القيم دي و الا يكونوا عبيد في نظرك كليبرالي او قوم فرعون لو انت كإخوانجي. انا واحد من ضمن مجموعة ضد الديمقراطية و مش شايفها الطريق للإزدهار و شايف ان البحث عن حكم رشيد و عاقل غير ديمقراطي اهم من الدفاع عن الحقوق السياسية و حق التظاهر و غيرها من الأشياء الغير مفيدة و الغير متوافقة مع ثقافتنا. و اه انا عارف ان غالبية الناس عايشة في ضلال و فاكرة اننا كبشر كلنا ممكن تتبنى نفس العقيدة السياسية و نفس نظام الحكم و دي طبعا كدبة كبيرة فضل يروجلها الليبراليين. الهدف هو الحكم الرشيد اللي مش لازم ابدا يبقى ديمقراطي بل ان الحكم الديمقراطي قد يأتي بما هو عكس ذلك. عشان كدا انا شايف ان منع التظاهر و اخصاء المجال السياسي العام تماما إنجاز جيد للدولة.	1643105250.0	scacaf	/r/Egypt/comments/scacaf/رسالة_لليبرالجية/	رسالة لليبرالجية

9cdiwtzc	I checked TV earlier this morning and every god damn channel is celebrating "The Egyptian Police day" which was 70 years ago. Why's no one mentioning the anniversary of 2011's revolution (the greatest revolution in modern history) which was only 11 years ago??  They're ignoring it like it never happened or like if it was a "bad" memory which they don't want to remember which is *completely* ridiculous.  How's uniting people to revolt aganist injustice and corruption smth bad?

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.      EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I definitely understand that ones experience in Egypt has a direct correlation unfortunately to ones financial and social status, where you live who you know, etc, which fuggin sucks, people should be able to have a good life no matter what.       I feel like I'm gonna have a bad time living there overall, but I still plan on visiting for a week or so to visit family and friends and perhaps maybe even meet some of you?

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.

h1klkmag	Hi, so it's been roughly 1 year since I landed here and to this day I haven't made any connections mostly due to the language barrier and mindset barriers as well    although I like talking with the gatekeeper next to my house he listens a lot to me and offers advice he's a cool old man, usually I shown him illustrations , maps and writing of my novels since I'm a Sci-Fi fantasy writer   I tend to keep to myself a lot mostly because I'm extremely passionate towards these things, I can go on so many hours of talking on how beautiful the cosmos of the galaxy is and how mysterious the unknown is! It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.  What do you think?	1643056644.0	sbvu7i	/r/Egypt/comments/sbvu7i/is_there_like_a_place_where_you_can_find/	Is there like a place where you can find like-minded individuals ?

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.   Therefore, we ought to praise their success and ensure that our future is not like theirs.	1643103330.0	sc9w1f	/r/Egypt/comments/sc9w1f/afghanistan/	Afghanistan

They're ignoring it like it never happened or like if it was a "bad" memory which they don't want to remember which is *completely* ridiculous.

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.      EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I definitely understand that ones experience in Egypt has a direct correlation unfortunately to ones financial and social status, where you live who you know, etc, which fuggin sucks, people should be able to have a good life no matter what.       I feel like I'm gonna have a bad time living there overall, but I still plan on visiting for a week or so to visit family and friends and perhaps maybe even meet some of you?

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.

h1klkmag	Hi, so it's been roughly 1 year since I landed here and to this day I haven't made any connections mostly due to the language barrier and mindset barriers as well    although I like talking with the gatekeeper next to my house he listens a lot to me and offers advice he's a cool old man, usually I shown him illustrations , maps and writing of my novels since I'm a Sci-Fi fantasy writer   I tend to keep to myself a lot mostly because I'm extremely passionate towards these things, I can go on so many hours of talking on how beautiful the cosmos of the galaxy is and how mysterious the unknown is! It truly is fascinating to to even think about or even imagine.  It would be somewhat cool to find one or two people who are an audience to these things. I will admit it feels lonely a lot being around mostly because its a different society with different values and ideas so to somewhat find common ground with someone here it is challenging.

9rhgu9gj	   It has been five months now since the Taliban took control of Afghanistan.      Now, a quick recapping and assessing their achievements and futuristic plans.   Undoubtedly, we all have noticed massive progress in hard-core scientific disciplines, such as pure and applied mathematics, physics, astronomy, engineering, and biological sciences.   We also have witnessed progress towards women's freedom. I heard some rumors that now women in Afghanistan can run for local government offices and soon be presidential.   Not only that, but also we have seen tremendous accomplishments in almost all aspects that touch our daily life, such as 5G tech, quantum computing, metaverse, electric cars, space, quantum physics, software developments, ethics, philosophy, psychology, and everything they promised to do.   Afghanistan is not the only one, but we also have seen equal progress from Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Sudan, Somalia, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, Turkey, Pakistan, Mali, Yemen, Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.   Therefore, we ought to praise their success and ensure that our future is not like theirs.	1643103330.0	sc9w1f	/r/Egypt/comments/sc9w1f/afghanistan/	Afghanistan

hjojb1et	I am Half Egyptian, I was born in a different country, I've lived here for most of my life, I only ever lived in Egypt for 5 years when I was a kid between the age of 8 and 12, so I haven't really experienced Egypt in the way that most of you have.         I haven't been back to Egypt for a little over 22 years.        I have a few Egyptian friends who do go back from time to time, and a few who continue to live there, (old school friends from back in the day), and Honestly I get mixed messages from Both sides, some say, man Egypt has changed for the better, so many opportunities now, work is abundant, you should really consider going back and explore options,          On the other end of that spectrum, they say, a7a bro, inta itgannint? Terga3 meen???? Stay where you are dude, you're better off, hatirga3 ta3mil eh??          I have these conversations regularly with them and I never find a truly unbiased answer, either side is heavily influenced by their own individual experience and/or by the media.        So my questions are,      What's it really like there now?      Is it worth going back to explore options, either work or start a business of some kind?       Am I screwing my self over if I come back?           Never mind how controlling or corrupt the government may or may not be, I'm asking about life there, about the people and their interactions with one another, family, safety, Education, stuff like that.        And thank you for taking the time to answer, if you do.        P.S: I don't have a higher degree in anything, Just my own work experience, started from the relative bottom up, Customer service job and moved my way up.      EDIT: Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond, I definitely understand that ones experience in Egypt has a direct correlation unfortunately to ones financial and social status, where you live who you know, etc, which fuggin sucks, people should be able to have a good life no matter what.       I feel like I'm gonna have a bad time living there overall, but I still plan on visiting for a week or so to visit family and friends and perhaps maybe even meet some of you?

3ea32oyn	On the 25/1/2011, As soon as we pushed through the march and entered the square, I remember you climbing up on the firetruck, pushed the cop that was shooting water (it really hurts) at us, and pointing it to the cops. I saw them take u down, and vanish; I will never forget you.  I remember marching on the qasr el nile bridge, 2nd row of the march, and the bravest 15 year old girl infront of us in the first row. As soon as we went through the barricade, she fell, My friend and I almost died trying to save the girl from the stompeed, and were successful. As soon as we looked up, cops grabbed her and we got hit, but we pushed through.  I remember the guy that literally saved my life after i fell down and was surrounded by cops with sticks, grabbing my hand as i laid on the floor, pulling me to my feet. I dont know where u went after, but thank you.  Remember Ahmad Harara, Esraa mahfooz, alaa abd elfattah, abo elmagd, ahmed doma, maher, shady, shady, rehab, sally, sanaa.  Ill be drinking one for you.   Remember those who gave their lives to a lost cause. Remember those who still suffer the consequences. Your death have been in vain, we failed you.

hhur186x	Years ago I used to buy from concrete and they were great but they got expensive and my family got poorer (middle class on the edge of being poor)... I mean they jumped from like 300 l.e during sale to a freaking 700-1000 l.e.   Anyways I tried town team and gave it many chances but their pants are easily ripped and the color fades pretty easily.  I just need a good pair of jeans with a fair price because I'm still a college student and I don't want to put much pressure on my family.

h1klkmag	So I was going to work and I had a funny encounter I thought to post about it today for entertainment   I ordered an Uber today and as usual I waited 10 minutes til he came through but he was one street away i brushed it off since locations tend to glitch a couple times, I walked to him and the car was in a questionable  Condition and he was parked in the middle of a puddle so idk what was going through his mind but then again I said fine maybe he's not from Cairo or something maybe idk  When i ushered him to come forth and I got in the car my doubts were confirmed, he had an old Samsung phone that glitches every 5 secs so I didn't give him a hard time at all, because I been there back when in my home place  Later that ride the guy started a conversation and in my mind I was like *Oh fuck not one of these talkative ones* bear in mind I got autism and a terrible experience with some drivers so my hairs on my neck all stood up.  Anyways the dialogue goes like this..  *"Are you from here?"* The driver asked menacingly I didn't wanna give away that I'm Greek despite me looking like a Jesus clone. I had zero time to react  *"Yeah Cairo is my home I just come and go"* I replied  He later on carried the conversation forth, it appeared that my short responses weren't working to kill it off, poor attempt but admirable effort I suppose  *"So where did you live before"* he asked menacingly  *"uh Dubai"* I replied while screaming internally  Jesus fucking christ on a bicycle I keep digging myself a hole but anyways I had to keep the conversation going  *"did you graduate here or there"* he asked  *"I graduated there"* I replied  *"what did you major in?"*  he asked  *"uh game developer"* i replied, my brain hates me  A GAME DEVELOPER ? ARE YOU STUPID? the dude probably thinks I'm a mommy's boy doing a shit major tf man I mean I am Sci-Fi writer for almost 5 years but still I guess a game developer was close enough to that lmaoo Keep in mind my Arabic is very basic so If you tune in enough you'd definitely know I suck at it terribly   luckily the ride came to an end before he could notice that and funnily enough the guy was a young genuine dude maybe he was inappropriate by asking personal questions but then again that's Egypt so I guess it's fine  Usually with people on the spectrum such as myself I tend to lie on these particular exchanges because you never know what might happen plus I don't give out personal information that easily but you know..   one thing it is funny how there's multiple Ubers in Egypt each one of them knows me with a different profession that makes me giggle when I think about it sometimes	1643223002.0	sdd8sc	/r/Egypt/comments/sdd8sc/awkward_uber_exchange_storytime/	Awkward Uber Exchange (Storytime!)

xwbom	Today, the subreddit has reached 150k members. Thank you all for the years of content and the sense of community on the sub, for the laughs and the memes, for the up-to-date news and discussions, for sticking around and watch the subreddit grow.   The subreddit has gone through several revamps since it's making in 2008, all for building a better community for Egyptians to ask questions, check the news or even watch relatable memes, but throughout the changes, a lot of things were just not fully done, either under development or ignored for a while as it wasn't as important, but we've realized that with a larger community, everything is needed, and we're happy to announce some changes that has been done to improve the subreddit even further and make it complete  # The wiki  The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/wiki/index) has been in the making for a while now, trying to enhance it with the user's help and add as much useful information as possible. A new and a revamped travel guide has been added, and it isn't only for foreigners but for you too, from hotels to pubs to places you'd want to visit. We will be adding more as time goes on. What about some common questions? We've made an [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/about/wiki/faq) page to answer the most common questions on the sub, but **here's where you can come in**. We're asking the community to post the most common questions being asked around, so we could add it to the FAQ page (any user who answers the questions and has his answer added in the page will be credited).  # Appearance  Building a community needs something special, and what's more special than the iconic snoo icon. We've also revamped the banner to give it a more special feel to it. The upvote/downvote buttons have also been changed to be aligned with the subreddit's theme (switch to light mode to view it).  # Top 10 posts  The sub has come a long way, especially the last 2 years and 5 of the 10 top posts on the subreddit were only done this year, which shows how much the community has grown and became more active.   1.

7cw1q7qt	Long story short I'm 17, born into a below middle class family, I used to be a straight A student, able to study all day and usually was at the top of my class however since 2 years ago when corona started my family and I have been through a lot of shit which has greatly affected my mental health.  Because of those 2 years I spent not studying, I seem to have lost my ability to concentrate more than 30 minutes, I'm barely able to finish one task a day but since my family isn't rich the only way I can be successful is through academic success. My parents also have a lot of expectations for me.   I can't seem to study anymore and my grades are fumbling hard, can't even find the motivation to get out of bed or even eat due to all of that my relationship with my parents is horrible, they don't seem to care about me and as much as they care about my grades.   The education system is also disgustingly out of order nowadays so I have no idea what to expect for my tests meaning I don't even know how to prepare myself.  I don't know what to do so any advice will be greatly appreciated.	1643276311.0	sduncr	/r/Egypt/comments/sduncr/how_do_i_survive_thanwia_3ama/	How do I survive thanwia 3ama ?
13vbod	I'm putting this here as a comparison to that Russian tourist guy who went to a "rotten neighborhood" in Egypt and discovered that people didn't treat him like a king or something.  So this video of a Chinese lady in Egypt who bought tea, and the guy didn't take money from her, so she went and bought some sweets and tried to gave it to him, and he refused, so she distributed the sweets to the people in the street, and these people invited her to eat breakfast with them.  She is saying that before she came to Egypt, everyone was telling her that Egypt is full of theives, but she saw that there are good people.  I couldn't find the original video or her channel on tiktok, so this twitter post is my only source.  https://twitter.com/jazzmine92_/status/1486009611161415690?t=qPF6DYla2AdWYSkRofBEcg	1643277201.0	sduus8	/r/Egypt/comments/sduus8/chinese_lady_in_egypt/	Chinese lady in Egypt

Hands them to the bigger officer - goes through my phone - looks into Telegram, browser history, (gallery?) I’m not sure - he found nothing, obviously, but I gathered it’s got more to do with national security issues (?), I totally accept that Egypt’s being Egypt.   Then he takes a picture of my ID on the phone and asks for my phone number - this felt kinda weird to me.   Is this really NORMAL?   I feel slightly violated and feel like changing my number - but I wouldn’t want THAT turning into another pointless investigation if I’m ever stopped again - since personal privacy seemingly isn’t even on the bottom of the priory list here.	1643389126.0	sev93c	/r/Egypt/comments/sev93c/mobile_phone_inspection/	Mobile phone inspection?

9rhgu9gj	Does anyone here know Nassim Nicholas Taleb? If you do? Have you read or watched any of his work?   I have read some of his work, and I am fascinated with the concept of "antifragility." And how antifragility is the opposite of fragility and not robustness, where it gained its strength from disorders, errors, randomness, volatility. And finally, why every society should be antifragile more than robust.   Here is a quote of the concept "Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better. This property is behind everything that has changed with time: evolution, culture, ideas, revolutions, political systems, technological innovation, cultural and economic success, corporate survival, good recipes (say, chicken soup or steak tartare with a drop of cognac), the rise of cities, cultures, legal systems, equatorial forests, bacterial resistance … even our own existence as a species on this planet."     He predicted the 2008 financial rescission, In 2007 when he wrote "The Black Swan."  He also said that Egypt would pay the price just after the revolution because our economy didn't have any volatility, stressor, or any ani fragility. It went through the robust category for 40 years.      If you are familiar with him, Share your thoughts.	1643446826.0	sfe6gw	/r/Egypt/comments/sfe6gw/nassim_nicholas_taleb/	Nassim Nicholas Taleb

h1klkmag	Hey there! While I am a foreigner having fun here. Since I am a Sci-fi Fantasy author I am currently working on a franchise trilogy since 2018 and will publish it around 2023 back home. So I figured while I am here I've been inspired to write something related Egypt.

8ilnce6x	[Cross posted this on Facebook]   Hello everyone   I've been meaning to ask this for a long time all because I know nothing about the Egyptian economy or the real estate market there. What I know is that I've fallen in love with the country and want to be a part of its investment sector as a foreign investor. My goal is to rent it and not live. Perhaps when the time comes I'll change my mind. But for now, I'm looking at a small vintage or modern villa home somewhere outside Cairo, preferably Hurghada, Alex, Sharm, Port Said, or by the coastal lines of the Red Sea. But where do I start? Is there an investor guide to read up on the laws, prices and the whole process? Your advice is greatly appreciated!	1643522370.0	sg2cyi	/r/Egypt/comments/sg2cyi/whats_the_way_to_invest_in_the_egyptian_real/	What's the way to invest in the Egyptian real estate market as a foreigner?

3z29epyr	بصراحه انا بحاول افهم تعامل الدوله مع الدين بشكل عام. الواقعه دي لما الواحد يحطها جنب قانون ازدراء الاديان مثلا و ان ممكن ستاند اب كوميديان يتشد من الدوله عشان حك بس في الدين. الموضوع بيسبب كونفيوچن عجيب.  هي الحاجه الوحيده اللي واضحه بالنسبه لي علي الاقل هو ان تصنيف مصر بانها دوله اسلاميه تصنيف ساذج حبتين.  الدوله المصرية بتعتقل الملحد زي شريف جابر و الملتحي زي احمد سبيع. (مع العلم بان الاولاني خرج و كمل في عمل فيديوهات و التاني لسه معتقل.) و العجيب ايضا ان المتدين و نقيضه بيقولوا انهم بيتم خنقهم من الدوله و ان الدوله بتساند الطرف التاني. يعني هتلاقي الليبرالي العلماني بيتكلم عن التنكيل بيه من طرف الدوله المسلمه اللي حطاله قانون بيضيق علي حريته. و المتدين بردو بيتكلم انه بيتم التنكيل بيه من طرف الدوله الكافره اللي سيباها مليطه.  حد ممكن يضيفلي او يصلحلي وجهه نظري؟  شكرا	1643537730.0	sg67n1	/r/Egypt/comments/sg67n1/ممكن_نتكلم_عن_امام_المسجد_الي_تم_وقفه_و_تحويله/	ممكن نتكلم عن امام المسجد الي تم وقفه و تحويله للتحقيق بسبب تصوير المسجد و هو فاضي وقت مباراة لمنتخب مصر؟

4l28zo	**Is Coptic the language of the Christians?**  &#x200B;  [Actually the word Coptic means \\"Egyptian\\". In the Coptic language to refer to the Coptic Christians is used \\"NiRemnqëmi NQrëstianos\\" which means \\"Christian Coptic\/Egyptians\\". In fact, Muslim Egyptians are also Coptic, they are simply Muslim Coptic, \\"NiRemnqëmi NMouslim\\"](https://preview.redd.it/fcxhgb5k8ue81.jpg?width=165&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2226b0454906b8daf38028b36da5b0f76d158ea4)  The short answer is NO, coptic is the language of all the egyptians wherever they are christian, muslim, atheist, pagan or from every other religion.   In fact, coptic language is more ancient that christianism itself (ancient egyptians start to write the egyptian language with greek letters almost since the time of King Alexander the Great in 332 BC), so it's imposible to be "the language of the christians".   Coptic language in bohairic coptic (the main dialect) is "**ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ**", transliterated as "tiMetRemNQëmi", and it means "the language of the egyptians":     * **ϯ** (ti) means "the". * **ⲙⲉⲧ** (Met) means here "language". * **ⲣⲉⲙ** (Rem) means here "person". * **ⲛ̀** (N) is a genitive letter "from". * **ⲭⲏⲙⲓ** (Qëmi) means "Egypt" (Kemet -> Kemi).  That said, it is true that by a historical accident the Coptic language has been closely linked with the Christians of Egypt in recent centuries.  This has been so because when the Egyptians adopted the Christian religion they continued to use their language (the Egyptian language written with Greek letters), and what they did was translate the bible and religious texts into that language, Coptic.   However, when the Egyptians adopted Islam they began to speak in Arabic, as the Qur'an should not be translated, it should be read and recited in Arabic. In addition, Egypt was ruled by an Arab elite and the people always imitate the elite (before Islam, Egyptians used to be bilingual Greek-Coptic).  &#x200B;  [Diagram showing the use of the various lects of Egyptian by time period and linguistic register.](https://preview.redd.it/yqw2makl8ue81.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=33893870da7c1a7c903c2733499a5b6d3e6531fb)  The Coptic language continued to be spoken during the first centuries of Islam, Egyptians used to be bilingual Arabic-Coptic. But with the passage of time, little by little it was lost, until at the end of the Middle Ages it was only spoken in small and remote villages.  &#x200B;  [Coptic is our language. It's the language that egyptians have spoked since prehistoric times.](https://preview.redd.it/myp5betm8ue81.png?width=320&format=png&auto=webp&s=2555a9fad733d15f623558792128d39773ff5af8)  At the same time, Arabic in Egypt evolved to form the modern Egyptian Arabic dialect, which has many influences from Coptic, and is spoken by the vast majority of the population of Egypt, both by Muslims and Christians.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian\_Arabic#Coptic\_substratum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Arabic#Coptic_substratum)  However, Coptic would not disappear completely, because, although in their day to day they spoke Arabic, the Christians of Egypt (the Egyptians who did not convert to Islam) continued to use the language in their rites. This is because their bible was in the Coptic language, as well as multiple hymns (recitations). It is for this reason that the Coptic language is often associated with Egyptian Christians.  &#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Ls1takorM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6Ls1takorM)  *A hymn sung in Coptic. The Coptic church still uses the ancient Egyptian language in its rites.*     As we have already explained, this does not mean that coptic is a christian language, or a language for christians. Coptic is ancient egyptian written in greek letters, and it existed before the birth of Jesus. Today many pharaonists (both christian and muslim) learn and speak coptic because it is the language of their ancestors, the ancient egyptians.  &#x200B;  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3uZMl4t6g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QQ3uZMl4t6g)  *"I'm muslim and I speak coptic language because I'm Egyptian" - Ahmad Atteya.*	1643554142.0	sgapjd	/r/Egypt/comments/sgapjd/is_coptic_the_language_of_the_christians/	Is Coptic the language of the Christians?

8mab7xlc	I need some career advise please. So my major was Spanish language and literatures, graduated almost 3 years ago and ever since I've been working as a customer support, I needed to get out of my parents house so I took the first thing that came up.  The thing they do not teach you at college is that language alone is never enough, I speak three languages and the opportunities for me are translation: pay is terrible, tourism: unstable, customer service: and it's a temporary job not a career   There is nothing that I LOVE or want to learn, even if I'm gonna start from zero but there's none. Here I am changing jobs for the third time, getting paid almost the same as the first job and not moving forward, there is technically no difference between me and a fresh grad.  So my question is how did you choose a carrer? Do you think seeing a counselor would help? If yes do you recommend a specific place/ person?	1643559947.0	sgcpyr	/r/Egypt/comments/sgcpyr/career_advise/	Career advise

I know Super Jet has a station nearby just outside the airport but I just don't know if by the time I get there, they'll have any bus going to Alex.   Has anyone got a clue about their timings?

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.  What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them. I also have B1 German certificate and I'm currently studying for a C1 certificate; however, I also can't afford to travel to Germany. As for public universities, I think they're gonna be much more stressful than private universities like AASTMT.	1643654336.0	sh8id7	/r/Egypt/comments/sh8id7/im_sick_of_uni_aastmt/	I'm sick of uni (AASTMT)

8v8a6qo	Egypt has a very bleak future ahead of it.   \- it is overpopulated with 100 million people living in a desert country  \- Ethiopia's spectacular economic development will mean that the Ethiopians will divert a large part of the Nile in the future, leaving Egypt with less water in the near future    \- Egypt is ruled by one of the most corrupt regimes in the world, the military regime  \- Egypt's population is impoverished, having a low standard of living comparable to other north African states  \- its economy is pathetic and dependent on American and Arabian aid  And l'm afraid it will only get worse. l look at Egypt and l see a state of hopelessness and social backwardness. Egypt is supposed to be a major power, how did that happen? With Nasser at least there was a sense of hope, l think, of better times to come.

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.  What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them. I also have B1 German certificate and I'm currently studying for a C1 certificate; however, I also can't afford to travel to Germany.

I know the famous places like moez St, old Cairo مجمع الأديان، the museum...etc  So you guys and gals know any hidden places that are worth visiting? also I'd appreciate it if someone told me the order of visiting these places (because I don't live in Cairo so i don't know the shortcuts or means of transportation and we don't wanna spend half of the day on the road)  Thank you all in advance.	1643667727.0	she37y	/r/Egypt/comments/she37y/hidden_places_to_visit_in_cairo/	Hidden places to visit in Cairo

Specifically, I'm looking to profile a craftsperson who works with traditional techniques to create work (like pottery, textiles, jewellery etc.). Basically looking to shoot a video like [this](https://youtu.be/Jd3RJ0OcJ3A) in the Sinai Peninsula.

For this generation I'd like to come back to Xbox as Gamepass provides great value.  One important issue I'd like to enquire about though, is Xbox Live still not working properly in Egypt? I remember struggling with buying games or subscriptions through Xbox Live store, this happens to be a big deal breaker for me if its still a pain in the ass.  Any Egyptian Xbox gamers out there care to chime in? Can you please tell me what's your experience with Xbox Live and Gamepass this generation so far?	1643702956.0	shpsxz	/r/Egypt/comments/shpsxz/question_about_xbox_xbox_live_in_egypt/	Question about Xbox / Xbox Live in Egypt

g4hlzqv8	Hey guys!   I was wondering if anyone can tell me what's the best way to go from the Cairo Airport to Alexandria. I land around, say 7:30pm and by the time I'm outside the airport it will be 8:30pm. I know Super Jet has a station nearby just outside the airport but I just don't know if by the time I get there, they'll have any bus going to Alex.   Has anyone got a clue about their timings? Any help will be highly appreciated!    Also how much should Uber cost from the airport to the bus station?   Thanks!:)     PS: Congrats on the win last night!	1643633398.0	sh0i5j	/r/Egypt/comments/sh0i5j/cairo_airport_to_alex/	Cairo Airport to Alex?

duusnlyl	I am a computer engineering student at AASTMT (Alex campus) and I'm really fed up with it!! The educational system sucks for real. Too many exams (no less than 30 exams and quizzes per semester), too many OBLIGATORY assignments and projects and attendance is a must although I understand nothing from the teaching staff. Another problem is that almost all the courses (subjects) that I'm supposed to take have absolutely nothing to do with programming. I know that to get into tech I have to do a lot of self-learning and the problem is that this educational system gives me no extra time. My GPA is high (3.95) and I want to keep it high, but I also wanna enjoy what I study. I can't enjoy studying stuff that have nothing to do with my passion.  What do you guys suggest?  Extra info: I'm 20 years old in my second year of college. I entered this fancy-ass university with a fully-funded scholarship from thanawya amma so please don't suggest joining AUC or GUC because I can't afford them. I also have B1 German certificate and I'm currently studying for a C1 certificate; however, I also can't afford to travel to Germany. As for public universities, I think they're gonna be much more stressful than private universities like AASTMT.	1643654336.0	sh8id7	/r/Egypt/comments/sh8id7/im_sick_of_uni_aastmt/	I'm sick of uni (AASTMT)

I have been thinking on getting an iPad here in Cairo. So, my Egyptian friends, how do you buy such stuff here?

awgbqiai	i just came across the "عذاب القبر للاطفال" post, and i it seems to me that,   ppl who got more friction with religion as kids either become non religious as adults or leave it all together, ppl whose main ideas about religion growing up and into their adult hood is just do good and be kind to others seem to have a better relationship with it.   given this, i think the best thing you can do for your child is to keep them out of the religion cycle at young ages and only tell them the main outliers like, god is good..when we die we go to heaven or better yet don't indoctrinate them at all.  this has been like my philosophy for a really long time and i'd like to see what others here think on that matter.	1643762689.0	siaoc5	/r/Egypt/comments/siaoc5/are_you_goin_to_indoctrinate_your_kids_on/	Are you goin to indoctrinate your kids on religion stuff when you're older? if so to what extent?

I just finished residency as a doctor. I lived in both the US early childhood and egypt pre-college. The years I spent in egypt are those I cherish the most but I know my life will be in the US. Ill be honest and admit that my family is upper middle class american and hence was able to live very well in cairo in the 5th settlement district. Im looking for a community in america that resembles something like that. Professional muslim arab community in america that has their shit together. Most Egyptians in america dont really come from the same background (in egypt) as I do and I feel like I need to hide things. Is anyone aware of such communities in the US. Im from NYC. I heard there are nice communities in areas like dallas and orange county california.

67o6behe	Hi all, I'm doing a little research on Egypt and was hoping to have a couple of questions answered by people from there.   Recently the hashtag #Leave\_Sisi had been trending on Twitter ahead of the 25th of January. Do you guys imagine that expression of dissent on social media provides any opportunity for social or political change in the case of Egypt?   How safe do people feel in expressing their opinions online?   How is the sentiment in Egypt now? Since there seems to be an increasing crackdown on dissent, do you guys expect that there will be mobilization of any scale?   With food cards and subsidies being eliminated, how much of an impact is this expected to have on people who rely on them?   Does the recent increase in minimum wage carry any positive impact? Was this increase announced to show "improvements"?

hupqc	I’m in Sharm right now, I’m meant to meet my partner she’s Egyptian. Currently she’s in a taxi coming from Suez but the police stopped her at عيون موسي. They are also turning a lot of people away, they won’t let her pass and won’t give a specific reason.  At first they said her taxi driver may be kidnapping her. They want to contact her parents but they have passed away, they won’t accept speaking to her uncle or sister and have forced her the driver to turn around and won’t even let them park nearby threatening to remove his license.  I don’t understand why is there strict rules here preventing people from travelling? Is this specifically for entry into Sharm and the surrounding area or is this all over the country? Neither my partner or the driver were aware this could be a problem.  Is there anything we can do? She’s thinking to take the taxi all the way to Cairo to take a bus all the way here but she has no idea if this going to be allowed either it seems insane.	1643808564.0	siopo1	/r/Egypt/comments/siopo1/advice_entry_into_sharm_elsheikh_through_عيون_موسي/	Advice entry into Sharm El-Sheikh through عيون موسي

7jhevr2k	Now with the Egyptian National Team in the Semifinals of AFCON, and the World Cup Qualifiers coming up soon, I wanted to bring up a topic of discussion here.   As we know the Egyptian National Team is 100% Muslim players. This is stating a fact. Not a single Copt/Christian on the team roster. And unfortunately this has been the case for decades and nothing has changed.   If Coptic Christians represent 15-20% of the Egyptian population, surely there must be 1 or 2 players that are talented enough to play professional football and represent their country?  What boggles my mind even more is that the Egyptian Clubs like Al Ahly and Zamalek and others bring in players from Africa, Brazil, etc who are actually Christian, but an Egyptian Christian player? “Error 404 not found”.   My question is simply, why?  Some theories I’ve come across is that the Egyptian National team administration want to keep the entire team Muslim so they can pray together, kneel down together when they score a goal, etc. But this seems really shallow and silly.   I believe the problem is also present in the scouting at the club level. I’ve heard many stories of very talented Copts who were in training camps with Egyptian clubs only for the scout to ask for the boys name and if it’s a Coptic name they tell him “Sorry ya Mina/Kyrillos/Bishoy, there’s no room for you on the team”. And since the problem lies in the Club scouting, the National team has no one to choose from because the Copts don’t get a chance to show their talent to begin with. Yet somehow Christians being scouted from Africa/South America are not being discriminated against.   It’s just an overall frustrating situation for the 20 million Copts in Egypt, who don’t get any representation in the National Team or Clubs. What’s also heartbreaking is that Copts still LOVE and SUPPORT the National Team and Clubs despite this discrimination, while quietly hoping for a better future.	1643822635.0	siuagr	/r/Egypt/comments/siuagr/coptic_christians_in_egyptian_football/	Coptic Christians in Egyptian Football

2gwx9kir	I saw a post on r/all that made me realize how much men all over the world are being ignored emotional support, and I realized, that in Egypt, this problem is thriving in the form of "استرجل".   I personally as a male have never received any compliment about my (looks, taste in music, taste in fashion...etc) from someone outside my family (and even in my family it's rare) even tho I try to be as appealing as I can be.  I noticed as a kid I've always been told "مفيش راجل "بيعيط and I've always seen kids get bullied by other kids for simply, crying.  Everytime I was in a tough spot and needed a shoulder to cry on I was always told to just "man up" or the Egyptian version "استرجل".

xwbom	We've recently started a mission to expand the subreddit's features further by making community awards. Currently, we have four Community Awards: the "**A thank you note.. in Egyptian**" (500 coins, giftable by members), the "**Heinz Koshari"** (500 coins, giftable by members), the "**Ancient gold**" (1000 coins, giftable by members), and "**The obelisk**" (1800 coins, giftable by mods only).  # What are Community Awards?  There are two types of awards, the first and site wide of which being the Regular awards which are purchased with **coins**,  a mechanism of Reddit that ultimately requires real money to purchase packs of coins that can then be spent on awards for posts and comments. r/Egypt  does not receive any money when they are purchased, but it does receive coins when users gift Community Awards.  >Community Awards are unique to each community, and members can give them to each  other. Moderators can design and name the Awards however they want.A  portion of Coins from Community Award purchases will be deposited to  the community’s Coin balance. Moderators can use Coins from that balance  to reward members with Mod Awards. The Coin balance is shown only to  moderators in the community’s sidebar.  ***Moderators do NOT have access to the*** r/Egypt ***coin bank other than to give Community Awards on this sub to quality posts and comments. Moderators do NOT receive any coins personally.***  The second type is **Community Award:**  Any user can gift this award for an amount of Coins (min. 500) to a post or comment. Each of these awards will also gift coins to r/Egypt itself, allowing mods to give mod-exclusive awards. For example, a 500 Coin Community Award also gives the subreddit 100 Coins.  **Mod-Exclusive Community Award:** These awards are exclusive to the community and purchased using the coins available only to mods from the r/Egypt Coin bank, and give a certain amount of Reddit Premium to the  recipient. For example, a 1800 Coin Mod-Exclusive Community Award will  grant one month of Reddit Premium(*Reddit Premium gives 700 monthly coins, access to Premium Awards, and more. Learn about it here:* [*https://www.reddit.com/premium*](https://www.reddit.com/premium)). Useful for contests and such to reward the users officially.  ^(There may be an official contest later to expand the awards, and details will be given out when it's ready.)  # Powerups subscribers  You've decided to Powerup this subreddit and community and for a while you've had access to the basic features, but we're trying to change it up by adding custom emojis (That's all we can do). We're open for any ideas by you to expand the emojis' library.  #  What are Powerups?  >Powerups are community  subscriptions that provide redditors with a way to give back to select  communities by coming together to unlock community perks. All it takes  is 25 powerups to unlock perks for the whole community—25 members can  band together to unlock perks for everyone, or one community member can  purchase all 25 powerups.  Note: once unlocked, you can still powerup  the community to unlock perks exclusive to Powerup supporters.      **Powerups perks include:**  * Community achievement flairs that recognize community members  who are Powerup supporters, top users by karma, top posters, and more  * GIFs in comments * Custom community emojis and Reddit emojis  * The ability to upload HD 1080p videos (up to 2Gb in size)  >Those who apply a Powerup also unlock an exclusive achievement  flair and a spot on the community heroes list, so the community can see who unlocked perks.    >   >Once you become a Powerup supporter you can immediately enjoy  all the perks. Once a community receives 25 powerups, the perks are then unlocked for the entire community.   # How can I apply a Powerup?   Currently, you can access Powerups in two ways:   * By purchasing a [Reddit Premium subscription](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043034412-What-is-a-Reddit-Premium-subscription-), which includes a monthly powerup you can apply to the community of your choice.  * By purchasing a Powerup subscription for a specific community starting at $4.99 USD- web only.	1643965225.0	sk8s0e	/r/Egypt/comments/sk8s0e/community_awards_and_powerups/	Community Awards and Powerups

pf06d	Hello, I have a bank account with NBE one in EGP and another in USD.  Originally I would use TransferWise to get my salary in from USD to my EGP account.    I would like to keep the dollars instead of transferring it and going through the exchange rates every time, I'm not sure how to proceed from there.  I tried placing my NBE USD account info on transfer wise but it is requesting a routing number which doesn't exist in Egypt.

fmo6mxk7	I'm at that age (23F) where most of my male relatives are getting married, I myself got married a couple months ago. And all they do is complain about how impossible it is to get married.  To that I would like to tell you: YOU are making it impossible. Both of you, men and women.   Let's start off with the men: you're constantly complaining about how it costs a fortune to get married to your dreamgirl. Then we take one look at your dreamgirl and it's obvious why. Guys, seriously I don't know whether attraction makes you lose the ability to think but stop wifing women who have unrealisitc financial expectations. There are plenty of women out there who know that it's a tough economy, work, don't expect to own a house or waste money on jewelry and weddings. Yet for some reason you choose women who's trip to Muhammed El Sagheer alone costs as much as your monthly salary - go figure why it's hard to get married.  Also, you gotta let go of the delusion that marrying wa7da Agnabeya is what you need. They look better than all of us - I know, but they will never ever submit to the Egyptian lifestyle of caring for home and children. If you ask her to get you a glass of water she would much rather throw it in your face. And that's fine, different cultures have different merits. But this illusion is something you gotta let go of for your own sake.  My husband and I met when I was studying in Switzerland as a med-tech student. And he was relieved that he could marry an Egyptian after dating Swiss women. We went back to Cairo, read the Fat7a, we skipped the wedding because of Covid (and money), skipped the whole shabka stuff and I insisted to my parents I'd rather have that money spent in things that made sense, like a roof over our head. We're renting, living life and elhamdulilah it's super easy. This isn't something you can achieve with a foreigner, also the whole virginity topic and sexually transmitted diseases come into mind since this is also something most egyptian men wouldn't be comfortable with.  The point is, no one is forcing you with a gun to your head to spend millions of pounds to marry a girl. And if your partner-to-be is not standing up to her parents and telling them to stop exploiting you then it's already a sign of a shit marriage. YOU will be together for a longer time than she will stay with her family, so if she's not willing to put her foot down in order to protect your future finances together then keep looking. Because then she will also not say no to her family when it comes to what school your kid goes to, where your house will be, what car you drive and the list goes on.  My relatives go for the next best girl who said yes. This shouldn't be your standard.   Now let's get to my favorite part. Women: honestly the only thing I can say is our society is turning us into gold diggers. If you think its reasonable to expect a young man who's around entry-level to pay for extravagant nonsense that lasts literally 1 day?  What do you want from a marriage? Do you want pictures of a DAY that cost half a million pounds in a white dress where you look happy? Or do you want a sustainable future where you're actually happy for a long time? And your family interventions. I don't care what your dad says about you "being worth more than XY pounds of a shabka", YOU know the financial capabilities of your partner and if you truly feel something for him you'll stand up to your family and think about what your priorities are. A clunky ring on your finger or a pissed off husband who'll start his life with you in debt. Have more courage to make the process go smoothly, and your husband-to-be will be thankful for it.  We didn't have much before we got married, because we were both entry-level employees but elhamdulilah we were blessed and suddenly lived a very generous life in Egypt.   We're happy as can be and I'd rather smile in front of my future kids than show them pictures of a wedding where I'm smiling.   Someone needs to say this and this is a throwaway account so I'll say it. Stop. Postponing. The. Marriage. Men have sexual needs. He will be thankful if you don't make it take longer if it's unnecessary.   Now you're gonna think "wow what a money obsessed person". The majority of divorces occur due to financial issues. Of course money is not the focus point of marriage and you need to be a good, kind, faithful partner but when you have that very serious talk about finances you at least eliminate the biggest factor for divorce.   TLDR; prioritize long-term happiness when it comes to marriage instead of the unnecessary cultural events. men, prioritize decency over looks and have no fear to reject a woman because she's too materialistic. This is just my two cents, yalla hate.	1644008535.0	sko8fr	/r/Egypt/comments/sko8fr/to_everyone_who_wants_to_get_married/	To everyone who wants to get married

14syjgea	If you don't know what Zumra is, it's an online grocery store where you could buy specialty (primarily Asian) ingredients for your Asian dishes, whether that be a specific type of soy sauce, seaweed, oyster sauce, Chinese chili oil, Korean chili paste, etc.   But recently, it's been pushing itself as "Not just Asian", by bringing up a bunch of other stuff you can buy at a normal grocery store. There is no point to this. Like I can find this anywhere else, when I come to a place like Zumra I don't expect this, and I don't want this.  But that's whatever, right? I can still buy my specialty Asian ingredients and ignore the normal ingredients! I can even buy some on the side if I need something else.  But no! They've started to focus wayyy away from the Asian ingredients and they've basically stopped restocking them. Kikkoman soy sauce, the good soy sauce you find in literally every single sushi restaurant, is really expensive. Except for if you buy it in bulk, which I used to do.   But now it's not available! And so is everything else. Gochujang? Out of stock. Soy sauce? Out of stock. Chili Oil? Out of stock. Tom Yum paste? Out of stock MSG? Out of stock. Even if anything is in stock, it's 2x as expensive as it was a year ago or even a few months ago.  The instant Korean noodles, the thing they're most known for, has had it's price increased.   But guess what IS in stock? Bread! Oh what a joy that I can go to the specialty Asian store and get my overpriced bread and luncheon.   I really don't know what's happened to Zumra, and I don't know if they'll ever be what they once was, but until then, I'll be out of soy sauce.	1644069563.0	sl7kna	/r/Egypt/comments/sl7kna/zumra_has_become_so_terrible_and_im_not_sure_why/	Zumra has become so terrible, and I'm not sure why.

g9bwzxee	I'm in my 20s so I didn't have a chance to watch anything good or even the normal status quo, from H1N1 to Jan. Revolution and all the blood we saw and the bodies of real people, people like me and those around me not visual effects like movies it was fucking real.  Then all the bad things that happened afterwards.  Than rab'a and elnahda (this is not a political post so let's not discuss this but we can't deny horrible things happened and many were killed and there was a lot of shed blood) then bombings and the other things that happened back in the day.  And what happened in Myanmar occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Turkestan and lately in Uyghur, India then we saw COVID and all the horrible stuff from all over the world and it all happened consecutively, I didn't witness a moment where things were normal and I refuse to believe that bad is the normal.  And now everytime I see something bad I just pray and feel a little to no sadness at all but something like rayan being stuck in a well should've had a bigger effect on me and many things before but I just don't!  It's not like I don't feel 'cause I know I'm usually sad and I feel when people need help and I try but what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?  Can all these traumatizing events turn us to loveless emotionless humans eventually and can we be even called humans then?  I don't know the answer for that neither do I have the ability to change what's going around me so I'll just pray for a better life and a better afterlife.	1644108011.0	sllh58	/r/Egypt/comments/sllh58/but_what_if_we_got_used_to_badness_to_the_point/	But what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?

And any info for a travel agency that provides nile cruises? I’m hoping to take a nile cruise from cairo to luxor, then to aswan, however I want to stay in aswan for (possibly) a week because I have some research to conduct and people to meet for a personal project. The Nile cruise is not my only option too, I know I can also take the train.. possibly car or bus so I want more details on these options too..  Things I want to visit: The Karnak temple, Abu Simbel, The Nubian museum, Heissa island in aswan  Any advice, or details would be helpful!

fmo6mxk7	I'm at that age (23F) where most of my male relatives are getting married, I myself got married a couple months ago. And all they do is complain about how impossible it is to get married.  To that I would like to tell you: YOU are making it impossible. Both of you, men and women.   Let's start off with the men: you're constantly complaining about how it costs a fortune to get married to your dreamgirl. Then we take one look at your dreamgirl and it's obvious why. Guys, seriously I don't know whether attraction makes you lose the ability to think but stop wifing women who have unrealisitc financial expectations. There are plenty of women out there who know that it's a tough economy, work, don't expect to own a house or waste money on jewelry and weddings. Yet for some reason you choose women who's trip to Muhammed El Sagheer alone costs as much as your monthly salary - go figure why it's hard to get married.  Also, you gotta let go of the delusion that marrying wa7da Agnabeya is what you need. They look better than all of us - I know, but they will never ever submit to the Egyptian lifestyle of caring for home and children. If you ask her to get you a glass of water she would much rather throw it in your face. And that's fine, different cultures have different merits. But this illusion is something you gotta let go of for your own sake.  My husband and I met when I was studying in Switzerland as a med-tech student. And he was relieved that he could marry an Egyptian after dating Swiss women. We went back to Cairo, read the Fat7a, we skipped the wedding because of Covid (and money), skipped the whole shabka stuff and I insisted to my parents I'd rather have that money spent in things that made sense, like a roof over our head. We're renting, living life and elhamdulilah it's super easy. This isn't something you can achieve with a foreigner, also the whole virginity topic and sexually transmitted diseases come into mind since this is also something most egyptian men wouldn't be comfortable with.  The point is, no one is forcing you with a gun to your head to spend millions of pounds to marry a girl. And if your partner-to-be is not standing up to her parents and telling them to stop exploiting you then it's already a sign of a shit marriage. YOU will be together for a longer time than she will stay with her family, so if she's not willing to put her foot down in order to protect your future finances together then keep looking. Because then she will also not say no to her family when it comes to what school your kid goes to, where your house will be, what car you drive and the list goes on.  My relatives go for the next best girl who said yes. This shouldn't be your standard.   Now let's get to my favorite part. Women: honestly the only thing I can say is our society is turning us into gold diggers. If you think its reasonable to expect a young man who's around entry-level to pay for extravagant nonsense that lasts literally 1 day?  What do you want from a marriage? Do you want pictures of a DAY that cost half a million pounds in a white dress where you look happy? Or do you want a sustainable future where you're actually happy for a long time? And your family interventions. I don't care what your dad says about you "being worth more than XY pounds of a shabka", YOU know the financial capabilities of your partner and if you truly feel something for him you'll stand up to your family and think about what your priorities are. A clunky ring on your finger or a pissed off husband who'll start his life with you in debt. Have more courage to make the process go smoothly, and your husband-to-be will be thankful for it.  We didn't have much before we got married, because we were both entry-level employees but elhamdulilah we were blessed and suddenly lived a very generous life in Egypt.   We're happy as can be and I'd rather smile in front of my future kids than show them pictures of a wedding where I'm smiling.   Someone needs to say this and this is a throwaway account so I'll say it. Stop. Postponing. The. Marriage. Men have sexual needs. He will be thankful if you don't make it take longer if it's unnecessary.   Now you're gonna think "wow what a money obsessed person". The majority of divorces occur due to financial issues. Of course money is not the focus point of marriage and you need to be a good, kind, faithful partner but when you have that very serious talk about finances you at least eliminate the biggest factor for divorce.   TLDR; prioritize long-term happiness when it comes to marriage instead of the unnecessary cultural events. men, prioritize decency over looks and have no fear to reject a woman because she's too materialistic. This is just my two cents, yalla hate.	1644008535.0	sko8fr	/r/Egypt/comments/sko8fr/to_everyone_who_wants_to_get_married/	To everyone who wants to get married

14syjgea	If you don't know what Zumra is, it's an online grocery store where you could buy specialty (primarily Asian) ingredients for your Asian dishes, whether that be a specific type of soy sauce, seaweed, oyster sauce, Chinese chili oil, Korean chili paste, etc.   But recently, it's been pushing itself as "Not just Asian", by bringing up a bunch of other stuff you can buy at a normal grocery store. There is no point to this. Like I can find this anywhere else, when I come to a place like Zumra I don't expect this, and I don't want this.  But that's whatever, right? I can still buy my specialty Asian ingredients and ignore the normal ingredients! I can even buy some on the side if I need something else.  But no! They've started to focus wayyy away from the Asian ingredients and they've basically stopped restocking them. Kikkoman soy sauce, the good soy sauce you find in literally every single sushi restaurant, is really expensive. Except for if you buy it in bulk, which I used to do.   But now it's not available! And so is everything else. Gochujang? Out of stock. Soy sauce? Out of stock. Chili Oil? Out of stock. Tom Yum paste? Out of stock MSG? Out of stock. Even if anything is in stock, it's 2x as expensive as it was a year ago or even a few months ago.  The instant Korean noodles, the thing they're most known for, has had it's price increased.   But guess what IS in stock? Bread! Oh what a joy that I can go to the specialty Asian store and get my overpriced bread and luncheon.   I really don't know what's happened to Zumra, and I don't know if they'll ever be what they once was, but until then, I'll be out of soy sauce.	1644069563.0	sl7kna	/r/Egypt/comments/sl7kna/zumra_has_become_so_terrible_and_im_not_sure_why/	Zumra has become so terrible, and I'm not sure why.

g9bwzxee	I'm in my 20s so I didn't have a chance to watch anything good or even the normal status quo, from H1N1 to Jan. Revolution and all the blood we saw and the bodies of real people, people like me and those around me not visual effects like movies it was fucking real.  Then all the bad things that happened afterwards.  Than rab'a and elnahda (this is not a political post so let's not discuss this but we can't deny horrible things happened and many were killed and there was a lot of shed blood) then bombings and the other things that happened back in the day.  And what happened in Myanmar occupied Palestine, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Turkestan and lately in Uyghur, India then we saw COVID and all the horrible stuff from all over the world and it all happened consecutively, I didn't witness a moment where things were normal and I refuse to believe that bad is the normal.  And now everytime I see something bad I just pray and feel a little to no sadness at all but something like rayan being stuck in a well should've had a bigger effect on me and many things before but I just don't!  It's not like I don't feel 'cause I know I'm usually sad and I feel when people need help and I try but what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?  Can all these traumatizing events turn us to loveless emotionless humans eventually and can we be even called humans then?  I don't know the answer for that neither do I have the ability to change what's going around me so I'll just pray for a better life and a better afterlife.	1644108011.0	sllh58	/r/Egypt/comments/sllh58/but_what_if_we_got_used_to_badness_to_the_point/	But what if we got used to badness to the point where it doesn't affect us anymore?

And any info for a travel agency that provides nile cruises? I’m hoping to take a nile cruise from cairo to luxor, then to aswan, however I want to stay in aswan for (possibly) a week because I have some research to conduct and people to meet for a personal project. The Nile cruise is not my only option too, I know I can also take the train.. possibly car or bus so I want more details on these options too..  Things I want to visit: The Karnak temple, Abu Simbel, The Nubian museum, Heissa island in aswan  Any advice, or details would be helpful!

xwbom	As the sub has developed, we've seen more people break the rules, prompting the creation of this post.  Personal attacks in comment trees, including name-calling, provocation using passive-aggressive language with little indication of peaceful discourse, flame wars, and other uncivil behavior.  "Be civil" is the subreddit's first rule. It is, by design and placement, the most important rule and, as a result, the most strictly enforced regulation. It's what makes this platform worthwhile for everyone to invest their time in.  We guarantee free expression in this subreddit as long as it does not infringe on people's rights, thus we anticipate a lot of divergent viewpoints. Some of these viewpoints may differ from yours, resulting in passive-aggressive, dismissive, or simply chaotic discussions.  Such behavior is not tolerated on this platform because it contradicts the community's entire purpose. In the following weeks, expect tougher and longer enforcement of this specific pattern of offenses. Bigotry of any kind, including homophobia, xenophobia, racism, and other forms, is strictly prohibited.  Posts that are discriminatory to a certain group of people are not accepted under any circumstances. Race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age, and mental or physical handicap are all examples of this, and the rules safeguard posts on any of these topics being discussed.   Regardless of one's religious beliefs or lack thereof, sexuality or race, members are expected to behave civilly, expressing civil viewpoints in a concise and non-offensive manner, breaking it will result in an immediate and permanent suspension.  **Another big problem that started to show itself is low-effort posts**  Examples such as [news that have no credible or reputable source like news off Facebook/Twitter/comics and memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/comments/rpickt/posting_fake_news/); Title gore such as long titles, short non-descriptive titles or emoji-filled reactions.  Please don't downvote anything you don't agree with; the voting system isn't meant to be a popularity contest; rather, it's meant to promote interesting, high-effort contributions. "Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they aren't adding to the community debate or discussion" says the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205926439) documentation. You may assure that your downvotes are provided for legitimate reasons if you simply take a moment to pause and reflect your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so because his opinion simply doesn't align with yours.  Even if they break the rules, we greatly encourage successful civil conversation when dealing with posts you disagree with. If you retaliate against someone by committing an offense yourself, both you and the other user will be banned. **If someone breaks the rules, report them instead of insulting them back.**   *^(Reporting posts, comments or users just because you don't agree with their opinions won't get their content removed.)*  TL;DR:  Many newcomers, a rapid review of the [rules and guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Egypt/wiki/rules), and greater enforcement in the future: a few quick reminders of what you should know  1.

3ht6hu90	I am not asking about blurting it out on national television or to strangers . What i am simply saying is can a dark person from an african origin say the n-word jokingly within his circle of close friends .  First , You have to understand that egypt is a third world country , and to racist people we are all considered a “sand n-word” .   In fact  we are an underprivileged minority group compared to the outside world .   The reason why white people shouldnt say the n-word is because of the painful history attached to it , however Egyptian never caused any such pain ,actually we were as much likely to face such prejudice .   So when you as an Egyptian argue that we shouldn’t even joke about the word , you have ironically detached yourself from your african origin and subconsciously believed we are white people .	1644173648.0	sm4brw	/r/Egypt/comments/sm4brw/can_a_dark_egyptian_joke_with_close_friends_by/	Can a dark Egyptian joke with close friends by saying the n-word ?
