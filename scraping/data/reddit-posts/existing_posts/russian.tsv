683yhjrf	 For instance in the phrase "–£ –Ω–µ–≥–æ –µ—Å—Ç—å –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–∞?" - I thought "–≥" corresponds to a "g" sound, but in most translators (google, dict.cc, leo) I found it sounds more like a "v" or "w" sound.

4euudf8	I have two to three years experience learning Russian in college, but I also haven‚Äôt used it in about two years. I was hoping for some suggestions to some free online reading? I own some books in Russian but it‚Äôs still too advanced for me to not look things up constantly. So I‚Äôm looking for something geared towards beginners, or maybe a resource that shows English and Russian side by side? I really miss it, and I want to go back to building my skills and vocabulary.	1642364764.0	s5kopm	/r/russian/comments/s5kopm/online_russian_reading_suggestions/	Online russian reading suggestions?
h4wlj	I have a few, the first time I was in russia and a person was walking their dog, and called out to him "–∫–æ –º–Ω–µ!" (I still didn't know this expression at the time) but to my ears that sounded exactly the same as "come here!" which means the same thing, and I thought to myself "wow that's weird that they talk to their dogs in english here"   The first time I heard "–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é" I heard it like privet's to you (as in greetings to you) and I thought they were kind of using english too   Another time someone gave me some bread, and unexpectedly gave me a cup of water too, and I was kind of surprised and looked at the water asking what is this for, and he said "—ç—Ç–æ —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç—å" and I thought that meant something like "drink it all" so I drank it all before eating the bread and he looked at me like "wtf u doing" and I didn't know why. I later on learned that Russians always drink something AFTER eating, and learned the concept of "–∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç—å" and then I realised why haha   Another time I was sitting at a table writing something down, and someone asked me to "–ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–Ω—å —Å—Ç—É–ª –∫ —Å–µ–±–µ –ø–æ–±–ª–∏–∂–µ" which I translated as "move the chair closer towards yourself" and I was so confused thinking how can I make it closer to myself when I'm already sitting on it and literally touching it, how can I make it even closer? Maybe they mean so the back of the chair is also touching my back? Like they want me to straighten my back out? Okay so now every part of the chair is touching me and I've successfully made myself closer to the chair and done what they've asked. And then I noticed that "wtf" look coming at me again... Turns out they meant move closer to the table...   I often mix some words up, like —Å–µ–ª—ë–¥–∫–∞, —Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫–∞ (I'm never sure which one is the fish, and which one is the sausage) especially since —Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫–∞ reminds me of the word sardines which is fish. Someone asks me "—Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫—É —Ö–æ—á–µ—à—å?" and my reply is "–Ω–µ—Ç, —è –Ω–µ –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ä—ã–±—É" and i get another wtf look haha	1642365900.0	s5l3vk	/r/russian/comments/s5l3vk/any_funny_moments_with_russian/	Any funny moments with russian?
9qpfpgq8	If I wanted to say ‚Äúsomething in Russian‚Äù, would it be ‚Äú—á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏‚Äù or ‚Äú—á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –Ω–∞ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º‚Äù?  Or, are both correct, but with slight differences in meaning?	1642366774.0	s5lfse	/r/russian/comments/s5lfse/help_with_proper_phrasing/	Help with proper phrasing

a85gkmkr	–í—Å–µ–º –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç, I‚Äôve seen both –Ω–∞ and –¥–ª—è translated as ‚Äúfor‚Äù, for example ‚Äò–Ω–∞ –æ–±–µ–¥‚Äô or ‚Äò–¥–ª—è –Ω–∏—Ö‚Äô, so are there specific situations in which one must use –Ω–∞ or –¥–ª—è? –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –º–æ–∏ –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è!	1642399078.0	s5wkkc	/r/russian/comments/s5wkkc/–Ω–∞_–∏–ª–∏_–¥–ª—è/	–ù–∞ –∏–ª–∏ –¥–ª—è?

It's supposed to roughly mean "Today we are going to ask residents of St. Petersburg, what does Russian culture mean and what is the personality of Russians." But when I translate "–ö—Ç–æ —Ç–∞–∫–æ–π —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫" it translates to "Who is a Russian man." Please educate me, your responses would be deeply appreciated!

The only program I've found so far that can do this is Duolingo, and I don't want my entire Spanish study plan to... just be Duolingo.

I'm technically trilingual, but my Russian is very clunky. I do understand the grammar perfectly, but I have a very, very, limited vocabulary, and when speaking to my parents I always end up replacing half the words with my other two languages. So I'm basically looking to expand my vocabulary by casually watching YouTubers, to see what's it like to use Russian in day-to-day life.

ao2ueumt	Hello everyone,  If it's not the right place to ask, I apologize !  A friend of mine found an old notebook from college, she didn't open it for something like 10/15 years. Inside is a sentence written in what I believe is cursive cyrillic. She doesn't know anyone from a slavic country, so she has no idea what it means, who wrote it there, it's a total mystery !  I tried my best, and think the last word is either "–∑–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é" or " –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é", but I cannot go any further, as I never learnt any slavic language.  Could you help us understand the sentence, so maybe we'll get an idea about how it's been written in her notebook ?  —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ !     Edit : and of course I forgot the link to the picture.

a0qlz566	Maybe this will be helpful for others as well.  Take for instance the –ª in –ª—é–¥–∏. I was acutely aware of how the Russian pronunciation sounded different even though in German we do have a relatively soft L. I was trying all kinds of ways to palatalize the L - to no avail. Turns out I was pressing TOO LITTLE of my tongue towards my palate, only the front part. When I added the middle part of my tongue I was surprised to find out that it actually sounded much closer to the Russian pronunciation. Same with –Ω. I saw a video were they compare the soft –Ω to the n in new. When pronouncing new, it feels like your tongue almost covers your entire palate (maybe except for the back). Hope this might help someone :) Oh and please correct me if I'm wrong.	1642527982.0	s737cf	/r/russian/comments/s737cf/i_think_i_finally_understood_what_i_was_doing/	I think I finally understood what I was doing wrong when trying to palatalize consonants

h4wlj	I have a few, the first time I was in russia and a person was walking their dog, and called out to him "–∫–æ –º–Ω–µ!" (I still didn't know this expression at the time) but to my ears that sounded exactly the same as "come here!" which means the same thing, and I thought to myself "wow that's weird that they talk to their dogs in english here"   The first time I heard "–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é" I heard it like privet's to you (as in greetings to you) and I thought they were kind of using english too   Another time someone gave me some bread, and unexpectedly gave me a cup of water too, and I was kind of surprised and looked at the water asking what is this for, and he said "—ç—Ç–æ —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç—å" and I thought that meant something like "drink it all" so I drank it all before eating the bread and he looked at me like "wtf u doing" and I didn't know why. I later on learned that Russians always drink something AFTER eating, and learned the concept of "–∑–∞–ø–∏—Ç—å" and then I realised why haha   Another time I was sitting at a table writing something down, and someone asked me to "–ø–æ–¥–≤–∏–Ω—å —Å—Ç—É–ª –∫ —Å–µ–±–µ –ø–æ–±–ª–∏–∂–µ" which I translated as "move the chair closer towards yourself" and I was so confused thinking how can I make it closer to myself when I'm already sitting on it and literally touching it, how can I make it even closer? Maybe they mean so the back of the chair is also touching my back? Like they want me to straighten my back out? Okay so now every part of the chair is touching me and I've successfully made myself closer to the chair and done what they've asked. And then I noticed that "wtf" look coming at me again... Turns out they meant move closer to the table...   I often mix some words up, like —Å–µ–ª—ë–¥–∫–∞, —Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫–∞ (I'm never sure which one is the fish, and which one is the sausage) especially since —Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫–∞ reminds me of the word sardines which is fish. Someone asks me "—Å–∞—Ä–¥–µ–ª—å–∫—É —Ö–æ—á–µ—à—å?" and my reply is "–Ω–µ—Ç, —è –Ω–µ –ª—é–±–ª—é —Ä—ã–±—É" and i get another wtf look haha	1642365900.0	s5l3vk	/r/russian/comments/s5l3vk/any_funny_moments_with_russian/	Any funny moments with russian?

I'd like to try to see if I can learn Spanish through Russian (IE learning Spanish on Duolingo as a Russian speaker) because it seems like good practice, and a great way to think in Russian easier, and honestly just seems kinda fun.  The only program I've found so far that can do this is Duolingo, and I don't want my entire Spanish study plan to... just be Duolingo. Do you know of any programs, apps, or books where you can learn Spanish through Russian?	1642441219.0	s69ri8	/r/russian/comments/s69ri8/good_resources_for_learning_spanish_through/	Good resources for learning Spanish through Russian?

ljarz	Specifically looking for gaming and the "fun facts" genre (like sci-show, that animal TikTok dude, etc.).   Russian is my native language but I was born in a non-Russian-speaking country. I'm technically trilingual, but my Russian is very clunky. I do understand the grammar perfectly, but I have a very, very, limited vocabulary, and when speaking to my parents I always end up replacing half the words with my other two languages. So I'm basically looking to expand my vocabulary by casually watching YouTubers, to see what's it like to use Russian in day-to-day life.

ao2ueumt	Hello everyone,  If it's not the right place to ask, I apologize !  A friend of mine found an old notebook from college, she didn't open it for something like 10/15 years. Inside is a sentence written in what I believe is cursive cyrillic. She doesn't know anyone from a slavic country, so she has no idea what it means, who wrote it there, it's a total mystery !  I tried my best, and think the last word is either "–∑–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é" or " –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é", but I cannot go any further, as I never learnt any slavic language.  Could you help us understand the sentence, so maybe we'll get an idea about how it's been written in her notebook ?  —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ !     Edit : and of course I forgot the link to the picture.

I was acutely aware of how the Russian pronunciation sounded different even though in German we do have a relatively soft L. I was trying all kinds of ways to palatalize the L - to no avail. Turns out I was pressing TOO LITTLE of my tongue towards my palate, only the front part. When I added the middle part of my tongue I was surprised to find out that it actually sounded much closer to the Russian pronunciation. Same with –Ω. I saw a video were they compare the soft –Ω to the n in new. When pronouncing new, it feels like your tongue almost covers your entire palate (maybe except for the back). Hope this might help someone :) Oh and please correct me if I'm wrong.	1642527982.0	s737cf	/r/russian/comments/s737cf/i_think_i_finally_understood_what_i_was_doing/	I think I finally understood what I was doing wrong when trying to palatalize consonants

x5m46	I‚Äôve been successful at studying numerous languages. Russian has always been difficult. I was a Russian minor and took four years of college Russian with all As but I actually can‚Äôt speak much at all or understand news articles. When I went to Russia (alone after college) I could not communicate.   When I was in high school I learned Slovak and moved to Slovakia and spoke Slovak well. Although they are similar languages, Russian expressions are different for sure.   Anyway, when I‚Äôve tried to start over with Russian with let‚Äôs say an advanced beginner  class, the focus is so much on grammar. I oddly don‚Äôt have issues with the grammar- I understand case usage and conjugations. I literally cannot remember Russian words at all. I have no words to fill the grammar!  I would say my brain has Slovak in it but I can separate Spanish French and Italian so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that.   I feel like it‚Äôs because Russian is a different alphabet and I can‚Äôt visually commit the words.   I can read Russian but I think if I learned romanicized Russian I‚Äôd remember it.

mltv3oc	***TYPO: ROMANIZED*, not romance. Sorry for the title  Hey! So, there's this Russian 80's synthpop song that works amazingly for my voice (he might be my vocal Russian doppelganger tbh) and I want to cover this song. The main issue is that I don't know Russian, so trying to adequately make out phonetical sounds will most likely 100% result in mistranslations that I don't want to have (esp considering the subject matter of the song, I really don't wanna mess it up.) I'm wondering if yall can translate this in a romanized version, in other words.... the phonetic sounds of each word so I know I'm speaking the song right when I sing it, whether or not I know the exact wording of each phrase I'm singing.   Anywho, as the title says, I'll be paying $100usd for anyone to do this task for me. Write the song out in English letters, phonetically representing the Russian words. I do have a good ear, just not good enough... but I'll be examining everything to the original because I do wanna pay whoever does this. I'll see the responses. I'm not made of money, so if I get a lot of responses, I'll have no option but to pay the full amount only for the full song if it works out to the original. However, if I find very few reply, it might be something I could do 25%for to start and 75%when I get the final product.  I know Google could maybe do this for me, but I trust Russian speakers more than I trust Google here tbh. So what do yall say??? I'll post the cover here when I finish it if that makes it worth it..... here's the song btw, with lyrics.  https://youtu.be/Jn47dbF1XIA  Having a guide on how to pronounce everything would be amazing, as the English lyrics just aren't as beautiful as the Russian lyrics, ya feel? I hope I don't come off as a dumbass ignorant asshole in this post, I just wanna do this song justice as a vocalist :(	1642685070.0	s8ixfq	/r/russian/comments/s8ixfq/will_pay_100usd_for_anyone_to_transcribe_into_a/	Will pay $100usd for anyone to transcribe into a romance version for a song cover.

i82ge1	A while ago (I'm talking like 2013, maybe?), I was recommended a grammar book on this subreddit that compiled an exhaustive list of Russian prefixes, suffixes, and roots.  It was so helpful in learning how to break down Russian words, especially when I didn't know a word I was looking at.  It was SO GOOD.  I was trying to find my copy, though, and I no longer know where it is.  I was wondering if there is someone out there that knows which book I'm talking about, and if you know where to get it.  I believe I got it from Amazon back in the day.  If I'm not wrong, the book itself had a blue cover and had plastic ring binding, as if it were made to order and printed off as such.

Looking for recommendations, but just browsing online and via YouTube, I'm not finding any with English dub.   Speaking of which, was Father Frost the *most* popular, and thus why it was dubbed in English, why others were not? Would love to know more.

49ch2mub	Greetings! I'm learning Russian for 7 months now, I learn at home and pretty much every day for at least one hour. I use russianpod 101, youtube, and another online course. I am native German and learning English was no problem for me, I can undersant pretty much everything and also talk about every topic. I learned English mostly with YouTube and netflix series with subtitles but I feel like that doesn't work for russian, even tho I have a vocabulary of about 2000 words, when natives speak at normal speed I almost understand absolutely nothing. For example when I watch YouTube channels like "in russian from Afar" or "cafe russian" who speak super slow and clear about easy topics I don't even need subtitles to understand but then the other day I watched Putins new year speech and I felt like it was a whole other language I hardly understood one single sentence. So my goal is that I can speak and understand Russian as good as English in 3 years. Do you think its a realistic goal? And did you feel the same with Russians speaking at natural speed at the beginning? How long did it take you guys to be decent at russian?

None	As far as I've been told by Russian nationalists, Russia has absolutely zero dialects whatsoever, and in fact women and men *and* children for that matter all sound exactly the same at all times; if someone speaks Russian differently than the standard Moscow dialect, they're Western spies that didn't pay attention during infiltration training.  On a more serious note, I am Alaskan and know of the Ninilchik dialect who inhabit the Kodiak Peninsula, and I also have met many Russian Jews in New York who speak a dialect of Russian which predates the Bolshevik Revolution and the standardization efforts made by the Communists. With that being said, the so-called aforementioned Russian nationalists are right. Russian is more standardized and uniform than most other languages, more so than English, which itself is known for not having much dialectal deviation that would interfere with mutual intelligibility with the exception of Scots or maybe AAVE/"Ebonics" (though the latter of which isn't that hard for me to understand at all, maybe because of cultural exposure). This is unlike Italian for example where people can't understand most other dialects, especially if it's a Northern Italian speaking with a Southern Italian, or Chinese where due to it being a tonal language even an accent can interfere with intelligibility between people even if everything is pronounced in a way mutually agreed upon.  &#x200B;  So again, is there any regional dialects that sound "funny" to a majority of other Russians?	1642907573.0	sajpig	/r/russian/comments/sajpig/is_there_a_dialect_of_russian_that_is_often_made/	Is there a dialect of Russian that is often made fun of in popular media, like Scottish on British TV?

For that reason, I have made a Google Doc version of the PDF and added several things that I wanted (and removed a few).  *  PDF of my new version: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBuBu34XTMI-2wmoyrZMAUP2EIj-5dXD/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qBuBu34XTMI-2wmoyrZMAUP2EIj-5dXD/view?usp=sharing) *  Google Doc of the cheatsheet: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/18GoJozAlHKnzrRtQi-N--C9wXpfA-O8rORg9yylUaeQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18GoJozAlHKnzrRtQi-N--C9wXpfA-O8rORg9yylUaeQ/edit?usp=sharing)  If you would like to customize it for your needs you could just make a copy of the Google Doc, apply the corresponding changes and voila!	1642939577.0	sas9sw	/r/russian/comments/sas9sw/russian_memorization_chart_editable/	Russian Memorization Chart (editable)

i39n3bvc	As a fan of Soviet culture, particularly in it's golden days (If I dare say so), where might one find English-dubbed Classic films such as Morozko (1964)? I'm particularly interested in Soviet-era cultural films featuring Baba Yaga and similar children's stories. Looking for recommendations, but just browsing online and via YouTube, I'm not finding any with English dub.   Speaking of which, was Father Frost the *most* popular, and thus why it was dubbed in English, why others were not? Would love to know more. Other films on my to-watch list are The Golden Horns, Vasilisa the Beautiful, Three Wishes for Cinderella, or Evenings On a Farm Near Dikanka.	1642726513.0	s8xs31	/r/russian/comments/s8xs31/–º–æ—Ä–æ–∑–∫–æ_and_similar_sovietera_films/	–ú–æ—Ä–æ–∑–∫–æ and similar Soviet-era films?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I'm learning Russian for 7 months now, I learn at home and pretty much every day for at least one hour. I use russianpod 101, youtube, and another online course. I am native German and learning English was no problem for me, I can undersant pretty much everything and also talk about every topic. I learned English mostly with YouTube and netflix series with subtitles but I feel like that doesn't work for russian, even tho I have a vocabulary of about 2000 words, when natives speak at normal speed I almost understand absolutely nothing. For example when I watch YouTube channels like "in russian from Afar" or "cafe russian" who speak super slow and clear about easy topics I don't even need subtitles to understand but then the other day I watched Putins new year speech and I felt like it was a whole other language I hardly understood one single sentence. So my goal is that I can speak and understand Russian as good as English in 3 years. Do you think its a realistic goal? And did you feel the same with Russians speaking at natural speed at the beginning? How long did it take you guys to be decent at russian?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I'm learning Russian for 7 months now, I learn at home and pretty much every day for at least one hour. I use russianpod 101, youtube, and another online course. I am native German and learning English was no problem for me, I can undersant pretty much everything and also talk about every topic. I learned English mostly with YouTube and netflix series with subtitles but I feel like that doesn't work for russian, even tho I have a vocabulary of about 2000 words, when natives speak at normal speed I almost understand absolutely nothing. For example when I watch YouTube channels like "in russian from Afar" or "cafe russian" who speak super slow and clear about easy topics I don't even need subtitles to understand but then the other day I watched Putins new year speech and I felt like it was a whole other language I hardly understood one single sentence. So my goal is that I can speak and understand Russian as good as English in 3 years. Do you think its a realistic goal? And did you feel the same with Russians speaking at natural speed at the beginning? How long did it take you guys to be decent at russian?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I'm learning Russian for 7 months now, I learn at home and pretty much every day for at least one hour. I use russianpod 101, youtube, and another online course. I am native German and learning English was no problem for me, I can undersant pretty much everything and also talk about every topic. I learned English mostly with YouTube and netflix series with subtitles but I feel like that doesn't work for russian, even tho I have a vocabulary of about 2000 words, when natives speak at normal speed I almost understand absolutely nothing. For example when I watch YouTube channels like "in russian from Afar" or "cafe russian" who speak super slow and clear about easy topics I don't even need subtitles to understand but then the other day I watched Putins new year speech and I felt like it was a whole other language I hardly understood one single sentence. So my goal is that I can speak and understand Russian as good as English in 3 years. Do you think its a realistic goal? And did you feel the same with Russians speaking at natural speed at the beginning? How long did it take you guys to be decent at russian?

None	As far as I've been told by Russian nationalists, Russia has absolutely zero dialects whatsoever, and in fact women and men *and* children for that matter all sound exactly the same at all times; if someone speaks Russian differently than the standard Moscow dialect, they're Western spies that didn't pay attention during infiltration training.  On a more serious note, I am Alaskan and know of the Ninilchik dialect who inhabit the Kodiak Peninsula, and I also have met many Russian Jews in New York who speak a dialect of Russian which predates the Bolshevik Revolution and the standardization efforts made by the Communists. With that being said, the so-called aforementioned Russian nationalists are right. Russian is more standardized and uniform than most other languages, more so than English, which itself is known for not having much dialectal deviation that would interfere with mutual intelligibility with the exception of Scots or maybe AAVE/"Ebonics" (though the latter of which isn't that hard for me to understand at all, maybe because of cultural exposure). This is unlike Italian for example where people can't understand most other dialects, especially if it's a Northern Italian speaking with a Southern Italian, or Chinese where due to it being a tonal language even an accent can interfere with intelligibility between people even if everything is pronounced in a way mutually agreed upon.  &#x200B;  So again, is there any regional dialects that sound "funny" to a majority of other Russians?	1642907573.0	sajpig	/r/russian/comments/sajpig/is_there_a_dialect_of_russian_that_is_often_made/	Is there a dialect of Russian that is often made fun of in popular media, like Scottish on British TV?

5a3yxqac	Hello all,  I came across a lovely song in Russian called '–ù–µ –ø–æ –º–æ—Ä—é' on BEK (which you can listen to here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHEx06a8IE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWHEx06a8IE)). However, what has confused me is the song is translated in English as 'At blue sea that was' (which is incorrect English in the first instance, but we'll ignore that).     As I understand '–ù–µ –ø–æ –º–æ—Ä—é' would be translated as something like 'Not of the sea(ing)'.    Could anyone explain if I am wrong here and if so how?

dgm6pl0j	I wanted to start learning Russian for some time now but never got around to it. But now I'm starting a 2 week quarantine so I finally decided to start learning it. Since I'm Serbian I belive that it should be easier because of 2 things:  ‚Ä¢I already know the cyrillic alphabet  ‚Ä¢Both are Slavic languages which (in theory) should make it easier  So my questions are:  -Where do I start?  -Do you recommend Duolingo?

15yubl	Learning about the rooms in the house and I have before me a building plan of sorts but some rooms are abbreviated to the point of not understanding for me.   These are –ø–æ—Å—Ç. & –∫–æ—Ç. They are smaller rooms - 5m2. Storage is indicated as  –ö–ª–∞–¥–æ–≤–∞—è here on the plan so it ain't them. Maybe a boiler room of sorts? Dictionary seems to say that is –∫–æ—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–∞—è so I am pretty certain of that but the –ø–æ—Å—Ç. is still eluding.

a0qlz566	–ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç –≤—Å–µ–º!  To those who have developed a good feel for verbal aspects: How did you do it?  This has been pretty much the only aspect (no pun intended) of Russian in which I have made zero progress. I know the basic rules for when to use which one, but that doesn't seem enough.   I believe my problem is that when I am reading or listening I don't even notice the aspect of a given verb. If you'd ask me, I could probably tell in 70% or so of cases, but I simply don't pay attention to it. I guess this is what I need to fix: I need to set aside time to specifically pay attention to them, I'm just not noticing them otherwise. Cuz if you aren't even aware of a verb's aspect, how are you ever going to develop a feel for its use cases? I might do that soon, or maybe it'll be much easier once I have more mental space as a result of encountering fewer new words? (I have read here many times that verbal aspect is more of an advanced topic-- could this be why?)  So yeah, these are my current hypotheses of what might help. What have been your experiences?

bvyiq	Hey guys so recently I have been on a good Russian learning run. I use Duolingo daily just to see the usage of grammar structures in context, Memrise for spaced repetition of vocabulary, Russian in Exercises to get some decent grammar/vocab explanations, the New Penguin Russian Course book as a supplement to fill in the gaps. I even have a Russian study partner to practice with couple times a week. My only issue is I was hoping to use a resource where I could get some listening practice in as well, that's why I was a little excited when I found RT's Learn Russia resource. However from what I have learned it no longer has support and the audio/video no longer work.

2crcoz1k	May be, it would be useful for some newbies. It's explanation of noun genders. You can identificate genders by noun ending.   Good news: you can easily identificate neutral gender, because it always ends by `o/e/—ë` or `–º—è`.   Bad news: you can sometimes confuse musculine gender with feminine.    Feminine ends by `–∞/—è, —Å—Ç—å, —å`, except of wods used for "male person", for example –ø–∞–ø–∞(father) ends by –∞, but it's musculine, because father is a male.   Nouns that ends by hard consonant(–ª, –º, –Ω, —Ä, –±, –¥, –≥, etc) are highly likely musculine.  Reliable signs of gender end here. In all other situations, you should guess/remember the noun with its gender.   A little hints:  You can make a mistake highly likely with words, ended by zh, sh, ch sounds.  If you need to remember a gender of a word, remember the noun with the "my" word. Musculine noun require "my" in –º–æ–π form. Feminine - –º–æ—è, and neutral - –º–æ—ë.      Now you can learn my scheme :)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/mvec8ae8l0e81.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85ee80994dc0fe3c8b9a9dc552bff0203db51962	1643195281.0	sd3j5h	/r/russian/comments/sd3j5h/russian_genders/	Russian genders

1u8v087v	–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç!  I learned that there is a possible construction regarding the nominative adjectives, called the shortened version. As the name implies, it is shorter than the long(and way more used) form, the material I'm using says it's quite rare to see it being used in spoken form, even tho I found it quite useful.  If I understood right, you use the short version AFTER the noun and each gender has it's own form, for example –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤—ã–π becomes just –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∏–≤ and it is placed after the noun.  On top of that, the main reason to like the shorter version, is that it implies something less powerful or less significant than normal, so saying in this way you're not calling someone beautiful, just *a little* beautiful or simply *slightly above average looking*. Right?  How much do you use it? Is this use still legitimate?  –°–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ!	1643324787.0	sebgjw	/r/russian/comments/sebgjw/further_understanding_the_short_adjectives/	Further understanding the short adjectives

If it helps filtering, don't restrain purely to films like Stalker since I admit it was a bizarrely comfortable experience and far from ordinary.	1643332678.0	seec75	/r/russian/comments/seec75/russian_movies_to_watch_with_english_subtitles/	Russian movies to watch with English subtitles

dt8rhpc1	Memorizing words is one thing, Memorizing how to hear them and say them is another. But then you have to memorize how they are spelt. I mean it's getting easier for me now that I see more and more words and kind of understand how it's spelt from how it sounds but I wouldn't be able to spell 100% of words correct off the top of my head. I only know the very basics too.  What would you guys suggest for learning how to spell? Writing on paper? Just randomly try practicing  using the words you've learned with strangers online, typing it out? Or is there a website or program you can use to see if you can spell a certain word right?	1643340318.0	segx4k	/r/russian/comments/segx4k/what_is_the_best_way_to_learn_spelling_in_russian/	What is the best way to learn spelling in Russian?

96unh415	 **The Learning Set**  As most of you know, learning vocabulary is one of the most important aspects of language learning. To help you guys with this issue, I have decided to prepare **a completely free Russian learning set** on an open-source flashcard application called **‚ÄúAnki.‚Äù** I would be delighted if you could check out this learning set and give me some feedback. Pictures below show a preview of the learning set. You can find the detailed explanation on how to download it as a separate heading below.  **Why Anki?**  Anki is an entirely free software (except for the iOS version) that can be used on Windows, macOS, Android, or iOS. It is much better than other flashcard applications such as Quizlet because it incorporates a **study technique called** [**spaced repetition**](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/jan/23/spaced-repetition-a-hack-to-make-your-brain-store-information)**.** It is also highly customizable, meaning that you can create any type of flashcard in any way you want. Even if you do not intend to use the learning set, I highly recommend using Anki in your other studies that require any kind of memorization. You can also find other shared decks for different languages. It is a bit hard to learn how to use it effectively, but there are plenty of resources online. To start things off, you can visit the unofficial subreddit [r/Anki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/).  I tried to make this learning set as comprehensive as possible by including almost every aspect of language learning. Although there is not a grammar section, immersing yourself in this learning set will help significantly with grammar. You can see the modules and the number of cards in each module from the following photo:  [Modules and the number of cards in each module](https://preview.redd.it/zv2zcknllde81.png?width=679&format=png&auto=webp&s=d58bb247f14d3710a2843745bf8e6691324cb319)  The most important and effective part of the learning set is the ‚ÄúMain Course,‚Äù whose primary goal is to teach you the vocabulary. This section includes the **most used 5000 words** in Russian, which **constitute almost 95% of all written and spoken Russian**. You can find a photo of a **typical flashcard below** (along with the annotated version):  [Preview of a Card](https://preview.redd.it/fm7sofikjde81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fa1ea9162831b90a723f6293c0494096fc585fb)  **Annotated:**  [Annotated](https://preview.redd.it/ovk1wpgnjde81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=08b313f52bb1c6f5c49c34d6c543b58907899580)  **Listening & Comprehension/Speaking**  These modules have been created with the utilization of the example sentences from the Main Course. **Sentences are sorted by their length** rather than the order they appear in the Main Course. In the following picture, you can see the **Listening & Comprehension** part of the learning set. It includes **a timer and dictionary links** that redirect to Wiktionary:  [Listening \(Annotated\)](https://preview.redd.it/vz1l0q6tjde81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=4337b3b0f77e78573288dbfc023a1c2ce4f1531b)  If you do not know the meaning of a word in the sentence, you can choose the Wiktionary link for that word and you will be directly redirected to the Wiktionary page of that word.   And here you can see the **Speaking part:**   [Speaking \(Annotated\)](https://preview.redd.it/f624m0p4lde81.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97000cf5b93d6bd0a2e61ab7f742ad96555cb20)  **How to download the learning set?**  1. Download Anki to your phone or computer by going to the [official website of Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). 2. Download the learning set from [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1147549038). 3. Open the downloaded file with Anki.  If you have any questions, you can write them in the comments section. Please do not forget to fill out the [form whose link is already within the learning set](https://forms.gle/TiPLEf4hHGSw26AGA)**.** I hope you can benefit from my learning set!

434wy2qh	My teacher tells us that a student of Russian should always use –≤—ã, unless talking to a child or pet, *even if* the native speaker addresses you with —Ç—ã. We're told not to use —Ç—ã until/unless we are *expressly invited* to do so.  I use –≤—ã with all the native speakers that I know in real life. Humans are hierarchical animals, I consider these folks to be above me because they are fluent in a language that I struggle to speak. (So far, they are also all older than me.)  I chat with a lot of Russian speakers online. Some of them use –≤—ã, so that's easy--I just use –≤—ã, too. But some of them use —Ç—ã. And here there seems to be no right answer. If I use —Ç—ã, I might appear disrespectful. If I continue to use –≤—ã, I might appear cold and formal. And if I ask permission to also use —Ç—ã, as my teacher suggested, my language partner either a) is embarrassed, feeling like *they* have been disrespectful, or b) is completely confused, and I don't blame them, because it's something they have an inherent sense of which I lack.  –î—Ä—É–∑—å—è, —á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?	1643363633.0	sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/	What are the real-life (Internet) rules for –≤—ã and —Ç—ã?

ggv7grge	Hi   I'm trying to start taking my Russian learning seriously, but I keep being dissuaded from learning the cases by people.   For example, I want to learn the 6 cases, because i think that this would make it MUCH easier for me to build any sentence. It's easier for me remember the rules of the 3 tenses / 6 cases than to remember EVERY ending to –∫–æ—à–∫–∞, for example. .  I was trying to build the phrase 'I want to give the flowers to my daughter' just as a little exercise for myself, so I started with:   -  'okaaay so I want is —è —Ö–æ—á—É'; - 'flowers is in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its a direct object, and daughter is in –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its the indirect object...'   And then my friend stopped me, told me the answer (which made me a little annoyed), and questioned why I was trying to learn cases when many Russians don't know them. I then asked my OTHER friend and she agreed that it was pointless learning cases     but... this makes no sense to me? Surely its easier to learn the logic of a sentence structure than to learn phrases by rote memorisation?    Am I just being a bad student here, and taking the wrong approach?	1643394175.0	sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/	Beginning to learn Russian - cases :(

ggv7grge	I'm putting this into a separate post, so apologies for spamming the sub.   I was wondering how the cases take priority in a sentence.   For example, if I wanted to say the phrase 'He gives the flowers to the girl', then it's pretty obvious which word takes which case.   But if I wanted to say 'Tom drives his mother's car to his girlfriends house' then it causes a little conflict in my mind.  For example, car is the direct object so the case could be '–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π' but it also belongs to his mother, so it could be —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π too?   Similar to girlfriends house... should house be in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π or –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π?    I'd love to know how cases take precedence in issues like this.    I know that this is beyond me, but if I have the nuances and rules written down somewhere, I can use them in future!	1643395284.0	sexjjs	/r/russian/comments/sexjjs/russian_cases_priority/	Russian cases priority?

Usually I do this through wiki articles as a starting point, however I have found minimal Foucault articles on wiki in Russian.

lctnh	I got some really good feedback from the first round of books that were sold. Here's a re-cap: My parents are trying to clear the large assortment of Russian books they have. Genres would be various from drama, mystical and non-fiction.   I uploaded the pictures of all the books available. I apologize if this isn't ideal but this was the best option I was able to come up with given the amount of books. I took it with my iPhone which should have decent resolution for you to be able to zoom in.  I have a very good shipping account I can use through work, where the costs would be much cheaper than usual for pretty much any country around the globe. I'm located in Canada, Ontario, Vaughan. If you're curious about shipping costs, please feel free to send me a DM so I can get you a quote.  If you're curious about any specific book, please feel free to send me a DM with the photo # that you are referring to. I think maybe if you do a screenshot and put a marker on the book you are looking referring to, that would make it easier for me to find it for you.  If you want me to pick out books based on specific genre or whether you want me to surprise you with the books I choose, that's fine too :) Just send me a DM about it :) I'd be more than glad to help you with any questions you may have! All proceeds will go to my parents to help them with some bills after COVID's impact here.     **Complete collection of Alexandra Marinina - detective**  **Litvinovs - detective**  **Ekaterina Vilmont - easy reading**  **Ustinova - detective**  **In Russian (in case I misspelled something)**  **–ü–æ–ª–Ω–æ–µ —Å–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä—ã –ú–∞—Ä–∏–Ω–∏–Ω–æ–π -–¥–µ—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã**  **–õ–∏—Ç–≤–∏–Ω–æ–≤—ã -–¥–µ—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã**  **–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –í–∏–ª—å–º–æ–Ω—Ç -–ª–µ–≥–∫–æ–µ —á—Ç–∏–≤–æ**  **–£—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–≤–∞- –¥–µ—Ç–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤—ã**  **3 Book Bundle - $10 CAD (you will get 2 extra for free as a bonus, total 5 books)**  **5 Book Bundle - $15 CAD (you will get 2 extra for free as a bonus, total 7 books)**  **10 Book Bundle - $20 CAD (you will get 2 extra for free a bonus, total 12 books)**  **Based on calculations I did, here is an idea of how much shipping will cost you;**  **If within Canada (less than $20 CAD for 10 +2 books)**  **If within USA ($20-25 CAD for 10 + 2 books)**  **If within UK ($50-70 CAD for 10 + 2 books)**  **Other parts of Europe: ($70+ CAD for 10 + 2 books)**  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/xfzc3fx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5be5416023ee2db84d3943fc730e83ce66aea021  https://preview.redd.it/3g2q3ix0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9acd0ab57eac6f3218bfb617b921db7d885a97ca  https://preview.redd.it/ndup3ix0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8a21207626133e5e83448a2e4f10f59ad382d6a  https://preview.redd.it/gm27ajx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed1754dece1f9d50c06589f699a2da8c3b77e9cc  https://preview.redd.it/qmispkx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=558db83eca1c533b2ae619ed8749dba18a89ee6c  https://preview.redd.it/kv5t7ix0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d071ff657c6064c0725764ec7037cc9ae5537a2  https://preview.redd.it/zoma7jx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2c85c2a96a843385d202e0c2f9e31813c819e81  https://preview.redd.it/tctbukx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b946737c24717344ece7c3c60dfb7f269197079d  https://preview.redd.it/008m4lx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7daab3b5657fd755469e458d9c84f792117a9cff  https://preview.redd.it/zgw5ukx0dpe81.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93607ad4893cba8ea1d5d46e99d3f5e4d2336a4c	1643495064.0	sfteit	/r/russian/comments/sfteit/selling_my_parents_russian_books_round_2/	Selling my parents' Russian books Round 2
80sjmd0w	tl;dr: can you say –Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É when you are thirsty for water?  Recently I learned some new words and I'm always very happy when I see a word that I recently learned in an article or a video or something like that. So this happened with the word  –∂–∞–∂–¥–∞—Ç—å, I saw it in a video ([https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN](https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN)).  So this sign doesn't make much sense to me,  is this an actual way of asking for water in this press conference? Seems unlikely, but I'm not sure what else could it be. Maybe he is just continuing the metaphor? Like "I'm thirsty for knowledge, give me the answers"?	1643497576.0	sfucfx	/r/russian/comments/sfucfx/—è_–∂–∞–∂–¥—É_is_this_only_metaphorical_or_can_be_taken/	–Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É - is this only metaphorical or can be taken literally?

d740wwp7	I have been quite confused about the reflexive verbs. I understand where they express some action to be done to oneself (bathing/shaving oneself etc). But I also learned that it can be used in places where there is no direct object.  Like –Ø —É—á—É—Å—å, where you say you are learning but not specifiy what.  My question is, similar to such context, can we make any verb  reflexive? For example, –Ø –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é—Å—å or –Ø –∑–Ω–∞—é—Å—å? "I speak" and "I know" but not specify the object? Or only some verbs can be reflexive and I have to learn them manually?  And if any verb can't be transformed into a reflexive, what do you write when there is no specific object? I mean what would be the "—É—á—É—Å—å" equivalent of "–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é"? "I am speaking" but not specified about what is same as "I am learning (something)" right?  And is there any way to know which verbs can be reflexive (other than the obvious shaving/bathing ones)?  Too many question lol.

8a5we7kl	I have been learning Russian since like 7th grade when I started on the Cyrillic alphabet, like about 4 years. Since then, I haven't gotten much farther than simple sentences, verb conjugation, and grammatical gender. I love how the language sounds and want to be fluent in it.   Just for some possibly needed details, my native language is American English, and I know a little Spanish, but speak mostly English.

e719b	So I used to date this woman studying here.  She's moved back to Russia.  Lately we were talking about getting back together until this weird guy came on the scene.  He's much older than us, he's seemingly involved in pharmacies without having any medical training (i suspect he provides rx drugs to addicts), and he's tried to force himself on her before.  He attempted to blackmail her with videos of her in a compromised state.  She reported him to the police, but for whatever reason she seems to have started speaking to him again.  She's been avoiding me, seemingly drunk or high all the time, which is uncharacteristic of her.  he has tried to contact me before directly, but I blocked him completely.  Today I got a random message through her imessage saying the following:  > –ò–¥–∏ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ –æ—Ç XXX! YYY > –°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—é –∑–∞–¥–µ–ª–∞—é —Ç–µ–±–µ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ–±—É–µ—à—å –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å!  I've put this through online translators (deepl, google, yandex, bing) and can't really make sense of it.  They mostly give a result similar to this:  > Get away from XXX! YYY > I'll close up an article for you if you try to write or type!  I understand the first line, and the "if you try to write or type" i think, but what is "I'll close up an article" mean?  Is this a threat of violence?  Is he threatening to write a police report?  What does it mean?  I'm really unsure what to make of this, other than he doesn't want me talking to her.  It's making me really worry about her safety.  If she doesn't want to be with me, that's fine, but I'm worried about what he's doing to her!  Maybe someone could help me to write this for her sister?  > Hey ZZZ, your sister seems to be involved with XXX again.  He sent me a (threatening) message not to speak to Julia ever again.

434wy2qh	For the past three years, I've been using Google Translate to help me read Russian stories and articles. I'd take screen captures of the text, import them as pictures, and highlight the text a paragraph at a time. The highlighted text would appear in a scrolling bar at the top, with another scrolling bar with English translation below.  This feature disappeared completely today. Yandex Translate does a little better, I persuaded it to give me two windows with Russian on the left and English on the right. But Yandex doesn't recognize paragraph breaks or punctuation, so it's just one giant run-on sentence, making dialogue almost impossible to understand.  The amount of vocabulary I acquired with that method is staggering. It was undoubtedly the best learning tool I had at my disposal, and I have many. My level of Russian is not yet good enough to just look up the words I don't know in a dictionary--I still struggle with phrasing. But it *is* good enough that if I can't gist out the Russian, the auto-translation, while not always perfect, gets me up and over that hill.  Does anyone know of a translation app that will either a) recognize punctuation OR b) allow me to select smaller blocks of text, and c) give a side-by-side or scrolling bar translation? I'm just heartbroken that Google has taken away a great learning tool so that the window-lickers won't get confused by their app.  Thanks for reading my wall of text.  Edit: I am using an Apple iPad, and I'm not extremely computer-savvy. üòÖ Perhaps I'm the window-licker here.	1643700788.0	shp8lw	/r/russian/comments/shp8lw/mourning_the_loss_of_a_learning_tool/	Mourning the loss of a learning tool

5s0e2naw	Hello from your neighbor in northwest!    I have been trying to learn Russian for a while on my own using duolingo. The reason for this is I want to learn more about our neighbor and sometime in the future being able to do a longer road trip in Russia and being able to have conversations and find my way around without problems.  Is there anyone from Russia with interest in Norway and trying to learn Norwegian that would be interested in chatting from time to time about life in our countries and the language?   I don't know if that will work, but possibly changing between Russian and Norwegian every now and then. Could be worth a try.  I'm 38M btw, native Norwegian speaker but also use English as my everyday working language.

o15js	Sorry for the rather unclear title. Through randomly coming across content like on "–û —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏" or material on Russian grammar for native speakers, I've noticed that certain grammar topics in Russian can often be framed as answers to questions, which circumvents the need to use clunky and unintuitive Latin-derived grammatical terms.  For example, the cases can be framed as an answer to some declension of "–∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ?" I have even seen the cases presented as a sort of "fill in the blank" (–µ—Å—Ç—ä / –Ω–µ—Ç / –¥–∞—é / –≤–∏–∂—É / –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª–µ–Ω / –¥—É–º–∞—é –æ).  Similarly, the aspect of verbs can be framed as an answer to the question "—á—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å / —á—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?"  I was curious if this could be applied to any other parts of the language. In particular, I'm wondering if there is anything for the partitive case (—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂), although I'm guessing the answer is no, since the question would have to include the "answer" (—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–∞—é?).	1643748014.0	si4zes	/r/russian/comments/si4zes/framing_grammar_topics_as_answers_to_questions_eg/	Framing grammar topics as answers to questions (e.g. –∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ? for cases)

434wy2qh	My teacher tells us that a student of Russian should always use –≤—ã, unless talking to a child or pet, *even if* the native speaker addresses you with —Ç—ã. We're told not to use —Ç—ã until/unless we are *expressly invited* to do so.  I use –≤—ã with all the native speakers that I know in real life. Humans are hierarchical animals, I consider these folks to be above me because they are fluent in a language that I struggle to speak. (So far, they are also all older than me.)  I chat with a lot of Russian speakers online. Some of them use –≤—ã, so that's easy--I just use –≤—ã, too. But some of them use —Ç—ã. And here there seems to be no right answer. If I use —Ç—ã, I might appear disrespectful. If I continue to use –≤—ã, I might appear cold and formal. And if I ask permission to also use —Ç—ã, as my teacher suggested, my language partner either a) is embarrassed, feeling like *they* have been disrespectful, or b) is completely confused, and I don't blame them, because it's something they have an inherent sense of which I lack.  –î—Ä—É–∑—å—è, —á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?	1643363633.0	sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/	What are the real-life (Internet) rules for –≤—ã and —Ç—ã?

ggv7grge	Hi   I'm trying to start taking my Russian learning seriously, but I keep being dissuaded from learning the cases by people.   For example, I want to learn the 6 cases, because i think that this would make it MUCH easier for me to build any sentence. It's easier for me remember the rules of the 3 tenses / 6 cases than to remember EVERY ending to –∫–æ—à–∫–∞, for example. .  I was trying to build the phrase 'I want to give the flowers to my daughter' just as a little exercise for myself, so I started with:   -  'okaaay so I want is —è —Ö–æ—á—É'; - 'flowers is in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its a direct object, and daughter is in –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its the indirect object...'   And then my friend stopped me, told me the answer (which made me a little annoyed), and questioned why I was trying to learn cases when many Russians don't know them. I then asked my OTHER friend and she agreed that it was pointless learning cases     but... this makes no sense to me? Surely its easier to learn the logic of a sentence structure than to learn phrases by rote memorisation?    Am I just being a bad student here, and taking the wrong approach?	1643394175.0	sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/	Beginning to learn Russian - cases :(

ggv7grge	I'm putting this into a separate post, so apologies for spamming the sub.   I was wondering how the cases take priority in a sentence.   For example, if I wanted to say the phrase 'He gives the flowers to the girl', then it's pretty obvious which word takes which case.   But if I wanted to say 'Tom drives his mother's car to his girlfriends house' then it causes a little conflict in my mind.  For example, car is the direct object so the case could be '–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π' but it also belongs to his mother, so it could be —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π too?   Similar to girlfriends house... should house be in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π or –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π?    I'd love to know how cases take precedence in issues like this.    I know that this is beyond me, but if I have the nuances and rules written down somewhere, I can use them in future!	1643395284.0	sexjjs	/r/russian/comments/sexjjs/russian_cases_priority/	Russian cases priority?

For English I have well a ton of movies and series in English, cartoons, some  YouTubers I love,...  But for Russian I have nothing... I don't have a ‚ú®spark ‚ú® to help be both practice and feel motivated.

lctnh	I got some really good feedback from the first round of books that were sold. Here's a re-cap: My parents are trying to clear the large assortment of Russian books they have. Genres would be various from drama, mystical and non-fiction.   I uploaded the pictures of all the books available. I apologize if this isn't ideal but this was the best option I was able to come up with given the amount of books. I took it with my iPhone which should have decent resolution for you to be able to zoom in.  I have a very good shipping account I can use through work, where the costs would be much cheaper than usual for pretty much any country around the globe. I'm located in Canada, Ontario, Vaughan. If you're curious about shipping costs, please feel free to send me a DM so I can get you a quote.  If you're curious about any specific book, please feel free to send me a DM with the photo # that you are referring to. I think maybe if you do a screenshot and put a marker on the book you are looking referring to, that would make it easier for me to find it for you.  If you want me to pick out books based on specific genre or whether you want me to surprise you with the books I choose, that's fine too :) Just send me a DM about it :) I'd be more than glad to help you with any questions you may have!

80sjmd0w	tl;dr: can you say –Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É when you are thirsty for water?  Recently I learned some new words and I'm always very happy when I see a word that I recently learned in an article or a video or something like that. So this happened with the word  –∂–∞–∂–¥–∞—Ç—å, I saw it in a video ([https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN](https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN)).  So this sign doesn't make much sense to me,  is this an actual way of asking for water in this press conference? Seems unlikely, but I'm not sure what else could it be. Maybe he is just continuing the metaphor? Like "I'm thirsty for knowledge, give me the answers"?	1643497576.0	sfucfx	/r/russian/comments/sfucfx/—è_–∂–∞–∂–¥—É_is_this_only_metaphorical_or_can_be_taken/	–Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É - is this only metaphorical or can be taken literally?

d740wwp7	I have been quite confused about the reflexive verbs. I understand where they express some action to be done to oneself (bathing/shaving oneself etc). But I also learned that it can be used in places where there is no direct object.  Like –Ø —É—á—É—Å—å, where you say you are learning but not specifiy what.  My question is, similar to such context, can we make any verb  reflexive? For example, –Ø –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é—Å—å or –Ø –∑–Ω–∞—é—Å—å? "I speak" and "I know" but not specify the object? Or only some verbs can be reflexive and I have to learn them manually?  And if any verb can't be transformed into a reflexive, what do you write when there is no specific object? I mean what would be the "—É—á—É—Å—å" equivalent of "–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é"? "I am speaking" but not specified about what is same as "I am learning (something)" right?  And is there any way to know which verbs can be reflexive (other than the obvious shaving/bathing ones)?  Too many question lol. I'm just confused.	1643501868.0	sfvus1	/r/russian/comments/sfvus1/can_any_verb_be_transformed_into_a_reflexive_verb/	Can any verb be transformed into a reflexive verb?
8a5we7kl	I have been learning Russian since like 7th grade when I started on the Cyrillic alphabet, like about 4 years. Since then, I haven't gotten much farther than simple sentences, verb conjugation, and grammatical gender. I love how the language sounds and want to be fluent in it.

srcf1	So I have a somewhat specific request, I'm looking for songs in English that sound like the songs from –ò—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∞ —Å—É–¥—å–±—ã such as  [–ü–æ —É–ª–∏—Ü–µ –º–æ–µ–π –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –≥–æ–¥](https://youtu.be/Y4IqmeoeS1s) or  [–Ø –°–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª –£ –Ø—Å–µ–Ω—è](https://youtu.be/YkoBjUL-2uE).

e719b	So I used to date this woman studying here.  She's moved back to Russia.  Lately we were talking about getting back together until this weird guy came on the scene.  He's much older than us, he's seemingly involved in pharmacies without having any medical training (i suspect he provides rx drugs to addicts), and he's tried to force himself on her before.  He attempted to blackmail her with videos of her in a compromised state.  She reported him to the police, but for whatever reason she seems to have started speaking to him again.  She's been avoiding me, seemingly drunk or high all the time, which is uncharacteristic of her.  he has tried to contact me before directly, but I blocked him completely.  Today I got a random message through her imessage saying the following:  > –ò–¥–∏ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ –æ—Ç XXX! YYY > –°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—é –∑–∞–¥–µ–ª–∞—é —Ç–µ–±–µ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ–±—É–µ—à—å –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å!  I've put this through online translators (deepl, google, yandex, bing) and can't really make sense of it.  They mostly give a result similar to this:  > Get away from XXX! YYY > I'll close up an article for you if you try to write or type!  I understand the first line, and the "if you try to write or type" i think, but what is "I'll close up an article" mean?  Is this a threat of violence?  Is he threatening to write a police report?  What does it mean?  I'm really unsure what to make of this, other than he doesn't want me talking to her.  It's making me really worry about her safety.  If she doesn't want to be with me, that's fine, but I'm worried about what he's doing to her!  Maybe someone could help me to write this for her sister?  > Hey ZZZ, your sister seems to be involved with XXX again.  He sent me a (threatening) message not to speak to Julia ever again.  She's not answering any calls.  It's OK if she doesn't want to speak to me, I understand.

434wy2qh	For the past three years, I've been using Google Translate to help me read Russian stories and articles. I'd take screen captures of the text, import them as pictures, and highlight the text a paragraph at a time. The highlighted text would appear in a scrolling bar at the top, with another scrolling bar with English translation below.  This feature disappeared completely today. Yandex Translate does a little better, I persuaded it to give me two windows with Russian on the left and English on the right. But Yandex doesn't recognize paragraph breaks or punctuation, so it's just one giant run-on sentence, making dialogue almost impossible to understand.  The amount of vocabulary I acquired with that method is staggering. It was undoubtedly the best learning tool I had at my disposal, and I have many. My level of Russian is not yet good enough to just look up the words I don't know in a dictionary--I still struggle with phrasing. But it *is* good enough that if I can't gist out the Russian, the auto-translation, while not always perfect, gets me up and over that hill.  Does anyone know of a translation app that will either a) recognize punctuation OR b) allow me to select smaller blocks of text, and c) give a side-by-side or scrolling bar translation? I'm just heartbroken that Google has taken away a great learning tool so that the window-lickers won't get confused by their app.  Thanks for reading my wall of text.  Edit: I am using an Apple iPad, and I'm not extremely computer-savvy. üòÖ Perhaps I'm the window-licker here.	1643700788.0	shp8lw	/r/russian/comments/shp8lw/mourning_the_loss_of_a_learning_tool/	Mourning the loss of a learning tool

5s0e2naw	Hello from your neighbor in northwest!    I have been trying to learn Russian for a while on my own using duolingo. The reason for this is I want to learn more about our neighbor and sometime in the future being able to do a longer road trip in Russia and being able to have conversations and find my way around without problems.  Is there anyone from Russia with interest in Norway and trying to learn Norwegian that would be interested in chatting from time to time about life in our countries and the language?   I don't know if that will work, but possibly changing between Russian and Norwegian every now and then. Could be worth a try.  I'm 38M btw, native Norwegian speaker but also use English as my everyday working language.

Through randomly coming across content like on "–û —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏" or material on Russian grammar for native speakers, I've noticed that certain grammar topics in Russian can often be framed as answers to questions, which circumvents the need to use clunky and unintuitive Latin-derived grammatical terms.  For example, the cases can be framed as an answer to some declension of "–∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ?" I have even seen the cases presented as a sort of "fill in the blank" (–µ—Å—Ç—ä / –Ω–µ—Ç / –¥–∞—é / –≤–∏–∂—É / –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª–µ–Ω / –¥—É–º–∞—é –æ).  Similarly, the aspect of verbs can be framed as an answer to the question "—á—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å / —á—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?"  I was curious if this could be applied to any other parts of the language. In particular, I'm wondering if there is anything for the partitive case (—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂), although I'm guessing the answer is no, since the question would have to include the "answer" (—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–∞—é?).	1643748014.0	si4zes	/r/russian/comments/si4zes/framing_grammar_topics_as_answers_to_questions_eg/	Framing grammar topics as answers to questions (e.g. –∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ? for cases)

434wy2qh	My teacher tells us that a student of Russian should always use –≤—ã, unless talking to a child or pet, *even if* the native speaker addresses you with —Ç—ã. We're told not to use —Ç—ã until/unless we are *expressly invited* to do so.  I use –≤—ã with all the native speakers that I know in real life. Humans are hierarchical animals, I consider these folks to be above me because they are fluent in a language that I struggle to speak. (So far, they are also all older than me.)  I chat with a lot of Russian speakers online. Some of them use –≤—ã, so that's easy--I just use –≤—ã, too. But some of them use —Ç—ã. And here there seems to be no right answer. If I use —Ç—ã, I might appear disrespectful. If I continue to use –≤—ã, I might appear cold and formal. And if I ask permission to also use —Ç—ã, as my teacher suggested, my language partner either a) is embarrassed, feeling like *they* have been disrespectful, or b) is completely confused, and I don't blame them, because it's something they have an inherent sense of which I lack.  –î—Ä—É–∑—å—è, —á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–µ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?	1643363633.0	sen8zk	/r/russian/comments/sen8zk/what_are_the_reallife_internet_rules_for_–≤—ã_and_—Ç—ã/	What are the real-life (Internet) rules for –≤—ã and —Ç—ã?

ggv7grge	Hi   I'm trying to start taking my Russian learning seriously, but I keep being dissuaded from learning the cases by people.   For example, I want to learn the 6 cases, because i think that this would make it MUCH easier for me to build any sentence. It's easier for me remember the rules of the 3 tenses / 6 cases than to remember EVERY ending to –∫–æ—à–∫–∞, for example. .  I was trying to build the phrase 'I want to give the flowers to my daughter' just as a little exercise for myself, so I started with:   -  'okaaay so I want is —è —Ö–æ—á—É'; - 'flowers is in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its a direct object, and daughter is in –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π because its the indirect object...'   And then my friend stopped me, told me the answer (which made me a little annoyed), and questioned why I was trying to learn cases when many Russians don't know them. I then asked my OTHER friend and she agreed that it was pointless learning cases     but... this makes no sense to me? Surely its easier to learn the logic of a sentence structure than to learn phrases by rote memorisation?    Am I just being a bad student here, and taking the wrong approach?	1643394175.0	sex4js	/r/russian/comments/sex4js/beginning_to_learn_russian_cases/	Beginning to learn Russian - cases :(

ggv7grge	I'm putting this into a separate post, so apologies for spamming the sub.   I was wondering how the cases take priority in a sentence.   For example, if I wanted to say the phrase 'He gives the flowers to the girl', then it's pretty obvious which word takes which case.   But if I wanted to say 'Tom drives his mother's car to his girlfriends house' then it causes a little conflict in my mind.  For example, car is the direct object so the case could be '–≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π' but it also belongs to his mother, so it could be —Ä–æ–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π too?   Similar to girlfriends house... should house be in –≤–∏–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π or –¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π?    I'd love to know how cases take precedence in issues like this.    I know that this is beyond me, but if I have the nuances and rules written down somewhere, I can use them in future!	1643395284.0	sexjjs	/r/russian/comments/sexjjs/russian_cases_priority/	Russian cases priority?

Usually I do this through wiki articles as a starting point, however I have found minimal Foucault articles on wiki in Russian.

da82jm8r	So I've been learning Russian in university for about a year. It is a language that I willingly chose to learn because I knew nothing about Russia, Russian culture,. and got intrigued. But now I'm facing an issues... I've realized that I was missing ‚ú®the spark ‚ú® of learning Russian.  Like I want to learn Japanese because I love anime, their music, dramas, food, one YouTuber I'm obsessed with,.. I want to learn Korean because I love their reality TV shows, kpop, k dramas ...  For English I have well a ton of movies and series in English, cartoons, some  YouTubers I love,...  But for Russian I have nothing... I don't have a ‚ú®spark ‚ú® to help be both practice and feel motivated. I just don't know enough ( well actually except politics and geography I know nothing) about Russia to find something that I like.

lctnh	I got some really good feedback from the first round of books that were sold. Here's a re-cap: My parents are trying to clear the large assortment of Russian books they have. Genres would be various from drama, mystical and non-fiction.   I uploaded the pictures of all the books available. I apologize if this isn't ideal but this was the best option I was able to come up with given the amount of books. I took it with my iPhone which should have decent resolution for you to be able to zoom in.  I have a very good shipping account I can use through work, where the costs would be much cheaper than usual for pretty much any country around the globe. I'm located in Canada, Ontario, Vaughan. If you're curious about shipping costs, please feel free to send me a DM so I can get you a quote.  If you're curious about any specific book, please feel free to send me a DM with the photo # that you are referring to. I think maybe if you do a screenshot and put a marker on the book you are looking referring to, that would make it easier for me to find it for you.  If you want me to pick out books based on specific genre or whether you want me to surprise you with the books I choose, that's fine too :) Just send me a DM about it :) I'd be more than glad to help you with any questions you may have!

80sjmd0w	tl;dr: can you say –Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É when you are thirsty for water?  Recently I learned some new words and I'm always very happy when I see a word that I recently learned in an article or a video or something like that. So this happened with the word  –∂–∞–∂–¥–∞—Ç—å, I saw it in a video ([https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN](https://ibb.co/BwHGqzN)).  So this sign doesn't make much sense to me,  is this an actual way of asking for water in this press conference? Seems unlikely, but I'm not sure what else could it be. Maybe he is just continuing the metaphor? Like "I'm thirsty for knowledge, give me the answers"?	1643497576.0	sfucfx	/r/russian/comments/sfucfx/—è_–∂–∞–∂–¥—É_is_this_only_metaphorical_or_can_be_taken/	–Ø –∂–∞–∂–¥—É - is this only metaphorical or can be taken literally?

d740wwp7	I have been quite confused about the reflexive verbs. I understand where they express some action to be done to oneself (bathing/shaving oneself etc). But I also learned that it can be used in places where there is no direct object.  Like –Ø —É—á—É—Å—å, where you say you are learning but not specifiy what.  My question is, similar to such context, can we make any verb  reflexive? For example, –Ø –≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é—Å—å or –Ø –∑–Ω–∞—é—Å—å? "I speak" and "I know" but not specify the object? Or only some verbs can be reflexive and I have to learn them manually?  And if any verb can't be transformed into a reflexive, what do you write when there is no specific object? I mean what would be the "—É—á—É—Å—å" equivalent of "–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä—é"? "I am speaking" but not specified about what is same as "I am learning (something)" right?  And is there any way to know which verbs can be reflexive (other than the obvious shaving/bathing ones)?  Too many question lol. I'm just confused.	1643501868.0	sfvus1	/r/russian/comments/sfvus1/can_any_verb_be_transformed_into_a_reflexive_verb/	Can any verb be transformed into a reflexive verb?
8a5we7kl	I have been learning Russian since like 7th grade when I started on the Cyrillic alphabet, like about 4 years. Since then, I haven't gotten much farther than simple sentences, verb conjugation, and grammatical gender. I love how the language sounds and want to be fluent in it.

srcf1	So I have a somewhat specific request, I'm looking for songs in English that sound like the songs from –ò—Ä–æ–Ω–∏–∞ —Å—É–¥—å–±—ã such as  [–ü–æ —É–ª–∏—Ü–µ –º–æ–µ–π –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –≥–æ–¥](https://youtu.be/Y4IqmeoeS1s) or  [–Ø –°–ø—Ä–æ—Å–∏–ª –£ –Ø—Å–µ–Ω—è](https://youtu.be/YkoBjUL-2uE).

e719b	So I used to date this woman studying here.  She's moved back to Russia.  Lately we were talking about getting back together until this weird guy came on the scene.  He's much older than us, he's seemingly involved in pharmacies without having any medical training (i suspect he provides rx drugs to addicts), and he's tried to force himself on her before.  He attempted to blackmail her with videos of her in a compromised state.  She reported him to the police, but for whatever reason she seems to have started speaking to him again.  She's been avoiding me, seemingly drunk or high all the time, which is uncharacteristic of her.  he has tried to contact me before directly, but I blocked him completely.  Today I got a random message through her imessage saying the following:  > –ò–¥–∏ –ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ –æ—Ç XXX! YYY > –°—Ç–∞—Ç—å—é –∑–∞–¥–µ–ª–∞—é —Ç–µ–±–µ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –ø–æ–ø—Ä–æ–±—É–µ—à—å –Ω–∞–ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–±—Ä–∞—Ç—å!  I've put this through online translators (deepl, google, yandex, bing) and can't really make sense of it.  They mostly give a result similar to this:  > Get away from XXX! YYY > I'll close up an article for you if you try to write or type!  I understand the first line, and the "if you try to write or type" i think, but what is "I'll close up an article" mean?  Is this a threat of violence?  Is he threatening to write a police report?  What does it mean?  I'm really unsure what to make of this, other than he doesn't want me talking to her.  It's making me really worry about her safety.  If she doesn't want to be with me, that's fine, but I'm worried about what he's doing to her!  Maybe someone could help me to write this for her sister?  > Hey ZZZ, your sister seems to be involved with XXX again.  He sent me a (threatening) message not to speak to Julia ever again.  She's not answering any calls.  It's OK if she doesn't want to speak to me, I understand.

434wy2qh	For the past three years, I've been using Google Translate to help me read Russian stories and articles. I'd take screen captures of the text, import them as pictures, and highlight the text a paragraph at a time. The highlighted text would appear in a scrolling bar at the top, with another scrolling bar with English translation below.  This feature disappeared completely today. Yandex Translate does a little better, I persuaded it to give me two windows with Russian on the left and English on the right. But Yandex doesn't recognize paragraph breaks or punctuation, so it's just one giant run-on sentence, making dialogue almost impossible to understand.  The amount of vocabulary I acquired with that method is staggering. It was undoubtedly the best learning tool I had at my disposal, and I have many. My level of Russian is not yet good enough to just look up the words I don't know in a dictionary--I still struggle with phrasing. But it *is* good enough that if I can't gist out the Russian, the auto-translation, while not always perfect, gets me up and over that hill.  Does anyone know of a translation app that will either a) recognize punctuation OR b) allow me to select smaller blocks of text, and c) give a side-by-side or scrolling bar translation? I'm just heartbroken that Google has taken away a great learning tool so that the window-lickers won't get confused by their app.  Thanks for reading my wall of text.  Edit: I am using an Apple iPad, and I'm not extremely computer-savvy. üòÖ Perhaps I'm the window-licker here.	1643700788.0	shp8lw	/r/russian/comments/shp8lw/mourning_the_loss_of_a_learning_tool/	Mourning the loss of a learning tool

5s0e2naw	Hello from your neighbor in northwest!    I have been trying to learn Russian for a while on my own using duolingo. The reason for this is I want to learn more about our neighbor and sometime in the future being able to do a longer road trip in Russia and being able to have conversations and find my way around without problems.  Is there anyone from Russia with interest in Norway and trying to learn Norwegian that would be interested in chatting from time to time about life in our countries and the language?   I don't know if that will work, but possibly changing between Russian and Norwegian every now and then. Could be worth a try.  I'm 38M btw, native Norwegian speaker but also use English as my everyday working language.

Through randomly coming across content like on "–û —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º –ø–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏" or material on Russian grammar for native speakers, I've noticed that certain grammar topics in Russian can often be framed as answers to questions, which circumvents the need to use clunky and unintuitive Latin-derived grammatical terms.  For example, the cases can be framed as an answer to some declension of "–∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ?" I have even seen the cases presented as a sort of "fill in the blank" (–µ—Å—Ç—ä / –Ω–µ—Ç / –¥–∞—é / –≤–∏–∂—É / –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª–µ–Ω / –¥—É–º–∞—é –æ).  Similarly, the aspect of verbs can be framed as an answer to the question "—á—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å / —á—Ç–æ —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å?"  I was curious if this could be applied to any other parts of the language. In particular, I'm wondering if there is anything for the partitive case (—á–∞—Å—Ç–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –ø–∞–¥–µ–∂), although I'm guessing the answer is no, since the question would have to include the "answer" (—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–∞—é?).	1643748014.0	si4zes	/r/russian/comments/si4zes/framing_grammar_topics_as_answers_to_questions_eg/	Framing grammar topics as answers to questions (e.g. –∫—Ç–æ/—á—Ç–æ? for cases)

The course is only a year long and I have a few months left before the final test, but my listening skills are awful, and they don't seem to be improving. (For anyone that knows how DLPT scoring works, my listening is probably about a 1+ at best)  When I listen, I usually don't recognize most words and oftentimes the words I do recognize make so little sense with such a lack of context that they don't help me at all. I'm not sure what to do to drastically improve my listening. I grind vocab like crazy and get plenty of exposure to authentic audio, but I nothing changes.

tg251	Hello  I'm using langauge reactor to watch Youtube with spoken russian while having both the english and russian subtitles on screen.  I've noticed that the characters are not pronoucing certain words as I would expect them too.  For instance in [this part](https://youtu.be/q9OIT7W24V8?t=380) the guy says "–¢—ã —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∏–π?", which I thought would end with a long "ee" sound, like "—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π".  The subtitles are human translated by russian speakers, so I assume they are using the correct conjunctions, but I don't quite know why there are quite a few words that sound completely different to how they are written.

d2mj6	I'm trying to understand the Russian words for "flower" and "colour" and how they form plurals, and I'm utterly confused!  According to [Wiktionary](https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82), —Ü–≤–µ—Ç (pl. —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∞ÃÅ) is "colour", and —Ü–≤–µ—Ç (pl. —Ü–≤–µÃÅ—Ç—ã) is "flower".  But also according to [Wiktionary](https://ru.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D1%86%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BA), —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–æÃÅ–∫ (pl. —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∫–∏ÃÅ) is "flower" as in "—Ü–≤–µ—Ç—É—â–∞—è —á–∞—Å—Ç—å —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è", and —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–æÃÅ–∫ (pl. —Ü–≤–µ—Ç—ãÃÅ) is "flower" as in "—Ü–≤–µ—Ç—É—â–µ–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ".  So, in short, "flowers" are —Ü–≤–µÃÅ—Ç—ã, —Ü–≤–µ—Ç—ãÃÅ and —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–∫–∏ÃÅ; and —Ü–≤–µ—Ç is "colour" and "flower", but "flower" is also —Ü–≤–µ—Ç–æÃÅ–∫.

9ewesa30	Hello! To elaborate on the title, I'm trying to look for programs for beginner Russian programs domestic to the U.S. I am currently a cc student applying to transfer for this fall, and I really want to have one of my majors be in this language. However, my cc doesn't offer any courses in Russian and my own self-studying has only gotten me as far as the Cyrillic script and some elementary vocabulary/phrases. Because I don't want to be a year behind when I transfer, I really want to get a leg up this summer.   Price is definitely a factor for me as I don't want to wipe out my savings but I'd still prefer an in-person program. I'm already applying to Bryn Mawr's Language Institute but don't know how generous their financial aid would be. To give more context, even if I get the maximum aid for Middlebury's Language School it would still be too expensive for me so I won't be applying there. If it helps, I have relations that can provide housing in L.A., Chicago, and NYC (and possibly D.C.) so that should lower residency costs. Any recommendations?	1643853202.0	sj6mua	/r/russian/comments/sj6mua/russian_summer_immersion_programs/	Russian Summer Immersion Programs?

d94es8o7	Hello. I am writing a story that features a Russian woman named Arina. A close friend would call her by the diminutive form of her name, and I had decided on Rinka after some search. Then I came upon a suggestion that a diminutive with a -ka suffix is pejorative and does not make for an affectionate pet name. I like the sound of Rinka, but I am more interested in not getting it wrong.  Would Rinka be an acceptable, tender alternative name for Arina, when used by a close friend or a loved one?

h4wlj	I like words when you literally translate them into English, it sounds kinda funny. Like how turtle in German is shield-toad. And glove in German is hand-shoe. Here's some of my favourites    English - Russian - literal translation   Scarecrow - –ø—É–≥–∞–ª–æ - The Frightener  Ink - —á–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–ª–æ - The Blackener  Soap - –º—ã–ª–æ - The Washer  Fridge - —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ - The cold-ing thing  Alarm clock - –±—É–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ - The wake-up-ing thing  Rhino - –Ω–æ—Å–æ—Ä–æ–≥ - The nose is a horn   Platypus - —É—Ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ—Å - Ducknose   Hippo - –±–µ–≥–µ–º–æ—Ç - Giant Monster   Porcupine - –¥–∏–∫–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑ - This thing looks wild   Cannibal - –ª—é–¥–æ–µ–¥ - The eater of people   Chiropractor - –∫–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ø—Ä–∞–≤ - The bone corrector   I mean the last 2 are literally what they are but it still seems funny for some reason, that we have weird words for these things, and they just literally say what they do    I think mannequin was something like –Ω–µ—á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ not-a-person but I'm not sure about that one    What words are your guys' favourites?	1643934828.0	sjz9wj	/r/russian/comments/sjz9wj/favourite_words/	Favourite words?

t842j	Does anyone know what the official grammatical term is for sentences that use —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ type conjunctions?  For example: –Ø –¥—É–º–∞–ª –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª. I was thinking about what you did.   Basically, it‚Äôs where in English you have a single word (i.e. what) that functions as an object for both clauses, whereas in Russian you need to create an object pair to correctly address the grammatical case required by each clause. I‚Äôve seen this referred to as a T-K construction online, but I don‚Äôt think this is the formal term for it.  I feel like this type of construction is very important for Russian sentence formation but is rarely explicitly taught in grammar lessons.	1643946565.0	sk3e14	/r/russian/comments/sk3e14/—Ç–æ_—á—Ç–æ_sentences_constructions/	–¢–æ, —á—Ç–æ sentences constructions

d94es8o7	Hello. I am writing a story that features a Russian woman named Arina. A close friend would call her by the diminutive form of her name, and I had decided on Rinka after some search. Then I came upon a suggestion that a diminutive with a -ka suffix is pejorative and does not make for an affectionate pet name. I like the sound of Rinka, but I am more interested in not getting it wrong.  Would Rinka be an acceptable, tender alternative name for Arina, when used by a close friend or a loved one?

I absolutely cannot get a proper understanding of the different use between "—á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ" I have some general idea but often find myself in situations where I cannot figure out which one to use, any help would be greatly appreciated and don't be afraid to go in depth :)  PS: I also speak French and Spanish fluently so feel free to make comparisons with those languages if they are more appropriate from an explanatory standpoint.	1643899703.0	sjl1kc	/r/russian/comments/sjl1kc/—á—Ç–æ–±—ã_–∏–ª–∏_–ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É_—á—Ç–æ/	–ß—Ç–æ–±—ã –∏–ª–∏ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ

s7c0i	Hello, I‚Äôm from the States and only the past 5 years have come to love the Russian culture, history, the language and my favorite.. the food. But it‚Äôs hard for me to connect to Russian people and I think it‚Äôs because of my lack of knowledge when it comes to the language.

h4wlj	I like words when you literally translate them into English, it sounds kinda funny. Like how turtle in German is shield-toad. And glove in German is hand-shoe. Here's some of my favourites    English - Russian - literal translation   Scarecrow - –ø—É–≥–∞–ª–æ - The Frightener  Ink - —á–µ—Ä–Ω–∏–ª–æ - The Blackener  Soap - –º—ã–ª–æ - The Washer  Fridge - —Ö–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ - The cold-ing thing  Alarm clock - –±—É–¥–∏–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫ - The wake-up-ing thing  Rhino - –Ω–æ—Å–æ—Ä–æ–≥ - The nose is a horn   Platypus - —É—Ç–∫–æ–Ω–æ—Å - Ducknose   Hippo - –±–µ–≥–µ–º–æ—Ç - Giant Monster   Porcupine - –¥–∏–∫–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑ - This thing looks wild   Cannibal - –ª—é–¥–æ–µ–¥ - The eater of people   Chiropractor - –∫–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ø—Ä–∞–≤ - The bone corrector   I mean the last 2 are literally what they are but it still seems funny for some reason, that we have weird words for these things, and they just literally say what they do    I think mannequin was something like –Ω–µ—á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫ not-a-person but I'm not sure about that one    What words are your guys' favourites?	1643934828.0	sjz9wj	/r/russian/comments/sjz9wj/favourite_words/	Favourite words?

t842j	Does anyone know what the official grammatical term is for sentences that use —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ type conjunctions?  For example: –Ø –¥—É–º–∞–ª –æ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ —Ç—ã —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞–ª. I was thinking about what you did.   Basically, it‚Äôs where in English you have a single word (i.e. what) that functions as an object for both clauses, whereas in Russian you need to create an object pair to correctly address the grammatical case required by each clause. I‚Äôve seen this referred to as a T-K construction online, but I don‚Äôt think this is the formal term for it.  I feel like this type of construction is very important for Russian sentence formation but is rarely explicitly taught in grammar lessons.	1643946565.0	sk3e14	/r/russian/comments/sk3e14/—Ç–æ_—á—Ç–æ_sentences_constructions/	–¢–æ, —á—Ç–æ sentences constructions

From my little Russian understanding this word can be used to refer to someone special to you that maybe is not your family member but is important to you.  The only thing is that I wanted to know, could this word "–†–æ–¥–Ω–æ–π" could be interpreted as him being his boyfriend? Since she has it saved like this? Or it doesn't share that meaning?

I like her show a lot.  But I would like a "Russian history from start to now" types of a show. I don't mind it being super long cause I want as thorough view on Russian as possible. In amateurish kind of way of course.

7ykzvgcs	has anyone used this? is it any good? i've been following Real Russian Club on youtube and she seems pretty decent. she did an episode featuring some textbooks, but it's hard to tell if the books are a good fit (and to know the motivations behind certain selections) without actually seeing them. while it's an attractive book, i'm wondering if that's all it is rather than having truly high-quality content. i'm a beginner but i enjoy grammar and can have a more serious approach to learning languages, so i don't mind denser or more structured content. the more i can understand the language, the better. i do not have the ability to use newer materials like cd roms, apps, and the like, so books without those extras are ok too. sorry if this sounds picky or demanding. i'm just looking to get the most bang for my buck and maximize what i can learn! what are your personal recommendations? thank you!	1644108509.0	slln0r	/r/russian/comments/slln0r/tochkaru_textbook/	tochka.ru textbook?

d0hgxc3d	Given that many Russian verbs have, at least from my foreigner's point of view, rather unpredictable variations between the perfective and imperfective forms I assume that the situation must occur where even a native speaker would ignore, forget or be unsure what the aspectual counterpart of an uncommon verb is.  If so, are there tricks that can be used to use an imperfective form perfectively and vice-versa?  Obviously my question is partly driven by simple curiosity, but I also want to know if I could garner some tricks I can use when this situation occurs which, my Russian being very weak, is not uncommon...	1644147689.0	slury7	/r/russian/comments/slury7/do_natives_sometimes_ignore_the_perfective_or/	Do natives sometimes ignore the perfective or imperfective counterpart to a verb they know and how do they work around it?

Instead of doing a course where I learn words like "House" or "he/she" I like to learn usable phrases like "Hey pass me the sugar" or "That's a beautiful scraf you've got there!" learning languages that way encourages me to study cause I can use those phrases. But I can't use "House" or "He/she" in day to day interactions.

jche4npt	Hi everyone, I‚Äôm currently in the process of learning Russian and I‚Äôm planning to create a blog where I document my progress and provide resources for other language learners. I‚Äôve been inspired by all the wonderful progress posts on Reddit, from users such as¬†[u/NoLoadLeft](https://www.reddit.com/u/NoLoadLeft/)¬†,¬†[u/Jazzy-99](https://www.reddit.com/u/Jazzy-99/) [u/DJ\_Ddawg](https://www.reddit.com/u/DJ_Ddawg/)  Reading through progress posts has been really motivating for me, so I would like to create something similar for the community. My question to you is, what aspects of the journey would you most like to know about? What sort of statistics would you like me to collect and present? How often would you like to be updated on my progress? What is it about certain ‚Äòprogress update‚Äô posts that you find most interesting and helpful? Is there any topic you would especially like me to talk about (perhaps the first 50 hours of learning, or methods of data collection etc.) Please let me know your suggestions, I‚Äôm really planning to make a in depth scientific study/ one person account of the language learning process.   As a side note, My BLOG is currently up and running, and I have made my first post with a detailed list of resources for immersion based learners. It includes links to helpful YouTube channels and videos, online blogs and websites, informative Reddit accounts and individual Reddit language learning progress reports. I'm still in the process of completing this list, so any feedback would be appreciated! You can visit the site here:  [https://road-to-rossiiu.ghost.io/](https://road-to-rossiiu.ghost.io/)   From the home screen you can click on the article titled 'Resources for Immersion'.  In the future I will be posting Russian progress updates at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years. I'll also be creating a post with information specific to Russian learners. I'm aware of how difficult it can be for lots of beginners to find quality content when they are first starting out.   Until then, I hope you find the information provided useful.
