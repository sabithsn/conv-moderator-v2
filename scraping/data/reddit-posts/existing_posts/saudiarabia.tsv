fzmzolb1	How fair is it that some people get to go on the hajj multiple times in their lives? Muslims believe that everyone should go on the hajj just once in their lives (assuming they can afford it & have the health to do so), so shouldn't the policies be engineered to let the most number of Muslims get to do the hajj just once and check that box off on their bucket list?	1642490772.0	s6rqz5	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s6rqz5/since_there_are_roughly_2_billion_muslims/	Since there are roughly 2 billion Muslims worldwide and only 2 million of them (or 0.1%) get to go on hajj annually, why doesn't the Saudi government limit pilgrimages to once a lifetime?

bvikcqhp	I honestly didn't know this was a thing, my older colleague used stc for last 30 years. 3 years ago he got a better postpaid offer at Zain and he just transferred his number to Zain. (Same number different carrier). Right now the Zain network barely has any signal in his work site, so he decided to get stc back. I accompanied him to the stc store and upon telling his number they claimed his number is blacklisted since he left stc. Now if he would like to take any packages he needs to take a new number.

6ivo4ga	Hello i have moved to al nahda district in jeddah recently in an area of the district that doesn't have fiber and i cannot install dsl because of a long story that I don't want to get into, so i need a good alternative either 4g or 5g.  I really don't care about the speed i can live with 3 or 4mb download and whatever upload it doesn't matter to me the important thing is ping or latency i can play games on (mainly only league of legends) i already know ping is way better on wired connection (fiber/dsl) but i don't have access to either right now so i want the second best thing i could get.  What kind of router should i get? Who is the best isp for 4g and 5g?

fzmp7g08	AsSalamu Alaikum,  I am new to Saudi and Arab culture in general, and as I’m moving to the capital Riyadh in a few weeks for work, I would like to know of some customs to be mindful of.  I know we are to be very careful when engaging with women, but what are the limits.  If I encounter a woman at a marketplace or even work as a colleague, how shall my interactions be? Can I smile, or should I be strictly business? I know shaking hands is a big no. Is small talk acceptable??  And a little more about my position, I will be teaching English at a number of schools, boys primary aged and girls primary aged. Do I have to treat the girls different than the boys?  I hope you all can help me with this, or to direct me to centers in Saudi that help accustom foreigners.

Her family are mostly over there and this step is important in validating our relationship towards them.  I'm looking for resources as to what will be required in this process, and what the best way is to go about it.

11pzyg	Hi guys, argentinean here.  With my father we're planning to go to the FIFA WC 2022 held in Qatar. For money reasons, we're looking to travel to Dammam first and rent a car there. The problem is the hotel capacity at Doha is/will be full during those days, so we probably stay at Saudi Arabia (and make some tourism if we can) and travel only for the games to Doha.  For what I understand, Dammam looks REALLY nice as a tourist city, and could be really cool to be there a couple of days, the problems is that from Dammam to Doha is a quite long trip for the 3 matches of the group stages.  Our other option is Al Hofuf, but we really don't know much about it, only that is much closer to the Qatar border.  Is it a safe place to be? or should we stick only to Dammam?  It's our first time in Middle east, so I would love some other suggestions (like places, or things I should be aware of). For what I understand the norm is 0 alcohol, so that's out question, but I don't know much about anything else.  Thanks in advance and looking forward to know more about your country and culture.	1642982671.0	sb7y5s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb7y5s/should_i_stay_at_al_hofuf_or_dammam_during_the/	Should I stay at Al Hofuf or Dammam during the Qatar FIFA WC 2022 + rent a car to travel to the games?

Anyway, I managed to finally find an issue with Riyadh (I mean no city is perfect), I couldn't find a gym with cycling classes for men, it seems they only offer it for females (as if your manlihood will be damaged by cycling, alpha males do cycle for the record).   Does anyone know if I'm mistaken and we do actually have men cycling gym?

cgrqvt1h	I live in a small apartment in Ash Sharafiyah (locally known as Nasriyah) neighborhood, Riyadh.  Our building is attached to the building immediately next to us, and the walls of our apartments do not insulate sound very well at all.  For some reason, our neighbors in the building next to us decide every few months to drill holes into their walls for 2 hours straight around midnight. Our entire building shakes whenever they do this and it sounds like the drilling is happening immediately next to us.  **Is this normal behavior?** I've only been in Riyadh a few years and it boggles my mind how these people think it is acceptable to drill into walls at midnight when people are asleep and have work to go to tomorrow morning.	1643144519.0	scnu96	/r/saudiarabia/comments/scnu96/neighbors_drilling_into_walls_at_midnight/	Neighbors Drilling into Walls at Midnight!!!
wg1pz	Hello everyone!   I was hoping someone more car saavy could answer this question for me.   I’m looking at used Toyota Tacomas from the UAE. Do you guys think a car with North American specs could handle the heat and dust here? I know it’s a Toyota so it’s basically bulletproof, but I’d like someone with a bit more automotive knowledge to weigh in on this.   I know that I would still be paying import fees + tax. I strictly want to know if the car will be reliable as I would ideally like to keep the car for the next 5-10 years.

zjq8l	Hi all, is there any way to request Fibre internet from any company in my area?   i've been waiting for OVER 10 YEARS NOW and STILL we got no Fibre coverage.  i did call them to see but you know they gave me the "i can't help you with that sorry bye" solution.   seems like they have no plans at all to bother and help those in need.   Not all people use internet only for social media...  they offered me 5G which is fine but i do not need because im looking for a stable and low letancy internet for gaming/streaming/downloading big files (3D enviroments, character files) etc..  otherwise im living now with lag spikes between 70-900 and never stable.  I've been in and out of Saudi studying outside for the past 5 years, and every time i come back and call them i get the same answer.  Of course with the raise of online working now i can't imagine how hard that will be when i start working (soon).  I know im not the only one struggling with this issue so if anyone can give any solution or someone to go to so they can install fibers in uncovered areas or something.     TLDR: STC haven't installed Fiber in some areas for years now and seems like they have no plans to, looking for solutions.	1643180337.0	sczuwm	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sczuwm/stc_fibre_coverage_do_they_plan_to_at_all/	STC Fibre Coverage...

I really don't care about the speed i can live with 3 or 4mb download and whatever upload it doesn't matter to me the important thing is ping or latency i can play games on (mainly only league of legends) i already know ping is way better on wired connection (fiber/dsl) but i don't have access to either right now so i want the second best thing i could get.

I really don’t mind fast driving and I get it that you want to be fast but why: - do people drive up so close that there are just a few meters left at 100 km/h? - flash to make way when there are clearly hundreds of cars in front of me - squeeze into the most tiny space you might leave (aka security distance)?  Oh and: why are the biggest idiots the ones with a black Dodge Challenger with all tinted windows?

11pzyg	Hi guys, argentinean here.  With my father we're planning to go to the FIFA WC 2022 held in Qatar. For money reasons, we're looking to travel to Dammam first and rent a car there. The problem is the hotel capacity at Doha is/will be full during those days, so we probably stay at Saudi Arabia (and make some tourism if we can) and travel only for the games to Doha.  For what I understand, Dammam looks REALLY nice as a tourist city, and could be really cool to be there a couple of days, the problems is that from Dammam to Doha is a quite long trip for the 3 matches of the group stages.  Our other option is Al Hofuf, but we really don't know much about it, only that is much closer to the Qatar border.  Is it a safe place to be? or should we stick only to Dammam?  It's our first time in Middle east, so I would love some other suggestions (like places, or things I should be aware of). For what I understand the norm is 0 alcohol, so that's out question, but I don't know much about anything else.  Thanks in advance and looking forward to know more about your country and culture.	1642982671.0	sb7y5s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb7y5s/should_i_stay_at_al_hofuf_or_dammam_during_the/	Should I stay at Al Hofuf or Dammam during the Qatar FIFA WC 2022 + rent a car to travel to the games?

6ivo4ga	Hello i have moved to al nahda district in jeddah recently in an area of the district that doesn't have fiber and i cannot install dsl because of a long story that I don't want to get into, so i need a good alternative either 4g or 5g.  I really don't care about the speed i can live with 3 or 4mb download and whatever upload it doesn't matter to me the important thing is ping or latency i can play games on (mainly only league of legends) i already know ping is way better on wired connection (fiber/dsl) but i don't have access to either right now so i want the second best thing i could get.  What kind of router should i get? Who is the best isp for 4g and 5g? I have a lot of questions so if there is anyone knowledgeable about wifi and internet solutions in jeddah please let me know	1642807639.0	s9o4bf	/r/saudiarabia/comments/s9o4bf/help_with_internet_solution/	Help with internet solution

fzmp7g08	AsSalamu Alaikum,  I am new to Saudi and Arab culture in general, and as I’m moving to the capital Riyadh in a few weeks for work, I would like to know of some customs to be mindful of.  I know we are to be very careful when engaging with women, but what are the limits.  If I encounter a woman at a marketplace or even work as a colleague, how shall my interactions be? Can I smile, or should I be strictly business? I know shaking hands is a big no. Is small talk acceptable??  And a little more about my position, I will be teaching English at a number of schools, boys primary aged and girls primary aged. Do I have to treat the girls different than the boys?  I hope you all can help me with this, or to direct me to centers in Saudi that help accustom foreigners.

11pzyg	Hi guys, argentinean here.  With my father we're planning to go to the FIFA WC 2022 held in Qatar. For money reasons, we're looking to travel to Dammam first and rent a car there. The problem is the hotel capacity at Doha is/will be full during those days, so we probably stay at Saudi Arabia (and make some tourism if we can) and travel only for the games to Doha.  For what I understand, Dammam looks REALLY nice as a tourist city, and could be really cool to be there a couple of days, the problems is that from Dammam to Doha is a quite long trip for the 3 matches of the group stages.  Our other option is Al Hofuf, but we really don't know much about it, only that is much closer to the Qatar border.  Is it a safe place to be? or should we stick only to Dammam?  It's our first time in Middle east, so I would love some other suggestions (like places, or things I should be aware of). For what I understand the norm is 0 alcohol, so that's out question, but I don't know much about anything else.  Thanks in advance and looking forward to know more about your country and culture.	1642982671.0	sb7y5s	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sb7y5s/should_i_stay_at_al_hofuf_or_dammam_during_the/	Should I stay at Al Hofuf or Dammam during the Qatar FIFA WC 2022 + rent a car to travel to the games?

Should we still go for the booster dose or cancel our appointments for the time being?  Update: really gratefull for the help from everyone. JazakAllah. We cancelled our appointments and will hopefully be tested today	1643098841.0	sc8u8m	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sc8u8m/booster_dose_for_someone_with_corona/	Booster dose for someone with corona(?)

So far it’s been okay and I’ve been able to hike to most places, but now that I’m in Tabuk, I’d like to go off roading in the desert.

cgrqvt1h	I live in a small apartment in Ash Sharafiyah (locally known as Nasriyah) neighborhood, Riyadh.  Our building is attached to the building immediately next to us, and the walls of our apartments do not insulate sound very well at all.  For some reason, our neighbors in the building next to us decide every few months to drill holes into their walls for 2 hours straight around midnight. Our entire building shakes whenever they do this and it sounds like the drilling is happening immediately next to us.  **Is this normal behavior?** I've only been in Riyadh a few years and it boggles my mind how these people think it is acceptable to drill into walls at midnight when people are asleep and have work to go to tomorrow morning.	1643144519.0	scnu96	/r/saudiarabia/comments/scnu96/neighbors_drilling_into_walls_at_midnight/	Neighbors Drilling into Walls at Midnight!!!
wg1pz	Hello everyone!   I was hoping someone more car saavy could answer this question for me.   I’m looking at used Toyota Tacomas from the UAE. Do you guys think a car with North American specs could handle the heat and dust here? I know it’s a Toyota so it’s basically bulletproof, but I’d like someone with a bit more automotive knowledge to weigh in on this.   I know that I would still be paying import fees + tax. I strictly want to know if the car will be reliable as I would ideally like to keep the car for the next 5-10 years.

zjq8l	Hi all, is there any way to request Fibre internet from any company in my area?   i've been waiting for OVER 10 YEARS NOW and STILL we got no Fibre coverage.  i did call them to see but you know they gave me the "i can't help you with that sorry bye" solution.   seems like they have no plans at all to bother and help those in need.   Not all people use internet only for social media...  they offered me 5G which is fine but i do not need because im looking for a stable and low letancy internet for gaming/streaming/downloading big files (3D enviroments, character files) etc..  otherwise im living now with lag spikes between 70-900 and never stable.  I've been in and out of Saudi studying outside for the past 5 years, and every time i come back and call them i get the same answer.  Of course with the raise of online working now i can't imagine how hard that will be when i start working (soon).  I know im not the only one struggling with this issue so if anyone can give any solution or someone to go to so they can install fibers in uncovered areas or something.     TLDR: STC haven't installed Fiber in some areas for years now and seems like they have no plans to, looking for solutions.	1643180337.0	sczuwm	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sczuwm/stc_fibre_coverage_do_they_plan_to_at_all/	STC Fibre Coverage...

npqqe	Hi All  I'm visiting Medina next week for a few days on business from San Francisco. First time visiting Saudi Arabia, so I'm looking forward to this.  I wanted to ask a few questions for my planning purposes  1. What are the transportation options to the hotel? (the sponsor is booking our hotels, but I haven't receive that information yet). Is there Uber or Lyft service, or is taxi the preferred way to go to the hotel (and around in general)? 2. Will I be able to get around town with English?  3. I have one free day to tour (not a lot of time unfortunately). What must see places or things should I go to or try? 4. For those of you who have taken a PCR test, what testing facilities have a under 24 hour turnaround? I need something under a day in order to get back on a plane to San Francisco. I think this is the one that stresses me out the most.  Thank you everyone in advance for your answers.

4k6j6iit	 Disclaimer:   I am an idiot. Take my opinion with Himalayan salt, and maybe green peppers. Scratch that, tomato is better. I know nothing and now I am talking out of my ass. The comments will prove that, as always. Am I doing this for karma and to feel better because I got validated by others for something even a kid knows? You bet your ass I am.     The subject starts here:    .  We are the best country in the world, for now. Whether you disagree with that or not, we are among the best. We are better off than most countries. However that might change in future. No, it will change. Unless we do something about it.   How can we guarantee that we shall forever be a good country?    Be good.       Do what you can to be good. When you are good, your family and friends become in a better position. When your family and friends become slightly better because of you , they make you better in the same way. Your neighborhood becomes better. Your city becomes better. Your district becomes better. Then the whole country becomes better. All because you took care of yourself. A smile to a stranger moves mountains.    Never neglect what you can do. No matter how small and insignificant your actions are. Never underestimate anything or anyone. Never be satisfied with what you have. Always be hungry for a better future. If you can be better, then do it. Comfort zone is THE evil.    Our greatest enemy is only yourself.   This massage is for me first before anyone else, then it is for everyone. I am sure many will think this is something really well known and they apply it. But for some, like me, we do not realize it.     This massage is for some people.

6p3vej3o	Female Asian expat. I’m currently in a mall at the foodcourt alone. And I swear I’m scared to move. I was eating and a group of teenage boys walked past me and laughed. Okay, I don’t mind. But they turned around, walked to my table, shoved their faces on me (I was eating at the table) and said funny sounds like they were imitating chinese or whatever. I sat there in horror and stared at them. They eventually left laughing.   I always thought there were people who had racial prejudice and does stuff like they will cut me off due to me being asian. But this is the first time I felt I was attacked. I was minding my own f*cking business.  I don’t understand why does this happen. I lived in Saudi for 5 years and I always thought it was generally safe. I’m new in Riyadh (only 4months) and this is the first time this happened to me. I’m also used to being alone. But now, idk.

551ifhi9	I'm doing some research and am very interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom. I couldn't find results in English easily and in Arabic searching is not my strong point (I read Arabic perfectly fine but writing is not a strength).  I'm interested to learn how people, the banking system and loans are handled by SAMA? Can a bank confirm a loan or would they need SAMA agreement first?  In the west and where I'm from there's interest. Interest is not shariah compliant so banks tend to use a bit of a different loan model. How does this affect the borrower? Are usually credit payments payment on occasion or should be closed by full at of each month (Loan plus fee summed and divided over the collateral time)?   If a borrower didn't pay the loan at full, what usually tends to happen?   If you notice my questions are very high level and as open question. Any information that can further make me understand is highly appreciated.    Also it's a but different than below, but I'd also like to know how people handle their finances (might be better for a different post)  If you have books in arabic or english about monetary policy you recommend for the Kingdom, I'd love to know of and read them.	1643576700.0	sgixg1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sgixg1/interested_to_learn_more_about_the_monetary/	Interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom

933g795b	 Hello, I’m a male from the US and I was wondering what good jobs someone from the US can find? I have over 5 years customer service experience and just about 3 years sales experience as well. Would there be a chance of me getting a solid job? If so where would I be able to look?  I’d like to live somewhere between Jeddah and yanbu. To go more into depth. I have worked in a serious customer service job for a few years now and have dealt with all types of people. Like I said I also had sales experience for a few years. I’m very tech savvy as I’m currently studying computers in school (although I’m not finished.)  Does anybody have any suggestions on where I can make a livable wage ?  Where to look for jobs ? Etc ?

4k6j6iit	Note: i dont know myself and i am still figuring it out.  The most powerful and dangerous creature is one who knows themselves. Whether they are evil or good.  There are things that you think are troubling you because of A reason but in reality, the root reason is the real reason.  An example: i failed at physics exam. The reason i didnt study. Why i didn't study? Because i was distracted by other stuff. Why was i busy doing things other than study? I am trying to avoid a proplem. Perhaps i did a bad thing or bad things. I have to solve them but didn't. Instead i avoided them and ran away from them. So i need a distraction to make not think of my issues. I didn't want to face myself or confront my issues. Because of that i am not happy. This leads to lower performance in another functions and duty. I didnt want to face and understand myself because then i will admit i did wrong. And if i did something wrong I have to SOLVE it. You think your problems are great. You think that you ahve to work really hard to fix them in order to achieve peace of mind. But i promise you once you understand yourself and understand what really you are and what are your issues, and to know what to do to fix them, you will be happy. I suffered from depression for so so so long. I was avoiding myself and responsibilities. Necer think it is too late.   What happened have happened. Let it go. Get over it. Half the people dont care about you, and the other half are glad it is you.  What you have to do now is to look to the future. Set a goal and step by step try to do it.  Never neglect what you can do.  Edit: this wont solve anything. But at least it is a step towards self improvement. No one will help you. The only person that can help you is yourself. What else you can do? Just give up? I refuse belive that. Each of us is great. We are all the same and born from same mother. You have to believe. Everyday say to yourself that it is possible to be better.  Say it with me  IT IS POSSIBLE	1643692006.0	shmr1v	/r/saudiarabia/comments/shmr1v/an_advice_know_yourself/	An advice: Know yourself

gedomrls	ممكن مو المكان المناسب لكن والله ما اعرف ايش اسوي، انا توظفت الحمدلله بعد عناء طويل بالبحث وبحكم ان الوظيفة تتطلب وجود سيارة لان بيكون عندي زيارات لأماكن متعددة قمت اتناقش مع الوالدة وش السواة لأن ما عندنا السيولة الكافية ان نشتري سيارة.  قلت لها ليش ما الوالد يشتري سيارة جديدة وانا اقسطها له بمساعدة اخوي واخذ سيارته القديمة، وقتها امي جلست معي وفقعت الفقاعة اللي كنت عايش فيها وقالت لي ان الوالد عليه دين فوق السبعين الف ريال لشخصين ومن وقتها مو عارف كيف ممكن اني اكمل حياتي بالخبر هذا.  طبعا الدين الأول بقرابة 11,000 ريال لشخص عزيز علينا صار له قرابة العشرين سنة والوالد ما أعطاه منها شي للان والشخص الثاني هو عمي وعلينا له 50,000 ريال.  كلمتني امي كيف الوالد يتصرف معهم وكيف انه ما يفكر بالسداد حاليا وكل ما الوالدة تقول له سدد لهم يقول لها من وين اجيب لهم؟ يا جماعة والله لو نعيش على خبز وملح افضل من اني اعرف اني قاعد تحت رحمة دين أحد، فار دمي والله يوم سمعت القصة وتسائلت مع نفسي كيف الوالد كل يوم يدعي ان ربي يرزقنا وهو ما أعطى بال لحقوق الناس؟ الحمد لله ربي راحمنا الان لكن إذا نزل غضبه علينا ما تعرف ايش بيصير، لكن الله يقويني على سداد هالديون حتى لو بدون معرفته لان لو عرف ممكن يقول لي انه حنا أولى بها.  ملاحظة: الوالد ما انكر حقوقهم لكن يماطل فيهم بدرجة بشعة جدا وتغيرت فكرتي عنه حاليا 180 درجة لكن الله يعين وييسر.	1643742233.0	si2p30	/r/saudiarabia/comments/si2p30/اكتشفت_ان_الوالد_عليه_دين_وضاقت_بي_الوسيعة/	اكتشفت ان الوالد عليه دين وضاقت بي الوسيعة

npqqe	Hi All  I'm visiting Medina next week for a few days on business from San Francisco. First time visiting Saudi Arabia, so I'm looking forward to this.  I wanted to ask a few questions for my planning purposes  1. What are the transportation options to the hotel? (the sponsor is booking our hotels, but I haven't receive that information yet). Is there Uber or Lyft service, or is taxi the preferred way to go to the hotel (and around in general)? 2. Will I be able to get around town with English?  3. I have one free day to tour (not a lot of time unfortunately). What must see places or things should I go to or try? 4. For those of you who have taken a PCR test, what testing facilities have a under 24 hour turnaround? I need something under a day in order to get back on a plane to San Francisco. I think this is the one that stresses me out the most.  Thank you everyone in advance for your answers.

The power grid link between Saudi Arabia and Iraq is expected to produce one gigawatt of energy during the initial phase, the Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman al-Saud  Iraq has been witnessing a chronic power shortage since the US-led invasion in 2003, as the country's electricity plants and electricity imported from neighbouring Iran reached over 20 gigawatts, far less than the actual demand of over 30 gigawatts.	1643345824.0	seim6i	/r/saudiarabia/comments/seim6i/iraqsaudi_power_grid_link/	Iraq-Saudi power grid link

4k6j6iit	 Disclaimer:   I am an idiot. Take my opinion with Himalayan salt, and maybe green peppers. Scratch that, tomato is better. I know nothing and now I am talking out of my ass. The comments will prove that, as always. Am I doing this for karma and to feel better because I got validated by others for something even a kid knows? You bet your ass I am.     The subject starts here:    .  We are the best country in the world, for now. Whether you disagree with that or not, we are among the best. We are better off than most countries. However that might change in future. No, it will change. Unless we do something about it.   How can we guarantee that we shall forever be a good country?    Be good.       Do what you can to be good. When you are good, your family and friends become in a better position. When your family and friends become slightly better because of you , they make you better in the same way. Your neighborhood becomes better. Your city becomes better. Your district becomes better. Then the whole country becomes better. All because you took care of yourself. A smile to a stranger moves mountains.    Never neglect what you can do. No matter how small and insignificant your actions are. Never underestimate anything or anyone. Never be satisfied with what you have. Always be hungry for a better future. If you can be better, then do it. Comfort zone is THE evil.    Our greatest enemy is only yourself.   This massage is for me first before anyone else, then it is for everyone. I am sure many will think this is something really well known and they apply it.

6p3vej3o	Female Asian expat. I’m currently in a mall at the foodcourt alone. And I swear I’m scared to move. I was eating and a group of teenage boys walked past me and laughed. Okay, I don’t mind. But they turned around, walked to my table, shoved their faces on me (I was eating at the table) and said funny sounds like they were imitating chinese or whatever. I sat there in horror and stared at them. They eventually left laughing.   I always thought there were people who had racial prejudice and does stuff like they will cut me off due to me being asian. But this is the first time I felt I was attacked. I was minding my own f*cking business.  I don’t understand why does this happen. I lived in Saudi for 5 years and I always thought it was generally safe. I’m new in Riyadh (only 4months) and this is the first time this happened to me. I’m also used to being alone. But now, idk.

551ifhi9	I'm doing some research and am very interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom. I couldn't find results in English easily and in Arabic searching is not my strong point (I read Arabic perfectly fine but writing is not a strength).  I'm interested to learn how people, the banking system and loans are handled by SAMA? Can a bank confirm a loan or would they need SAMA agreement first?  In the west and where I'm from there's interest. Interest is not shariah compliant so banks tend to use a bit of a different loan model. How does this affect the borrower? Are usually credit payments payment on occasion or should be closed by full at of each month (Loan plus fee summed and divided over the collateral time)?   If a borrower didn't pay the loan at full, what usually tends to happen?   If you notice my questions are very high level and as open question. Any information that can further make me understand is highly appreciated.    Also it's a but different than below, but I'd also like to know how people handle their finances (might be better for a different post)  If you have books in arabic or english about monetary policy you recommend for the Kingdom, I'd love to know of and read them.	1643576700.0	sgixg1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sgixg1/interested_to_learn_more_about_the_monetary/	Interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom

4k6j6iit	Note: i dont know myself and i am still figuring it out.  The most powerful and dangerous creature is one who knows themselves. Whether they are evil or good.  There are things that you think are troubling you because of A reason but in reality, the root reason is the real reason.  An example: i failed at physics exam. The reason i didnt study. Why i didn't study? Because i was distracted by other stuff. Why was i busy doing things other than study? I am trying to avoid a proplem. Perhaps i did a bad thing or bad things. I have to solve them but didn't. Instead i avoided them and ran away from them. So i need a distraction to make not think of my issues. I didn't want to face myself or confront my issues. Because of that i am not happy. This leads to lower performance in another functions and duty. I didnt want to face and understand myself because then i will admit i did wrong. And if i did something wrong I have to SOLVE it. You think your problems are great. You think that you ahve to work really hard to fix them in order to achieve peace of mind. But i promise you once you understand yourself and understand what really you are and what are your issues, and to know what to do to fix them, you will be happy. I suffered from depression for so so so long. I was avoiding myself and responsibilities. Necer think it is too late.   What happened have happened. Let it go. Get over it. Half the people dont care about you, and the other half are glad it is you.  What you have to do now is to look to the future. Set a goal and step by step try to do it.  Never neglect what you can do.  Edit: this wont solve anything. But at least it is a step towards self improvement. No one will help you. The only person that can help you is yourself. What else you can do? Just give up? I refuse belive that. Each of us is great. We are all the same and born from same mother. You have to believe.

gedomrls	ممكن مو المكان المناسب لكن والله ما اعرف ايش اسوي، انا توظفت الحمدلله بعد عناء طويل بالبحث وبحكم ان الوظيفة تتطلب وجود سيارة لان بيكون عندي زيارات لأماكن متعددة قمت اتناقش مع الوالدة وش السواة لأن ما عندنا السيولة الكافية ان نشتري سيارة.  قلت لها ليش ما الوالد يشتري سيارة جديدة وانا اقسطها له بمساعدة اخوي واخذ سيارته القديمة، وقتها امي جلست معي وفقعت الفقاعة اللي كنت عايش فيها وقالت لي ان الوالد عليه دين فوق السبعين الف ريال لشخصين ومن وقتها مو عارف كيف ممكن اني اكمل حياتي بالخبر هذا.  طبعا الدين الأول بقرابة 11,000 ريال لشخص عزيز علينا صار له قرابة العشرين سنة والوالد ما أعطاه منها شي للان والشخص الثاني هو عمي وعلينا له 50,000 ريال.  كلمتني امي كيف الوالد يتصرف معهم وكيف انه ما يفكر بالسداد حاليا وكل ما الوالدة تقول له سدد لهم يقول لها من وين اجيب لهم؟ يا جماعة والله لو نعيش على خبز وملح افضل من اني اعرف اني قاعد تحت رحمة دين أحد، فار دمي والله يوم سمعت القصة وتسائلت مع نفسي كيف الوالد كل يوم يدعي ان ربي يرزقنا وهو ما أعطى بال لحقوق الناس؟ الحمد لله ربي راحمنا الان لكن إذا نزل غضبه علينا ما تعرف ايش بيصير، لكن الله يقويني على سداد هالديون حتى لو بدون معرفته لان لو عرف ممكن يقول لي انه حنا أولى بها.  ملاحظة: الوالد ما انكر حقوقهم لكن يماطل فيهم بدرجة بشعة جدا وتغيرت فكرتي عنه حاليا 180 درجة لكن الله يعين وييسر.	1643742233.0	si2p30	/r/saudiarabia/comments/si2p30/اكتشفت_ان_الوالد_عليه_دين_وضاقت_بي_الوسيعة/	اكتشفت ان الوالد عليه دين وضاقت بي الوسيعة

npqqe	Hi All  I'm visiting Medina next week for a few days on business from San Francisco. First time visiting Saudi Arabia, so I'm looking forward to this.  I wanted to ask a few questions for my planning purposes  1. What are the transportation options to the hotel? (the sponsor is booking our hotels, but I haven't receive that information yet). Is there Uber or Lyft service, or is taxi the preferred way to go to the hotel (and around in general)? 2. Will I be able to get around town with English?  3. I have one free day to tour (not a lot of time unfortunately). What must see places or things should I go to or try? 4. For those of you who have taken a PCR test, what testing facilities have a under 24 hour turnaround? I need something under a day in order to get back on a plane to San Francisco. I think this is the one that stresses me out the most.  Thank you everyone in advance for your answers.

4k6j6iit	 Disclaimer:   I am an idiot. Take my opinion with Himalayan salt, and maybe green peppers. Scratch that, tomato is better. I know nothing and now I am talking out of my ass. The comments will prove that, as always. Am I doing this for karma and to feel better because I got validated by others for something even a kid knows? You bet your ass I am.     The subject starts here:    .  We are the best country in the world, for now. Whether you disagree with that or not, we are among the best. We are better off than most countries. However that might change in future. No, it will change. Unless we do something about it.   How can we guarantee that we shall forever be a good country?    Be good.       Do what you can to be good. When you are good, your family and friends become in a better position. When your family and friends become slightly better because of you , they make you better in the same way. Your neighborhood becomes better. Your city becomes better. Your district becomes better. Then the whole country becomes better. All because you took care of yourself. A smile to a stranger moves mountains.    Never neglect what you can do. No matter how small and insignificant your actions are. Never underestimate anything or anyone. Never be satisfied with what you have. Always be hungry for a better future. If you can be better, then do it. Comfort zone is THE evil.    Our greatest enemy is only yourself.   This massage is for me first before anyone else, then it is for everyone. I am sure many will think this is something really well known and they apply it.

6p3vej3o	Female Asian expat. I’m currently in a mall at the foodcourt alone. And I swear I’m scared to move. I was eating and a group of teenage boys walked past me and laughed. Okay, I don’t mind. But they turned around, walked to my table, shoved their faces on me (I was eating at the table) and said funny sounds like they were imitating chinese or whatever. I sat there in horror and stared at them. They eventually left laughing.   I always thought there were people who had racial prejudice and does stuff like they will cut me off due to me being asian. But this is the first time I felt I was attacked. I was minding my own f*cking business.  I don’t understand why does this happen. I lived in Saudi for 5 years and I always thought it was generally safe. I’m new in Riyadh (only 4months) and this is the first time this happened to me. I’m also used to being alone. But now, idk.

551ifhi9	I'm doing some research and am very interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom. I couldn't find results in English easily and in Arabic searching is not my strong point (I read Arabic perfectly fine but writing is not a strength).  I'm interested to learn how people, the banking system and loans are handled by SAMA? Can a bank confirm a loan or would they need SAMA agreement first?  In the west and where I'm from there's interest. Interest is not shariah compliant so banks tend to use a bit of a different loan model. How does this affect the borrower? Are usually credit payments payment on occasion or should be closed by full at of each month (Loan plus fee summed and divided over the collateral time)?   If a borrower didn't pay the loan at full, what usually tends to happen?   If you notice my questions are very high level and as open question. Any information that can further make me understand is highly appreciated.    Also it's a but different than below, but I'd also like to know how people handle their finances (might be better for a different post)  If you have books in arabic or english about monetary policy you recommend for the Kingdom, I'd love to know of and read them.	1643576700.0	sgixg1	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sgixg1/interested_to_learn_more_about_the_monetary/	Interested to learn more about the monetary system in the Kingdom

4k6j6iit	Note: i dont know myself and i am still figuring it out.  The most powerful and dangerous creature is one who knows themselves. Whether they are evil or good.  There are things that you think are troubling you because of A reason but in reality, the root reason is the real reason.  An example: i failed at physics exam. The reason i didnt study. Why i didn't study? Because i was distracted by other stuff. Why was i busy doing things other than study? I am trying to avoid a proplem. Perhaps i did a bad thing or bad things. I have to solve them but didn't. Instead i avoided them and ran away from them. So i need a distraction to make not think of my issues. I didn't want to face myself or confront my issues. Because of that i am not happy. This leads to lower performance in another functions and duty. I didnt want to face and understand myself because then i will admit i did wrong. And if i did something wrong I have to SOLVE it. You think your problems are great. You think that you ahve to work really hard to fix them in order to achieve peace of mind. But i promise you once you understand yourself and understand what really you are and what are your issues, and to know what to do to fix them, you will be happy. I suffered from depression for so so so long. I was avoiding myself and responsibilities. Necer think it is too late.   What happened have happened. Let it go. Get over it. Half the people dont care about you, and the other half are glad it is you.  What you have to do now is to look to the future. Set a goal and step by step try to do it.  Never neglect what you can do.  Edit: this wont solve anything. But at least it is a step towards self improvement. No one will help you. The only person that can help you is yourself. What else you can do? Just give up? I refuse belive that. Each of us is great. We are all the same and born from same mother. You have to believe. Everyday say to yourself that it is possible to be better.  Say it with me  IT IS POSSIBLE	1643692006.0	shmr1v	/r/saudiarabia/comments/shmr1v/an_advice_know_yourself/	An advice: Know yourself

gedomrls	ممكن مو المكان المناسب لكن والله ما اعرف ايش اسوي، انا توظفت الحمدلله بعد عناء طويل بالبحث وبحكم ان الوظيفة تتطلب وجود سيارة لان بيكون عندي زيارات لأماكن متعددة قمت اتناقش مع الوالدة وش السواة لأن ما عندنا السيولة الكافية ان نشتري سيارة.  قلت لها ليش ما الوالد يشتري سيارة جديدة وانا اقسطها له بمساعدة اخوي واخذ سيارته القديمة، وقتها امي جلست معي وفقعت الفقاعة اللي كنت عايش فيها وقالت لي ان الوالد عليه دين فوق السبعين الف ريال لشخصين ومن وقتها مو عارف كيف ممكن اني اكمل حياتي بالخبر هذا.  طبعا الدين الأول بقرابة 11,000 ريال لشخص عزيز علينا صار له قرابة العشرين سنة والوالد ما أعطاه منها شي للان والشخص الثاني هو عمي وعلينا له 50,000 ريال.  كلمتني امي كيف الوالد يتصرف معهم وكيف انه ما يفكر بالسداد حاليا وكل ما الوالدة تقول له سدد لهم يقول لها من وين اجيب لهم؟ يا جماعة والله لو نعيش على خبز وملح افضل من اني اعرف اني قاعد تحت رحمة دين أحد، فار دمي والله يوم سمعت القصة وتسائلت مع نفسي كيف الوالد كل يوم يدعي ان ربي يرزقنا وهو ما أعطى بال لحقوق الناس؟ الحمد لله ربي راحمنا الان لكن إذا نزل غضبه علينا ما تعرف ايش بيصير، لكن الله يقويني على سداد هالديون حتى لو بدون معرفته لان لو عرف ممكن يقول لي انه حنا أولى بها.  ملاحظة: الوالد ما انكر حقوقهم لكن يماطل فيهم بدرجة بشعة جدا وتغيرت فكرتي عنه حاليا 180 درجة لكن الله يعين وييسر.	1643742233.0	si2p30	/r/saudiarabia/comments/si2p30/اكتشفت_ان_الوالد_عليه_دين_وضاقت_بي_الوسيعة/	اكتشفت ان الوالد عليه دين وضاقت بي الوسيعة

56nomw64	Hi all. I arrived to KSA on a "Temporary Working Visa" with the aim of issuing an Iqama soon (within 3 months). The visa was issued on 17/11/21 and has an expiry date of 17/02/22 written on it.  It seems like the company i'm working for cannot issue the Iqama before the expiry date of the visa.  However, i entered KSA using this visa on 13/12/21. My company says that the 3-months period starts from the date i entered KSA (this means that the temporary working visa expires on 13/03/22).   Can you please advise which expiry date is the correct one?  Thank you :)	1643802716.0	simsu7	/r/saudiarabia/comments/simsu7/expiration_of_temporary_working_visa/	Expiration of Temporary Working Visa

Do I have to have my passport on me, or would my Saudi national ID do?  3.  Do I have to take a PCR test before going to Bahrain / before coming back to Saudi?

7e27m6sc	Hello Everyone,   I am on the verge of accepting an offer in Riyadh and would appreciate your advice on some questions that pertain to my wife's career/ educational opportunities.  Background: She is a Korean national, accredited pharmacist (Pham D) and will be joining me in Riyadh. She has experience covering time at a hospital pharmacy, regular pharmacy, and corporate (Abbvie, Astra Zeneca). In corporate, she worked in pharmacovigilance. Her English is impeccable.  Questions: 1) She is looking to pursue a pharmacy masters degree in Riyadh. The websites are a bit confusing and it would be great to know  - how hard/ easy is it to join a public school (e.g. King Saud) masters degree in pharmacy? - how do public vs private schools compare? - can you recommend any particular programms/ schools?  2) She would appreciate the opportunity to continue working in Riyadh. - how hard/ easy is it to get a job as a foreign/ female in this field? She won't need an expat package etc, just visa sponsorship  - any particular recruiters you could recommend?  3) other advice is much appreciated    Many thanks in advance	1643888819.0	sjh7to	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjh7to/question_for_riyadh_pharmacists/	Question for Riyadh pharmacists

83tcrloi	That's %6 of the GDP! Coming in at 3rd place (out of 200+ countries), Saudi Arabia is the biggest source of remittance in the world after the US and UAE. If you do per capita though...it would blow the other 2 countries straight out of the water and take an easy 1st.  Wouldn't it make sense to push locals to take those jobs and use the money as wages? That way the money stays within and is spent within, thus increasing consumer spending...which is essentially how the economy grows.  Or is it a matter of pride, that those jobs are beneath them? If that's the case, then how far can oil-independent Saudi Arabia go without a blue collar population? Or how can it be a successful oil-independent economy without a blue collar population? Which country's economic model is it emulating?   And speaking of consumer spending, what is really the goal of dependant tax/fees? Is it to drive out non-Saudis? Is it to generate more revenue? Is it both?   If it's about the money, wouldn't the country be *losing* more money since now the breadwinner is spending less money or sending their family abroad and wiring them the money which would have otherwise been spent within, keeping the economy active?   2030 is just 8 years away. It's been like what? 5 years? How's it coming along so far as far as moving away from oil is concerned? I've gone through the vision's official [website](<https://www.vision2030.gov.sa>)...talk about fluff text and buzz words! That's all it contains.  Moving away from oil means the money has to be coming in from something else. What?   Do you see Saudi Arabia as being a manufacturing powerhouse in 8 years? Or with a robust tourist industry that would generate the same revenue as what oil is? How exactly is it going to work out?

3yemok5	We see a lot of "Therapists" in the kingdom, and we need to understand the difference before visiting a mental health professional.  I'm writing this post to clear things out because most of the people dont actually know these information, and it's a really simple difference.  - Therapists or Psychotherapist in the kindgom are usually bachelor's degree holders with two years of experience atleast. Only recently (2 years ago) Saudi government required they get the Masters degree atleast in order to be registered as a therapists. Most countries still stick with bachelor's degree being enough.   Therapists cannot and should not prescribe medications. They will lose their license if they even recommended a medication verbally.   Therapists can't provide an official diagnosis, but they can apply many behavior treatments.   ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ  - Psychologists, which we see very few of in the kingdom, are people who study psychology and hold atleast Master's or PhD, also constantly on the lookout for new research regarding mental health and treatments. They can provide official diagnosis, can usually work with complicated cases, family psychology, drugs addictions, suicidal individuals, psychopaths and so on.   They are  still not allowed to prescribe medications or recommend it. The difference we here between a psychologist and a therapists is the level of training and intensity. You should know that therapists can also receive intense training depending on the courses and experience they have.    ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ  -Psychiatrists, they are doctors who went to med school to learn about the human body, what could go wrong with it and it's reactions to chemicals like every other doctor, then did residency on psychiatry, and graduated to be doctors like every other doctors, but are called Psychiatrists because they study mental illnesses and how medications can affect them.   Believe it or not, they received much much less training on behavior therapy, and many of them don't know how to apply behavior therapy. What they specialize in is giving you a diagnosis and prescribe you medications for it. If you visit one, expect to be prescribed medications, and not talk therapy or CBT.   Can medications help? Hell yeah, but it's highly recommended that you try behavior therapy first. Are meds dangerous? Addictive? Nope, if you follow the plan the doctor made for you, and also do behavior therapy along with the medications for best results, nothing will go wrong.   We'll talk about general knowledge regarding medications latet, but know this, if you started medications for a mental health disorder, never ever stop them all at once, this will make you worse. If you want to stop them, simply tell your doctor that you want to stop the meds and they'll give you a dosage plan to stop them without making your mental health worse.   Stopping stimulants (adhd medications like Ritalin and Concerta) is okay, but your doctor would want you to take it everyday so you could function on your day better, do your chores, remember stuff, finish up work and so on.     Tl'dr:  Therapist: bachelor's degree, can do behavioral therapy.  Psychologist: MD or PhD, can do behavioral therapy better, can provide diagnosis.  Psychiatrist: Medical doctors who can prescribe medications, provide diagnosis, CANT do behavioral therapy.  Edit: some psychiatrists can do behavioral therapy, but most dont.	1643978860.0	skchap	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skchap/lets_talk_about_therapists_or_psychotherapist_vs/	Let's talk about Therapists (or psychotherapist) vs Psychiatrists vs Psychologist.

Background: She is a Korean national, accredited pharmacist (Pham D) and will be joining me in Riyadh. She has experience covering time at a hospital pharmacy, regular pharmacy, and corporate (Abbvie, Astra Zeneca). In corporate, she worked in pharmacovigilance. Her English is impeccable.  Questions: 1) She is looking to pursue a pharmacy masters degree in Riyadh. The websites are a bit confusing and it would be great to know  - how hard/ easy is it to join a public school (e.g. King Saud) masters degree in pharmacy? - how do public vs private schools compare? - can you recommend any particular programms/ schools?  2) She would appreciate the opportunity to continue working in Riyadh. - how hard/ easy is it to get a job as a foreign/ female in this field? She won't need an expat package etc, just visa sponsorship  - any particular recruiters you could recommend?  3) other advice is much appreciated    Many thanks in advance	1643888819.0	sjh7to	/r/saudiarabia/comments/sjh7to/question_for_riyadh_pharmacists/	Question for Riyadh pharmacists

83tcrloi	That's %6 of the GDP! Coming in at 3rd place (out of 200+ countries), Saudi Arabia is the biggest source of remittance in the world after the US and UAE. If you do per capita though...it would blow the other 2 countries straight out of the water and take an easy 1st.  Wouldn't it make sense to push locals to take those jobs and use the money as wages? That way the money stays within and is spent within, thus increasing consumer spending...which is essentially how the economy grows.  Or is it a matter of pride, that those jobs are beneath them? If that's the case, then how far can oil-independent Saudi Arabia go without a blue collar population? Or how can it be a successful oil-independent economy without a blue collar population? Which country's economic model is it emulating?   And speaking of consumer spending, what is really the goal of dependant tax/fees? Is it to drive out non-Saudis? Is it to generate more revenue? Is it both?   If it's about the money, wouldn't the country be *losing* more money since now the breadwinner is spending less money or sending their family abroad and wiring them the money which would have otherwise been spent within, keeping the economy active?   2030 is just 8 years away. It's been like what? 5 years? How's it coming along so far as far as moving away from oil is concerned? I've gone through the vision's official [website](<https://www.vision2030.gov.sa>)...talk about fluff text and buzz words! That's all it contains.  Moving away from oil means the money has to be coming in from something else. What?   Do you see Saudi Arabia as being a manufacturing powerhouse in 8 years? Or with a robust tourist industry that would generate the same revenue as what oil is? How exactly is it going to work out?

3yemok5	We see a lot of "Therapists" in the kingdom, and we need to understand the difference before visiting a mental health professional.  I'm writing this post to clear things out because most of the people dont actually know these information, and it's a really simple difference.  - Therapists or Psychotherapist in the kindgom are usually bachelor's degree holders with two years of experience atleast. Only recently (2 years ago) Saudi government required they get the Masters degree atleast in order to be registered as a therapists. Most countries still stick with bachelor's degree being enough.   Therapists cannot and should not prescribe medications. They will lose their license if they even recommended a medication verbally.   Therapists can't provide an official diagnosis, but they can apply many behavior treatments.   ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ  - Psychologists, which we see very few of in the kingdom, are people who study psychology and hold atleast Master's or PhD, also constantly on the lookout for new research regarding mental health and treatments. They can provide official diagnosis, can usually work with complicated cases, family psychology, drugs addictions, suicidal individuals, psychopaths and so on.   They are  still not allowed to prescribe medications or recommend it. The difference we here between a psychologist and a therapists is the level of training and intensity. You should know that therapists can also receive intense training depending on the courses and experience they have.    ــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ  -Psychiatrists, they are doctors who went to med school to learn about the human body, what could go wrong with it and it's reactions to chemicals like every other doctor, then did residency on psychiatry, and graduated to be doctors like every other doctors, but are called Psychiatrists because they study mental illnesses and how medications can affect them.   Believe it or not, they received much much less training on behavior therapy, and many of them don't know how to apply behavior therapy. What they specialize in is giving you a diagnosis and prescribe you medications for it. If you visit one, expect to be prescribed medications, and not talk therapy or CBT.   Can medications help? Hell yeah, but it's highly recommended that you try behavior therapy first. Are meds dangerous? Addictive? Nope, if you follow the plan the doctor made for you, and also do behavior therapy along with the medications for best results, nothing will go wrong.   We'll talk about general knowledge regarding medications latet, but know this, if you started medications for a mental health disorder, never ever stop them all at once, this will make you worse. If you want to stop them, simply tell your doctor that you want to stop the meds and they'll give you a dosage plan to stop them without making your mental health worse.   Stopping stimulants (adhd medications like Ritalin and Concerta) is okay, but your doctor would want you to take it everyday so you could function on your day better, do your chores, remember stuff, finish up work and so on.     Tl'dr:  Therapist: bachelor's degree, can do behavioral therapy.  Psychologist: MD or PhD, can do behavioral therapy better, can provide diagnosis.  Psychiatrist: Medical doctors who can prescribe medications, provide diagnosis, CANT do behavioral therapy.  Edit: some psychiatrists can do behavioral therapy, but most dont.	1643978860.0	skchap	/r/saudiarabia/comments/skchap/lets_talk_about_therapists_or_psychotherapist_vs/	Let's talk about Therapists (or psychotherapist) vs Psychiatrists vs Psychologist.
