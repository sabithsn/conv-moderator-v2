8eidtjdv	Hello,  My name is Sean Murray. I am a student in digital publishing. I am writing a piece on how Russian Canadians have been affected by the current tensions between the Ukraine and Russia. Are there any Russian Canadians on this subreddit who would be willing to answer a few questions? The responses provided by the individual would be included in the article, and only be seen by my instructor. If you are interested, can you please let know so I can DM you the questions? I have attached a link to my LinkedIn profile below. Thank you for your time.

2e71i9ol	 My friend needs to sign 2 Russian Power of Attorney documents and 1 de-registration document for his family to sell property in Russia. He needs the POA’s certified and the de-reg authenticated (witnessed signature). He resides in Canada on a work visa. He has an appointment with the Russian embassy but he may not be able to make it. He was told this is where he should go but we’re both confused and unsure on the process. Appointments are fully booked at the embassy and it’s a time sensitive matter. Is there alternative ways to go about this quickly?

5gnfaqxe	I'm half Russian from the US (Russian father; American mother). If I had a dollar for every stupid thing I heard about Russia I could've retired when I graduated high school. 1) people ask if Russia is still Communist or are surprised when I tell them it's not. This was not just in elementary school but I've been asked by grown ass adults who were adults when the Soviet Union collapsed. 2) Is Ukraine (or Moldova or another former Soviet country) in Russia? 3) someone asked if Russians drink eel blood. Eel blood is poisonous to humans.  4) Why do Russians hate Jews? It's a long fucking story 5) do you hate gay people? No, I don't 6) do you hate blacks (people of color in general)? IDK did Russia colonized Africa or Latin America?

ivytkyi4	So, basically I started thinking moving to Russia to just see how life is here, I may even to Omsk!     But in general, I would like to know what is the Russian point of view on things and when I search I ONLY get western point of view (and let's say that I don't trust the West anymore) I am not even going to talk about the Ukraine crisis where I do agree with Russia ffs, I mean it's worst than Cuba and we all know how it went and the US gun lobbies are sad now that most of their stuff was gifted to the teletubbies, so they want to create another conflict...      I am not talking about State owned channel because I don't trust any of those from Fox news, to RT, to Skynews, I am looking for a YouTube channel that just talks about stuff and shows them how they are.     I never saw/heard Russian's opinion about doneks, luhanks, or crimea for all I know it was a land invasion, but I found that they 'crimea' voted to be Russian in early 2000s and I found out because a Russian guy told me to look it up.

5achrqzn	Привет всем! As the Covid pandemic begins to subside, and assuming that Biden doesn’t start something stupid in Ukraine, my dad has offered to take me and my six year old daughter to Russia this summer (we’ve been trying to get to Saint Petersburg and Moscow for the past two summers, only to have our visas canceled last-minute due to Covid/non-recognition of our American vaccines).   My daughter requires the use of a wheelchair or walker to get around on her own. Knowing that Saint Petersburg and Moscow are historic cities, I am aware that she will generally have a difficult time getting around independently, but are things like shops, restaurants, and museums at least accessible at a basic level? How about the metro and buses in either city? A friend who’s visited Moscow said the gap between the platform and subway car is upwards of six inches in most places, is that still the case? She’s just really mastering getting around on her own here in our corner of rural America, and I’m not sure how she’d do in a bustling metropolis.   She’s a budding Russophile, wants to learn Russian as her first foreign language, and is beyond excited by the prospect of being able to visit, but I don’t want her to be miserable the entire time if she can’t get around easily, or worse, in dangerous situations in places like the metro.	1642929517.0	sapqs1	/r/russia/comments/sapqs1/disability_access_in_st_petersburgmoscow/	Disability access in St. Petersburg/Moscow

dz7cdv1m	I have the feeling that both US and also many european countrys (especially eastern EU countrys) constantly try to play out germany and russia against each other and it makes me really sick.   I feel like russia and germany could be very good allies. I live in germany for 30 years and never felt that russia wants anything bad for us even though they would have a reason. I remember how putin was speaking for almost an hour in german language in front of our Bundestag and I was really proud being half german and half russian back then and I thought that our countrys will have a great future together  But now it seems like everything is fucked up and everyone around us wants that we somehow act against russia. I feel that a lot of germans and german politicians are neutral about russia but are pressured by partners.

6eam77rj	“We've listened to local radio all across the country. And apart from a few reportings of football games, the mental fare has been as generalized, as packaged, and as undistinguished as the food.” I stirred Charley with my foot to keep him awake. I had been keen to hear what people thought politically. Those whom I had met did not talk about the subject, didn't seem to want to talk about it. It seemed to me partly caution and partly lack of interest, but strong opinions were just not stated. One storekeeper did admit to me that he had to do business with both sides and could not permit himself the luxury of an opinion. He was a graying man in a little gray store, a crossroads place where I stopped for a box of dog biscuits and a can of pipe tobacco. This man, this store might have been anywhere in the nation, but actually it was back in Minnesota. The man had a kind of wistful twinkle in his eyes as though he remembered humor when it was not against the law, so that I dared go out on a limb. I said, "It looks then as though the natural contentiousness of people had died. But I don't believe that. It'll just take another channel. Can you think, sir, of what that channel might be?" "You mean where will they bust out?” “Where do they bust out?" I was not wrong, the twinkle was there, the precious, humorous twinkle. "Well, sir," he said, "we've got a murder now and then, or we can read about them. Then we've got the World Series. You can raise a wind any time over the Pirates or the Yankees, but I guess the best of all is we've got the Russians. “Feelings pretty strong there?” “Oh, sure! Hardly a day goes by somebody doesn't take a belt at the Russians.” For some reason he was getting a little easier, even permitted himself a chuckle that could have turned to throat-clearing if he saw a bad reaction from me. I asked, “Anybody know any Russians around here?” And now he went all out and laughed. “Course not. That's why they're valuable. Nobody can find fault with you if you take out after the Russians. "Because we're not doing business with them?” He picked up a cheese knife from the counter and carefully ran his thumb along the edge and laid the knife down. “Maybe that's it. By George, maybe that's it. We're not doing business. "You think then we might be using the Russians as an outlet for something else, for other things." “I didn't think that at all, sir, but I bet I'm going to. Why, I remember when people took everything out on Mr. Roosevelt. Andy Larsen got red in the face about Roosevelt one time when his hens got the croup. Yes, sir,” he said with growing enthusiasm, “those Russians got quite a load to carry. Man has a fight with his wife, he belts the Russians.” “Maybe everybody needs Russians. I'll bet even in Russia they need Russians. Maybe they call it Americans.  He cut a sliver of cheese from a wheel and held it out to me on the knife blade. “You've give me something to think about in a sneaking kind of way.”	1642988055.0	sb9tmp	/r/russia/comments/sb9tmp/i_asked_anybody_know_any_russians_around_here_and/	"I asked, “Anybody know any Russians around here?” And now he went all out and laughed. “Course not.

c74usucr	Hello. I'm an American who can be described as staunchly pro Russian in regards to international affairs and the current geopolitical situation.

9xpsue8y	“They don’t shoot like this anymore” - they say with nostalgia about Soviet comedies. These tapes have been popular for decades: the familiar characters with their incredible adventures still make adults and children laugh.   Perhaps it's hard for a person unfamiliar with Russian history, the Soviet way of life or the cultural code of the Soviet man to understand how Lukashin from "The Irony of Fate" could have mistaken St. Petersburg for Moscow, arrived at the address "at home" and wandered into his (spoiler - someone else's) apartment without noticing the catch.   Or How can one understand where in a simple Soviet apartment - Three tape recorders, three foreign film cameras, three cigarette cases domestic, suede jacket ... Three...     Or why caviar, eggplant caviar, is a delicacy, but you can eat black and red caviar with spoons.  Similarly, it is difficult to understand the wordplay and subtle humor of Soviet comedies. *- Are you a son of a bitch, an impostor, squandering the government lands?! You can't spare any parishes!*  In these and many other phrases there will always be references to the history or culture of our state. And it is put in a joke... it's almost impossible to get by a person from abroad.   But, anyone who really wants to understand Russia even a little bit should watch these comedies at least because we have half the country talking in phrases from these comedies - yes, literally every day.   You'll find out that "*I'll tear your jaws out and poke your blinkers out*" is... a joke, not a threat. And that "*Student, Komsomol girl, athlete, and just plain pretty*!" shouldn't offend your political beliefs in any way.   In short, just to understand Russia a little closer, be sure to watch these comedies.   **1. Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future (Ivan Vasilievich Changes Profession) - 1973**  [Ivan Vasilievich: Back to the Future \(Ivan Vasilievich Changes Profession\)](https://preview.redd.it/58v68jnx0nd81.jpg?width=630&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9b05634248a698cd492a5beed696956e4203f26)  The story begins in Moscow in 1973, where engineer Alexander "Shurik" Timofeyev is working on a time machine in his apartment. By chance, he sends Ivan Vasilievich Bunsha (Yuri Yakovlev), the superintendent of his building, and Georgy Miloslavsky, a burglar, back in time to the time of Ivan IV the Terrible. The pair are forced to disguise themselves: Bunsha disguises himself as Ivan IV (the Tsar), while Miloslavsky disguises himself as the Prince of the same name. At the same time, the real Ivan IV (also played by Yuri Yakovlev) uses the same machine to get into Shurik's apartment, he has to deal with modern life while Shurik tries to fix the machine to get everyone back to their places in time.         **2.** **The Diamond Arm 1969**  [The Diamond Arm](https://preview.redd.it/myh4rod51nd81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2875fcb81f0afda18025281232bf3b30fdb6d43a)  Diamond Arm has become a cult Russian film, and many Russian contemporaries consider it one of the best comedies of all time.  **3. Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures 1965**  [Operation Y and Shurik's Other Adventures](https://preview.redd.it/sqnlabcv2nd81.jpg?width=310&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51f1421cfed36c39b8122b9e82b1c14f0075606b)  The story is about the adventures of Shurik (alternate spelling - Shurik), a naive and nerdy Soviet student who often gets into ridiculous situations, but always very neatly finds a way out.   **4. Kidnapping, Caucasian Style - 1967**  [Kidnapping, Caucasian Style](https://preview.redd.it/d79xnhjg3nd81.jpg?width=194&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a54f953126110a709ce8958302f1cb45eabfbedb)  The kind but naive ethnography student Shurik, known from previous films as a student at the Polytechnic Institute, goes to the Caucasus to study the ancient customs and traditions of the locals, including the local "myths, legends, and toasts." At the beginning of the film, Shurik is riding down a mountain road in the Caucasus on a donkey. Suddenly a young woman named Nina walks along the road. "A college student, an athlete, a Komsomol girl, and finally a beauty."   **5. Gentlemen of Fortune - 1971**  [Gentlemen of Fortune](https://preview.redd.it/1g7r2gmm3nd81.jpg?width=335&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd17bc28924163a3a95367be1a260e1b651c2e82)  The film tells the story of an affable kindergarten director named Troshkin, who looks a lot like a violent criminal nicknamed Docent (Docent, literally docent) who stole Alexander the Great's helmet at an archeological dig.   The Docent and his gang are caught by the police, but the Docent is in a different prison than his comrades. Since Troshkin looks identical to Docent, the police send him undercover to the real criminals in prison to get information about the stolen helmet. He must pass himself off as the real criminal Docent, so to be convincing, Troshkin, an educated and good-natured man, has to learn the lingo and manners of criminals.  **6. Office Romance 1977**  [Office Romance](https://preview.redd.it/dt05i6fr3nd81.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=513d585875a4a26eca322488d5927d7d9d78b2db)  The action takes place in Moscow in 1976. Anatoly Yefremovich Novoseltsev, an awkward single father of two sons, works in a statistical bureau. His boss is Ludmila Prokofyevna Kalugina, a stern, lonely woman in her 30s, nicknamed "our hag" by her subordinates. Novoseltsev dreams of a promotion and a raise, but is timid to talk to his boss about it. She can not dream at all or it just seems so…  **7. The Irony of Fate 1976**  [The Irony of Fate](https://preview.redd.it/yh4x71cj4nd81.jpg?width=336&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b01bfe5525e663898863d8785d2ccb8f204711ce)  A Soviet romantic comedy film directed by Eldar Ryazanov.  The key plot of the film is the dull monotony of the public architecture of the Brezhnev era, which allowed this theme to develop.   Following an annual tradition, a company of friends gathers in a bathhouse (a traditional public bathhouse "sauna") in Moscow to celebrate the New Year. Afterwards, one of them needs to catch a flight to Leningrad, and the whole group is going to take him to the airport. By the time the group reaches the airport, everyone is very drunk. No one can remember who is supposed to be on the flight. By mistake, Zhenya gets on the plane instead of Pavlik. During the whole flight Zhenya sleeps. In Leningrad, the seat neighbor (cameo of Eldar Ryazanov) helps Zhenya out of the plane. Zhenya wakes up at the Leningrad airport, believing that he is still in Moscow.	1643032147.0	sbmmi7	/r/russia/comments/sbmmi7/the_best_soviet_comedies_hello_galochkayoure/	The Best Soviet Comedies – “Hello, Galochka…you’re about to die!”

zljn3	Hey r/russia!     My dad Travelled to Leningrad, USSR in March of 1989. I was looking to find if anyone knows where i can find old Newspaper articles from this time. He was playing Hockey as a sort of Missionary for Hockey Missionaries International which i believe was under a different name at the time. The reason i ask is because he and/or his team were featured in the paper for a Exhibition game they played.  I feel like its a shot in the dark to find this exact paper but worth the shot.

9xpsue8y	The opening of the Bolshoi Theatre took place on January 18, 1825.  The Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, located in the center of the capital, on Theatre Square, is one of the symbols of Russia and the brilliant skill of its artists. It's talented performers, vocalists and ballet dancers, composers and conductors, and choreographers are known throughout the world.  https://preview.redd.it/5ukasgb4xsd81.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be7b7c768e34ca2d848450d94114d4db3b82d453  World premieres of operas by Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov, Prokofiev and Arensky have taken place here. The great Rachmaninoff conducted here.  https://preview.redd.it/tdfh38cvxsd81.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1466c2e74b8b26e5fe5e44ca0ee9f9f52db620d  **Interesting facts about the Bolshoi Theatre.**  ● Originally, the Bolshoi Theatre was called Petrovsky.  ● The first building of the theatre was never completed - it burned down as a result of a fire, so the construction had to start again.  ● The current building of the Bolshoi Theatre is the fourth in number and was erected in 1835. The second and third buildings suffered the same fate as the first - they burned to the ground.  ● For the whole time of its existence, the Bolshoi Theatre has staged over 800 different performances.  ● The first Bolshoi Theatre troupe included only 43 people.  ● There was a Bolshoi Theatre in St. Petersburg, too. It opened four years after its Moscow counterpart, but in 1886 it was closed.  ● Despite the fact that St. Petersburg was the capital of the Russian Empire for a long time, the Russian monarchs often attended performances at the Bolshoi Theatre, although they had to travel more than 800 kilometers for that.  ● During World War II, the Bolshoi Theatre building was camouflaged as an ordinary apartment building in order to save it from targeted bombing. Nevertheless, in 1941 one bomb did hit the building.  ● One of the most recognizable details of its interior are the chandeliers. During the Second World War, they survived only by miracle, as they were removed and transported to safety just one day before the building was hit by an aerial bomb, the only one in the entire war. It didn't destroy the structure, but the chandeliers still would hardly have survived its impact.  ● The chandelier over the historic Bolshoi stage weighs about 2.3 tons. It consists of more than 20,000 crystal crystals, which themselves weigh about 260 kilograms. At a height of 8.5 meters the chandelier has a diameter of 6.5 meters.  ● The Bolshoi Theatre building is on the Russian 100 rubles bill  ● Actors of the Bolshoi Theatre from time to time tour Russia and other countries of the world, so famous performances can be seen not only in Russia's most famous theatre, but also in other places.  ● The names are not traditionally translated into other languages. Therefore, in English, for example, it would be correct to say "Bolshoi Theatre" instead of using the words "Big" or "Large" - the literal meaning of word Bolshoi.  ● Today its theatrical troupe includes more than a thousand artists from different countries.  https://preview.redd.it/6oxqdto7ysd81.jpg?width=770&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fdbcedd74c160aca8704e7bc149b74733eedf5de  **How much one pays to see the ballet in 2021-22:**  First place in the ranking of the most expensive performances was taken by the opera The Queen of Spades, the part of Herman in which is performed by the Azerbaijani singer Yusif Eyvazov.  A ticket for the Bolshoi Theatre auditorium is available for just 1,200 rubles(around 15$ or 13 Euro), a seat in the front rows costs 17,000 rubles (around 220$ or 195 Euro ), but they're all sold out long ago.	1643102649.0	sc9qjv	/r/russia/comments/sc9qjv/the_bolshoi_theatre_in_moscow_facts/	The Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow - FACTS
3fh8futj	Hello.  I don't know if i can ask this here, so im sorry if this is against any rules or is already explained somewhere else.  I was planning to go to Moscow, but it seems you would need to do a lot of things to get a visa. On the embassy site of my country they gave the advice to not book any hotels and/or flights prior to the visa getting accepted. But to even apply for a (tourist) visa you need an official invitation. To my knowledge you can only get that if you have booked a hotel or tour already.   So my question is: how can i get an official invitation ( do i just ask a hotel, do i need to make a reservation, etc.) Because the information on their site is not clearing things up for me.  If anyone could help me with this or has some helpfull advise regarding getting a visa or traveling to Moscow that would be greatly appreciated.	1643108333.0	scb43j	/r/russia/comments/scb43j/getting_an_official_invitation/	Getting an official invitation

So I came to [R/russia](https://www.reddit.com/r/russia) and was wandering if anyone would be willing to help, or maybe direct me to somewhere or somebody who would be able to. Don't want to be a bother or anything like that.   Focusing on education between the years of 1978 to 1991, if it's not much of a bother I'd kindly ask you, if you're not born between those years to maybe ask a parent or family member, it's 17 questions.

3ovw7qc2	I remember as a kid i grew up (Jeltsin era) thinking Russia was also a European nation, one that would eventually join the EU and NATO.  Sure there were differences, but those differences also exist within the EU. Now after 20 years of Putin, i honestly feel Russia has taken such a different path, with authoritarianism, conservatism, imperialism and strong nationalism that they have nothing in common with especially western Europe.   Would like to know if my feeling about this is correct from the Russian point of view and if my feeling towards Russia in the past was maybe more idealism.   &#x200B;  Please keep it civil, i realise this might be a touchy subject and that i might be very ignorant towards Russia as a forgeiner.   &#x200B;  [View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/scquqz)	1643152753.0	scquqz	/r/russia/comments/scquqz/are_europe_and_russia_even_compatible_now_and_in/	Are Europe and Russia even compatible now and in the future?

enzfe	Hi folks,  For more than ten years, in my free time, I work with the legacy of my great grandfather, famous Soviet sculptor [Sergey Merkurov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Merkurov), who created the most iconic realistic sculptures of political leaders of the early USSR.  Last year, on Lenin's birthday, we dropped a successful NFT [based](https://rarible.com/token/0xd07dc4262bcdbf85190c01c996b4c06a461d2430:504531?tab=owners) on Vladimir Lenin's death mask. That later will become a part of Merkurov's museum collection.  Today, we work on another interesting NFT collection, based on a single aquarelle edition that Merkurov created in 1931. It is the Love alphabet. Unofficial - as the artwork was banned in the USSR.  https://preview.redd.it/h5owu8hw00e81.jpg?width=2083&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=34a2b6c5ab7ebe2af124ae8b1064bfd3eb261566  The collection will feature full original, as well as important contemporary additions - such as letters and nonbinary love kinds. This will be done in collaboration with contemporary artists of all kinds. With this collection, I want to build a community of love and connectedness, promote [Love Alphabet](https://mini.azbuka.love/) (Alphabet in Russian) for future generations, and to spread it to a wide and different audience.  If you like art, love, maybe Russia, maybe erotic and find it interesting, you’re welcome to our team. As a future collector or an artist: we have already 10 letters confirmed, 40 unassigned.  If you find it interesting, let's discuss it here or in our telegram [chat](https://t.me/azbuka_love)!	1643188311.0	sd1tiw	/r/russia/comments/sd1tiw/historical_erotic_alphabet_nft_collection/	Historical Erotic alphabet NFT collection

When you get home, you take off your own shoes and put on slippers. I adopted this habit because A) I always took my shoes/boots off when I came home because they were usually filthy, B) my flat was cold, C) the floors in my flat weren’t of the highest quality and D) slippers really are comfortable!  I’ve even had this habit carry over now that I’ve returned to the United States and I can’t imagine walking in my house barefoot or wearing only socks.*  **Danced all night.**  *In the United States, bars and clubs usually close around 2AM but in Russia they stay open until 6AM.  So it wasn’t uncommon to have a night out with friends that meant staying up all night and returning home around 7AM*  **Ate at McDonald’s.**  *I don’t if there are any significant differences between McDonald’s in the United States and the ones in Russia but, in my opinion, the food at the ones in Russia tastes better. It seems to have more flavor and is not as greasy or sickening. I don’t eat McDonald’s when I’m in the US but doing so didn’t seem quite so bad while living in Russia. Maybe it wasn’t even healthier, but it definitely tasted better and also gave a level of comfort and familiarity, despite the small differences in taste.*  **Drank tea.**  *Like most people, I’d always associated tea with England. I had no idea that Russians drank so much tea. While I rarely drank tea on my own, it was something of a social activity at work and I soon found myself mindlessly drinking cup after cup of tea throughout the work day. At home I never drank tea but always kept some on hand in case I had Russian friends visiting.*  **Accepted cheating as a normal form of behaviour.**   *In this context I’m talking about students cheating on tests although I’ve heard that cheating in relationships is also quite common. As a teacher I was told to expect my students to cheat and this was part of the culture. They weren’t cheating, they were helping their friends. The first time I saw students blatantly cheating, I was shocked. But as time went by I got used to it and came to expect it.*  **Had two front doors.**   *No, there weren’t two separate entrances to my flat. There was one entrance with two doors. There’s a lovely picture* [*here*](https://href.li/?http://moscow-on-the-line.blogspot.com/2010/12/double-doors.html)*. So strange and I don’t know if it was for security reasons or maybe to keep heat inside the flat.*  **Ate caviar when it wasn’t a special occasion.**    *Many people associate caviar with Russia but also with special occasions. It’s often thought that eating caviar and drinking champagne (or vodka) is the height of sophistication. But in Russia caviar can be eaten any time and is often served on pancakes (blini) or on bread with butter.*  Have you ever been or lived in Russia?

zhfm19i	Northern Canadian here, a lot of our side of the Taiga (what we call Boreal Forest) that covers the Canadian Shield and Siberia has large sections towards the west composed primarily of what we call muskeg, it's a type of high latitude peat bog with enough soil in it to make quick sand.    There is a wiki page in muskegs in English although it is a Cree word, I'm curious as to how prominent they are in Siberia.  Muskegs can go for many kilometers and make large swaths of our northern region hard to build on and I'm wondering if far eastern Russia is more similar in terms of forest to eastern or western Boreal (Taiga) forest which is differentiated by the presence of large muskegs.	1643215282.0	sda7se	/r/russia/comments/sda7se/do_you_have_large_fields_of_muskeg_in_siberia/	Do you have large fields of muskeg in Siberia

i9vuzyye	I have a question for the St. Petersburg community about vaccines. I'm an American planning a trip to St. Petersburg for 2 weeks in March, and I found out the city now has a vaccine passport system in place for restaurants/museums/bars/gyms/etc. I've received 2 doses of Pfizer and a booster in the US, but I'm reading the Russian government won't recognize that as proof of vaccination. I'll definitely need to go to restaurants, and have plans to go to one museum (I run a study abroad company and am considering adding a visit to this particular museum to one of my programs) and the spa at the Sokos hotel so I'm trying to figure out the best way to navigate this.   I've been talking with some of my Russian friends who live in SPb, and they've said there are some exceptions for foreigners. Nobody really knows what they are though. They did say I could get a Sputnik Light shot when I arrive, but I'll need a SNILS number to get the QR-code. I speak Russian and can navigate Gosuslugi website just fine, but I don't know if I qualify for a SNILS because I only have a 3-year tourist visa.  So here are my questions:  1. How strictly are places checking QR-codes? 2. Does anyone have experience using a CDC card as proof of vaccination? How did that go? 3. Should I get the Sputnik Light? What's the easiest way to get a QR-code if I do? 4. Has anyone gotten a Sputnik shot after a Pfizer series?  Were there any complications afterwards?  Thanks for your help with this!	1643215086.0	sda4xg	/r/russia/comments/sda4xg/vaccine_passports_in_st_petersburg/	Vaccine Passports in St. Petersburg

The movie takes us in the train, and shows a Russian guy and a Finn girl getting along little by little. Now I Know this movie is NOT made by Russians, which is why I'm curious about a Russian PoV. For me, it's these movies of the West typically fascinated by Russia, showing the same stereotypes, but not all are negative, far from there! So here's a list of things I like/found realistic, and whatnot:  \- The ambience in the train, second and third class. I never took that kind of train, but I read about it a lot and it looks just like that, third class being noisy and warm, second class being a bit better but also solitary. Everyone basically lives together for a few days, and they don't mind the noise, smell, etc.   \- The Russian guy personality: a bit rough, stereotypical, but also kind and intelligent, whose manners contrasts with the Finn girl (more reserved, but also plainer). In the end, she can rely on him despite his rude attitude in the beginning. He is talking about the past greatness of Russia, the childhood with cosmonauts, etc. Landmarks that I think reflect what many people think today.   \- The landscapes, and the hospitality of Russian people (I'm thinking about the babushka scene).   I am NOT talking about the book where the guy says all kinds of bullshit, likes beating his wife etc. The movie makes him much different.   I am making this post in contrast with all the bullshit there is on Ukraine Nato etc. I'm curious to hear about your opinions.	1643302443.0	se2uz5	/r/russia/comments/se2uz5/compartment_n6_the_movie_what_do_you_think_about/	Compartment n°6, the movie: what do you think about it?
9xpsue8y	 January 25 Russia celebrated Student Day!  [ And a real Russian student is a lazy student](https://preview.redd.it/050f5oxdg9e81.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ced390b07e3cb804785b8b554e6ff90f09606270)  That’s why there are a million superstitions in Russia for students in case of exams. They say that if you do it right, you can even learn nothing.  **Don’t wash your hair before the exam**  And don’t shave (well, for those who have something to shave). This omen has a “scientific” explanation: the teacher can not recognize you in your new appearance, and will not believe that you were sitting in his lectures.  [Don’t wash your hair before the exam](https://preview.redd.it/4zg167osg9e81.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d10c516111d84a932572ecb6873ae1107f0e353)   **Sleep with books**  Put under the pillow all that you studied for this exam. Lecture notes, book and notebooks. It is believed that this way the knowledge will definitely get into the student’s brain.   [Sleep with books](https://preview.redd.it/obvmi3fwg9e81.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb04f4b1d4a20d8074ebe37cc800c3a2dd879409)   **Secret spell “Khalyava Pridi”**  Favorite thing to do! At midnight, you must climb out the window, waving your open transcript (**marksheet)** and shout “Khalyava Pridi” which means “Freebie, come”.  After that, you must close the credit card and never open it until after the exam.  **5 cents brings you luck**  Before you go to the exam, you must put a five cent coin in the shoe under the heel. This omen is more likely to come from the student days of our parents. It was believed that a “5 cent” under the heel would guarantee a 5 at the exam which is the highest grade.  **To be scolded**  During the exam, one of your friends or family (or both at the same time) must always scold you. If not with the gross words, then at least more or less censorious and widely known. That’s when you’ll be remembered! Whether the omen works or not, it is hard to say, but it gives a lot of pleasure to the scolding party.  [To be scolded](https://preview.redd.it/bw7ygxj3h9e81.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=b10a22665aa9d4cec397b91829ac57d9b1fd3681)   **Studying before**  The only omen in existence which, when used faithfully, works in 9 out of 10 cases. The last one was just a little bit unlucky. Or you didn’t put a synopsis under your pillow, wash your head, and get up on your right foot…	1643302738.0	se2yzx	/r/russia/comments/se2yzx/how_to_distinguish_a_russian_student_from_all/	How to distinguish a Russian student from all others?

12mbxc	I've been hanging out on this sub for some time. I read it daily, read pretty much every post & every comment. So why am I here?  To learn, plain & simple. To see other view points & try to gain a better understanding of the Russian people, & their culture, your viewpoints, pretty much anything I can learn. I've even learned a few things here about my own country that I didn't know.  I see a fair amount of anti-American and anti-western sentiment, I also see open dialog here & I would like to be a part of that.  About me:  I'm 67 years old, I live about 30 miles south of Richmond Virginia on the east coast of the U.S. That's about 125 miles south of Washington D.C. I remember well the days of the "Cold War", and most of the things that transpired throughout the 60's forward. So I have seen quite a bit in my lifetime. I work for a living, I'm sure as hell not wealthy or privileged in any way, just trying to get by day to day.   I don't see the Russian people or their government as my "Enemy", never really have. I certainly don't believe all the BS that gets spit out on the media outlets in my country or most other's for that matter. If something catches my eye, I'll research everything about it that I can & draw my own conclusions.  All Americans aren't stupid or bigoted. I have had high hopes for both of our countries for many years, and have wished that we had a better understanding of one another & hoped that we could all work together to solve some of the problems that face us all.  I think that communication starts one person at a time, things won't change in my lifetime I'm sure, but maybe in our children's life time, or their children's lifetime things will get to a much better place than they are now.  Ask me anything you want about my country, I'll answer you as honestly as I can. Have an opinion about something regarding the U.S., speak your mind. I'll listen. I wont promise to agree or disagree with anything, I wont promise to say something you may like or dislike, but I will be honest & give you MY opinions & viewpoint on whatever we discuss.   So...what would you like to know?	1643330625.0	sedlz8	/r/russia/comments/sedlz8/im_an_american_so_lets_talk/	I'm an American, so lets talk.

5m7ys37g	I plan on staying one month in Yaroslavl  to be with my boyfriend but I have two main concerns. I have done something that people shouldn’t do, I have let the political news incorporate so much fear into my judgements. So naturally my main concerns are:  1. Staying in Yaroslavl for such a long time may not be the best choice for an American with everything happening in the Russian-Ukrainian situation?  2. It might not be a good idea to be three hours away from Moscow where the US embassy is… right?  I love Russia , my experience in Moscow was a dream. I just want to gather opinions on this matter that are not derived from the news or from people who are not Russian. Since some of you are actually living in Russia and now the run downs I think you guys are the perfect people for this.  Ps any advice would be nice too:)   In advanced, thank you guys very much for your time and help!  (Lol you guys, I am rereading this post for errors and am realizing how paranoid I am, yikes.

12mplnhi	I initially didn’t feel comfortable making this post, as it felt a bit self-indulgent for a random American to make a post trying to communicate how I feel to 200,000 people. However, I saw a comment by a Russian who was “relieved” after hearing not all Americans hated Russia right now, and I realized it might be productive to reach out to the Russian people here.  First of all, I’d like to say that we don’t all hate you. Many intelligent Americans have a great admiration and respect for your people. Between the university students who are ardent supporters of Communism, and the ancient men in our news and government who still believe we are engaged in an ideological war with the Soviet Union, there are those Americans who can understand that the majority of your country is populated by ordinary and infinitely complex people, who have lives, dreams, and families, just like we do.  Your culture and history command great respect from citizens around the world. There is arguably no nation that has produced such a diversity of artists, military leaders, writers, scientists, leaders, and multi-talented great men and women as yours. Your culture is uniquely situated by the nature of your size and location to be a fascinating, beautiful combination of Eastern and Western ideals and values, which is reflected more so in your architecture than anything else.   Although are countries are so often put at odds, I find the similarities and differences between our nations beautiful. The American nation was founded by individuals who risked everything to pursue better lives by the avenue of a system of self-governance nearly unheard of in their time. Your people, in the early 20th Century, pursued the exact same and simultaneously exact opposite goals in the same way. I am anti-communist, but it took a massive amount of passion and bravery from your ancestors to fight for and install such a system in your country. Whether you long for the days of the USSR or not, you can’t blame the revolutionaries for trying something new. They were the first to do so on such a scale. The same could have, and may still, happened to the Americans. We are both young nations by the age of our specific governments, and old nations by the age of our ideals; for us, the democratic Greeks and empiric Romans, and for you, the people who have lived in your nation for hundreds, even thousands, of years. In a way, it seems we’re destined to be odds with each other like two competitive brothers. Unfortunately, on the scale of history, competitive fighting between brothers results in the death of thousands of innocent men and women.   By the way, the reason that you’re still portrayed as villains in some of our movies, despite the Middle East being our supposed enemies for the past two decades isn’t just propaganda. It’s because you’re famously strong, honorable, and intelligent people. I know this is a generalization, but historically, it’s not necessarily wrong either. You could not create a more admirable enemy if you tried. Although I don’t wish for war in any nation, I can’t think of a more admirable opponent. Whether you believe Ukraine should be under Russian control or not, I think we all ultimately hope for the same thing; safety, peace, and prosperity. Many of us are aware that we don’t really know the truth of the current situation, as I hope many of you are as well. I despise the behavior of the few in power who continuously pit young men against each other, but it seems to be the natural state of the world.  I wish the best for you and your families, regardless of the outcome of the current tensions.	1643340592.0	seh07g	/r/russia/comments/seh07g/from_an_american_to_russians/	From An American To Russians

gp3amo2e	hi ! i have always been heavily interested in Russian culture & the language and I’d love to visit one day.  Do y’all have any suggestions of places to visit? I love the “less travelled” destinations. In my country I really like visiting small towns to shop at antique shops & clothing boutiques. I like the idea of possibly finding a cool, rare item. Huge music lover & I love art & museums. also would you have any tips for learning the language? I’ve been learning it on & off for about 3 years but very little has stuck :( which makes me sad because it’s such a cool language. Not sure if this would be important to mention but I am American.   i really can’t say when I’ll visit but I hope to eventually.   i hope this is okay for this sub, I always read the rules but I’m never sure.	1643355592.0	sela3t	/r/russia/comments/sela3t/where_to_visit/	where to visit ?

o01543t	What are your personal experiences with Russophobia? In my own experience growing up in Oregon, US I have only seen older generations having bad opinions about Russia (and only because of the Cold War). The generation I grew up in, again in my own experience, has shown no bad opinion of Russia. I grew up with many of my friends being first generation Russian-Americans and I know several people who had plans to study abroad in Russia before covid.   Have you experienced Russophobia? Do you see it more from the US gov. and media? Or have you had experiences while traveling?

2zkr1wzj	Hello fellow Russians, I'm regular european who is just watching what's going on in this sub recently and if to compare to other countries subs here are somewhat very important and dominant topics of history (WWII especially) and politics. Why?  Politics, yeah, I can get this one maybe, every country has what to say and who to like or dislike in their political field, but to have  WWII topic debated every day is unusual. Why it is so important to you? Is it some kind of.. big part of your nation's identity or something? Or you feel some kind of.. unjust of how the history is being told elsewhere?	1643393775.0	sewzdg	/r/russia/comments/sewzdg/why_history_and_politics/	Why history and politics?

12mbxc	I've never been much of a fan of non English films because I generally don't like English dubbing or subtitles but came across a couple of titles on Netflix that sparked my interest one of which seriously got my attention.  The first show I watched on Netflix was "To the Lake". I enjoyed this show quite a bit, despite the dubbing.  The one that really got me though was "Better Than Us". I have now watched this series twice, once dubbed in English, the 2nd time in Russian with English subtitles, both times in just a couple of days. It was even better in Russian, it was much more authentic.   Paulina Andreeva  simply blew me away. Her abilities as an actress were simply amazing. Her control of her facial expressions & movements as the robot Arisa are absolutely second to none. No one in any other film or TV series I've ever seen even comes close to her performance in that kind of role. I do hope that Netflix picks up the next installment which I understand is going to be filmed in China.   So this weekend I plan on watching two other Russian films.  Attraction & Invasion.  I'm a big fan of Science Fiction & I was wondering if anyone here had any other recommendations on movies or TV series I could be on the lookout for.   #	1643409756.0	sf2vc4	/r/russia/comments/sf2vc4/russian_cinema_tv/	Russian Cinema & TV

I also recently started learning Russian, and at the same time, I changed the location on Tinder to Nizhny Novgorod to make some friends and get a glimpse of Russian culture.  I get lots of matches, and it always starts off pretty well. But then when I ask for whatsapp or instagram, a few of them never reply. Or for the ones that do, I add them in one of those apps and they quickly turn monossylabic or unresponsive.  One girl in particular, I added her on VK, and I thought we were having quite a nice chat. We both speak Spanish, so we were practicing our Spanish. Then she blocked me out of nowhere. Did not see that coming.  I've done this before in other countries and it's always worked fine. No idea what I could possibly be doing wrong this time. Any ideas?

I thought the paper was very neutral in how it presented everything. I went through the opinion pages as well as the general news.

38x5o	The Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation [has issued](https://regulation.gov.ru/projects#npa=123967) and official list of traditional Russian values, including "priority of the spiritual over the material" and "humanism". Quite strikingly, these two are listed one after another.     To my knowledge, [humanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism) focuses primarily on mankind, human well-being and the study of reality through science, all of which are rooted in the material world, while it de-emphasizes religious teachings, dogma, superstition and all things we collectively call "spiritual", perhaps for lack of a better word.      I want to ask what is the traditional Russian view of both humanism and the spiritual and how do the two go together here.	1643490147.0	sfrmtb	/r/russia/comments/sfrmtb/what_is_the_traditional_russian_view_of_humanism/	What is the traditional Russian view of humanism?

1lu1u5r	Hello Russian mates, EU citizen here trying to find an answer to a question I frankly haven't heard a clear official answer so far: what exactly does Putin sees as the main ideology of Russia today which has to be defended from NATO and Western nations (including here the younger democraties of Eastern Europe).  In the Cold War things were obvious from ideological point of view: there was on one side USSR + its subjugated Eastern European countries standing for a communist single party ideology, no elections, no democracy, no freedom of speech, planned state owned economy. On the opposing side there was US + Western Europe and their capitalist economies, multiparty system, elections every 4 years, freedom of speech. The Cold War ended in the '90s with communism collapse and the East block (USSR/Russia included) switched to West's capitalist/democracy system.   Now correct me please if I'm wrong, but, at least in theory and as official position, today Russia is a democracy with multy-party system, capitalist market economy, elections every 4 years, freedom of speech for its citizens. So, at least from an ideological point of view, Russia and the Western world should be in the same boat.  Yes, I know that unlike many liberal democracies from West, Putin openly stands for traditional family values, Christian religion values and against too many rights for the LGBT community. But I think that's not nearly enough to place Russia in an opposing position against the West: similar views and even policies are present now in some parts of Western world - ex. Poland, Hungary and half of US population have same conservative agenda.  So in short: why Putin is acting like he is still defending the USSR against the West, since the USSR no longer exist and, more so, the main ideology for which USSR existed, communism, is long dead and buried.   Please enlighten me on this matter fellow Russians, I really want to hear your sincere opinions or facts I might've missed.

Please ignore the Americans going on about the Irish fishermen "forced" the Russian navy to move. We know that's nonsense. We are used to bullshit from empires after fighting the British for 800 years.   The request came from one bunch of (much smaller) people to another not to fire rockets where we were fishing and Russia said "fair enough".   Thanks Russia!

In the UK, we have a system of freehold and leasehold. Most flats are leasehold which means someone else owns the land and I have to pay ground rent and service charge. The service charge includes utilities, concierge etc. We also pay taxes on top.  How does it work in Russia? Would I have a mortgage plus ground rent, service charge, and taxes?

8ubg3zzz	*Русский перевод внизу*  I’m trying to learn Russian. I’m American,  and ironically wanted to begin learning after reading “Agent Sonya”; it just so happened that all this news about Russia and Ukraine are happening as well.   I’m self teaching and I have a notebook that I’ve been practicing writing in. I have almost all the alphabet and sounds down, as well as a few words and phrases. I’m loving it so far, but I want to start conversing as soon as possible so that I can get a “real world” view of the language.   Some things I’m interested in and would love talking about are: art, politics, reform, history, and culture. I’m extremely open minded, and I don’t judge anyone. So, if you would like to or would want to create a group for Russian/English learning please comment and let me know.   Я пытаюсь выучить русский язык. Я американец и, по иронии судьбы, хотел начать учиться после прочтения «Агента Сони»; так получилось, что все эти новости о России и Украине также происходят.  Я самообучаю, и у меня есть тетрадь, в которой я практикую писать. У меня почти весь алфавит и звуки вниз, а также несколько слов и фраз. До сих пор мне это нравится, но я хочу начать разговаривать как можно скорее, чтобы получить «реальный» взгляд на язык.  Некоторые вещи, которые меня интересуют и о которых я хотел бы поговорить, это: искусство, политика, реформы, история и культура. Я чрезвычайно открыт и никого не судю. Итак, если вы хотите или хотите создать группу для изучения русского/английского языков, пожалуйста, прокомментируйте и дайте мне знать.	1643589449.0	sgnk2u	/r/russia/comments/sgnk2u/would_there_be_anyone_willing_to_be_my_pen_pals_я/	Would there be anyone willing to be my pen pal(s)?

9xpsue8y	Mikhail Baryshnikov – who is he and why has the image of a typical Russian in exile become entrenched?  Baryshnikov is well known to the Western world as Alexander Petrovsky, Cary’s “final” boyfriend from the last season of “Sex and the City”. Baryshnikov in the series appeared not only in the role of an intelligent man and a talented artist, but that same Russian, who always kisses the lady’s hand and takes her to the best restaurants with a horse-drawn carriage, but in return demands unconditional love.  **But who is Baryshnikov in a real life and is he really the best incarnation of a Russian in the Western world?**  [„The more injuries you get, the smarter you get.“](https://preview.redd.it/nhpo34w4kze81.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9edb730b7bbf9de6b78bf4bd251dd6a2fa8938b2)  He has been called the greatest ballet dancer of the last century. He is one of the chosen Russians who influenced the fate of world ballet. His emigration was a gain for the United States - the media started talking about how the country could now rightfully be called the ballet power of the world. His admirers simply called him Misha, while critics declared that Baryshnikov was the only Russian in the United States with 100 percent recognizability.  [Baryshnikov was born January 27, 1948, in Riga.](https://preview.redd.it/n2o27ds7kze81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbb5f1e7b9a6d787c02c4307fae4b08947d25d57)  Since childhood, Mikhail Baryshnikov dreamed of performing on stage, but the problem was his short stature - the dancer is 168 cm tall and weighs 65 kg.  His mother committed suicide when Mikhail was 12 years old.  A few years later, Baryshnikov moved to Leningrad, where he began choreographing and very quickly made it to the famous Mariinsky Theater. Baryshnikov instantly became famous.  In 1973, the artist was allowed to organize a creative evening and choose his own repertoire. He invited contemporary choreographers to stage one-act ballet dances. At the evening the dancer performed “Prodigal Son”, “Divertissement”, “Daphnis and Chloe” - this was the pinnacle of his work in Russia.  >„Children being left, it’s not always like books of Charles Dickens. When you lose your parents in childhood, it’s a fact of life, and, you know, human beings are extraordinary powerful survivors. My mother commit suicide. I was lucky it was not in front of me. O. K.? Which is truth, and Father was confused, and we never had any relationship, serious relationship. I never knew my father, in a way. But what? It’s made me different? No, I mean. I blame for every fuckups in my life my parents? No. \[Pause\] I got lucky. I fell in love with dance.“  [\(in the interview for The New Yorker\)](https://preview.redd.it/j248qwebkze81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2627aa8f336b643bb1a91dc0a7924ebd640bd415)  In the summer of 1974, Mikhail Baryshnikov did not return from his Canadian tour and became a non-returnee. The artist asked for political asylum, although the decision to stay in the West was difficult for him.  Baryshnikov was immediately invited to join the American Ballet Theatre company, where he became the company’s premiere and then director.  His next step was modern, which is as highly regarded in America as classical ballet. And here he surpassed himself, showing a new level of male dance, infusing it with aesthetics and beauty. His solo ballets are monologue-confessions in which the transience of life, the inevitability of death, and reflections on creativity come to the fore.  The vivid temperament of the artist could not help but have an impact on Mikhail’s private life. He was credited with affairs not only with his partners on stage, such as Gelsie Kirkland, but also with the most brilliant representatives of the cinema and show business - Sharon Stone and Isabella Rossellini. The dancer himself was reserved in conversations with reporters on personal subjects, for which he was even nicknamed the man in the box.  Mikhail has always been a lover of a busy social life - he could often be found at Studio54 in New York, as well as in the top restaurants of Paris, where he was friends with the local social elite, Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, as she mentioned in her diaries.  His life in America did not resemble the sufferings of an emigrant. Mikhail Baryshnikov personally knew Jacqueline Kennedy, Princess Diana, and was friends with Joseph Brodsky. He owns the popular Russian restaurant Samovar, located on Central Street in New York, in the house where Frank Sinatra used to live, and there were jazz clubs all around. In Baryshnikov’s restaurant one could often also hear his friend Joseph Brodsky singing to the accompaniment of the dancer himself. Friends liked to perform Russian romances for their friends.  In August 2017, Baryshnikov was included in Forbes’ top 100 influential Russians of the century.  **Russian indeed?**  As the dancer told an American Times reporter in one of his interviews, during his childhood years in Latvia he felt like an outsider. Baryshnikov attributes this to the personality of his father, who served in the Soviet army, which allegedly occupied Latvia according to those views.  I did not feel comfortable in Russia either, where I was perceived as a provincial Latvian, always looking like a Westerner.  And yet it was the USSR that opened the door to his brilliant career, gave him an education, a punchy character, intelligence and charisma - and by doing so he conquered the world.  Therefore, Baryshnikov, combining the hard fate of a man without a family and homeland, but with an open heart and great talent, will forever remain a symbol of that very mysterious but warm Russian soul, no matter where or who he was.	1643618603.0	sgwkkz	/r/russia/comments/sgwkkz/that_russian_baryshnikov/	That Russian, Baryshnikov

None	I have a story I want to share with all of you. So please bear with me if this will be a long post.  A dysfunctional sect foster family adopted me from the U.S. because my birth mom was only 17 years old, and she couldn't take care of me. Was I mad at her? No, I couldn't imagine myself as a mother who was part of a lost generation to a young group of teenagers during the collapse of the USSR. To hell with politics sometimes, right?  My history of living in the U.S. is almost as horrible as anyone can imagine, so I ran away when I was 15. I later got a full scholarship to university and graduated. Until recently, I finally had the finances that allowed me to travel. But, of course, I always wanted to go back to Russia for one reason - to find my mother and let her know that I was all right and that if she ever needed my help, I would readily provide it. Some people told me that I had to move on with my life. I didn't believe that principle because no mother and child should ever be separated. And that I had this primal wound, and I always wondered where my personality traits came from. For this reason, I had to come back with my elementary level of Russian.  However, when I arrived in a small town nine hours southeast of Moscow, I was born. According to the adoption papers, I was supposed to navigate the address where she lived. But, instead, I happened to walk up to my great-grandfather, who lived there alone now. He was about 94 years old and in great shape. He understood my situation and gave me a phone number that led directly to my mother's sister. For some reason, I wondered why he didn't have my mother's phone number in the first place, but he told me to find out for myself.  I immediately contacted my mother's sister and told her about myself. She, of course, was shocked and confirmed that we would meet the following day.  This was not what I wanted to hear, but unfortunately, my mother disappeared without any trace. According to my aunt and my mother's other sister, most likely, she had been abducted. Even better, I never knew I had a younger brother who is five years younger than me and looks a lot like me! Long story short, when my mother disappeared, my aunt jumped in adopting him. He is such a polite teenager. This makes me so happy, and gains mad respect for my aunt. You may ask why my aunt didn't adopt me from the beginning. Understand, she was also just a teenager.  I got along very well with the whole family, and my brother and I have similar personalities, which just struck me.  That being said, if any of you are adoptees, I would advise everyone to reunite with their families because you never know. Maybe they are waiting for you. My aunt knew about me, and technically she always wondered if we would ever meet again, and we did finally after twenty-two years.  Now we all have peace of mind and are happy from there. I finally have a family that I always wanted to have. Both of my aunts have beautiful young daughters, and they are intelligent for their young age. Even better is that my appearance is very similar to my mother's, unlike my brother's. So my aunts are relieved as if they have finally seen my mother in many years. They told me they were finally at peace in their souls.  Lastly, Russia is truly a great place with infinitely generous neighbors. I would absolutely go back when things calmed down to be near my family again.

8jn5s682	Dear Reddit Users,  I was watching a documentary about Ukraine and its position as a country. I understand that this is a Russian Reddit community for topics related to Russia, but since Ukraine and Russia are positioned side by side, I would appreciate to hear your take as well.  I am interested on the subject of the identity of Ukraine and Ukrainians.  I would like to hear your thoughts about the description that there are three Ukraine's:  1. **The western**\*\*\*,\*\*\* *Ukrainian speaking nationalistic* or patriotic Ukraine 2. **Eastern Ukraine**, generally refers to territories of Ukraine east of the Dnipro river, particularly Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. Noticeable cultural differences in the region (compared with the rest of Ukraine except Southern Ukraine) are *more "positive views" on the Russian language and on the Soviet era* and more "negative views" on Ukrainian nationalism. 3. **Kiev and Central Ukraine** where they *speak Russian but vote as those from the western part*  I would greatly appreciate if you'd shere your thoughts on that subject.  Regarding the Ukranian identity It was said that mythological archetype for Ukrainians are Cossacks that represent bravery and the suffering which represents The Holodomor.  I've also heard that Ukrainians tend to be more individualistic in general in contrast to Russians who tend to have more collective sense as a nation.  Thank you!  P. S. If someone is familiar with author Yaroslav Hrytsak I would like to hear what do Ukrainians think about him.	1643726556.0	shwkfa	/r/russia/comments/shwkfa/ukranian_identity/	Ukranian identity

5bcuqo8p	I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)	1643740443.0	si1zcm	/r/russia/comments/si1zcm/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

am4qxhez	Hi,  Pesky Westerner here.   I come from a country, Ireland, where growing up the island was actually very poor. My family drove a Lada 2102 and were basic sheep farmers. It would've been when the country was about 70 years old and free of colonialism.   In the next few years there was basically what can only be described as an explosion of capitalism.. our tiny world blew up. Money everywhere. Big 4x4s. Big houses. Big careers. You name it.   I don't see Ireland as "special", I just see it as what happens if you give people freedom. We were free from the church and free from the British. Free to trade. Free to work hard. Etc.   I always expected to see the same thing happen in Russia because I don't see Irish people as "special" and I've spent so many nights reading about Russian engineering etc that I thought that after some freedom existed in Russia that it would "explode".   I know it might sound crazy but if you look at Russian programmers, Russian engineers, Russian artists etc they are brilliant.   But yet there was never a Russian BMW, Russian Microsoft etc.   I just want to know... why did it not happen?	1643755694.0	si828t	/r/russia/comments/si828t/what_we_were_expecting_vs_what_we_got/	What we were expecting vs. What we got

9xpsue8y	Mikhail Baryshnikov – who is he and why has the image of a typical Russian in exile become entrenched?  Baryshnikov is well known to the Western world as Alexander Petrovsky, Cary’s “final” boyfriend from the last season of “Sex and the City”. Baryshnikov in the series appeared not only in the role of an intelligent man and a talented artist, but that same Russian, who always kisses the lady’s hand and takes her to the best restaurants with a horse-drawn carriage, but in return demands unconditional love.  **But who is Baryshnikov in a real life and is he really the best incarnation of a Russian in the Western world?**  [„The more injuries you get, the smarter you get.“](https://preview.redd.it/nhpo34w4kze81.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9edb730b7bbf9de6b78bf4bd251dd6a2fa8938b2)  He has been called the greatest ballet dancer of the last century. He is one of the chosen Russians who influenced the fate of world ballet. His emigration was a gain for the United States - the media started talking about how the country could now rightfully be called the ballet power of the world. His admirers simply called him Misha, while critics declared that Baryshnikov was the only Russian in the United States with 100 percent recognizability.  [Baryshnikov was born January 27, 1948, in Riga.](https://preview.redd.it/n2o27ds7kze81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbb5f1e7b9a6d787c02c4307fae4b08947d25d57)  Since childhood, Mikhail Baryshnikov dreamed of performing on stage, but the problem was his short stature - the dancer is 168 cm tall and weighs 65 kg.  His mother committed suicide when Mikhail was 12 years old.  A few years later, Baryshnikov moved to Leningrad, where he began choreographing and very quickly made it to the famous Mariinsky Theater. Baryshnikov instantly became famous.  In 1973, the artist was allowed to organize a creative evening and choose his own repertoire. He invited contemporary choreographers to stage one-act ballet dances. At the evening the dancer performed “Prodigal Son”, “Divertissement”, “Daphnis and Chloe” - this was the pinnacle of his work in Russia.  >„Children being left, it’s not always like books of Charles Dickens. When you lose your parents in childhood, it’s a fact of life, and, you know, human beings are extraordinary powerful survivors. My mother commit suicide. I was lucky it was not in front of me. O. K.? Which is truth, and Father was confused, and we never had any relationship, serious relationship. I never knew my father, in a way. But what? It’s made me different? No, I mean. I blame for every fuckups in my life my parents? No. \[Pause\] I got lucky. I fell in love with dance.“  [\(in the interview for The New Yorker\)](https://preview.redd.it/j248qwebkze81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2627aa8f336b643bb1a91dc0a7924ebd640bd415)  In the summer of 1974, Mikhail Baryshnikov did not return from his Canadian tour and became a non-returnee. The artist asked for political asylum, although the decision to stay in the West was difficult for him.  Baryshnikov was immediately invited to join the American Ballet Theatre company, where he became the company’s premiere and then director.  His next step was modern, which is as highly regarded in America as classical ballet. And here he surpassed himself, showing a new level of male dance, infusing it with aesthetics and beauty. His solo ballets are monologue-confessions in which the transience of life, the inevitability of death, and reflections on creativity come to the fore.  The vivid temperament of the artist could not help but have an impact on Mikhail’s private life. He was credited with affairs not only with his partners on stage, such as Gelsie Kirkland, but also with the most brilliant representatives of the cinema and show business - Sharon Stone and Isabella Rossellini. The dancer himself was reserved in conversations with reporters on personal subjects, for which he was even nicknamed the man in the box.  Mikhail has always been a lover of a busy social life - he could often be found at Studio54 in New York, as well as in the top restaurants of Paris, where he was friends with the local social elite, Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, as she mentioned in her diaries.  His life in America did not resemble the sufferings of an emigrant. Mikhail Baryshnikov personally knew Jacqueline Kennedy, Princess Diana, and was friends with Joseph Brodsky. He owns the popular Russian restaurant Samovar, located on Central Street in New York, in the house where Frank Sinatra used to live, and there were jazz clubs all around. In Baryshnikov’s restaurant one could often also hear his friend Joseph Brodsky singing to the accompaniment of the dancer himself. Friends liked to perform Russian romances for their friends.  In August 2017, Baryshnikov was included in Forbes’ top 100 influential Russians of the century.  **Russian indeed?**  As the dancer told an American Times reporter in one of his interviews, during his childhood years in Latvia he felt like an outsider. Baryshnikov attributes this to the personality of his father, who served in the Soviet army, which allegedly occupied Latvia according to those views.  I did not feel comfortable in Russia either, where I was perceived as a provincial Latvian, always looking like a Westerner.  And yet it was the USSR that opened the door to his brilliant career, gave him an education, a punchy character, intelligence and charisma - and by doing so he conquered the world.  Therefore, Baryshnikov, combining the hard fate of a man without a family and homeland, but with an open heart and great talent, will forever remain a symbol of that very mysterious but warm Russian soul, no matter where or who he was.	1643618603.0	sgwkkz	/r/russia/comments/sgwkkz/that_russian_baryshnikov/	That Russian, Baryshnikov

None	I have a story I want to share with all of you. So please bear with me if this will be a long post.  A dysfunctional sect foster family adopted me from the U.S. because my birth mom was only 17 years old, and she couldn't take care of me. Was I mad at her? No, I couldn't imagine myself as a mother who was part of a lost generation to a young group of teenagers during the collapse of the USSR. To hell with politics sometimes, right?  My history of living in the U.S. is almost as horrible as anyone can imagine, so I ran away when I was 15. I later got a full scholarship to university and graduated. Until recently, I finally had the finances that allowed me to travel. But, of course, I always wanted to go back to Russia for one reason - to find my mother and let her know that I was all right and that if she ever needed my help, I would readily provide it. Some people told me that I had to move on with my life. I didn't believe that principle because no mother and child should ever be separated. And that I had this primal wound, and I always wondered where my personality traits came from. For this reason, I had to come back with my elementary level of Russian.  However, when I arrived in a small town nine hours southeast of Moscow, I was born. According to the adoption papers, I was supposed to navigate the address where she lived. But, instead, I happened to walk up to my great-grandfather, who lived there alone now. He was about 94 years old and in great shape. He understood my situation and gave me a phone number that led directly to my mother's sister. For some reason, I wondered why he didn't have my mother's phone number in the first place, but he told me to find out for myself.  I immediately contacted my mother's sister and told her about myself. She, of course, was shocked and confirmed that we would meet the following day.  This was not what I wanted to hear, but unfortunately, my mother disappeared without any trace. According to my aunt and my mother's other sister, most likely, she had been abducted. Even better, I never knew I had a younger brother who is five years younger than me and looks a lot like me! Long story short, when my mother disappeared, my aunt jumped in adopting him. He is such a polite teenager. This makes me so happy, and gains mad respect for my aunt. You may ask why my aunt didn't adopt me from the beginning. Understand, she was also just a teenager.  I got along very well with the whole family, and my brother and I have similar personalities, which just struck me.  That being said, if any of you are adoptees, I would advise everyone to reunite with their families because you never know. Maybe they are waiting for you. My aunt knew about me, and technically she always wondered if we would ever meet again, and we did finally after twenty-two years.  Now we all have peace of mind and are happy from there. I finally have a family that I always wanted to have. Both of my aunts have beautiful young daughters, and they are intelligent for their young age. Even better is that my appearance is very similar to my mother's, unlike my brother's. So my aunts are relieved as if they have finally seen my mother in many years. They told me they were finally at peace in their souls.  Lastly, Russia is truly a great place with infinitely generous neighbors. I would absolutely go back when things calmed down to be near my family again.

8jn5s682	Dear Reddit Users,  I was watching a documentary about Ukraine and its position as a country. I understand that this is a Russian Reddit community for topics related to Russia, but since Ukraine and Russia are positioned side by side, I would appreciate to hear your take as well.  I am interested on the subject of the identity of Ukraine and Ukrainians.  I would like to hear your thoughts about the description that there are three Ukraine's:  1. **The western**\*\*\*,\*\*\* *Ukrainian speaking nationalistic* or patriotic Ukraine 2. **Eastern Ukraine**, generally refers to territories of Ukraine east of the Dnipro river, particularly Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. Noticeable cultural differences in the region (compared with the rest of Ukraine except Southern Ukraine) are *more "positive views" on the Russian language and on the Soviet era* and more "negative views" on Ukrainian nationalism. 3. **Kiev and Central Ukraine** where they *speak Russian but vote as those from the western part*  I would greatly appreciate if you'd shere your thoughts on that subject.  Regarding the Ukranian identity It was said that mythological archetype for Ukrainians are Cossacks that represent bravery and the suffering which represents The Holodomor.  I've also heard that Ukrainians tend to be more individualistic in general in contrast to Russians who tend to have more collective sense as a nation.  Thank you!  P. S. If someone is familiar with author Yaroslav Hrytsak I would like to hear what do Ukrainians think about him.	1643726556.0	shwkfa	/r/russia/comments/shwkfa/ukranian_identity/	Ukranian identity

5bcuqo8p	I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated.

am4qxhez	Hi,  Pesky Westerner here.   I come from a country, Ireland, where growing up the island was actually very poor. My family drove a Lada 2102 and were basic sheep farmers. It would've been when the country was about 70 years old and free of colonialism.   In the next few years there was basically what can only be described as an explosion of capitalism.. our tiny world blew up. Money everywhere. Big 4x4s. Big houses. Big careers. You name it.   I don't see Ireland as "special", I just see it as what happens if you give people freedom. We were free from the church and free from the British. Free to trade. Free to work hard. Etc.   I always expected to see the same thing happen in Russia because I don't see Irish people as "special" and I've spent so many nights reading about Russian engineering etc that I thought that after some freedom existed in Russia that it would "explode".   I know it might sound crazy but if you look at Russian programmers, Russian engineers, Russian artists etc they are brilliant.   But yet there was never a Russian BMW, Russian Microsoft etc.   I just want to know... why did it not happen?	1643755694.0	si828t	/r/russia/comments/si828t/what_we_were_expecting_vs_what_we_got/	What we were expecting vs. What we got

9xpsue8y	Mikhail Baryshnikov – who is he and why has the image of a typical Russian in exile become entrenched?  Baryshnikov is well known to the Western world as Alexander Petrovsky, Cary’s “final” boyfriend from the last season of “Sex and the City”. Baryshnikov in the series appeared not only in the role of an intelligent man and a talented artist, but that same Russian, who always kisses the lady’s hand and takes her to the best restaurants with a horse-drawn carriage, but in return demands unconditional love.  **But who is Baryshnikov in a real life and is he really the best incarnation of a Russian in the Western world?**  [„The more injuries you get, the smarter you get.“](https://preview.redd.it/nhpo34w4kze81.jpg?width=636&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9edb730b7bbf9de6b78bf4bd251dd6a2fa8938b2)  He has been called the greatest ballet dancer of the last century. He is one of the chosen Russians who influenced the fate of world ballet. His emigration was a gain for the United States - the media started talking about how the country could now rightfully be called the ballet power of the world. His admirers simply called him Misha, while critics declared that Baryshnikov was the only Russian in the United States with 100 percent recognizability.  [Baryshnikov was born January 27, 1948, in Riga.](https://preview.redd.it/n2o27ds7kze81.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbb5f1e7b9a6d787c02c4307fae4b08947d25d57)  Since childhood, Mikhail Baryshnikov dreamed of performing on stage, but the problem was his short stature - the dancer is 168 cm tall and weighs 65 kg.  His mother committed suicide when Mikhail was 12 years old.  A few years later, Baryshnikov moved to Leningrad, where he began choreographing and very quickly made it to the famous Mariinsky Theater. Baryshnikov instantly became famous.  In 1973, the artist was allowed to organize a creative evening and choose his own repertoire. He invited contemporary choreographers to stage one-act ballet dances. At the evening the dancer performed “Prodigal Son”, “Divertissement”, “Daphnis and Chloe” - this was the pinnacle of his work in Russia.  >„Children being left, it’s not always like books of Charles Dickens. When you lose your parents in childhood, it’s a fact of life, and, you know, human beings are extraordinary powerful survivors. My mother commit suicide. I was lucky it was not in front of me. O. K.? Which is truth, and Father was confused, and we never had any relationship, serious relationship. I never knew my father, in a way. But what? It’s made me different? No, I mean. I blame for every fuckups in my life my parents? No. \[Pause\] I got lucky. I fell in love with dance.“  [\(in the interview for The New Yorker\)](https://preview.redd.it/j248qwebkze81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2627aa8f336b643bb1a91dc0a7924ebd640bd415)  In the summer of 1974, Mikhail Baryshnikov did not return from his Canadian tour and became a non-returnee. The artist asked for political asylum, although the decision to stay in the West was difficult for him.  Baryshnikov was immediately invited to join the American Ballet Theatre company, where he became the company’s premiere and then director.  His next step was modern, which is as highly regarded in America as classical ballet. And here he surpassed himself, showing a new level of male dance, infusing it with aesthetics and beauty. His solo ballets are monologue-confessions in which the transience of life, the inevitability of death, and reflections on creativity come to the fore.  The vivid temperament of the artist could not help but have an impact on Mikhail’s private life. He was credited with affairs not only with his partners on stage, such as Gelsie Kirkland, but also with the most brilliant representatives of the cinema and show business - Sharon Stone and Isabella Rossellini. The dancer himself was reserved in conversations with reporters on personal subjects, for which he was even nicknamed the man in the box.  Mikhail has always been a lover of a busy social life - he could often be found at Studio54 in New York, as well as in the top restaurants of Paris, where he was friends with the local social elite, Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, as she mentioned in her diaries.  His life in America did not resemble the sufferings of an emigrant. Mikhail Baryshnikov personally knew Jacqueline Kennedy, Princess Diana, and was friends with Joseph Brodsky. He owns the popular Russian restaurant Samovar, located on Central Street in New York, in the house where Frank Sinatra used to live, and there were jazz clubs all around. In Baryshnikov’s restaurant one could often also hear his friend Joseph Brodsky singing to the accompaniment of the dancer himself. Friends liked to perform Russian romances for their friends.  In August 2017, Baryshnikov was included in Forbes’ top 100 influential Russians of the century.  **Russian indeed?**  As the dancer told an American Times reporter in one of his interviews, during his childhood years in Latvia he felt like an outsider. Baryshnikov attributes this to the personality of his father, who served in the Soviet army, which allegedly occupied Latvia according to those views.  I did not feel comfortable in Russia either, where I was perceived as a provincial Latvian, always looking like a Westerner.  And yet it was the USSR that opened the door to his brilliant career, gave him an education, a punchy character, intelligence and charisma - and by doing so he conquered the world.  Therefore, Baryshnikov, combining the hard fate of a man without a family and homeland, but with an open heart and great talent, will forever remain a symbol of that very mysterious but warm Russian soul, no matter where or who he was.	1643618603.0	sgwkkz	/r/russia/comments/sgwkkz/that_russian_baryshnikov/	That Russian, Baryshnikov

None	I have a story I want to share with all of you. So please bear with me if this will be a long post.  A dysfunctional sect foster family adopted me from the U.S. because my birth mom was only 17 years old, and she couldn't take care of me. Was I mad at her? No, I couldn't imagine myself as a mother who was part of a lost generation to a young group of teenagers during the collapse of the USSR. To hell with politics sometimes, right?  My history of living in the U.S. is almost as horrible as anyone can imagine, so I ran away when I was 15. I later got a full scholarship to university and graduated. Until recently, I finally had the finances that allowed me to travel. But, of course, I always wanted to go back to Russia for one reason - to find my mother and let her know that I was all right and that if she ever needed my help, I would readily provide it. Some people told me that I had to move on with my life. I didn't believe that principle because no mother and child should ever be separated. And that I had this primal wound, and I always wondered where my personality traits came from. For this reason, I had to come back with my elementary level of Russian.  However, when I arrived in a small town nine hours southeast of Moscow, I was born. According to the adoption papers, I was supposed to navigate the address where she lived. But, instead, I happened to walk up to my great-grandfather, who lived there alone now. He was about 94 years old and in great shape. He understood my situation and gave me a phone number that led directly to my mother's sister. For some reason, I wondered why he didn't have my mother's phone number in the first place, but he told me to find out for myself.  I immediately contacted my mother's sister and told her about myself. She, of course, was shocked and confirmed that we would meet the following day.  This was not what I wanted to hear, but unfortunately, my mother disappeared without any trace. According to my aunt and my mother's other sister, most likely, she had been abducted. Even better, I never knew I had a younger brother who is five years younger than me and looks a lot like me! Long story short, when my mother disappeared, my aunt jumped in adopting him. He is such a polite teenager. This makes me so happy, and gains mad respect for my aunt. You may ask why my aunt didn't adopt me from the beginning. Understand, she was also just a teenager.  I got along very well with the whole family, and my brother and I have similar personalities, which just struck me.  That being said, if any of you are adoptees, I would advise everyone to reunite with their families because you never know. Maybe they are waiting for you. My aunt knew about me, and technically she always wondered if we would ever meet again, and we did finally after twenty-two years.  Now we all have peace of mind and are happy from there. I finally have a family that I always wanted to have. Both of my aunts have beautiful young daughters, and they are intelligent for their young age. Even better is that my appearance is very similar to my mother's, unlike my brother's. So my aunts are relieved as if they have finally seen my mother in many years. They told me they were finally at peace in their souls.  Lastly, Russia is truly a great place with infinitely generous neighbors. I would absolutely go back when things calmed down to be near my family again.

However, in the [next page](https://washington.mid.ru/en/consular-services/citizens-usa/visa-to-russia/tourist-visa/), a US passport is required which they don't have since they're only green card holders.

8jn5s682	Dear Reddit Users,  I was watching a documentary about Ukraine and its position as a country. I understand that this is a Russian Reddit community for topics related to Russia, but since Ukraine and Russia are positioned side by side, I would appreciate to hear your take as well.  I am interested on the subject of the identity of Ukraine and Ukrainians.  I would like to hear your thoughts about the description that there are three Ukraine's:  1. **The western**\*\*\*,\*\*\* *Ukrainian speaking nationalistic* or patriotic Ukraine 2. **Eastern Ukraine**, generally refers to territories of Ukraine east of the Dnipro river, particularly Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. Noticeable cultural differences in the region (compared with the rest of Ukraine except Southern Ukraine) are *more "positive views" on the Russian language and on the Soviet era* and more "negative views" on Ukrainian nationalism. 3. **Kiev and Central Ukraine** where they *speak Russian but vote as those from the western part*  I would greatly appreciate if you'd shere your thoughts on that subject.  Regarding the Ukranian identity It was said that mythological archetype for Ukrainians are Cossacks that represent bravery and the suffering which represents The Holodomor.  I've also heard that Ukrainians tend to be more individualistic in general in contrast to Russians who tend to have more collective sense as a nation.  Thank you!  P. S. If someone is familiar with author Yaroslav Hrytsak I would like to hear what do Ukrainians think about him.	1643726556.0	shwkfa	/r/russia/comments/shwkfa/ukranian_identity/	Ukranian identity

5bcuqo8p	I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)	1643740443.0	si1zcm	/r/russia/comments/si1zcm/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

am4qxhez	Hi,  Pesky Westerner here.   I come from a country, Ireland, where growing up the island was actually very poor. My family drove a Lada 2102 and were basic sheep farmers. It would've been when the country was about 70 years old and free of colonialism.   In the next few years there was basically what can only be described as an explosion of capitalism.. our tiny world blew up. Money everywhere. Big 4x4s. Big houses. Big careers. You name it.   I don't see Ireland as "special", I just see it as what happens if you give people freedom. We were free from the church and free from the British. Free to trade. Free to work hard. Etc.   I always expected to see the same thing happen in Russia because I don't see Irish people as "special" and I've spent so many nights reading about Russian engineering etc that I thought that after some freedom existed in Russia that it would "explode".   I know it might sound crazy but if you look at Russian programmers, Russian engineers, Russian artists etc they are brilliant.   But yet there was never a Russian BMW, Russian Microsoft etc.   I just want to know... why did it not happen?	1643755694.0	si828t	/r/russia/comments/si828t/what_we_were_expecting_vs_what_we_got/	What we were expecting vs. What we got

9xpsue8y	&#x200B;  [ Joseph Brodsky \(24 May 1940 – 28 January 1996\) ](https://preview.redd.it/4g9jwsvjvdf81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=699746734f85e796dd011afb2929ed8936ccee1b)  Joseph Brodsky was born in 1940, in Leningrad, and began writing poetry when he was eighteen. Anna Akhmatova soon recognized in the young poet the most gifted lyric voice of his generation.   From March 1964 until November 1965, Brodsky lived in exile in the Arkhangelsk region of northern Russia; he had been sentenced to five years in exile at hard labor for “social parasitism,” but did not serve out his term.   On June 4, 1972, Joseph Brodsky became an involuntary exile from his native country.  After brief stays in Vienna and London, he came to the United States. He has been Poet-in-Residence and Visiting Professor at the University of Michigan, Queens College, Smith College, Columbia University, and Cambridge University in England.  Brodsky passionately loved Venice. He came here seventeen times and always in winter.   [ He wrote a postcard essay to this city, “Watermark”](https://preview.redd.it/evkhll60wdf81.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e558729b16ab9ea2b687e51d02853c021a51629)  Brodsky’s short book is an autobiographical essay, a kind of poetry in prose, recounting Brodsky’s relationship with Venice. In about half a hundred short chapters, each devoted to a different episode from the author’s visits to the city (or his thoughts), he describes its atmosphere. “It is all written in short, closed passages, where in each passage one picture or one feeling is described. And these are pictures either from his various impressions of Venice (where he visited every winter) or his ideas of Venice as they were before emigration. People connected with Venice in one way or another (there, in Italy or in Russia) and people with whom he may not have seen in Venice himself, but who, before him, without him, besides him, had been to Venice, or wrote about Venice.  Joseph Brodsky died in New York on the night of January 28. According to medical experts, his heart stopped suddenly - a heart attack, the fifth in a row. Brodsky’s first burial was temporary - the body in a coffin lined with zinc was placed in a crypt at the Church of the Holy Trinity on the banks of the Hudson.  According to the poet’s widow Maria (née Sozzani, an Italian aristocrat with Russian roots): "The idea of a funeral in Venice was suggested by a friend. It was the city that, apart from St. Petersburg, Joseph loved most of all.  On June 21, 1997, Brodsky’s body was reburied in the San Michele cemetery.  On the back of the monument is an inscription in Latin - a line from the ancient Roman poet Propertius’ elegy, which means: "With death not all things end.”  On Brodsky’s grave visitors leave poems, letters, pebbles, photographs, pencils, and cigarettes - as we know, Joseph was a heavy smoker.

ejd86euy	I don't live in Russia but here in the nordic countries I think its considered that usually the woman who is in charge in the home. The man also has a say but usually its the woman's will that goes first in the end. Because when mother is unhappy nobody's happy as the saying goes. I think we men like to help and support our women as well because they are more in to taking care of the kids. So its more of a choice. Perhaps even a bit of laziness as well because being in charge requires energy.   Is it similar in Russia In an average family situation?

gvk6b9br	The increasingly cynical realism of Russian foreign policy as successive rounds of NATO expanded to Russia’s borders as well as the hyper-cynicism of much of Putin’s foreign policy at present have their roots in genuine disenchantment most Russians have as a result of western policy on Russia and NATO expansion in the 90s.  From its outset, new post-Soviet Russia was viewed not as a potential partner, but as a potential threat to its neighbors and the West. That potential, however, needed to be actualized to become an actual or kinetic threat. Potential’s actualization was contingent on policies—whether Western or Russian—that isolated and/or alienated Russia from the West.   And it wasn’t Russia that made the first move. The expansion of NATO – world history’s most powerful military-political bloc – to Russia’s borders in the 90s, when Russia was as pro-western as it ever could be, *without Russia’s inclusion in the bloc* gradually actualized the Russian threat.  There were several aspects to this process. First, the decision to expand NATO eastward broke the trust and explicit promise not to so expand and thus take advantage of the Warsaw Pact’s dissolution.   Second, the U.S. policy made no extra effort to entice Russia into NATO commensurate with the country’s great power status. To the contrary, policymakers appear to have discouraged, if not outright rejected Russian overtures.  Third, NATO enlargement and especially NATO “humanitarian bombing“ of Yugoslavia (without the UN's approval - [The UN Charter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charter_of_the_United_Nations) prohibits the use of force except in the case of a decision by the Security Council under Chapter VII, or self-defence against an armed attack) shifted the correlation of forces in Russian domestic politics from support for, to opposition against Westernization.   Fourth, NATO expansion undermined Russian national security vis-à-vis NATO. This not only further alienated the Russian power ministries or siloviki from the West and Russia’s at the time pro-Western leadership, it humiliated Russia’s proud military and national security establishment. This was all the more so, since NATO’s more forward-leaning configuration required adjustments to Russian force structure, defense procurement, and military and national security doctrines, many of which Moscow was in no position to carry out at the time because of the dire economic depression into which the collapse of the USSR had plunged the country.  The idealistic and naïve Russians of the democratic *perestroika* generation learned a harsh lesson from the partner they hoped for in the United States. The lone superpower, increasingly hubristic hegemon, ‘victor in the Cold War’ – the United States – demonstrated that Russian national security, even domestic stability placed a distant second when it came not just to America’s maintenance of its position as world leader but also to the unlimited enhancement of U.S. power globally and especially within Russia’s traditional sphere of influence.  One can discount the promise not to expand NATO to one’s liking. But more than the spirt of statements and assurances was broken along with the ‘promise’. The spirit of that minimal trust that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and then General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev had built up between our two countries’ elites and peoples was gravely undermined. Maybe forever.	1643800960.0	simaya	/r/russia/comments/simaya/adult_take_on_nato_expansion_and_russian_foreign/	Adult take on NATO expansion and Russian foreign policy

59ek8ny3	Hey everyone! I have an upcoming trip to Russia soon and I would like to know these things (from those that have traveled to Russia during the current COVID regiment):  1) With the 72-hour PCR COVID test requirement, would I have to show that information to immigration officials in Russia or would this only apply to my flight from the United States to Russia?  2) For those that got their tests in the US, how long (on average) would it take for someone to get your PCR results? The only reason I'm asking this one is I'm debating whether or not to visit a more expensive facility that grants you PCR results quicker (as it is "in-house") or go to a regular PCR COVID test facility (like at an airport or hospital) and save some money.

brbwf	Hello all,  I try and keep up with the news, but I realize that I'm not as informed as others. And I had one question that I haven't seen answered yet. If indeed the US, NATO, Ukraine, etc is antagonizing, or goading, Russia into a conflict, why was Russia the first to mobilize their forces into strategic locations around Ukraine and in Belarus? Was Russia afraid that they'd be invaded? From my media, it appears that Russia was the one to "make the first move" by "threatening" Ukraine/Europe by mobilizing their forces, and the US/NATO's response was at the Russian provocation. Is this true? We can all agree that Russia doesn't have much to gain from an international conflict. So why are their troops strategically placed, as to invade Ukraine? Is this an "act" to get Russia's demands met?	1643906198.0	sjnmv0	/r/russia/comments/sjnmv0/question_from_an_american_about_the/	Question from an American about the Russian/Ukraine Conflict

2sx2c2ld	Nikita Khrushchev is still disliked in the post-Soviet space. He is accused of many sins, but it must be admitted that he did a lot of good things. For example, he solved one of the main problems of the Soviet people – HOUSING.  The housing issue has been spoiling the Soviet people since 1922. Since then, when crowds of rural residents poured into the cities en masse. If in pre-revolutionary Russia the share of urban residents was 18%, then in 1926 the number doubled to 36%. Naturally, all this mass of former villagers had to be resettled. In the early years of Soviet power, the problem was solved simply by compacting former residents. Former mansions and apartment buildings were converted into communal apartments. Intellectuals, former officials and other old-regime urban population living in luxury apartments with offices and bedrooms were settled in cramped rooms with a shared kitchen and a crowd of proletarian neighbors.  State construction began under Stalin. New houses began to be built. Basically three types. The first one included giant monument towers, often in the "Neo-Gothic" style, which grew up in the center of megacities (Moscow and Leningrad). Only their superiors received their luxury apartments. Even in today's times, such housing is considered elite.  Luxury houses of 3-6 floors (often with shops on the ground floor) were a little more modest, but still stood out for their architectural individuality. Ceilings of 3-4 meters and rooms of 15-20 and even 30 "squares", spacious hallways and dressing rooms, massive stone balconies, curly cornices and stucco molding made them the object of universal envy until the very end of the XX century.  For ordinary citizens of the Country of the Soviets, modest 3-4-storey housing was built without frills, but still distinguished by good comfort. 2-4-room apartments with fairly spacious kitchens and large hallways, huge windows and ceilings up to 3.2 meters high, seemed like palaces for former residents of dormitories and barracks. Sometimes, however, the kitchens were small, and then there were none at all - it was implied that a Soviet citizen would eat in public canteens and cafes.  Such expensive and long-term housing could not solve the housing problem. After the Great War, there was an incredible housing crisis in the country. The majority of the urban population huddled in communal apartments, by the 50s they had lived there for generations. After Stalin's death, the situation worsened: rural residents began to be issued passports, which naturally increased migration. The collective farmers fled from the delights of rural life, and the urban population began to increase rapidly. In 1956, it accounted for 48.4% of the total population.  The housing issue had to be solved. And the sooner the better. Until the problem has matured like a purulent abscess and burst with popular indignation. A week after Stalin's death, the new head of government, Georgy Malenkov, called for expanding housing construction. The first secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Nikita Khrushchev, the new leader of the country, also paid close attention to the housing problem.  Only fast and cheap housing construction could solve the issue. In principle, there have been developments for this in world practice. France also faced similar problems after the war. We solved their construction of panel houses, that is, assembled from panels. And the architect Le Corbusier developed the project. These cubicles were inhabited at home, with a combined bathroom and a tiny kitchen, naturally not by the elite of society - students, workers, migrants from colonies and other poor people. However, later these buildings were recognized in France as a national disgrace and demolished everywhere. And Corbusier's biographers diligently avoid these projects, and therefore he is still considered a great architect.  In the Soviet Union, the architectural workshop of Mikhail Posokhin undertook the development of panel houses. In 1949, he and Ashot Mdoyants built a panel house on Khoroshevsky Highway in Moscow. And then 15 more such houses were built in the same area by the "flow-speed" method. The engineer of the project was Vitaly Lagutenko, the grandfather of the famous musician and singer Ilya Lagutenko from the group "Mumiy Trol". Those houses on the Khoroshevsky highway looked little like today's "Khrushchev". They were decorated with hanging garlands under the windows, pilasters in the piers covered the seams between the slabs and generally had a good and beautiful finish.  Perhaps the "Khoroshevsky" houses would have become the main model for the construction of "Khrushchev" if Nikita Khrushchev's speech at the All-Union Meeting of Builders, architects and other workers of the construction industry had not been heard in December 1954. For the first time, Khrushchev criticized Stalin in the architecture of the "Stalinist neoclassical". He reported that the Moscow State University high-rise cost the treasury the amount for which it was possible to build an average city from panel houses. The builders of houses on Khoroshevsky Highway also got it, whom the country's leader reproached for wastefulness: "they understand architecture too aesthetically, as an artistic activity, and not as a means of meeting the urgent needs of the Soviet people.   The result of Khrushchev's speech was the government decree "On the elimination of excesses in design and construction", which finally put an end to the period of Stalinist architecture. Now the main thing in construction has become three main theses: easier, cheaper and more.  Many projects were offered, up to exotic ones, such as a house made of plastic. However, the simplest and cheapest, and therefore the best, solution was recognized by M.Posokhin and V. Lagutenko. In fact, they took the "Khoroshevsky" project and removed all the "excesses" - pilasters, hanging garlands and so on. No chance was given to the exterior decoration, calculations showed that if you abandon arches, balustrades, balconies, columns and other exterior finishes, the cost of such a house is reduced by a third. Nikita Khrushchev liked the project and the project of K-7 houses, colloquially called "Khrushchevki", "khrushchoby", was born. And sometimes "lagutenki" as Vitaly Lagutenko became the main builder of these houses.  The savings affected not only the exterior decoration. The standards for the dimensions and areas of the premises were reduced. The kitchen was supposed to be 5-6 m2, wardrobe 2.5 m2, minimum ceiling height 2.5 m, minimum room width 2.2 m. Toilet and bathroom were provided combined, no garbage chutes and elevators. Therefore, the "Khrushchevki" were no higher than five floors. Big problems with noise insulation and increased heat dissipation.  In the realities of today's days, "Khrushchevki" look, of course, complete squalor, but then for Soviet people who lived their lives in communal apartments and barracks, they seemed like palaces. Everyone dreamed of getting a separate apartment in such a house. Moreover, Nikita Khrushchev promised that this housing is temporary, communism will come in 1980, panel houses will be demolished and every Soviet citizen will receive a separate palace or a comfortable villa.  The experience of building the first houses of the K-7 series in Moscow was recognized as successful. The question arose about such construction throughout the country. So to speak, put the construction "on stream". A French engineer and developer of panel construction, Raymond Camus, was involved in the case, bought a license for the production of concrete slabs from his company and processed it to Soviet conditions. House-building plants were being created all over the country, which, in the course of the organization, began to build K-7 houses. Without a basement, with a minimum size of apartments, houses were built simply and cheaply: they were assembled as a bookcase and mounted by the "solvent-free method". Only two dozen components were assembled by a complex team; builders, electricians, plasterers and plumbers worked in three shifts simultaneously with installers. After two years of working out this method, a four-section, five-storey house was assembled in 12-15 days. And in Leningrad, one brigade set a record in general - assembled a house in five days!  They built Khrushchevki until 1966. Then came the turn of the apartments "Brezhnevok", in fact an improved copy of the houses of the K-7 series. The rooms became impassable, and adjacent, balconies appeared, shared a toilet with a bathtub, paid attention to noise and thermal insulation, kitchens became at least 6 m2, or even more. Despite all the shortcomings of the "Khrushchev" and "Brezhnevki" solved the housing problem in the USSR. In Khrushchev's times, from 1956 to 1963, the country's housing stock almost doubled from 640 to 1,184 million m2, and from 1956 to 1985, 290 million m2 of housing was commissioned. Tens of millions of Soviet people moved from barracks, basements, communal apartments and dormitories to separate apartments. They might not be the best, but compared to the places where they lived, they were palaces.  And more. Although the "Khrushchevki" were designed for 25 years, a maximum of 50, they are still standing and people still live in them. And apparently, they will stand for a long time. Soviet urban planners both designed and built for centuries.

Any help would be legendary, have been trying to gather info for a concept design project  P.s. if anyone knows any masterful Russian portrait painters from past and present, please do recommend!	1643979414.0	skcnil	/r/russia/comments/skcnil/art_forms_uniquecommonly_attributed_to_russia/	Art forms unique/commonly attributed to Russia?
1oxwnd9	I am not sure how many member of this sub saw the story that the [leader of ISIS was killed in a US led special forces raid yesterday.](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/biden-says-isis-leader-quraishi-killed-syria-raid-2022-02-03/)  What I thought was positive in relation to this sub is that Russia cooperated on some level in this operation, because the US helicopters flew over a lot of Russian controlled airspace to get to the target.    It is not in the story, but when asked on MSNBC the White House spokesperson said that yes Russia allowed the flights.  And I suspect the cooperation went deeper than that, but that is just speculation.      This is the sort of cooperation we need to see more often.  These guys are still a real threat to both Russia and the United States.	1643980267.0	skcxv3	/r/russia/comments/skcxv3/us_and_russian_cooperation_on_terrorism/	US and Russian Cooperation On Terrorism

5bglkt	Hi,  I'm a Turkish citizen aged 26, have 2 sinovac and 1 biontech covid vaccine, work as a research assistant in a state university and I would like to visit Russia for the Iron Maiden concert in 1st of June; however, I have no idea about international travel procedures between Turkey and Russia.   Do I need a visa? Will I be able to get it asap as the concert is in about 4 months?   Will the tension between Russia-Ukrain affect my travel because Turkey stands with Ukrain on the issue?   Is it safe to travel alone for the concert?   Will I be able to find people there to enjoy the concert together? Do young people there speak English so I can get along with them? Do young Russians like foreigners to include them in their group at all?  I only speak English and Turkish. Would this be a problem there?   I've always wanted to visit Russia, and I will probably visit Russia more in the future if I would have a nice experience this summer. (Huge fan of bands like Kino, Chernikovskaya Hata, Molchat Doma btw)  Thanks!	1643997373.0	skjqbm	/r/russia/comments/skjqbm/traveling_to_russia_from_turkey_for_the_iron/	Traveling to Russia from Turkey for the Iron Maiden concert in 1st of June

Its an upbeat dance song, sung by a maybe middle aged woman. I know this isn't much but am dying to hear it again, maybe it's popular enough that people know it?

lahvn	After a long week I finally was ready for a nice taxi ride home and to relax for a few days, I don’t speak Russian well and usually tell my driver “я плохо говорю по русски” and most of the time the ride is in silence unless they speak a little English then we have a nice chat on the 29 minute ride.    But today, my driver spoke no English at all but the music he played was all in English and very beautiful, about half way home he asked “тебе нравится музыка” which I replied да, очень приятная! He then said this singer was his daughter singing. This was very cool and you could tell that he was a very proud papa, at the end of the ride I asked if maybe she had a YouTube channel and he gave me a card with her name.

I’ve heard SPB is a pretty liberal/culturally diverse city so I don’t expect enormous issues but I’ve heard varying things regarding the treatment of queer people there. I don’t look or dress openly flamboyant or queer but like I do have some tattoos and piercings and stuff. I use gender neutral pronouns in English/the US but I know not to attempt that in Russia. I’m also 6’3 and viewed as a man so people don’t really tend to fuck with me. However, when I tell my queer/trans friends here that I’m thinking about studying in Russia they get very worried for me.

I'm watching coverage of the olympics on NBC and it's almost every hour on the hour they're pushing this lie about chinese concentration camps. It's absolutely absurd! I'm sure it is no coincidence the word "genocide" was used emphatically several times while the word "cultural" was only used once.  That poor, lovely Chinese woman having to be around that insect from the state department and give fair and unbiased answers whilst he just pelts viewers with propaganda is disturbing.  I want out of this damn place. The U.S won't stop trying to start wars anytime soon and I'm tired of disagreeing with everyone I know.

1f10pre9	Just came up with this crazy conspiracy theory and wanted to share it just for a bit of fun.  Just think about it. What if there's no real conflict between Russia and Ukraine at all? What if instead Russia and Ukraine are working together to rebuild Ukraine's infrastructure and give it new military infrastructure, all on the pockets of silly gullible westerners?   Crimea had to be given back as a reason to start the whole operation. It doesn't really matter who officially controls the land since both governments work together.   And some people have to get sacrificed in the east to create the whole "invasion" hysteria.   NATO comes to the rescue, like the good guys they are. They give Ukraine money, weapons, and build military infrastructure that can be studied and used by both countries.   Meanwhile, the western countries run around in panic like a bunch of headless chicken about the "imminent invasion" that's never going to happen. All the while giving more free stuff to Ukraine, and probably Russia indirectly through smuggling.   This is just a theory for fun. Please don't take it seriously.	1644083181.0	slcp80	/r/russia/comments/slcp80/crazy_conspiracy_theory/	Crazy conspiracy theory

a9n149u2	Being from the EU I always assumed Russia hates NATO because it is a rival for power in Europe and it defends democracy, but seeing the comments on r/russia makes me think some people actually fear NATO per threat of invasion. Is that a genuine concern? In the EU there is not even the vaguest possibility of thought that NATO would launch a first strike, since it is by definition a defensive alliance. Plus it is voluntary to join, so shouldn't it be the country's decision anyway? I honestly don't understand why Russia would be threatened, if they don't attack NATO they are basically guaranteed peace. Do people in russia view is differently??

3oqtan3q	So I have been offered a position working in Moscow on this salary. The accomodation is provided in the north east. It's only about 12/16 hours per week, but that does work out as being an hourly wage of 250RUR. Is it enough to live decently on?  EDIT:  Thank you all for your thought out and meaningful responses. I read all of them and verily learned. I have decided not to go ahead with the position, even though contrary to many comments I do believe it would be possible to, well, survive... I guess. In case you're interested I will post the overall pros and cons list I drew up below.     **Moscow**  Pros:  I get a place to live.  Can work on passion projects due to lots of non-working time.  Have time to do extra online work to supplement income.  Experience Russian immersion.  New culture, new language.  Quite a lot of non-working time.  If I don’t do it, I will consider that somewhat of a failure of weakness.  &#x200B;  Cons:  Weather in winter.  Pay atrocious.  Need another job to live ok.  Don’t really want to live in Moscow if in Russia (prefer St. Petersburg).  A bit worried that the employer will exploit me to some extent.  Not really better than Workaway and less attractive location.  Premade rigid curriculum.  All kids (no teaching adults).  Accommodation ‘assured’ but details not provided and photos refused (sketchy).  Cold, curt and examining vibe in recent emails.  Weirdly formal 24-hour decision time NOW for a position starting in September.  Large consensus against QOL online on that wage.  Can’t really recommend it to my partner.  Be really alone unless partner comes along.  Don’t think I’d really vibe that easily with the less liberal culture and might thus find it hard to make friends.   Based on info and details thus unearthed, I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone else.  &#x200B;  Thank you everyone!	1644171602.0	sm3hr3	/r/russia/comments/sm3hr3/is_15000rur_pm_enough_to_live_in_moscow_not/	Is 15000RUR p/m enough to live in Moscow, not including accomodation?

9xpsue8y	**In what sports and disciplines will Russian athletes compete for medals?**  (except for figure skating)  # Cross-Country Skiing  Russian athletes can win 1 gold, 1 or 2 silver and 1 or 2 bronze medals.  [ Alexander Bolshunov ](https://preview.redd.it/ub4ig2kordg81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19390beab4f5ff3b62d70e8377c1b5acd1dab386)  Alexander Bolshunov is the main star for the Russians – he took three silvers and a bronze at the PyeongChang Games. Bolshunov was the first Russian to win the World Cup (twice), won the most difficult Tour de Ski, collected eight World Cup medals, including gold in the skiathlon a year ago. It’s about time he put himself in contention for an Olympic gold medal.  He will be joined by two-time world champion Sergey Ustyugov. He missed out on last season because of a coronavirus, but this year the Russian has had an impressive World Cup start with three individual podiums and a good battle with Johannes Klebo in the relay.  If Alexander Terentyev heals from his micro-injury, he has a good chance to win medals up to gold in the team sprint.  [ Natalia Nepryaeva ](https://preview.redd.it/73lim22trdg81.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af73a9412fa01dc692293c184719acc52ffec566)  Natalia Nepryaeva, who has a bronze medal at the 2018 Olympics, silver (2021) and bronze medals at the World Championships (2019), as well as the first victory in the Tour De Ski for Russian women, will fight for medals. Together with Yulia Stupak, she can compete for a medal in the team sprint as well.   # Biathlon  The team counts on 2 medals in biathlon, one of which is a gold medal. The main hope for the Russians is Alexander Loginov, Eduard Latypov and Kristina Reztsova.  [ Alexander Loginov ](https://preview.redd.it/mb0dnkzyrdg81.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30d9d4ba5dad2177ee0ec758c3a03923c1d3c35f)  # Snowboard/Freestyle  There are going to be a great number of sets of medals in these events – 11 and 13, respectively.  **Russia expects 1 gold, 1 silver and 1 bronze.**  We hope for Dmitry Loginov in snowboarding, who has three World Cup golds under his belt in recent years and is in the top-3 of the World Cup overall standings this season. Vic Wylde, a two-time champion at the 2014 Olympics, retreated into the shadows after his triumph in Sochi, but in the last year he began to return to his former heights.  [ Dmitry Loginov ](https://preview.redd.it/x5l09cy2sdg81.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2df7255a98b66bd541ec1743fa27673392182de)  The mixed cross-country skiing tournament, making its debut at the 2022 Olympics, could also bring medals. Lubov Nikitina, Pavel Krotov and Maksim Burov were first at the 2021 World Championships.  And at other competitions free stylists perform steadily, finding themselves on the podium.  Russia also has a 2021 World Champion in Big-Air - Anastasia Tatalina.  # Hockey  The Russian men’s hockey team is flying to Beijing to defend its Olympic title and, given that there will again be no players from the NHL, has every chance of success.  # Curling  The Russians in Beijing have two teams - the men’s team of Sergey Glukhov and the women’s team of Alina Kovaleva. And for the first time in a long time both our teams have a real chance for medals.	1644226622.0	smm9of	/r/russia/comments/smm9of/to_beijing_for_gold_in_which_sports_will_russia/	To Beijing for gold.

9wy83	Hey guys or privet. I am in a pretty complex situation and want to hear your opinion.   I am from Turkey, My mom is from here and my dad is from Russia (yes it happens this way as well haha although I don't know anyone who had Turkish mother and Russian father it's always the other way round). He's ethnic Russian and from Moscow, Arrived here more than two decades ago then met my mom who's 9 years older than him and had an unhappy marriage before. He became Muslim at least 'on paper' and although I doubt he is a real believer his religion is his obsessive love for my mother lol so I cannot ask for his advice regarding this all because I know he will tell her and this will be a drama. To add every time he mentions his home country it is always negative, like he was glad to leave and never looked back or regretted. My grandma (his mother) also leaves here since I was 6, she taught me some Russian, my father never wanted to do that and always told me this language is useless.  The thing is I began to question whether I wanna stay here or not. It all began the last year when something disturbing happened to me, I won't get in detail right now, let's say I was sexualized by a much older man which honestly is not uncommon here and unfortunately my family couldn't help me sort this out. Instead my mom blamed everything on me cuz she is sort of a religious fanatic (she wasn't like that but turned more obsessed when she became older) and my dad will just listen to her without any critical thinking, so she easily manipulated him into believing I was in the wrong. Luckily it something really wild yet I know many girls and women face some sort of harassment or sexual assault here. Many people want to leave because of backward culture and recent economic crisis etc, I just don't see a future here frankly, I think Turkey will turn into yet another poor and Islamist middle eastern country within the next decade. Although some state in a big city like Istanbul or Izmir you can live more normal life even as a young woman. Sadly I am stuck in a smaller and city and more conservative where my mother originates from.  But the question is not whether I should leave my current country (I am here so for me it is easier to decide than for a random user residing in Russia), but rather if I should consider moving to Russia. I have a very conflicting opinion about it. I once asked my father what would happen if I moved to Russia just as if I got curious and he told me life there is not good, the climate is terrible, everything is filthy (according to him) and political situation is an absolute disaster (he admits things aren't all bright in Turkey as well but says Russia is like 100 times worse which I have hard time buying since it should be like North Korea then). He also stated that because I look mixed/foreign locals will be racist and will call me churka and other slurs, especially because I wear hijab (of course I won't wear it the moment I leave my parents).   My grandma has a little bit more balanced opinion and says it's not that bad in Moscow (where they used to live) but she also mentioned climate and that after 2014 food ban all grocery became crappy and expensive according to her friends she's on phone with. But I feel like her view might be a little bit skewed because here she lives off the pension that Russian government is paying her plus money that my dad gives her so she's on endless vacation while in Moscow she was working a menial job or something like that.  I tried to form my own opinion but it seems like everything is so polarized (well it's something familiar), on one hand many people say Russia is prosperous and thriving country, however media outlets affiliated with the opposition (those that my father consumes from time to time seemingly only to confirm his bias) paint the situation grim and hopeless.  So first of all I am not sure where would I start in case I took the decision (when I turn 18) how easy would that be to emigrate to Russia and will the fact I am half Russian even help? Given the contempt my father feels towards his homeland I am convinced Russian government does not know anything about my mere existence. So will I have to prove my ethnic origin and how much will it help? I heard the education in Russia is cheap (my dad mentioned there are too much students in the country) but I also know there are official exams. I can understand spoken Russian quite well and can read although am not that good and when it comes to grammar my skills are mediocre at best or below, even worse than my English. Do you think I can master my Russian in 2-3 years and how much effort will I have to put? Is it even real to achieve on my own?  My aunt still lives in an apartment which in part is owned by my grandma so if she talks to my aunt I think she can host me at least initially. But otherwise I don't know if I can expect any support from my family. You already know about my father and my mom, well she will be unhappy about that I am sure. None of that was spoken yet but I have no doubt eventually she will start to pressure me into marrying someone, of course that won't happen before I am 18 and likely won't pop-up before I get at least some education, but one day she will be doing that and starts guilt tripping me into marriage with some person (damn sure she already has someone in mind and equally sure I won't be happy about that) cuz that's what she always does and my dad will join her just because he always sides with her.  Lastly, although I hate to reiterate what I asked but I can't decide if it will be worth the hassle and am yet to find out how to approach this. On one hand I despise the lifestyle and culture around me and I always felt like Russia is a place where we somehow belong and can come to in case things at home go south or something happens, but on the other it's pretty much a foreign country where I don't know anyone and am not sure what I am eligible for.  P.S. I am using an account of a person I know because there are certain karma and age limits in this sub and I don't wanna post from my real username just to be clear	1644231997.0	smnnp1	/r/russia/comments/smnnp1/should_i_f15_pursue_moving_to_russia_in_future/	should i, F/15, pursue moving to Russia in future?
