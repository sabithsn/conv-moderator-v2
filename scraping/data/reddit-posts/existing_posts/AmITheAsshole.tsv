fvj70gun	I (28F) love to read. I usually have a couple of books going at once and the people at my local library know me by name. I also love talking about books with other people - I get a lot of good recommendations that way, and it's also a way to bond over a shared interest. My boyfriend (28M) never reads. He does spend a lot of time reading the news, but never books. However, whenever he's a part of one of the conversations, or if anyone asks, he always says that he likes to read. It's also listed as an interest on his resume/ SM. I think he may be embarrassed by/ self-conscious about the fact that he doesn't, as we're pretty nerdy and hang out with nerdy people, and people sometime associate reading with being more intelligent.  This seems like it shouldn't matter, but we've been dating for five years and it's just one of those things that grates on me. Last weekend it happened again, and when I got home I calmly/ politely asked that he stop saying that he likes to read. He got very defensive and said that he does like to read, he read all the time growing up and books are really important to him, but he is too busy to read now. I said that we've been dating for five years and the entire time he hasn't read a single book, and that if you are too busy to read one book in five years, then you don't actually like to read. I also pointed out that when he talks about how he loves hiking/ camping I don't pretend to like them, even though some people might look down on that.  He said that I was being childish, and that it would be one thing if he went around bringing up the topic of reading all the time, but he only talks about it when people ask. AITA for bring up something relatively unimportant that I can tell he's self-conscious about?  Edit: People are saying 'reading the news is reading' - true, I should have clarified that this is specific to talking about reading books  Edit 2: I really appreciate all of the comments here! I see now that I have some reflecting to do, and I appreciate the constructive points. I apologize for any posts that were overly defensive - I've never posted on here before, but I asked for feedback and I appreciate people taking the time to give input.	1642771847.0	s9as8l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9as8l/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_stop_pretending/	AITA For asking my boyfriend to stop pretending that he likes to read?
6bo9xp7k	 i (17F) currently attend a publix university and i live in a coed dorm, but a single gender suite. meaning there are two bedrooms, a small kitchen area, and a bathroom, and 4 girls are assigned to this unit, two in each bedroom. but there are guys living on the same floor, even across the hall, the suites are the only thing that is divided by gender. this wasnt a problem until the very end of last semester and the beginning of this, but my roommate (18F) has been having her ex boyfriend (M18) who lives down the hall from us sleepover multiple nights a week, without even asking me if im comfortable with this, given we share a bedroom. she also has him over multiple times during the day, without even letting me know. there have been occasions when she leaves for work early in the morning and i will wake up alone in my room with him sleeping in her bed and she’s not there. i feel bad for being upset by this but it’s my bedroom too and i didn’t sign up to share a room with two other people, and certainly not a boy. the other night it was around 10 and i was doing homework and they were in bed and i hear them kissing. they did it again the same night when i was in bed after doing my homework. i pay for this dorm too and i feel i have the right to not feel uncomfortable in it. i’m not comfortable having a guy over more times than not, in my living space. it’s only a problem because we share a room and there is quite literally no where else for me to go. i want to tell her i don’t want him sleeping over at all, i’m just simply not comfortable sharing a bedroom at night with a boy. i also want to tell her i’m okay with him being over sometimes during the day but not all the time and certainly not without at least telling me. i know its her room too so i don’t really know if i would be a jerk for making all these rules.	1642772009.0	s9au9d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9au9d/wibta_if_i_tell_my_roommate_to_not_have_her_ex/	WIBTA if i tell my roommate to not have her ex boyfriend sleepover and to have him over during the day less?
hr3weqki	 My friends recently got kicked out of their last house due to (what they said) a roommate who couldn’t stand them. She would complain the the landlord and he eventually told them to leave   my friends had nowhere to go, they’re both 18 and 19 and a couple so they wanted to go somewhere together. It was either live with us or be out in the streets so it was settled.    But now that they live here it’s clear why they were kicked out of their house. We have a small house and they came in with all their stuff. I asked them if they could ask my parents where some of their stuff could be placed since our bedrooms hallway is small. They agreed but later didn’t do it at all. The entire hallway is blocked and they even put stuff in the cabinet that blocks it while it’s my clothing storage. My dad almost can’t get over their stuff to go to bed at night. We made some rules when together.   Like: 1.  when having energy bursts that needs to be released please don’t be hyper indoors after 1:30 am.  my mom can’t go up the stairs due to a heart operation she had in the past. She sleeps in the living room.  2. Don’t smoke upstairs. They lied to us about it multiple times. Cause everytime I open their door  I see an ash bucket in the room.  also noticeable that when having cigs new they not much later need new ones, but barely having been downstairs   3. Laundry: make either a schedule to do so or wait until ours is done.  4. Make sure people can sleep. 5. Please pay rent. We asked the 3 times less than the minimum Cause more electric bills is something my parents can’t pay. (They shower for one and a half hours and leave all electricity on all day despite the fact them knowing it’s gonna cost them a lot) 6. Pay for own food.(they  ignore that since all condiments are all empty and I’m talking about a 4 tubes of mayo. They only live on junkfood)  Worst of all they have their own special sleep schedule  due to sleeping at 6 am willingly and waking up at 5pm.   Their tv is against the wall that is connected to my room. If I ask if the volume can go lower via phone or knocking they ignore it or barely lower the volume. I have lost a lot of sleep due to that and am happy now if I get 4 hours of sleep because of them   We gave them an extra month for rent. But they evade the question on wether they will make it. This situation has caused a few arguements between my parents   The rent is due soon. But they planned to visit grandparents then, they planned this after the rent date was discussed.  My dad is willing to kick them out if they don’t pay it by then, cause they’re almost causing my parents debt. And I know this.  So am I the asshole for not telling them	1642772570.0	s9b0m4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b0m4/aita_for_not_telling_my_friends_theyre_getting/	AITA for not telling my friends they’re getting kicked out soon
5tjharga	We have been friends for almost 8 years and roommates for 2. Everything was fine until she (22F) got a new boyfriend (21M) a couple months ago. It just so happened to be on my (23F) birthday. They didn’t even tell me happy birthday or hang out with me, which would be fine but we already made plans to go out. And it has been 8 months since they first started dating and he has been living with us since that day 8 months ago. Like going straight to work and then back to our house to take a shower and eat our food and sleep. He does not pay rent or utilities and I have talked to my roommate numerous times about it and she said well he doesn’t really live here so that would be rude. When I was getting ready to move a month ago I started taking my thing from our shared spaces, like pots and pans and stuff like that. The roommate would yell at me saying her boyfriend needs that stuff to cook for them.   Along with stupid stuff like that they would leave the door unlocked all night so her boyfriend could get in overnight and still leave it unlocked when he came in. I was fuming when I found this out because we lived in a not safe area. He would also always take my paid parking spot, only when I wasn’t there because I was at work. I had to walk across a dark parking lot to get to my house because of this. When I moved out I unfriended her and haven’t talked to her. My other friends say I am being an asshole and I don’t think I am.	1642772781.0	s9b2vz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b2vz/aita_for_unfriending_my_friend_of_8_years/	AITA for unfriending my friend of 8 years?
iupl6tlx	I have a lot of issues with my fiancé mom. She is very young to have a son getting married and I think that’s part of the issue. We are still in the same stage in life kind of and she gets competitive or insecure because I did things more traditionally and am getting married and having kids in the traditional order and getting married younger. I’ll call her Ava for this post. She’s been pretty awful to me but thankfully she is getting married around the same time as us and gives zero shits about out engagement or wedding.  The other day we saw Ava at a family members house and I was going through pictures on my phone showing his cousin some stuff and the cousin saw a picture of Ava and loudly demanded to know why I had pictures of her in a bikini and called me weird.   I totally forgot that was there but honestly Ava talked a lot of shit about how I was proposed to and me and my friends were having a laugh at her Instagram pics about getting engaged.   Ava heard and asked why and called me creepy. I was honest that we were making fun of her proposal and it was nothing creepy but she demanded to see and snatched the phone out of my hand.  I saw red and I told her she’d just committed a crime and she had one second to put the phone back in my hand and apologize. Instead she ran behind a table and was taunting me. Her fiancé said something nasty about my body and I lost it and said she could give me the phone or I’d call 911 because she was literally committing a crime.  She took a picture angled down kind of sexy and gave the phone back and said there for your collection and I just lost my shit crying. My fiancé said she’s uninvited from the wedding, which she didn’t seem to care as we left with me crying.  I texted her this morning that she is a their and doesn’t respect boundaries so she isn’t welcome in our home until she apologizes in front of everyone who witnessed that.	1642772982.0	s9b560	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b560/aita_for_banning_my_fiancés_mom_from_out_home/	AITA for banning my fiancé’s mom from out home unless she gives me a public apology?
7nfniq82	This happened a while ago but recently came to mind and I would like outside judgement.  For a ~6 month period I (19 at time) had 2 * 3 month university courses with a small group of students, 20> or so. We all got along well and ate lunch in a common area that was used solely by us except on rare occasions.  We brought stuff from home and there was no rules against what could be brought in just about cleaning up after yourself etc., no one was allergic to anything at least not severely. I can't remember anyone complaining about anything that someone brought, just curious questions or requests to taste.   Here I should ad that at the time I was pescatarian. I ate vegetarian but also seafood, and since we studied in a harbour town known for it's fish markets meant I bought and ate a lot of fish. 3-4 times a week I cooked fish, shrimp, clams etc. I cooked a meal every night, and lefterovers were brought to lunch the next day. I used the microwaves if it was supposed to be eaten hot, and nobody had any issues with any supposedly bad smell. I'd say on the contrary, people often wanted a taste based on the smell. Just like I often wanted a taste when a student of Indian heritage brought home cooked food, it smelled delicious!  At the start of the course a new student joined us. Immediately on first day lunch she complained about the smell of my heated food. She absolutely hated fish and said that I wasn't allowed to bring it for lunch. I said that there was no rule against this. But her complaints just increased in frequency and intensity.  Finally I caved and stopped heating fish dishes in the microwave, I cooked cold variations like salads, sandwiches etc OR warm vegetarian dishes instead as a compromise.   Apparently not good enough. She complained even when I heated vegetarian and said it "smelled fishy" or wouldn't believe it was vegetarian. I had to complete stop bringing in anything related to fish. I said it was honestly ridiculous to demand this since I would basically completely change my dietary habits when I already had compromised. I also pointed out that I never complained about the citrus fruits she often peeled and ate at lunch even though I found that smell really strong. She claimed that to be completely different and that I was just an inconsiderate asshole.  Her demeanour towards me only got worse and my nearest friends in the class informed me that she was lying about me behind my back about what a terrible person I was. I believe most people think I had been accommodating enough when I stopped heating fish dishes since they honestly couldn't smell anything anymore when asked. But a couple of people said that I was a jerk but mostly because I "knew" my food would set her off, even if they didn't care about the food per se.  Lunch went from being a fun time of food and socialising, to mostly stiff atmospher with passive agressive comments and dirty looks.   Was ITAH for not giving in?	1642773160.0	s9b7jy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b7jy/aita_for_continuing_to_bring_fish_for_lunch/	AITA for continuing to bring fish for lunch?
ivcnvxhv	My (69F) daughter (32F) and I live next door to each other.  One night a week, she goes and stays the night with her boyfriend, and I look in on her cat.  A while ago, after washing up the cat bowls, I threw out her kitchen sponge, because I thought it was grimy, and pulled out a new one.  I did the same thing again last week, for the same reason.  This week, when I went over, I saw a note in the kitchen saying, "please don't throw out my kitchen sponges, thanks!"  When I saw her the next morning, I asked her about it, and she said that it was frustrating that I was doing that, because there was really nothing wrong with her sponge, she had only been using it a couple weeks, and she had washed it a couple times during that time.  I said that it seemed grimy to me.  She got annoyed and said that she doesn't like that she will come home sometimes to find that I've moved something, or cleaned something.  I told her that I'm just trying to be helpful and that I'm nice enough to look in on her cat, and I don't want to be in an environment that I don't think is clean enough.    She said that she is very appreciative that I look in on her cat and she tells me that all of the time, but that if I can't just come in to take care of the cat and leave without messing with her stuff then I don't have to come anymore.  She said that the cat will be fine overnight alone.  She feeds him wet food before she leaves in the evening, he gets fed dry by automatic feeder twice while she's gone, and she will feed him wet when she gets home the next morning.  I don't want the cat to be home alone for that long because I think it's not fair, but she's not budging with this.  AITA to have taken it upon myself to do a few things here and there around the house?	1642773163.0	s9b7ln	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b7ln/aita_for_changing_out_my_daughters_kitchen_sponges/	AITA for changing out my daughters kitchen sponges?
ivbr3k6r	My fiancé has two teenage children with his ex. His ex can be extremely inappropriate towards him but he claims that’s just her personality. For some context she works in the entertainment industry and I guess is kind of sexy/flirty with everyone but it is very upsetting when i feel like I live in her shadow.  His mom adores her. His kids obviously want their mom but I totally respect that she is the kids mom and will always be in the picture.  The other day they went to one of their daughters games and out to eat and he dropped her at our house to get her car. I asked him why her shirt was wet and he said he rolled the car window down so she’d get hit with a sprinkler. He’s a big prankster and has done similar to me but I just seemed inappropriate with her.  She rolled her eyes and told me to calm down it was just a joke and that I need to grow up and I’m prudish and dumb. They chatted for a few minutes and I took our hose and sprayed her because like she said it’s just water.  She got really mad and said some nasty things. He kind of laughed but also said I shouldn’t have done it and now I’m concerned because his daughters aren’t speaking to me and the older one cussed me out before she left for school.	1642773485.0	s9bbby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9bbby/aita_for_spraying_my_fiancés_ex_with_a_hose/	AITA for spraying my fiancé’s ex with a hose?
ivbywuq3	  My brother 20M got a girl pregnant and my father (mom died long back), her parents convinced the girl to keep the baby as they are heavily religious.   I (25F) thought it was an extremely bad idea and told the same to my brother. I am not in contact with my father due to religious differences. The girl wanted to go to college and did not want to have a kid. However, my father convinced her parents to take care of the baby while she/my brother goes off to college and they can help out in weekends and holidays. They would have to take care of the baby completely once they have graduated. My brother cut contact with me because he felt that i was trying to ruin his future family.   Well, the girl and her parents passed away when the baby was 6 months old and my father was struggling to take care of a baby while my brother was at college. He told my brother that he has to take the baby while my brother was attending university full time. My brother refused but my father just drove to his college and handed him the baby and drove off.  Now, my brother and I live in the same city and he is asking me to take care of the baby until he graduated. He told me that he would come to my place the second his college is over for the day. He wants me to watch the baby Mon-Fri 6 am - 6 pm. I told him that was not going to happen. He begged me and my father. When he kept bothering me with this, I told him that this is not what I signed up for and he told me that this wasn't what he signed up for either.   I told him that this was exactly what he signed up for from the second that they decided to keep the baby. He did not think of the worst case scenario and was not prepared. He is devastated over her death and from what I know, he loves his child and spends every moment away from college with her (weekends, holidays, winter/summer breaks). He was extremely close with his gf and her parents. He is coping with their death too.   I travel a lot and I would have to ask for a demotion to be able to stay at home. I think this is too much to ask of me. Especially considering that they haven't spoken to me in years. I sent post and messages  congratulating when she born but no one replied to me.	1642774213.0	s9bkg6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9bkg6/aita_for_telling_my_brother_and_father_that_this/	AITA for telling my brother and father that this is exactly what he signed up for when he is struggling with a year old baby girl after her mom and grandparents passed away?

iogqc3co	My brother (M28) and I (M30) didn't grow up together. He grew up with our father and I grew up with our mother. Once a month, he would go to my house so we could play and interact and on summer break, I would go to my father's house.  Since he is 7, he would steal things from my house when he'd get mad. If we had a small fight, really normal for children, he would take something with him in his pockets. Nothing too expensive, things like food, pencils, etc. Some hours later, my Dad would bring him back and he would return what he got and he'd apologize.   As the years went by, it got worse. Our relatives started to notice and it got to a point where he was put into psychological treatment when he was 12. This made our relationship fall apart and I just lost total interest in interacting with him.  When he was 14, he got addicted to drugs and was selling the things he'd steal from our relatives' houses. He got smart, nobody would notice and even his treatment wasn't helping.  Days before going to college I had a big fight with my family because he'd stolen some of my money and they got really mad when I suggested putting him into a drug rehab we had in my city. Days after I left, they agreed and he was put into rehab.  Almost 12 years later, without any type of contact with my family, my bother somehow got my number and called me, saying he'd need a house to stay in a few days as he was planning to break up with his girlfriend.  I asked for our mom's number and he gave it, so I called her and she updated me on what happened in those 12 years. For the first 7 years, my brother got free from drug addiction and wasn't stealing for them at all, but after that, he got back into smoking small amounts and expensive things were vanishing from my relatives after he'd visited them, but according to her: "last year, we all talked to him and now he is not doing drugs anymore". But according to some other relatives he still is both doing drugs, stealing and that I shouldn't let him stay at my house.  I got confused so I found his Facebook and he still looks like an addict, but his girlfriend looks like a good and healthy person, so I don't think she is an addict. Plus, it looks like they make good money, so I don't understand why he'd be stealing.  Today, he called me and I told him I wouldn't allow him to stay in my house. He got mad, saying he had nowhere to go, as non of our relatives, including our parents, would let him stay at their houses. My girlfriend thinks I should let him stay, but I think he might be a danger to our son (2 months old), as he doesn't like children and he might be an addict still.

iun8i6v1	I (29f) have a precious beautiful three year old daughter.  Her birthday was on New Year's Day, and she turned three years old.  My husband and I decided to make it a Birthday Party in conjunction with inviting family and friends for the New Year celebration also.  We decided that we would invite around 25 people for the birthday party.  My brother, Randy (24m) invited his friend Rob (23m) to the birthday party also.  I wasn't too happy about Randy inviting Rob, but decided not to say anything at this time.    The party is going on and everybody is coming over, and hugging and kissing my daughter, and wishing her happy birthday.  I notice that Rob picks up my daughter, and is holding her in his hands and wishes her a happy birthday also.  I don't think he did anything wrong, but I told my husband that I had bad energy and karma from Rob holding my daughter.  He told me that I was being ridiculous, and there was no ill will.    I disregarded my husband's opinion, and subsequently politely went over to Rob, and told him, "please don't pick up my daughter or touch her or he couldn't stay at the New Year/Birthday Party.  My daughter, only wants to be held by immediate family members."  He didn't verbally answer, but nodded his head in agreement.  About an hour later, I notice Rob dancing with my daughter, where his hands were interlocked with her hands.  I agree that he did have a few drinks, and could have been drunk or tipsy, but I was so frustrated after I warned him, and he agreed.    I subsequently asked him to leave very politely.  Rob blurts out  "bye everyone, I am not wanted here anymore".  Randy, yells at me, saying that I ruined his New Years, and walks out with Rob.  My parents both agree that I was an asshole for kicking him out of the party, but they stayed until the end.  My husband, told me that he thought the behavior was innocuous, and I overreacted.

iuevag95	I (24F) have always had a different relationship with my mother (50F), where I’m more of a friend/care giver to her - she often says I’m her best friend. The only exception is if I do something she doesn’t agree with and she switches into “parent mode” which often involves yelling. I know everything about her life from relationship, divorce, health problems, I think that gives the picture.  I’m a perpetual student so of course I have loans. I’ve been in university every year since high school (undergraduate and graduate).In high school obviously I had no idea what I was doing so my mother did my loans application and had all the logins (up until after high school she also knew and wouldn’t let me change all the passwords to my social media and email). Every January, my mother took a portion of my student loan/grant money that gets deposited right into my bank account (usually $1000, which wasn’t the whole deposit) and said that that portion of the money is actually used to cover “taxes”. Trusting my mother, I never questioned this.  This past month I thought it was odd that it never got deposited into my bank. I called the student loans office and my information on file had been changed to my younger sister’s banking info (this has happened in the past but was fixed at some point). I texted my sister and she had no idea what money I was talking about, she never spent it. I texted my mother and she said she must have put the wrong bank information in this year. When I asked about the money she said all of it had to cover the “taxes” this year. I was disappointed because extra money would have been nice but not vital. Being older and more interested in finances than when I was younger, I asked if she could explain why the government doesn’t just keep that tax money instead of giving it to me and then having to give it back. She got really defensive, didn’t explain and accused me of thinking she was doing something sneaky. She’s the type of mother where if you try to be honest she goes “well I guess I’m just the worst mother in the world”.  Long story short, I made some calls, googled and asked friends with similar loans and can’t find anything on this “tax”. The only thing that came up was a tax deduction people paying off interest on their loans are eligible for, which is not my situation.  I’ve been wrong about some things in the past with my mother and I think there’s a potential Im just being dramatic here.

al9vvkly	Long time lurker, first time poster. Posting from main because I literally do not have the energy to make a new account for this. English is not my native language, I'm on phone, so please excuse any grammatical and formatting issues.  I(enby, 24) live in the first floor of a two story house owned by my parents. My dad bought the house to stay close to his parents but then had to relocate for work to a smaller town, and I wanted to come back to the city for college and they didn't want to pay more for a dorm or a hostel so I stay here.   My grandfather passed away in 2018. Before he died, we had a nurse who looked after him. Shortly after he passed away, she(45ish,F) moved with her family - husband (early 50s), and two sons (20, 24)in the ground floor of my parents house because their rent went up and they were looking for a place, my parents talked to them and offered them the place at a BIG discount as a gratitude for taking care of my grandfather till the last day. Cut to chase, they are HORRIBLE people to share a house with. Different floors, and yet I can hear them yelling, things would often go missing (we're very big on community which refuses to respect boundaries culturally and she would often come and go as she pleases), etc etc, and parents would refuse to serve them the 30 days notice because they were in "debt of her". Anyway, they moved out in 2020 October after they bought their own house. I was super relieved.   It's been almost a year and half now, and yet I get mail of the sons regularly, usually from their banks. One even had their debit card! (I didn't open it, it had a small transparent window and was visible from the outside.) I have forwarded all their mails and let them know that they need to change their mailing address. It has not happened, I am getting a little tired of it. I again received some mail a couple of days ago, so they clearly haven't listened to me for the last year. I don't want to keep forwarding them their mail anymore, it's not my responsibility, I have been doing it as a courtesy until now but now I'm starting to feel otherwise.

ivelgcp3	Me (22F) and my fiancé (23M) got a very high energy puppy a couple months back. At the time I did not think it was a good idea because we had an infant. I’m a SAHM so my partner thought it would be okay to go ahead and get the dog and I could take care of it. I expressed that it would be hard for me to do that and give the dog all the exercise and attention it needs due to the fact I have to pay attention to our baby. He said that it was okay and whenever he was home from work he would exercise and play with the dog. Fast forward to now. This high energy dog is getting less than half the exercise he needs and I am the one who feeds, potties, and watches the dog. I firmly told him that the dog needs at least 2 hours of exercise a day and that he needed to take him out when he’s home. He did good for a few days but now it’s always the excuse that he’s tired or it’s to cold out or he would take him on one really short walk.  I feel absolutely awful for the dog because he’s not getting the exercise he needs and I can’t do it due to my partner not wanting to watch our kid when he’s home or just falling asleep when he gets home. So WIBTA if I threaten to get rid of the dog to either make him understand that he needs to do better by the dog or find someone who will?	1642777253.0	s9cnoq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9cnoq/wibta_if_i_threatened_to_get_rid_of_the_family_dog/	WIBTA if I threatened to get rid of the family dog?
dl6m8bpk	Dyslexic and on mobile  Info My fiance and his mother had a falling out and not even a week after I proposed (Christmas Eve) his sister tried to take over and with the wedding date so close 2 APR we agreed to hire a wedding planner. She is great she takes our ideas and makes them perfect.   Now FSIL has apologised and fiance asked if she'd like to help with the wedding (I'll admit that I'm not as forgiving as my fiance so I might of been a bit short with her)with the promise that she doesn't try and take over again. Today FSIL asked when were we going to firer our wedding planner to which we replied that we weren't going to firer her. she's doing a great job. To which FSIL started saying that we were wasting our money and now that she back helping we didn't need her. Fiance said that we were not firing her she almost as this wedding complete plan all thats left are the small things eg: suits. FSIL said that we should go through the plan just to make sure it what we want. I replied you mean to see if it's what you want (that might of been assholish). The conversion went down hill from there.   Now that I had some time to think about I might of been looking for an signs of her trying to take over again (she really hurt fiance feelings last) that I might of overreacted.  So AITA?

ivfamug1	Disclaimer: New to reddit, my sister recommended it to me.  Currently, my son \[14m\] is really interested in music. He spends hours every night at home practising with his guitar and has joined a local theatre group which meets twice a week.  Other than school, his only other commitment is football ⚽. He has been playing since he was nine and he is now playing every game in the season, whereas previously he had been a reserve. He’s met great friends through football and lots of his friends from school play as well. Being on the team gives him the opportunity to travel to compete in different tournaments, teaches him teamwork and commitment, and it's the only thing that keeps him active as he doesn’t enjoy PE in school.  However, my son has recently decided that he wants to quit football to focus wholeheartedly on his music. I’m proud of his passion and ability, but do think that he would be remiss to give up football at this stage. Yes, it does take up two nights of his week, but he would be a lot less active and a lot less social if he did not go. I have told him that he should wait out this season and then if he doesn’t want to join the Under 16s squad next year, that is his decision, but he is very annoyed with me and thinks I am only forcing him to play football because he is a boy, which I am not.  My sister, who has two sons, thinks that I am indeed TA here as her son \[12m\] has quit multiple sports/clubs before he found his love of tennis. I do not like the idea of forcing my children into anything that they don’t want to do, but I do feel that there are more benefits of him participating than just sitting in our garage with his guitar all night.  Can any other parents relate to this? Am I the asshole here?

ivfsgthb	I (21F) am studying Computer Engineering. My best friend Mike (21M) and our other friend Allie (21F) come from wealthy families that pay for their university education. My family pays for uni and supports me as well but I grew up poor unlike my friends.   I’ve been working odd jobs since I was 16y. I’ve been a babysitter, production worker, waitress and for the past two years technical support on and off( this is a fancy way of saying I tell your grandma to restart her frozen computer screen). Both Mike and Allie have never ‘approved’ of my odd jobs. They believe I should only work if it’s related to my major. I’ve ignored them through the years because I landed a 4-month internship this summer while the two of them have yet to find a degree related job.   I have been off work for about 4 months and my parents have no issues supporting me financially and leave it up to me to decide whether I want a job for some extra cash (my dad and I have an ‘existence agreement’ which means he sends me enough money to have a roof over my head and food to eat). If I want to go clubbing, travel or do anything considered ‘fun’ that is my business and he does not pay. I like this deal because it definitely motivates me to work.   So, I applied for a tech support position and to my surprise got the offer of a lifetime. I’d be making twice as much as what is industry standard. If I was to work a degree related job it will take me over a year to reach that salary and that is if I am lucky. Only catch is that they want me full time with the option of a part-time position in a few months.  This was discussed in my family and after the job promised to take into consideration my uni schedule I signed with them. I informed Allie and Mike, anticipating their rant about it being a menial job.  Surprisingly Allie was excited for me and congratulated me but Mike started saying this was such a bad decision and went on a ludicrous rant how this actually hurts my resume somehow. I told him that I did not ask about his opinion and that he is being childish. He said I don’t accept criticism and I am being an asshole and he is just looking out for me.  AITA?

4tggrbug	To begin, my roommate and I are both veterinary students at SGU. This is an island school with plenty of island mutts running around in not great shape. I (22F) and my roommate (26F) live in an apartment with a 2 dog maximum. However, we fostered a puppy two semesters ago as she was waiting for surgery. Before this puppy came home, roommate asked if I minded and assured me she would take complete care of her. I said sure provided she was vaccinated, dewormed, and healthy. She assured me she was. We both have personal dogs and my dog is immune compromised, so this is obviously very important.  After the dog had been there for about a month, regularly interacting with my dog, I found out the roommate lied. The dog was not vaccinated and in fact had several tick borne diseases she was undergoing treatment for. Additionally, I ended up caring for her quite a bit and the roommate would get angry if I didn’t. Fine, she was a cutie and I didn’t mind. The dog was later adopted.   My roommate went back to school earlier than I did this semester, so she was at the apartment by herself. After about a week I noticed on my roommates snapchat that she posted a photo of a large dog and two very young (like 2 week old) puppies, clearly in our apartment. She never said anything to me about this. When I asked her, she said “oh yeah, I told you about this! I’m fostered a mama dog and her two puppies.” I told her she did not tell me about this, and asked 1.) if they were all healthy and 2.) how long they were staying. She claimed they were perfectly healthy and it was only for a few days. I dropped the subject.   This week I find out the dogs are all still there, and they have been to the vet multiple times for health issues. Additionally, it turns out there were more puppies, but several of them died (unknown of what) before my roommate brought the others home. She also lied to a friend of mine and said the mama dog was perfectly healthy so he would agree to adopt her. Didn’t mention the puppies at all, then just brought them to his house and said “oh I told you she had puppies!“ and made him feel like a terrible person for refusing to take them.   Here’s where I might be the asshole. I told her that these dogs need to be out within the next couple days, she needs to pay to have the apartment professionally cleaned since the puppies were sick, and that under no circumstances is she to bring another animal into the apartment without asking me first. She freaked out on me and now I have her family and the entire shelter animal club messaging me berating me for being so callous, and saying I shouldn’t be a vet if I hate stray animal this much.

2qqnst1	I refused to go to my cousins wedding even though we considered each other sisters or best friends. A tad bit of backstory; So my cousin/roommate (20F) has been lying about everything to make my husband and I villains in my family. Things like saying we stole money from her or we treated her really bad emotionally. Even to the point that when he almost died in the hospital from an unrelated car accident, my family refused to support us financially. This is because she told them the accident was a scam to get money. I didn’t hang around my family often enough after the accident so I didn’t find out about the lies for a while till her step sister confronted us. It was so backwards from how my cousin/roommate acted around us that I didn’t believe it for a while till she stole money from us because the accident funds were apparently supposed to be split amongst us three. Even my husband shrugged off the funds being split because he believed she needed it and that’s why she took it. So that’s where I kinda feel iffy about our relationship and where she really starts twisting our conflicts.   A few months after the accident she went to elope to her boyfriend of 2weeks. I of course told the family because I still cared about her. No one believed me thanks to her and she told them that she was actually planning a wedding not eloping. At this point I knew the full extent of her manipulation on my family because she managed to once again turn them against me. They chalked it up to me being cruel to my cousin by starting drama. But she knew what I did and refused to invited me to her “plan B” wedding for a majority of the wedding planning. Again, this wedding is only taking place because she was caught eloping by me and now she has to play through her lie. She then continued to lie about a lot of things like lack of money, her relationship, etc, to get people to pay for her wedding including her church paying for her venue. It is important to note that this wedding would not take place if everyone knew the truth. I won’t go into detail here it’s just how our family works.  After the lying about inviting me and my family pressuring me to go, I still said no. I love her, but I refused to go unless she personally invited me, apologized, and told me the truth about her lies. I need this because I need confirmation. However, according to her, that’s ‘too low’ for her. She was so upset and went to the family once again so she can play the hopeless bride whose wedding is ruined by me. They told me I have to accept her invite to the wedding or she will be really upset and my family will cut me off. And they plan to, because I am supposed to be the better person and look past our apparent “misunderstandings”. Even my parents and husband think I’m being a little bit of an asshole for not wanting to go and making her upset on her wedding day.   Am I the asshole for refusing to go?	1642780169.0	s9dqih	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9dqih/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_cousins_wedding/	AITA For Refusing to go to my Cousins Wedding
4q97mi3	A while ago, I received a message on FB from a girl I was with in high school, telling me that she was planning to delete me from her friends list because I had never been nice to her. I replied that there was no problem since we never spoke to each other in 10 years and that it was her who had insisted on having me as a friend and that I did not understand what she meant about not being nice to her. She replied that it was because I'm obviously racist because I didnt want to be her friend in hightschool. I'm not going to play the "I have friends from different cultures" but it is true and my mother always taught me to respect each other's culture and to defend those who are victims of racism or any  kind of discrimination . To tell the truth, we had nothing in common, I was very discreet and I only played video games while she spent her time to talk about herself and her dresses. She was really disrespectful to everyone and even stole my last art homework of the year. I then explained to her that I had no memory of it, especially since I had just lost my mother, I was an orphan so I clearly had other priorities than flattering her ego. She got angry saying that my behavior was bad and that was not  a good excuse, that I should have been nice to her because she wanted to be my friend and I should have done what she wanted when I spent my days cring. She finally said that I had harassed her for three years so I explain to her that she must clearly made a mistake and have the wrong girl because we had been in the same class for only two years and that I myself had been harassed  during my first year in high school and spent my days alone. She didn't want to hear anything and I ended up blocking her by telling her that now I had no more time to waste with parasites like her. I found later that she had sent the same message to two other people. I'm sure I wasn't mean to her in high school, but I feel bad for insulting her like that.

3fm5d0kr	Okay so I (f21) am a very private person, even to my family. I have to put here that we're all asian.   So my mum (f50) has this habit of sleeping in my bed when something happens in her room.   My dad argued with her?  Sleep in my bed My dad turned the aircon too cold? Sleep in my bed She sleeps better because of the change of environment? Sleep in my bed.   Now, here's the thing. My room is extremely sacred to me, and I do a lot of private things here that I don't like to do with people around. So I hate it when people sleep in my room. (I only have 1 bed, so if you're sleeping in my room, you're sleeping in my bed) I get anxious and upset when anyone is like "can I sleep with you? '  The answer is no. Do anything else, but leave me the fuck alone at night. It's my private time.   Anyways, so my dad got sick, and she doesn't wanna sleep in the same room as him. Fair enough.   But she wants to sleep in mine.   Logically, yes I should let her sleep in my room. I'm the only one with excess space in my bed, and if not, she needs to sleep on the couch.   But she makes me so anxious and upset and there was once she slept in my room for a week straight, I couldn't take it and had a mental breakdown and cried. So I said 'no'  And she's like " when you'll move out, I'm free to sleep in any room, it wouldn't be such a bother to all of you'  And "I paid for this house, wdym I can't sleep in your room, do you want me to sleep on the couch and ruin my back? '  And here's the thing, one night is fine, whatever  I'll deal with it. But we don't know how long my dad's gonna be sick for, so if she sleeps in my room for like a week or so, I'm gonna lose it and damage our relationship. So ofc I said no. Sigh... Am I the asshole for saying no to her?   Tldr: mum makes me anxious when she sleeps in my bed, I can break down and cry, but she has to sleep in my bed because she can't share a room with my sick dad. But I said no to her.

73ra4e9c	So recently my friends M/14 and F/14 have been spending a lot of time with a guy who’s almost 20. The guy doesn’t have a job or even a highschool diploma and he sits inside all day playing Minecraft with them. Now at first I didn’t pay any attention to it as I was just happy that they had found a new friend but after awhile it got kinda creepy. They would spend all day with this guy that we don’t even know and they had done the whole cliche discord matching pfps and bios that made it look like they were dating. When I mentioned how creepy this guy was they all blocked me and refuse to talk to me now. Am I the ass for not trusting this guy?	1642780813.0	s9dz23	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9dz23/aita_for_being_suspicious_of_my_friends_online/	AITA for being suspicious of my friends online friend?
c01uq76m	This is a wild one. (Long story, but CRAZY.)  So my MIL married my FIL (husband's stepdad) when my husband was 12. My husband's bio dad was abusive, and my FIL stepped up and gave hubby the best childhood possible to make up for the miserable early years.  When my husband was based in Italy while in the military. His mom came to visit him, got drunk on wine, and told him, "I'm divorcing your stepdad because he's been depressed so he doesn't want to have sex. I need someone who will fill my sexual needs."  She followed through and divorced my FIL, but my husband still considered him to be his dad and celebrated Christmas with my FIL instead of with his mom.  A few years later, MIL decided she wanted him back, and FIL agreed to get remarried because he didn't like living by himself. She's been miserable to live with, though. She is mentally unstable, refuses to contribute in any way to the household, and talks to my FIL like he is dirt. Yet my FIL continues to take good care of her and has nursed her back to health after multiple illnesses.  Then she texts my husband on a Thursday and says, "I want you to help me pack my stuff and then transport everything to another state. I'm divorcing your stepdad again because he isn't having enough sex with me."  AGAIN?!  She didn't even tell my husband's brother. She only told my husband because she wanted help moving. I said that I didn't want him to go because I don't think he should be enabling her behavior by helping her move and I had plans to spend time with him that Saturday.  She ended up calling and said, "Nevermind. I don't want you to be mad at me." He said, "I'm not mad at you," even though he was. And THIS WOMAN had the audacity to say, "You're making things awkward."  So fast-forward a few weeks. My FIL is a saint and is packing up all of her things and committing to drive them down to her just to be kind and help her despite what she was doing to him. My MIL calls my husband and says, "I want you to drive down with your dad so he doesn't have to make the trip alone."  My husband says, "I'll have to talk to my wife about it."  And she replies with, "Why do you need to talk to her? What, you can't do anything without asking her? You don't need her permission."  Excuse me?!  He said, "I can't just drive to another state without talking to my wife about it."  When he told me, I strongly objected to him helping move her stuff for her. I didn't like what she said about him not needing to talk to me, and I still don't think he should be enabling her behavior. If she wants to move, she should be an adult, pack her own things, and have them moved. I told my husband that he could go if he felt morally obligated, but that I wish he wouldn't.  My family thought I was being awful because I shouldn't object to my husband helping his mother, but I still don't think that I am being unreasonable.  What do you think?	1642781021.0	s9e26p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9e26p/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_shouldnt_help/	AITA for telling my husband that he shouldn't help his mom? (CRAZY story)
37ay6hmn	This just happened and I feel really bad, and I think I was a bit of an a-hole here.  So I get hormone treatments that are not covered by my insurance, so I pay out of pocket and it’s not cheap.  I go to the office and get a pellet inserted in the fat of my butt cheek and it slowly releases hormones for for 3-4 months.  I’m on my second pellet.  So when you get the pellet they have to monitor your hormones through blood work.  You are supposed to go at 4 weeks after the pellet insertion so they can see if you need another one inserted or if the dosage was good.  So after the first pellet I called to get my script to get the blood work and the receptionist had NO CLUE what I was talking about.  No idea about hormone pellets, getting blood work, nothing.  I kinda chalked it off to maybe she was new.  So she said she needed to leave a message for the dr and would get back to me.  To make this a shorter story, it took 3 weeks of phone tag and people not knowing what I was asking for before I finally got my blood work done.  That made it at week 7, which is too late to get a good read on if the dosage was correct.  So fast forward to pellet 2.  I told the dr about the fiasco getting my blood work done and asked if he could write the script then so I didn’t have to call and get the run around again.  He did and at 4 weeks I go to get the blood work but the phlebotomist couldn’t read one of the requests.  So she called their office to ask and cue no one having any idea what she is asking about.  Now I have to mention that the hormone stuff is taken care of at a satellite office and the main office is the one who seems to have no idea about what treatments they do…but I think they should have an idea what sort of doctor they work for.  The poor phlebotomist was put on hold three times and was getting really frustrated so I asked her to just hand me the phone.  While on hold I told her we should just call the satellite office because the main office never knows what I’m talking about!  And the receptionist heard that and said “are you referring to me?” And I said “yes, when I call it always seems no one knows what I’m talking about” and that obviously upset her.  She then told me to just call the satellite office which we did and they answered the phlebotomists questions immediately.  I feel like my comment was kinda rude, but I also feel like they should be more aware of what the doctors in their office actually do or at least where to go to get questions from patients answered.

I asked him to work 35-40 hours a weeks to help pay for bills and grow our savings. His current job is out of season and he’s only been getting 10 hours so he got a second one. I usually work 40+ hours on breaks and 20 during classes.    He has only worked a few shift in his new job. He wants to quit but I’m asking to find another job first. He really does not like the work and it gives him bad anxiety. If they were being inappropriate or awful to him I would agree to him quitting on the spot but that’s not the case.    He is really salty and anxious when I told him that. I tried to accommodate and told him he could quit in a few days if he puts in multiple applications to other places.   Well this morning he said he was sick and I asked him if he needed anything/ what’s wrong. Turns out he was not sick but was having anxiety about going to work. I comforted him and tried to help but he promised me he would hold out a bit longer. I strait up said “babe you promised me you would go for a couple more days, this isn’t keeping that promise”    He is pretty salty and upset at me.

csntjzsr	So I 24f have been living with my boyfriend in one of his grandparents rental homes. We have two roommates (both male) because we wanted to make the rent dirt cheap so we can save for a house. Now the house is three bedroom but it’s basically a trailer on a foundation. So space is VERY tight.   So our roommate met this girl three weeks ago and finally brought her up to meet the gang and she spent the night. Well that night has turned into a week and a half. Two nights ago  my boyfriend was sitting on the couch playing games and she was sitting in there with him and the roommate calls her and they start discussing her moving in. My boyfriend not wanting to make a scene waited up for the roommate to get home so he could talk to him about her not being able to move in. He seemed to understand and said that he would take her home in the morning(she doesn’t drive) he never took her home yesterday and we let her slide for one more night. well last night they were sitting in the living room and they are on the phone and start discussing her moving in again.   My boyfriend who is sitting there flabbergasted didn’t say anything and waited for me to get home. We were talking and realized that we were on the same page about her not moving in. What bothered us the most was that she doesn’t work and doesn’t drive. (We live in the middle of no where so we aren’t in walking distance of anything) So we ended up getting his parents and grandparents involved (they are our landlords) and they said that she can’t move in. Well this morning the roommate finally took her home and was extremely angry and said that he’d just find his own place.

ivd5h2gl	My best friend of 30 years (“Katie”) went though a rough divorce a few years ago. Her ex (“Chris”) had a lot of substance abuse issues, continually denied it was a problem and refused to ever get treatment for it. A while ago, another friend mentioned that she was really surprised that Chris was being so cavalier about patient information on Facebook. So I looked at his page (we are still Facebook friends but I almost never use it) and he had several pictures of patient records (X-rays mostly) on his page, commenting on how crazy or unique the cases were. Hadn’t even blacked out the patient information. I took screenshots of all it, then reported him to his hospital. I also mentioned in my complaint that he had a history of substance abuse. Chris was recently fired and has been blowing up Katie’s phone bc he’s convinced she reported him (bc of the substance abuse allegations). She hasn’t responded to him at all and won’t let me tell him I did it bc she doesn’t want anyone in her life to have contact with him. (I only offered to tell him bc I didn’t want him to keep accusing and harassing her about it.) I can tell it’s really stressing Katie out and she has kind of hinted that I should have left him alone. I know I technically didn’t do anything wrong (he was fired so obviously, the hospital determined he had done something to merit termination), but Katie had just started to move on past the trauma and now he’s back in her life.

94yowcyh	My husband(28M) and I (28F) married about two years ago. And I am not interested in having a relationship with my SIL(32F). However, things aren't always like this.  My now SIL and I were roommates in grad school, and she is also the reason I met my husband. All things were great back then. I once believe that SIL is a great friend. We get along really well, and I think of her as a role model for relationships, careers, and life in general. She was like the sister I always wanted as an only child from a single household. A part of me was so excited when my husband and I wanted to get married after dating for two years - we were at a crossroads where the choices were to get married or go long distance internationally. Because that means she will become family as well. But things took an unexpected turn after she learned about our plain.   She reached out to my husband, saying, "I just have a bad feeling about this." and " When I introduced you two, I never thought you would be getting married.". She even quotes me from our private conversation and tells my husband that I don't think marriage is a big deal, and he should "Go with the long distance to test our relationship" because "You will make it if it's truly meant to be.".  Part of me understand that she is looking out for her brother, and since she and her now-husband were together for ten years before they got engaged, what we did must seem rushed in her mind. But I can't help but feel betrayed and angry that she was trying to put her hand into one of the most significant decisions of my life. If you have the time and space to "test" your relationship for ten years, good for you, but it doesn't mean I should suffer and do the same to make you feel better.   I was also hurt that she would think of me as I was only trying to take advantage of her brother and family. In reality, I am not only the sole breadwinner but also take care of most of the household work since my husband is currently in school.   I tried to talk it out with her after, but the vibe I got was, "Sorry I hurt your feeling, but family is family.". Everything seems to be back to normal now, where she appeared to be back to her nice self. But I have lost interest in playing the role as a part of the big happy family since I now know I will always be a second-class citizen if something were to happen. I thought this feeling would go away, and my husband really wanted me to get along with his sister again. AITA for being petty and not forgiving since it all worked out fine?	1642782795.0	s9eqbs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9eqbs/aita_for_not_wanting_to_have_a_relationship_with/	AITA for not wanting to have a relationship with my sisters-in-law?
3ukwc1bd	Sorry in advance, english is not my main language! In my (23F) town there is an old lady (we usually call her "trolley lady", she is quite famous in our town so everyone knows her) that always goes out alone with this trolley, usually walking in the middle of the road, blocking every car from passing and creating problems.  She always asks someone for help or money, like accompaning her home or buying some stuff. We have learned to avoid her, because if you offer her a finger she will take the whole arm. Like 3 days ago, I had to go to the train station (so I had a time for the train if I wanted to take it) and she asked me to accompany her home. I suffer from anxiety, depression and low self-esteem so it's actually diffuclt for me to say "No" to someone, and I like to think that usually I am kind with others, or at least try to be.  So I helped her home and she asked me to get her trolley to her appartment on the 3rd floor, and I did. Then she asked me if I could buy her some stuff and I said no since I had little money on me (for the ticket), she then asked me to accompany her to the mall, and I did. Then i had to go take the train because I was late, so I said goodbye.  Today I had a bad day but I had to go to the doctor and pharmacy for my painkillers. I really didn't want to go out but in the end I did. The whole time everything was just too much for me so I went as fast as I could and hurried home. And there is why I might be TA.  She was there, with her trolley and everything else and as soons as she seea me she screams "miss, miss! Come and help me!". I literally went cold and thought "oh fuck, not right now" so I just said "no I can't today, I'm in hurry" and ran home.  I didn't want to be touched, like really didn't want, and every sound was making me on edge, I just wanted to go home. But now I feel like maybe I should have helped her, as she was an old lady. So, AITA?	1642782962.0	s9eseq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9eseq/aita_for_ignoring_an_old_lady/	AITA for ignoring an old lady?
ivhbcu51	I (f17) broke up with my ex (f17) around a year ago. We were together for around 7 months, so it wasn't huge, but I loved her a lot and thought she loved me too. When we broke up, she told me terrible things about myself. She told me she only loved me physically and I was annoying (why she broke up with me when I moved away), she told me I was in too deep, and she told me I was a bad person. She also got into a relationship the next day, so I assume she'd been talking to someone else behind my back. And look, I'm not perfect, but I never once did anything bad to her. At the end of the day, she told me she thinks I'm a great friend, and wants to stay friends.  Fast forward a few months, she started talking badly about me to people for no reason, ignoring me and then telling me it was my fault, and calling me terrible things once again. And, my sister, (f16), decided to become her best friend.  Then a few weeks later (and still now), my sister and ex kept shit talking me to EACH OTHER. It hurts so incredibly much. But, they always tell me it's deserved, and I'm a bad person. They call me weird, annoying, and obsessive. My sister has said a few times she likes my ex better than she likes me.  Recently, I got into a huge fight with my brother. Long story short, I told her I hate feeling like she isn't there for me, and hate feeling like she's excusing my ex's actions. She told me "If you don't stop talking about this I'll talk about you EVEN MORE!" And it ended with her telling me, "If you don't like that I'm friends with her, stop paying attention. You're weird."  I've never hurt either one of them on purpose, and the times I've made a mistake I've sincerely apologized and done everything in my power to make up for it (which is just being human, right?). I wouldn't have an issue with her being friends with my ex either, because who am I to b upset? If my ex didn't treat me so terribly. But now they both talk shit about me to other people and each other. They've turned people against me. And all I ever do is try my best. It's hard to not feel like it's all my fault and a problem with me.  I know I could just try to ignore this. I hate feeling like I'm ruining somebody's friendship. But this hurts a lot. I also know they're both better people than this. I feel like I might be the asshole, simply because I've always believed people should choose who their friends are. And they're so happy being friends, I'd feel terrible to destroy it.   So, AITA for asking her to stop being friends with my ex?	1642783187.0	s9evel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9evel/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_sister_is_still/	AITA for being upset that my sister is still friends with my ex?
hb0q9pb7	Yeah so I (25) stay with my mom and sister (13) and I’m a full time student. I also freelance on upwork, so there’s no “need” for me to wake up at a certain time everyday unless I have class. But my mom always gets pissed off about me sleeping or taking naps. A lot of the time I stay up late to study or work cause that’s the only time that the house is quiet. (my mom likes to play gospel radio full volume literally 24/7, and when she falls asleep i can turn down the volume when she’s not looking) So when I stay up late naturally I end up either sleeping later until maybe 11 am or sometimes even 1 pm if I don’t have anything to do that day. Or, I’ll wake up early and take an hour nap in the afternoon to stay alert. But also, I’m just a person who needs a lot of sleep. (edit: it’s not just the gospel music that keeps me from studying during the day, it’s because my mom is really distracting cause she always needs us to go do things with her or asks for my advice or to talk with me. and then my sister needs my help with school. so night time is the only time i can get extended hours of work/study in.)  My sister is in a virtual school and I’m the one overseeing all her schoolwork. It’s an independent self study program and she doesn’t have any teachers or classroom time, so I’m literally helping her learn all her coursework and making sure she gets it in on time. My mom doesn’t even know how to log in to my sister’s canvas account and look at her grades, and definitely hasn’t put in any effort to teach my sister. Why should it matter when I do those things, if it’s early in the morning or at 2 pm as long as they get done in a timely manner?  My mom knows that I stay up late to work but she feels like I just shouldn’t do that. She told me today that other people have to wake up early and that I should be considerate and not sleep after 9 am. She also said she doesn’t want us to be bums and it’s time for all of us to get off of our asses and do something. She’s dissatisfied with how the house looks which I could understand, but she acts as if we don’t do anything at all. I literally cook dinner 4-5 times a week and on the days I don’t cook we eat out. She sometimes cooks but not too often. I clean when I can. I personally don’t see the point in all this, and I feel like I’m doing enough, but maybe I’m wrong.	1642783335.0	s9exq4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9exq4/aita_for_sleeping_in_when_i_dont_have_class/	AITA for sleeping in when I don’t have class?
ivgeomsd	I have parents who are fitness coaches. They are crazy when it comes to when and what you should eat, how often you should work out etc.   Ever since I was little I can remember hating breakfast. It's always made me feel shitty, I feel sick and can hardly eat in a morning however my parents say its normal and I just need to train my body.   Since last year my parents started to open they're gym up earlier so they can sanatize it properly before they open, so I was able to skip breakfast until my mum realised nothing was being eaten. So they started making me breakfast before they left at 6 and the same time I would get up.   My friend who I walk to school with, has to take her 2 little sisters to school so only has 20 minutes to shower, get dressed and ready before they wake up so she never gets breakfast, but then she always says how hungry she is.   So I decided to start putting the breakfast my mum made into tubs so she could eat on the way to school. This has been working since school began and I would just eat breakfast at break wich is around 9.30am and my body has woken up more.   Well, yesterday my mum got home just as I was getting the tub out of my bag to wash it. She asked me what was in it and I told her the whole thing as I thaught she would be okay with it since I was still eating.  She yelled at me and said how I could end up with an ED like she did, and that the school food is nasty and made in a factory. I told her i wouldn't as I'm still eating 3 meals a day, and the food isn't that bad. She called my dad and I was sat there for a hours lecture on how I'm damaging my body for not eating at the right times, and I have just been wasting the breakfasts they made for me.   So AITA?  Note: my mum had an eating disorder when she was younger, and want to make sure that I eat 3 times a day to make sure that I dont end up with one. This is also probably the reason she's obsessed with fitness is to make sure she dosent relapse	1642783489.0	s9ezul	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ezul/aita_for_skipping_my_breakfast_everyday_and_not/	AITA for skipping my breakfast everyday and not telling my parent's?
iez2xsuk	I apologize if this is not the right place to put this in but I just feel so confused and stuck that I needed to write this down.  For context, I (20 NB) have been friends with M (20 M) for almost ten years, we both have one another down as emergency contacts and know one another’s medical history for any medical situations.   M works on and off in the army but is currently working a side hustle with his family at a axe throwing place, helping guest and safety teaching them to throw axes. I’m currently in college and is on and off with volunteering/ working at a fire station as a EMT.   Two weeks ago, M was beginning to complain of sudden abdominal pain that would be sharp and painful to move but would be on and off, I suggested to get checked out by a doctor and he did that, just to be told it could be gastritis.  Three days ago, M had to be transferred to the hospital as he began to go into septic shock and was later informed he had appendicitis, I was called by the hospital and quickly made my way .  M came out of surgery and asked if I can call his family and his emergency contact and inform them of the situation, to which I did, it wasn’t much calls as he only had me, his father, and little brother as his emergency contract.   I eventually had to leave since I had to work and went on my day. I usually have my phone on silent when I’m at work except I would get notifications and calls from emergency contacts. During work, I kept getting calls from m, I answered them once I had my break and it turned out to be his girlfriend.  His girlfriend was upset at me since I didn’t call her and informed her of M in the hospital and how I was a bitch and trying to ruin her relationship. I told her that M only asked me to call his emergency contact and that she wasn’t on their so I had no fault on her finding out last minute.   She continued to harass me so I just refused her calls and left the situation alone. Several of my coworkers overhead my conversation and asked what happened, I didn’t want to throw the situation out but just only watered it down so they could kinda get the picture.  Several of my coworkers thought I was in the wrong while others think I shouldn’t be getting the heat and that the discussion should have been stuck to M and his girlfriend.

4m7gflou	Apologies in advance for formatting as I am on mobile.  I (29M) had my birthday back on Wednesday, the 19th. During the early part of the day, I remembered that due to multiple issues over the past 5-6 months, I haven't talked to my stepmom, whom I consider my real mom. I reached out to her via text, as she doesn't monitor her social media or messenger much at all. I explained why I hadn't reached out, what I had been going through, and explained that with the downtime I had during my birthday, I wanted to reach out to let her know I wasn't shutting her out. It took her a few hours to respond and when she did, it was clipped and felt passive-aggressive (e.g, she chided me that it wasn't only me but my SO that had "ghosted" her). I apologized for that, thanked her for wishing me a Happy Birthday, and the didn't receive a response. A few hours after that, I received news that my SO and I were about an hour and a half from being escorted out of our current residence by police because we were in the red for payment. Us being in self quarantine for our second bout of Covid and being unable to work fell on deaf ears for any goodwill.   Well, I reached out to my stepmom, via call this time, got her voicemail, and let her know the urgency of the situation and if she was able to help. I received no answer or communication, and haven't since that day. Now I'm wondering if I came off as TA for seeming like I only reached out for money. So, AITA?  ETA: 1. We barely talk as is and outside of holidays/birthdays, she never initiates contact. 2. I don't ignore messages from her, nor do I use her as an ATM. It's really presumptuous of some of you to jump to that conclusion. 3. In those months that I was buried under financial, residential, and medical stress, she never reached out. I'm expected to fill in the gaps she leaves. 4. I'm staying in an Extended Stay hotel, which is far more financially viable than apartments in my area. 5. My unfortunate situation timing is what I'm asking to be judged on, not what fantasies you people come up with to smear me.	1642783803.0	s9f40j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9f40j/aita_for_asking_for_assistance_from_my_stepmom/	AITA For Asking For Assistance From My Stepmom?
ivj6fl6y	My wife and I closed on our house a few months ago. We absolutely love it, it’s a one-in-a-million house that could easily be our forever home.   A couple days ago, we got an extremely emotional call from the seller. She said that the house was her childhood home and she regretted selling it, and pleaded with us to let her buy it back (covering closing and moving costs, so that we would break exactly even). My wife and I told her that our house is not for sale. The seller said “everything has its price, name yours.” We reiterated again that we’re not interested in selling. The seller said that she would give us 20% more than we paid for it. I told her that we’d consider it, and ended the call.  As much as we love the house, this offer is a total no-brainer—20% over purchase price amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars (edit: and far outpaces how much the house has appreciated in the few months we've owned it). Here’s where my wife thinks we might be in the wrong. The seller was visibly pregnant when we closed on the house, so she presumably had her baby fairly recently. My wife thinks the seller is going through some sort of postpartum depression/psychosis, and so it would be wrong to take advantage of her presumed mental illness. My wife thinks we should avoid further contact with the seller and keep the house.  I think my wife is making some unfounded (and frankly sexist) assumptions that the seller is mentally ill just because she was pregnant. Who are we to say that getting to keep a childhood home after having seller’s remorse isn’t worth several hundred thousand dollars to someone? I think we should take the seller up on her offer. As much as we love the house, it clearly means a lot more to the seller than it does to us, and we stand to gain an enormous amount of money in the process.	1642783908.0	s9f5mj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9f5mj/wibta_for_letting_the_previous_owner_of_my_house/	WIBTA for letting the previous owner of my house buy it back a few months after the sale for 20% more than we paid?
fvj70gun	I (28F) love to read. I usually have a couple of books going at once and the people at my local library know me by name. I also love talking about books with other people - I get a lot of good recommendations that way, and it's also a way to bond over a shared interest. My boyfriend (28M) never reads. He does spend a lot of time reading the news, but never books. However, whenever he's a part of one of the conversations, or if anyone asks, he always says that he likes to read. It's also listed as an interest on his resume/ SM. I think he may be embarrassed by/ self-conscious about the fact that he doesn't, as we're pretty nerdy and hang out with nerdy people, and people sometime associate reading with being more intelligent.  This seems like it shouldn't matter, but we've been dating for five years and it's just one of those things that grates on me. Last weekend it happened again, and when I got home I calmly/ politely asked that he stop saying that he likes to read. He got very defensive and said that he does like to read, he read all the time growing up and books are really important to him, but he is too busy to read now. I said that we've been dating for five years and the entire time he hasn't read a single book, and that if you are too busy to read one book in five years, then you don't actually like to read. I also pointed out that when he talks about how he loves hiking/ camping I don't pretend to like them, even though some people might look down on that.  He said that I was being childish, and that it would be one thing if he went around bringing up the topic of reading all the time, but he only talks about it when people ask. AITA for bring up something relatively unimportant that I can tell he's self-conscious about?  Edit: People are saying 'reading the news is reading' - true, I should have clarified that this is specific to talking about reading books  Edit 2: I really appreciate all of the comments here! I see now that I have some reflecting to do, and I appreciate the constructive points. I apologize for any posts that were overly defensive - I've never posted on here before, but I asked for feedback and I appreciate people taking the time to give input.	1642771847.0	s9as8l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9as8l/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_stop_pretending/	AITA For asking my boyfriend to stop pretending that he likes to read?
6bo9xp7k	 i (17F) currently attend a publix university and i live in a coed dorm, but a single gender suite. meaning there are two bedrooms, a small kitchen area, and a bathroom, and 4 girls are assigned to this unit, two in each bedroom. but there are guys living on the same floor, even across the hall, the suites are the only thing that is divided by gender. this wasnt a problem until the very end of last semester and the beginning of this, but my roommate (18F) has been having her ex boyfriend (M18) who lives down the hall from us sleepover multiple nights a week, without even asking me if im comfortable with this, given we share a bedroom. she also has him over multiple times during the day, without even letting me know. there have been occasions when she leaves for work early in the morning and i will wake up alone in my room with him sleeping in her bed and she’s not there. i feel bad for being upset by this but it’s my bedroom too and i didn’t sign up to share a room with two other people, and certainly not a boy. the other night it was around 10 and i was doing homework and they were in bed and i hear them kissing. they did it again the same night when i was in bed after doing my homework. i pay for this dorm too and i feel i have the right to not feel uncomfortable in it. i’m not comfortable having a guy over more times than not, in my living space. it’s only a problem because we share a room and there is quite literally no where else for me to go. i want to tell her i don’t want him sleeping over at all, i’m just simply not comfortable sharing a bedroom at night with a boy. i also want to tell her i’m okay with him being over sometimes during the day but not all the time and certainly not without at least telling me. i know its her room too so i don’t really know if i would be a jerk for making all these rules.	1642772009.0	s9au9d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9au9d/wibta_if_i_tell_my_roommate_to_not_have_her_ex/	WIBTA if i tell my roommate to not have her ex boyfriend sleepover and to have him over during the day less?
hr3weqki	 My friends recently got kicked out of their last house due to (what they said) a roommate who couldn’t stand them. She would complain the the landlord and he eventually told them to leave   my friends had nowhere to go, they’re both 18 and 19 and a couple so they wanted to go somewhere together. It was either live with us or be out in the streets so it was settled.    But now that they live here it’s clear why they were kicked out of their house. We have a small house and they came in with all their stuff. I asked them if they could ask my parents where some of their stuff could be placed since our bedrooms hallway is small. They agreed but later didn’t do it at all. The entire hallway is blocked and they even put stuff in the cabinet that blocks it while it’s my clothing storage. My dad almost can’t get over their stuff to go to bed at night. We made some rules when together.   Like: 1.  when having energy bursts that needs to be released please don’t be hyper indoors after 1:30 am.  my mom can’t go up the stairs due to a heart operation she had in the past. She sleeps in the living room.  2. Don’t smoke upstairs. They lied to us about it multiple times. Cause everytime I open their door  I see an ash bucket in the room.  also noticeable that when having cigs new they not much later need new ones, but barely having been downstairs   3. Laundry: make either a schedule to do so or wait until ours is done.  4. Make sure people can sleep. 5. Please pay rent. We asked the 3 times less than the minimum Cause more electric bills is something my parents can’t pay. (They shower for one and a half hours and leave all electricity on all day despite the fact them knowing it’s gonna cost them a lot) 6. Pay for own food.(they  ignore that since all condiments are all empty and I’m talking about a 4 tubes of mayo. They only live on junkfood)  Worst of all they have their own special sleep schedule  due to sleeping at 6 am willingly and waking up at 5pm.   Their tv is against the wall that is connected to my room. If I ask if the volume can go lower via phone or knocking they ignore it or barely lower the volume. I have lost a lot of sleep due to that and am happy now if I get 4 hours of sleep because of them   We gave them an extra month for rent. But they evade the question on wether they will make it. This situation has caused a few arguements between my parents   The rent is due soon. But they planned to visit grandparents then, they planned this after the rent date was discussed.  My dad is willing to kick them out if they don’t pay it by then, cause they’re almost causing my parents debt. And I know this.  So am I the asshole for not telling them	1642772570.0	s9b0m4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b0m4/aita_for_not_telling_my_friends_theyre_getting/	AITA for not telling my friends they’re getting kicked out soon
5tjharga	We have been friends for almost 8 years and roommates for 2. Everything was fine until she (22F) got a new boyfriend (21M) a couple months ago. It just so happened to be on my (23F) birthday. They didn’t even tell me happy birthday or hang out with me, which would be fine but we already made plans to go out. And it has been 8 months since they first started dating and he has been living with us since that day 8 months ago. Like going straight to work and then back to our house to take a shower and eat our food and sleep. He does not pay rent or utilities and I have talked to my roommate numerous times about it and she said well he doesn’t really live here so that would be rude. When I was getting ready to move a month ago I started taking my thing from our shared spaces, like pots and pans and stuff like that. The roommate would yell at me saying her boyfriend needs that stuff to cook for them.   Along with stupid stuff like that they would leave the door unlocked all night so her boyfriend could get in overnight and still leave it unlocked when he came in. I was fuming when I found this out because we lived in a not safe area. He would also always take my paid parking spot, only when I wasn’t there because I was at work. I had to walk across a dark parking lot to get to my house because of this. When I moved out I unfriended her and haven’t talked to her. My other friends say I am being an asshole and I don’t think I am.	1642772781.0	s9b2vz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b2vz/aita_for_unfriending_my_friend_of_8_years/	AITA for unfriending my friend of 8 years?
iupl6tlx	I have a lot of issues with my fiancé mom. She is very young to have a son getting married and I think that’s part of the issue. We are still in the same stage in life kind of and she gets competitive or insecure because I did things more traditionally and am getting married and having kids in the traditional order and getting married younger. I’ll call her Ava for this post. She’s been pretty awful to me but thankfully she is getting married around the same time as us and gives zero shits about out engagement or wedding.  The other day we saw Ava at a family members house and I was going through pictures on my phone showing his cousin some stuff and the cousin saw a picture of Ava and loudly demanded to know why I had pictures of her in a bikini and called me weird.   I totally forgot that was there but honestly Ava talked a lot of shit about how I was proposed to and me and my friends were having a laugh at her Instagram pics about getting engaged.   Ava heard and asked why and called me creepy. I was honest that we were making fun of her proposal and it was nothing creepy but she demanded to see and snatched the phone out of my hand.  I saw red and I told her she’d just committed a crime and she had one second to put the phone back in my hand and apologize. Instead she ran behind a table and was taunting me. Her fiancé said something nasty about my body and I lost it and said she could give me the phone or I’d call 911 because she was literally committing a crime.  She took a picture angled down kind of sexy and gave the phone back and said there for your collection and I just lost my shit crying. My fiancé said she’s uninvited from the wedding, which she didn’t seem to care as we left with me crying.  I texted her this morning that she is a their and doesn’t respect boundaries so she isn’t welcome in our home until she apologizes in front of everyone who witnessed that.	1642772982.0	s9b560	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b560/aita_for_banning_my_fiancés_mom_from_out_home/	AITA for banning my fiancé’s mom from out home unless she gives me a public apology?
7nfniq82	This happened a while ago but recently came to mind and I would like outside judgement.  For a ~6 month period I (19 at time) had 2 * 3 month university courses with a small group of students, 20> or so. We all got along well and ate lunch in a common area that was used solely by us except on rare occasions.  We brought stuff from home and there was no rules against what could be brought in just about cleaning up after yourself etc., no one was allergic to anything at least not severely. I can't remember anyone complaining about anything that someone brought, just curious questions or requests to taste.   Here I should ad that at the time I was pescatarian. I ate vegetarian but also seafood, and since we studied in a harbour town known for it's fish markets meant I bought and ate a lot of fish. 3-4 times a week I cooked fish, shrimp, clams etc. I cooked a meal every night, and lefterovers were brought to lunch the next day. I used the microwaves if it was supposed to be eaten hot, and nobody had any issues with any supposedly bad smell. I'd say on the contrary, people often wanted a taste based on the smell. Just like I often wanted a taste when a student of Indian heritage brought home cooked food, it smelled delicious!  At the start of the course a new student joined us. Immediately on first day lunch she complained about the smell of my heated food. She absolutely hated fish and said that I wasn't allowed to bring it for lunch. I said that there was no rule against this. But her complaints just increased in frequency and intensity.  Finally I caved and stopped heating fish dishes in the microwave, I cooked cold variations like salads, sandwiches etc OR warm vegetarian dishes instead as a compromise.   Apparently not good enough. She complained even when I heated vegetarian and said it "smelled fishy" or wouldn't believe it was vegetarian. I had to complete stop bringing in anything related to fish. I said it was honestly ridiculous to demand this since I would basically completely change my dietary habits when I already had compromised. I also pointed out that I never complained about the citrus fruits she often peeled and ate at lunch even though I found that smell really strong. She claimed that to be completely different and that I was just an inconsiderate asshole.  Her demeanour towards me only got worse and my nearest friends in the class informed me that she was lying about me behind my back about what a terrible person I was. I believe most people think I had been accommodating enough when I stopped heating fish dishes since they honestly couldn't smell anything anymore when asked. But a couple of people said that I was a jerk but mostly because I "knew" my food would set her off, even if they didn't care about the food per se.  Lunch went from being a fun time of food and socialising, to mostly stiff atmospher with passive agressive comments and dirty looks.   Was ITAH for not giving in?	1642773160.0	s9b7jy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9b7jy/aita_for_continuing_to_bring_fish_for_lunch/	AITA for continuing to bring fish for lunch?
ivcnvxhv	My (69F) daughter (32F) and I live next door to each other.  One night a week, she goes and stays the night with her boyfriend, and I look in on her cat.  A while ago, after washing up the cat bowls, I threw out her kitchen sponge, because I thought it was grimy, and pulled out a new one.  I did the same thing again last week, for the same reason.  This week, when I went over, I saw a note in the kitchen saying, "please don't throw out my kitchen sponges, thanks!"  When I saw her the next morning, I asked her about it, and she said that it was frustrating that I was doing that, because there was really nothing wrong with her sponge, she had only been using it a couple weeks, and she had washed it a couple times during that time.  I said that it seemed grimy to me.  She got annoyed and said that she doesn't like that she will come home sometimes to find that I've moved something, or cleaned something.  I told her that I'm just trying to be helpful and that I'm nice enough to look in on her cat, and I don't want to be in an environment that I don't think is clean enough.    She said that she is very appreciative that I look in on her cat and she tells me that all of the time, but that if I can't just come in to take care of the cat and leave without messing with her stuff then I don't have to come anymore.  She said that the cat will be fine overnight alone.  She feeds him wet food before she leaves in the evening, he gets fed dry by automatic feeder twice while she's gone, and she will feed him wet when she gets home the next morning.  I don't want the cat to be home alone for that long because I think it's not fair, but she's not budging with this.

ivbr3k6r	My fiancé has two teenage children with his ex. His ex can be extremely inappropriate towards him but he claims that’s just her personality. For some context she works in the entertainment industry and I guess is kind of sexy/flirty with everyone but it is very upsetting when i feel like I live in her shadow.  His mom adores her. His kids obviously want their mom but I totally respect that she is the kids mom and will always be in the picture.  The other day they went to one of their daughters games and out to eat and he dropped her at our house to get her car. I asked him why her shirt was wet and he said he rolled the car window down so she’d get hit with a sprinkler. He’s a big prankster and has done similar to me but I just seemed inappropriate with her.  She rolled her eyes and told me to calm down it was just a joke and that I need to grow up and I’m prudish and dumb. They chatted for a few minutes and I took our hose and sprayed her because like she said it’s just water.  She got really mad and said some nasty things. He kind of laughed but also said I shouldn’t have done it and now I’m concerned because his daughters aren’t speaking to me and the older one cussed me out before she left for school.	1642773485.0	s9bbby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9bbby/aita_for_spraying_my_fiancés_ex_with_a_hose/	AITA for spraying my fiancé’s ex with a hose?
ivbywuq3	  My brother 20M got a girl pregnant and my father (mom died long back), her parents convinced the girl to keep the baby as they are heavily religious.   I (25F) thought it was an extremely bad idea and told the same to my brother. I am not in contact with my father due to religious differences. The girl wanted to go to college and did not want to have a kid. However, my father convinced her parents to take care of the baby while she/my brother goes off to college and they can help out in weekends and holidays. They would have to take care of the baby completely once they have graduated. My brother cut contact with me because he felt that i was trying to ruin his future family.   Well, the girl and her parents passed away when the baby was 6 months old and my father was struggling to take care of a baby while my brother was at college. He told my brother that he has to take the baby while my brother was attending university full time. My brother refused but my father just drove to his college and handed him the baby and drove off.  Now, my brother and I live in the same city and he is asking me to take care of the baby until he graduated. He told me that he would come to my place the second his college is over for the day. He wants me to watch the baby Mon-Fri 6 am - 6 pm. I told him that was not going to happen. He begged me and my father. When he kept bothering me with this, I told him that this is not what I signed up for and he told me that this wasn't what he signed up for either.   I told him that this was exactly what he signed up for from the second that they decided to keep the baby. He did not think of the worst case scenario and was not prepared. He is devastated over her death and from what I know, he loves his child and spends every moment away from college with her (weekends, holidays, winter/summer breaks). He was extremely close with his gf and her parents. He is coping with their death too.   I travel a lot and I would have to ask for a demotion to be able to stay at home. I think this is too much to ask of me. Especially considering that they haven't spoken to me in years. I sent post and messages  congratulating when she born but no one replied to me.	1642774213.0	s9bkg6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9bkg6/aita_for_telling_my_brother_and_father_that_this/	AITA for telling my brother and father that this is exactly what he signed up for when he is struggling with a year old baby girl after her mom and grandparents passed away?

iogqc3co	My brother (M28) and I (M30) didn't grow up together. He grew up with our father and I grew up with our mother. Once a month, he would go to my house so we could play and interact and on summer break, I would go to my father's house.  Since he is 7, he would steal things from my house when he'd get mad. If we had a small fight, really normal for children, he would take something with him in his pockets. Nothing too expensive, things like food, pencils, etc. Some hours later, my Dad would bring him back and he would return what he got and he'd apologize.   As the years went by, it got worse. Our relatives started to notice and it got to a point where he was put into psychological treatment when he was 12. This made our relationship fall apart and I just lost total interest in interacting with him.  When he was 14, he got addicted to drugs and was selling the things he'd steal from our relatives' houses. He got smart, nobody would notice and even his treatment wasn't helping.  Days before going to college I had a big fight with my family because he'd stolen some of my money and they got really mad when I suggested putting him into a drug rehab we had in my city. Days after I left, they agreed and he was put into rehab.  Almost 12 years later, without any type of contact with my family, my bother somehow got my number and called me, saying he'd need a house to stay in a few days as he was planning to break up with his girlfriend.  I asked for our mom's number and he gave it, so I called her and she updated me on what happened in those 12 years. For the first 7 years, my brother got free from drug addiction and wasn't stealing for them at all, but after that, he got back into smoking small amounts and expensive things were vanishing from my relatives after he'd visited them, but according to her: "last year, we all talked to him and now he is not doing drugs anymore". But according to some other relatives he still is both doing drugs, stealing and that I shouldn't let him stay at my house.  I got confused so I found his Facebook and he still looks like an addict, but his girlfriend looks like a good and healthy person, so I don't think she is an addict. Plus, it looks like they make good money, so I don't understand why he'd be stealing.  Today, he called me and I told him I wouldn't allow him to stay in my house. He got mad, saying he had nowhere to go, as non of our relatives, including our parents, would let him stay at their houses. My girlfriend thinks I should let him stay, but I think he might be a danger to our son (2 months old), as he doesn't like children and he might be an addict still.

iun8i6v1	I (29f) have a precious beautiful three year old daughter.  Her birthday was on New Year's Day, and she turned three years old.  My husband and I decided to make it a Birthday Party in conjunction with inviting family and friends for the New Year celebration also.  We decided that we would invite around 25 people for the birthday party.  My brother, Randy (24m) invited his friend Rob (23m) to the birthday party also.  I wasn't too happy about Randy inviting Rob, but decided not to say anything at this time.    The party is going on and everybody is coming over, and hugging and kissing my daughter, and wishing her happy birthday.  I notice that Rob picks up my daughter, and is holding her in his hands and wishes her a happy birthday also.  I don't think he did anything wrong, but I told my husband that I had bad energy and karma from Rob holding my daughter.  He told me that I was being ridiculous, and there was no ill will.    I disregarded my husband's opinion, and subsequently politely went over to Rob, and told him, "please don't pick up my daughter or touch her or he couldn't stay at the New Year/Birthday Party.  My daughter, only wants to be held by immediate family members."  He didn't verbally answer, but nodded his head in agreement.  About an hour later, I notice Rob dancing with my daughter, where his hands were interlocked with her hands.  I agree that he did have a few drinks, and could have been drunk or tipsy, but I was so frustrated after I warned him, and he agreed.    I subsequently asked him to leave very politely.  Rob blurts out  "bye everyone, I am not wanted here anymore".  Randy, yells at me, saying that I ruined his New Years, and walks out with Rob.  My parents both agree that I was an asshole for kicking him out of the party, but they stayed until the end.  My husband, told me that he thought the behavior was innocuous, and I overreacted.

iuevag95	I (24F) have always had a different relationship with my mother (50F), where I’m more of a friend/care giver to her - she often says I’m her best friend. The only exception is if I do something she doesn’t agree with and she switches into “parent mode” which often involves yelling. I know everything about her life from relationship, divorce, health problems, I think that gives the picture.  I’m a perpetual student so of course I have loans. I’ve been in university every year since high school (undergraduate and graduate).In high school obviously I had no idea what I was doing so my mother did my loans application and had all the logins (up until after high school she also knew and wouldn’t let me change all the passwords to my social media and email). Every January, my mother took a portion of my student loan/grant money that gets deposited right into my bank account (usually $1000, which wasn’t the whole deposit) and said that that portion of the money is actually used to cover “taxes”. Trusting my mother, I never questioned this.  This past month I thought it was odd that it never got deposited into my bank. I called the student loans office and my information on file had been changed to my younger sister’s banking info (this has happened in the past but was fixed at some point). I texted my sister and she had no idea what money I was talking about, she never spent it. I texted my mother and she said she must have put the wrong bank information in this year. When I asked about the money she said all of it had to cover the “taxes” this year. I was disappointed because extra money would have been nice but not vital. Being older and more interested in finances than when I was younger, I asked if she could explain why the government doesn’t just keep that tax money instead of giving it to me and then having to give it back. She got really defensive, didn’t explain and accused me of thinking she was doing something sneaky. She’s the type of mother where if you try to be honest she goes “well I guess I’m just the worst mother in the world”.  Long story short, I made some calls, googled and asked friends with similar loans and can’t find anything on this “tax”. The only thing that came up was a tax deduction people paying off interest on their loans are eligible for, which is not my situation.  I’ve been wrong about some things in the past with my mother and I think there’s a potential Im just being dramatic here. AITA or is there something weird here?	1642776998.0	s9ck7v	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ck7v/aita_for_thinking_my_mother_might_be_stealing/	AITA for thinking my mother might be stealing money from me?
al9vvkly	Long time lurker, first time poster. Posting from main because I literally do not have the energy to make a new account for this. English is not my native language, I'm on phone, so please excuse any grammatical and formatting issues.  I(enby, 24) live in the first floor of a two story house owned by my parents. My dad bought the house to stay close to his parents but then had to relocate for work to a smaller town, and I wanted to come back to the city for college and they didn't want to pay more for a dorm or a hostel so I stay here.   My grandfather passed away in 2018. Before he died, we had a nurse who looked after him. Shortly after he passed away, she(45ish,F) moved with her family - husband (early 50s), and two sons (20, 24)in the ground floor of my parents house because their rent went up and they were looking for a place, my parents talked to them and offered them the place at a BIG discount as a gratitude for taking care of my grandfather till the last day. Cut to chase, they are HORRIBLE people to share a house with. Different floors, and yet I can hear them yelling, things would often go missing (we're very big on community which refuses to respect boundaries culturally and she would often come and go as she pleases), etc etc, and parents would refuse to serve them the 30 days notice because they were in "debt of her". Anyway, they moved out in 2020 October after they bought their own house. I was super relieved.   It's been almost a year and half now, and yet I get mail of the sons regularly, usually from their banks. One even had their debit card! (I didn't open it, it had a small transparent window and was visible from the outside.) I have forwarded all their mails and let them know that they need to change their mailing address. It has not happened, I am getting a little tired of it. I again received some mail a couple of days ago, so they clearly haven't listened to me for the last year. I don't want to keep forwarding them their mail anymore, it's not my responsibility, I have been doing it as a courtesy until now but now I'm starting to feel otherwise.   WIBTA if I stop forwarding their mails?	1642777147.0	s9clze	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9clze/wibta_if_i_stop_forwarding_mail_to_previous/	WIBTA if I stop forwarding mail to previous tenants?
ivelgcp3	Me (22F) and my fiancé (23M) got a very high energy puppy a couple months back. At the time I did not think it was a good idea because we had an infant. I’m a SAHM so my partner thought it would be okay to go ahead and get the dog and I could take care of it. I expressed that it would be hard for me to do that and give the dog all the exercise and attention it needs due to the fact I have to pay attention to our baby. He said that it was okay and whenever he was home from work he would exercise and play with the dog. Fast forward to now. This high energy dog is getting less than half the exercise he needs and I am the one who feeds, potties, and watches the dog. I firmly told him that the dog needs at least 2 hours of exercise a day and that he needed to take him out when he’s home. He did good for a few days but now it’s always the excuse that he’s tired or it’s to cold out or he would take him on one really short walk.  I feel absolutely awful for the dog because he’s not getting the exercise he needs and I can’t do it due to my partner not wanting to watch our kid when he’s home or just falling asleep when he gets home. So WIBTA if I threaten to get rid of the dog to either make him understand that he needs to do better by the dog or find someone who will?	1642777253.0	s9cnoq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9cnoq/wibta_if_i_threatened_to_get_rid_of_the_family_dog/	WIBTA if I threatened to get rid of the family dog?

She is great she takes our ideas and makes them perfect.   Now FSIL has apologised and fiance asked if she'd like to help with the wedding (I'll admit that I'm not as forgiving as my fiance so I might of been a bit short with her)with the promise that she doesn't try and take over again. Today FSIL asked when were we going to firer our wedding planner to which we replied that we weren't going to firer her. she's doing a great job. To which FSIL started saying that we were wasting our money and now that she back helping we didn't need her. Fiance said that we were not firing her she almost as this wedding complete plan all thats left are the small things eg: suits. FSIL said that we should go through the plan just to make sure it what we want. I replied you mean to see if it's what you want (that might of been assholish). The conversion went down hill from there.   Now that I had some time to think about I might of been looking for an signs of her trying to take over again (she really hurt fiance feelings last) that I might of overreacted.  So AITA?

ivfamug1	Disclaimer: New to reddit, my sister recommended it to me.  Currently, my son \[14m\] is really interested in music. He spends hours every night at home practising with his guitar and has joined a local theatre group which meets twice a week.  Other than school, his only other commitment is football ⚽. He has been playing since he was nine and he is now playing every game in the season, whereas previously he had been a reserve. He’s met great friends through football and lots of his friends from school play as well. Being on the team gives him the opportunity to travel to compete in different tournaments, teaches him teamwork and commitment, and it's the only thing that keeps him active as he doesn’t enjoy PE in school.  However, my son has recently decided that he wants to quit football to focus wholeheartedly on his music. I’m proud of his passion and ability, but do think that he would be remiss to give up football at this stage. Yes, it does take up two nights of his week, but he would be a lot less active and a lot less social if he did not go. I have told him that he should wait out this season and then if he doesn’t want to join the Under 16s squad next year, that is his decision, but he is very annoyed with me and thinks I am only forcing him to play football because he is a boy, which I am not.  My sister, who has two sons, thinks that I am indeed TA here as her son \[12m\] has quit multiple sports/clubs before he found his love of tennis. I do not like the idea of forcing my children into anything that they don’t want to do, but I do feel that there are more benefits of him participating than just sitting in our garage with his guitar all night.  Can any other parents relate to this? Am I the asshole here?

ivfsgthb	I (21F) am studying Computer Engineering. My best friend Mike (21M) and our other friend Allie (21F) come from wealthy families that pay for their university education. My family pays for uni and supports me as well but I grew up poor unlike my friends.   I’ve been working odd jobs since I was 16y. I’ve been a babysitter, production worker, waitress and for the past two years technical support on and off( this is a fancy way of saying I tell your grandma to restart her frozen computer screen). Both Mike and Allie have never ‘approved’ of my odd jobs. They believe I should only work if it’s related to my major. I’ve ignored them through the years because I landed a 4-month internship this summer while the two of them have yet to find a degree related job.   I have been off work for about 4 months and my parents have no issues supporting me financially and leave it up to me to decide whether I want a job for some extra cash (my dad and I have an ‘existence agreement’ which means he sends me enough money to have a roof over my head and food to eat). If I want to go clubbing, travel or do anything considered ‘fun’ that is my business and he does not pay. I like this deal because it definitely motivates me to work.   So, I applied for a tech support position and to my surprise got the offer of a lifetime. I’d be making twice as much as what is industry standard. If I was to work a degree related job it will take me over a year to reach that salary and that is if I am lucky. Only catch is that they want me full time with the option of a part-time position in a few months.  This was discussed in my family and after the job promised to take into consideration my uni schedule I signed with them. I informed Allie and Mike, anticipating their rant about it being a menial job.  Surprisingly Allie was excited for me and congratulated me but Mike started saying this was such a bad decision and went on a ludicrous rant how this actually hurts my resume somehow. I told him that I did not ask about his opinion and that he is being childish. He said I don’t accept criticism and I am being an asshole and he is just looking out for me.  AITA?

4tggrbug	To begin, my roommate and I are both veterinary students at SGU. This is an island school with plenty of island mutts running around in not great shape. I (22F) and my roommate (26F) live in an apartment with a 2 dog maximum. However, we fostered a puppy two semesters ago as she was waiting for surgery. Before this puppy came home, roommate asked if I minded and assured me she would take complete care of her. I said sure provided she was vaccinated, dewormed, and healthy. She assured me she was. We both have personal dogs and my dog is immune compromised, so this is obviously very important.  After the dog had been there for about a month, regularly interacting with my dog, I found out the roommate lied. The dog was not vaccinated and in fact had several tick borne diseases she was undergoing treatment for. Additionally, I ended up caring for her quite a bit and the roommate would get angry if I didn’t. Fine, she was a cutie and I didn’t mind. The dog was later adopted.   My roommate went back to school earlier than I did this semester, so she was at the apartment by herself. After about a week I noticed on my roommates snapchat that she posted a photo of a large dog and two very young (like 2 week old) puppies, clearly in our apartment. She never said anything to me about this. When I asked her, she said “oh yeah, I told you about this! I’m fostered a mama dog and her two puppies.” I told her she did not tell me about this, and asked 1.) if they were all healthy and 2.) how long they were staying. She claimed they were perfectly healthy and it was only for a few days. I dropped the subject.   This week I find out the dogs are all still there, and they have been to the vet multiple times for health issues. Additionally, it turns out there were more puppies, but several of them died (unknown of what) before my roommate brought the others home. She also lied to a friend of mine and said the mama dog was perfectly healthy so he would agree to adopt her. Didn’t mention the puppies at all, then just brought them to his house and said “oh I told you she had puppies!“ and made him feel like a terrible person for refusing to take them.   Here’s where I might be the asshole. I told her that these dogs need to be out within the next couple days, she needs to pay to have the apartment professionally cleaned since the puppies were sick, and that under no circumstances is she to bring another animal into the apartment without asking me first. She freaked out on me and now I have her family and the entire shelter animal club messaging me berating me for being so callous, and saying I shouldn’t be a vet if I hate stray animal this much.

2qqnst1	I refused to go to my cousins wedding even though we considered each other sisters or best friends. A tad bit of backstory; So my cousin/roommate (20F) has been lying about everything to make my husband and I villains in my family. Things like saying we stole money from her or we treated her really bad emotionally. Even to the point that when he almost died in the hospital from an unrelated car accident, my family refused to support us financially. This is because she told them the accident was a scam to get money. I didn’t hang around my family often enough after the accident so I didn’t find out about the lies for a while till her step sister confronted us. It was so backwards from how my cousin/roommate acted around us that I didn’t believe it for a while till she stole money from us because the accident funds were apparently supposed to be split amongst us three. Even my husband shrugged off the funds being split because he believed she needed it and that’s why she took it. So that’s where I kinda feel iffy about our relationship and where she really starts twisting our conflicts.   A few months after the accident she went to elope to her boyfriend of 2weeks. I of course told the family because I still cared about her. No one believed me thanks to her and she told them that she was actually planning a wedding not eloping. At this point I knew the full extent of her manipulation on my family because she managed to once again turn them against me. They chalked it up to me being cruel to my cousin by starting drama. But she knew what I did and refused to invited me to her “plan B” wedding for a majority of the wedding planning. Again, this wedding is only taking place because she was caught eloping by me and now she has to play through her lie. She then continued to lie about a lot of things like lack of money, her relationship, etc, to get people to pay for her wedding including her church paying for her venue. It is important to note that this wedding would not take place if everyone knew the truth. I won’t go into detail here it’s just how our family works.  After the lying about inviting me and my family pressuring me to go, I still said no. I love her, but I refused to go unless she personally invited me, apologized, and told me the truth about her lies. I need this because I need confirmation. However, according to her, that’s ‘too low’ for her. She was so upset and went to the family once again so she can play the hopeless bride whose wedding is ruined by me. They told me I have to accept her invite to the wedding or she will be really upset and my family will cut me off. And they plan to, because I am supposed to be the better person and look past our apparent “misunderstandings”. Even my parents and husband think I’m being a little bit of an asshole for not wanting to go and making her upset on her wedding day.

I replied that there was no problem since we never spoke to each other in 10 years and that it was her who had insisted on having me as a friend and that I did not understand what she meant about not being nice to her. She replied that it was because I'm obviously racist because I didnt want to be her friend in hightschool. I'm not going to play the "I have friends from different cultures" but it is true and my mother always taught me to respect each other's culture and to defend those who are victims of racism or any  kind of discrimination . To tell the truth, we had nothing in common, I was very discreet and I only played video games while she spent her time to talk about herself and her dresses. She was really disrespectful to everyone and even stole my last art homework of the year. I then explained to her that I had no memory of it, especially since I had just lost my mother, I was an orphan so I clearly had other priorities than flattering her ego. She got angry saying that my behavior was bad and that was not  a good excuse, that I should have been nice to her because she wanted to be my friend and I should have done what she wanted when I spent my days cring. She finally said that I had harassed her for three years so I explain to her that she must clearly made a mistake and have the wrong girl because we had been in the same class for only two years and that I myself had been harassed  during my first year in high school and spent my days alone. She didn't want to hear anything and I ended up blocking her by telling her that now I had no more time to waste with parasites like her. I found later that she had sent the same message to two other people. I'm sure I wasn't mean to her in high school, but I feel bad for insulting her like that.

3fm5d0kr	Okay so I (f21) am a very private person, even to my family. I have to put here that we're all asian.   So my mum (f50) has this habit of sleeping in my bed when something happens in her room.   My dad argued with her?  Sleep in my bed My dad turned the aircon too cold? Sleep in my bed She sleeps better because of the change of environment? Sleep in my bed.   Now, here's the thing. My room is extremely sacred to me, and I do a lot of private things here that I don't like to do with people around. So I hate it when people sleep in my room. (I only have 1 bed, so if you're sleeping in my room, you're sleeping in my bed) I get anxious and upset when anyone is like "can I sleep with you? '  The answer is no. Do anything else, but leave me the fuck alone at night. It's my private time.   Anyways, so my dad got sick, and she doesn't wanna sleep in the same room as him. Fair enough.   But she wants to sleep in mine.   Logically, yes I should let her sleep in my room. I'm the only one with excess space in my bed, and if not, she needs to sleep on the couch.   But she makes me so anxious and upset and there was once she slept in my room for a week straight, I couldn't take it and had a mental breakdown and cried. So I said 'no'  And she's like " when you'll move out, I'm free to sleep in any room, it wouldn't be such a bother to all of you'  And "I paid for this house, wdym I can't sleep in your room, do you want me to sleep on the couch and ruin my back? '  And here's the thing, one night is fine, whatever  I'll deal with it. But we don't know how long my dad's gonna be sick for, so if she sleeps in my room for like a week or so, I'm gonna lose it and damage our relationship. So ofc I said no. Sigh... Am I the asshole for saying no to her?   Tldr: mum makes me anxious when she sleeps in my bed, I can break down and cry, but she has to sleep in my bed because she can't share a room with my sick dad. But I said no to her.

73ra4e9c	So recently my friends M/14 and F/14 have been spending a lot of time with a guy who’s almost 20. The guy doesn’t have a job or even a highschool diploma and he sits inside all day playing Minecraft with them. Now at first I didn’t pay any attention to it as I was just happy that they had found a new friend but after awhile it got kinda creepy. They would spend all day with this guy that we don’t even know and they had done the whole cliche discord matching pfps and bios that made it look like they were dating. When I mentioned how creepy this guy was they all blocked me and refuse to talk to me now. Am I the ass for not trusting this guy?	1642780813.0	s9dz23	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9dz23/aita_for_being_suspicious_of_my_friends_online/	AITA for being suspicious of my friends online friend?
c01uq76m	This is a wild one. (Long story, but CRAZY.)  So my MIL married my FIL (husband's stepdad) when my husband was 12. My husband's bio dad was abusive, and my FIL stepped up and gave hubby the best childhood possible to make up for the miserable early years.  When my husband was based in Italy while in the military. His mom came to visit him, got drunk on wine, and told him, "I'm divorcing your stepdad because he's been depressed so he doesn't want to have sex. I need someone who will fill my sexual needs."  She followed through and divorced my FIL, but my husband still considered him to be his dad and celebrated Christmas with my FIL instead of with his mom.  A few years later, MIL decided she wanted him back, and FIL agreed to get remarried because he didn't like living by himself. She's been miserable to live with, though. She is mentally unstable, refuses to contribute in any way to the household, and talks to my FIL like he is dirt. Yet my FIL continues to take good care of her and has nursed her back to health after multiple illnesses.  Then she texts my husband on a Thursday and says, "I want you to help me pack my stuff and then transport everything to another state. I'm divorcing your stepdad again because he isn't having enough sex with me."  AGAIN?!  She didn't even tell my husband's brother. She only told my husband because she wanted help moving. I said that I didn't want him to go because I don't think he should be enabling her behavior by helping her move and I had plans to spend time with him that Saturday.  She ended up calling and said, "Nevermind. I don't want you to be mad at me." He said, "I'm not mad at you," even though he was. And THIS WOMAN had the audacity to say, "You're making things awkward."  So fast-forward a few weeks. My FIL is a saint and is packing up all of her things and committing to drive them down to her just to be kind and help her despite what she was doing to him. My MIL calls my husband and says, "I want you to drive down with your dad so he doesn't have to make the trip alone."  My husband says, "I'll have to talk to my wife about it."  And she replies with, "Why do you need to talk to her? What, you can't do anything without asking her? You don't need her permission."  Excuse me?!  He said, "I can't just drive to another state without talking to my wife about it."  When he told me, I strongly objected to him helping move her stuff for her. I didn't like what she said about him not needing to talk to me, and I still don't think he should be enabling her behavior. If she wants to move, she should be an adult, pack her own things, and have them moved. I told my husband that he could go if he felt morally obligated, but that I wish he wouldn't.  My family thought I was being awful because I shouldn't object to my husband helping his mother, but I still don't think that I am being unreasonable.  What do you think?	1642781021.0	s9e26p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9e26p/aita_for_telling_my_husband_that_he_shouldnt_help/	AITA for telling my husband that he shouldn't help his mom? (CRAZY story)
37ay6hmn	This just happened and I feel really bad, and I think I was a bit of an a-hole here.  So I get hormone treatments that are not covered by my insurance, so I pay out of pocket and it’s not cheap.  I go to the office and get a pellet inserted in the fat of my butt cheek and it slowly releases hormones for for 3-4 months.  I’m on my second pellet.  So when you get the pellet they have to monitor your hormones through blood work.  You are supposed to go at 4 weeks after the pellet insertion so they can see if you need another one inserted or if the dosage was good.  So after the first pellet I called to get my script to get the blood work and the receptionist had NO CLUE what I was talking about.  No idea about hormone pellets, getting blood work, nothing.  I kinda chalked it off to maybe she was new.  So she said she needed to leave a message for the dr and would get back to me.  To make this a shorter story, it took 3 weeks of phone tag and people not knowing what I was asking for before I finally got my blood work done.  That made it at week 7, which is too late to get a good read on if the dosage was correct.  So fast forward to pellet 2.  I told the dr about the fiasco getting my blood work done and asked if he could write the script then so I didn’t have to call and get the run around again.  He did and at 4 weeks I go to get the blood work but the phlebotomist couldn’t read one of the requests.  So she called their office to ask and cue no one having any idea what she is asking about.  Now I have to mention that the hormone stuff is taken care of at a satellite office and the main office is the one who seems to have no idea about what treatments they do…but I think they should have an idea what sort of doctor they work for.  The poor phlebotomist was put on hold three times and was getting really frustrated so I asked her to just hand me the phone.  While on hold I told her we should just call the satellite office because the main office never knows what I’m talking about!  And the receptionist heard that and said “are you referring to me?” And I said “yes, when I call it always seems no one knows what I’m talking about” and that obviously upset her.  She then told me to just call the satellite office which we did and they answered the phlebotomists questions immediately.  I feel like my comment was kinda rude, but I also feel like they should be more aware of what the doctors in their office actually do or at least where to go to get questions from patients answered.

7u0c9kdg	I (F20) have been with my partner(M22) for almost 3 year now and we live together. Recently he has finished college, but we are having troubles finding him a job for his degree.    I asked him to work 35-40 hours a weeks to help pay for bills and grow our savings. His current job is out of season and he’s only been getting 10 hours so he got a second one. I usually work 40+ hours on breaks and 20 during classes.    He has only worked a few shift in his new job. He wants to quit but I’m asking to find another job first. He really does not like the work and it gives him bad anxiety. If they were being inappropriate or awful to him I would agree to him quitting on the spot but that’s not the case.    He is really salty and anxious when I told him that. I tried to accommodate and told him he could quit in a few days if he puts in multiple applications to other places.   Well this morning he said he was sick and I asked him if he needed anything/ what’s wrong. Turns out he was not sick but was having anxiety about going to work. I comforted him and tried to help but he promised me he would hold out a bit longer. I strait up said “babe you promised me you would go for a couple more days, this isn’t keeping that promise”    He is pretty salty and upset at me.

csntjzsr	So I 24f have been living with my boyfriend in one of his grandparents rental homes. We have two roommates (both male) because we wanted to make the rent dirt cheap so we can save for a house. Now the house is three bedroom but it’s basically a trailer on a foundation. So space is VERY tight.   So our roommate met this girl three weeks ago and finally brought her up to meet the gang and she spent the night. Well that night has turned into a week and a half. Two nights ago  my boyfriend was sitting on the couch playing games and she was sitting in there with him and the roommate calls her and they start discussing her moving in. My boyfriend not wanting to make a scene waited up for the roommate to get home so he could talk to him about her not being able to move in. He seemed to understand and said that he would take her home in the morning(she doesn’t drive) he never took her home yesterday and we let her slide for one more night. well last night they were sitting in the living room and they are on the phone and start discussing her moving in again.   My boyfriend who is sitting there flabbergasted didn’t say anything and waited for me to get home. We were talking and realized that we were on the same page about her not moving in. What bothered us the most was that she doesn’t work and doesn’t drive. (We live in the middle of no where so we aren’t in walking distance of anything) So we ended up getting his parents and grandparents involved (they are our landlords) and they said that she can’t move in. Well this morning the roommate finally took her home and was extremely angry and said that he’d just find his own place.

dvvvygop	I was walking on the sidewalk at a normal pace when suddenly my boyfriend runs me off the sidewalk and into the grass to let a group of three pass us. I got mad and told him he was a jerk.   Before the incident I had been walking at a normal pace and I was already walking close to the edge. He says he told me to move but I didn’t hear him so he made me move. He made me move by stepping to the side towards me until he bumped into me and it was either move or get knocked over.   He says he was justified since the group of three were walking faster than us and were almost on top of us. I told him he could have moved without running me off.

ivd5h2gl	My best friend of 30 years (“Katie”) went though a rough divorce a few years ago. Her ex (“Chris”) had a lot of substance abuse issues, continually denied it was a problem and refused to ever get treatment for it. A while ago, another friend mentioned that she was really surprised that Chris was being so cavalier about patient information on Facebook. So I looked at his page (we are still Facebook friends but I almost never use it) and he had several pictures of patient records (X-rays mostly) on his page, commenting on how crazy or unique the cases were. Hadn’t even blacked out the patient information. I took screenshots of all it, then reported him to his hospital. I also mentioned in my complaint that he had a history of substance abuse. Chris was recently fired and has been blowing up Katie’s phone bc he’s convinced she reported him (bc of the substance abuse allegations). She hasn’t responded to him at all and won’t let me tell him I did it bc she doesn’t want anyone in her life to have contact with him. (I only offered to tell him bc I didn’t want him to keep accusing and harassing her about it.) I can tell it’s really stressing Katie out and she has kind of hinted that I should have left him alone. I know I technically didn’t do anything wrong (he was fired so obviously, the hospital determined he had done something to merit termination), but Katie had just started to move on past the trauma and now he’s back in her life.

94yowcyh	My husband(28M) and I (28F) married about two years ago. And I am not interested in having a relationship with my SIL(32F). However, things aren't always like this.  My now SIL and I were roommates in grad school, and she is also the reason I met my husband. All things were great back then. I once believe that SIL is a great friend. We get along really well, and I think of her as a role model for relationships, careers, and life in general. She was like the sister I always wanted as an only child from a single household. A part of me was so excited when my husband and I wanted to get married after dating for two years - we were at a crossroads where the choices were to get married or go long distance internationally. Because that means she will become family as well. But things took an unexpected turn after she learned about our plain.   She reached out to my husband, saying, "I just have a bad feeling about this." and " When I introduced you two, I never thought you would be getting married.". She even quotes me from our private conversation and tells my husband that I don't think marriage is a big deal, and he should "Go with the long distance to test our relationship" because "You will make it if it's truly meant to be.".  Part of me understand that she is looking out for her brother, and since she and her now-husband were together for ten years before they got engaged, what we did must seem rushed in her mind. But I can't help but feel betrayed and angry that she was trying to put her hand into one of the most significant decisions of my life. If you have the time and space to "test" your relationship for ten years, good for you, but it doesn't mean I should suffer and do the same to make you feel better.   I was also hurt that she would think of me as I was only trying to take advantage of her brother and family. In reality, I am not only the sole breadwinner but also take care of most of the household work since my husband is currently in school.   I tried to talk it out with her after, but the vibe I got was, "Sorry I hurt your feeling, but family is family.". Everything seems to be back to normal now, where she appeared to be back to her nice self. But I have lost interest in playing the role as a part of the big happy family since I now know I will always be a second-class citizen if something were to happen. I thought this feeling would go away, and my husband really wanted me to get along with his sister again.

3ukwc1bd	Sorry in advance, english is not my main language! In my (23F) town there is an old lady (we usually call her "trolley lady", she is quite famous in our town so everyone knows her) that always goes out alone with this trolley, usually walking in the middle of the road, blocking every car from passing and creating problems.  She always asks someone for help or money, like accompaning her home or buying some stuff. We have learned to avoid her, because if you offer her a finger she will take the whole arm. Like 3 days ago, I had to go to the train station (so I had a time for the train if I wanted to take it) and she asked me to accompany her home. I suffer from anxiety, depression and low self-esteem so it's actually diffuclt for me to say "No" to someone, and I like to think that usually I am kind with others, or at least try to be.  So I helped her home and she asked me to get her trolley to her appartment on the 3rd floor, and I did. Then she asked me if I could buy her some stuff and I said no since I had little money on me (for the ticket), she then asked me to accompany her to the mall, and I did. Then i had to go take the train because I was late, so I said goodbye.  Today I had a bad day but I had to go to the doctor and pharmacy for my painkillers. I really didn't want to go out but in the end I did. The whole time everything was just too much for me so I went as fast as I could and hurried home. And there is why I might be TA.  She was there, with her trolley and everything else and as soons as she seea me she screams "miss, miss! Come and help me!". I literally went cold and thought "oh fuck, not right now" so I just said "no I can't today, I'm in hurry" and ran home.  I didn't want to be touched, like really didn't want, and every sound was making me on edge, I just wanted to go home. But now I feel like maybe I should have helped her, as she was an old lady.

ivhbcu51	I (f17) broke up with my ex (f17) around a year ago. We were together for around 7 months, so it wasn't huge, but I loved her a lot and thought she loved me too. When we broke up, she told me terrible things about myself. She told me she only loved me physically and I was annoying (why she broke up with me when I moved away), she told me I was in too deep, and she told me I was a bad person. She also got into a relationship the next day, so I assume she'd been talking to someone else behind my back. And look, I'm not perfect, but I never once did anything bad to her. At the end of the day, she told me she thinks I'm a great friend, and wants to stay friends.  Fast forward a few months, she started talking badly about me to people for no reason, ignoring me and then telling me it was my fault, and calling me terrible things once again. And, my sister, (f16), decided to become her best friend.  Then a few weeks later (and still now), my sister and ex kept shit talking me to EACH OTHER. It hurts so incredibly much. But, they always tell me it's deserved, and I'm a bad person. They call me weird, annoying, and obsessive. My sister has said a few times she likes my ex better than she likes me.  Recently, I got into a huge fight with my brother. Long story short, I told her I hate feeling like she isn't there for me, and hate feeling like she's excusing my ex's actions. She told me "If you don't stop talking about this I'll talk about you EVEN MORE!" And it ended with her telling me, "If you don't like that I'm friends with her, stop paying attention. You're weird."  I've never hurt either one of them on purpose, and the times I've made a mistake I've sincerely apologized and done everything in my power to make up for it (which is just being human, right?). I wouldn't have an issue with her being friends with my ex either, because who am I to b upset? If my ex didn't treat me so terribly. But now they both talk shit about me to other people and each other. They've turned people against me. And all I ever do is try my best. It's hard to not feel like it's all my fault and a problem with me.  I know I could just try to ignore this. I hate feeling like I'm ruining somebody's friendship. But this hurts a lot. I also know they're both better people than this. I feel like I might be the asshole, simply because I've always believed people should choose who their friends are. And they're so happy being friends, I'd feel terrible to destroy it.   So, AITA for asking her to stop being friends with my ex?	1642783187.0	s9evel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9evel/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_sister_is_still/	AITA for being upset that my sister is still friends with my ex?
hb0q9pb7	Yeah so I (25) stay with my mom and sister (13) and I’m a full time student. I also freelance on upwork, so there’s no “need” for me to wake up at a certain time everyday unless I have class. But my mom always gets pissed off about me sleeping or taking naps. A lot of the time I stay up late to study or work cause that’s the only time that the house is quiet. (my mom likes to play gospel radio full volume literally 24/7, and when she falls asleep i can turn down the volume when she’s not looking) So when I stay up late naturally I end up either sleeping later until maybe 11 am or sometimes even 1 pm if I don’t have anything to do that day. Or, I’ll wake up early and take an hour nap in the afternoon to stay alert. But also, I’m just a person who needs a lot of sleep. (edit: it’s not just the gospel music that keeps me from studying during the day, it’s because my mom is really distracting cause she always needs us to go do things with her or asks for my advice or to talk with me. and then my sister needs my help with school. so night time is the only time i can get extended hours of work/study in.)  My sister is in a virtual school and I’m the one overseeing all her schoolwork. It’s an independent self study program and she doesn’t have any teachers or classroom time, so I’m literally helping her learn all her coursework and making sure she gets it in on time. My mom doesn’t even know how to log in to my sister’s canvas account and look at her grades, and definitely hasn’t put in any effort to teach my sister. Why should it matter when I do those things, if it’s early in the morning or at 2 pm as long as they get done in a timely manner?  My mom knows that I stay up late to work but she feels like I just shouldn’t do that. She told me today that other people have to wake up early and that I should be considerate and not sleep after 9 am. She also said she doesn’t want us to be bums and it’s time for all of us to get off of our asses and do something. She’s dissatisfied with how the house looks which I could understand, but she acts as if we don’t do anything at all. I literally cook dinner 4-5 times a week and on the days I don’t cook we eat out. She sometimes cooks but not too often. I clean when I can. I personally don’t see the point in all this, and I feel like I’m doing enough, but maybe I’m wrong.	1642783335.0	s9exq4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9exq4/aita_for_sleeping_in_when_i_dont_have_class/	AITA for sleeping in when I don’t have class?
ivgeomsd	I have parents who are fitness coaches. They are crazy when it comes to when and what you should eat, how often you should work out etc.   Ever since I was little I can remember hating breakfast. It's always made me feel shitty, I feel sick and can hardly eat in a morning however my parents say its normal and I just need to train my body.   Since last year my parents started to open they're gym up earlier so they can sanatize it properly before they open, so I was able to skip breakfast until my mum realised nothing was being eaten. So they started making me breakfast before they left at 6 and the same time I would get up.   My friend who I walk to school with, has to take her 2 little sisters to school so only has 20 minutes to shower, get dressed and ready before they wake up so she never gets breakfast, but then she always says how hungry she is.   So I decided to start putting the breakfast my mum made into tubs so she could eat on the way to school. This has been working since school began and I would just eat breakfast at break wich is around 9.30am and my body has woken up more.   Well, yesterday my mum got home just as I was getting the tub out of my bag to wash it. She asked me what was in it and I told her the whole thing as I thaught she would be okay with it since I was still eating.  She yelled at me and said how I could end up with an ED like she did, and that the school food is nasty and made in a factory. I told her i wouldn't as I'm still eating 3 meals a day, and the food isn't that bad. She called my dad and I was sat there for a hours lecture on how I'm damaging my body for not eating at the right times, and I have just been wasting the breakfasts they made for me.   So AITA?  Note: my mum had an eating disorder when she was younger, and want to make sure that I eat 3 times a day to make sure that I dont end up with one. This is also probably the reason she's obsessed with fitness is to make sure she dosent relapse	1642783489.0	s9ezul	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ezul/aita_for_skipping_my_breakfast_everyday_and_not/	AITA for skipping my breakfast everyday and not telling my parent's?
iez2xsuk	I apologize if this is not the right place to put this in but I just feel so confused and stuck that I needed to write this down.  For context, I (20 NB) have been friends with M (20 M) for almost ten years, we both have one another down as emergency contacts and know one another’s medical history for any medical situations.   M works on and off in the army but is currently working a side hustle with his family at a axe throwing place, helping guest and safety teaching them to throw axes. I’m currently in college and is on and off with volunteering/ working at a fire station as a EMT.   Two weeks ago, M was beginning to complain of sudden abdominal pain that would be sharp and painful to move but would be on and off, I suggested to get checked out by a doctor and he did that, just to be told it could be gastritis.  Three days ago, M had to be transferred to the hospital as he began to go into septic shock and was later informed he had appendicitis, I was called by the hospital and quickly made my way .  M came out of surgery and asked if I can call his family and his emergency contact and inform them of the situation, to which I did, it wasn’t much calls as he only had me, his father, and little brother as his emergency contract.   I eventually had to leave since I had to work and went on my day. I usually have my phone on silent when I’m at work except I would get notifications and calls from emergency contacts. During work, I kept getting calls from m, I answered them once I had my break and it turned out to be his girlfriend.  His girlfriend was upset at me since I didn’t call her and informed her of M in the hospital and how I was a bitch and trying to ruin her relationship. I told her that M only asked me to call his emergency contact and that she wasn’t on their so I had no fault on her finding out last minute.   She continued to harass me so I just refused her calls and left the situation alone. Several of my coworkers overhead my conversation and asked what happened, I didn’t want to throw the situation out but just only watered it down so they could kinda get the picture.  Several of my coworkers thought I was in the wrong while others think I shouldn’t be getting the heat and that the discussion should have been stuck to M and his girlfriend.

4m7gflou	Apologies in advance for formatting as I am on mobile.  I (29M) had my birthday back on Wednesday, the 19th. During the early part of the day, I remembered that due to multiple issues over the past 5-6 months, I haven't talked to my stepmom, whom I consider my real mom. I reached out to her via text, as she doesn't monitor her social media or messenger much at all. I explained why I hadn't reached out, what I had been going through, and explained that with the downtime I had during my birthday, I wanted to reach out to let her know I wasn't shutting her out. It took her a few hours to respond and when she did, it was clipped and felt passive-aggressive (e.g, she chided me that it wasn't only me but my SO that had "ghosted" her). I apologized for that, thanked her for wishing me a Happy Birthday, and the didn't receive a response. A few hours after that, I received news that my SO and I were about an hour and a half from being escorted out of our current residence by police because we were in the red for payment. Us being in self quarantine for our second bout of Covid and being unable to work fell on deaf ears for any goodwill.   Well, I reached out to my stepmom, via call this time, got her voicemail, and let her know the urgency of the situation and if she was able to help. I received no answer or communication, and haven't since that day. Now I'm wondering if I came off as TA for seeming like I only reached out for money. So, AITA?  ETA: 1. We barely talk as is and outside of holidays/birthdays, she never initiates contact. 2. I don't ignore messages from her, nor do I use her as an ATM. It's really presumptuous of some of you to jump to that conclusion. 3. In those months that I was buried under financial, residential, and medical stress, she never reached out. I'm expected to fill in the gaps she leaves. 4. I'm staying in an Extended Stay hotel, which is far more financially viable than apartments in my area. 5. My unfortunate situation timing is what I'm asking to be judged on, not what fantasies you people come up with to smear me.	1642783803.0	s9f40j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9f40j/aita_for_asking_for_assistance_from_my_stepmom/	AITA For Asking For Assistance From My Stepmom?
ivj6fl6y	My wife and I closed on our house a few months ago. We absolutely love it, it’s a one-in-a-million house that could easily be our forever home.   A couple days ago, we got an extremely emotional call from the seller. She said that the house was her childhood home and she regretted selling it, and pleaded with us to let her buy it back (covering closing and moving costs, so that we would break exactly even). My wife and I told her that our house is not for sale. The seller said “everything has its price, name yours.” We reiterated again that we’re not interested in selling. The seller said that she would give us 20% more than we paid for it. I told her that we’d consider it, and ended the call.  As much as we love the house, this offer is a total no-brainer—20% over purchase price amounts to hundreds of thousands of dollars (edit: and far outpaces how much the house has appreciated in the few months we've owned it). Here’s where my wife thinks we might be in the wrong. The seller was visibly pregnant when we closed on the house, so she presumably had her baby fairly recently. My wife thinks the seller is going through some sort of postpartum depression/psychosis, and so it would be wrong to take advantage of her presumed mental illness. My wife thinks we should avoid further contact with the seller and keep the house.  I think my wife is making some unfounded (and frankly sexist) assumptions that the seller is mentally ill just because she was pregnant. Who are we to say that getting to keep a childhood home after having seller’s remorse isn’t worth several hundred thousand dollars to someone? I think we should take the seller up on her offer. As much as we love the house, it clearly means a lot more to the seller than it does to us, and we stand to gain an enormous amount of money in the process.	1642783908.0	s9f5mj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9f5mj/wibta_for_letting_the_previous_owner_of_my_house/	WIBTA for letting the previous owner of my house buy it back a few months after the sale for 20% more than we paid?
6f2jpnmj	For context I am 16 years old and my mother is 44. I work a crappy minimum wage job and get paid $100 to $200 every 2 weeks. It would be less crappy if I didn't have to split half my paycheck with my mother but we can't all get what we want. My mom doesn't work and gets paid SSI so I feel obligated to give her money because she has said numerous times that everyone's income affects hers. I don't have an issue with working but she keeps volunteering me to work and when I confronted her she told me that she just wanted me to make more money. Now here's where I definitely feel like TA, I told her that she can't just decide when I'm busy or not and that she should have asked if I was okay working. I now have to go in at 4:00 but I don't want to be mad at my mother if I don't have a good reason to be. I know this post is childish but is this actually a normal thing?   Edit: a lot of you are saying I'm being abused and I have been told this in the past. I'm just trying to get through high school so I can leave. I only have this job so that I have prior experience so that when I quit I can find a better job and show I have experience. My boss is also my dad's boss so I can't talk to her about not listening to my mom because I have 3 family members who work there. I can't stop giving her money because that will make it worse, I'm overwhelmed realizing that this isn't normal and y'all are saying to get emancipated but I've already looked into this option and it doesn't seem likely I can get it done before I'm 18 do I may just wait a year considering I'm turning 19 soon. Thanks for all the support and I you want to know anything don't be scared to ask.	1642783978.0	s9f6q1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9f6q1/wibta_for_telling_my_mom_i_only_work_so_she_gets/	WIBTA for telling my mom I only work so she gets paid?

8kweuddz	My parents are split up so I have busy Christmas’s. The ‘schedule’ for this year was - Wake up at my mums, go to my grandparents’s house (mums), go to grandparents house (dads), gpo to dads house till the next dad, next day mum picks me up for my mums extended family Christmas.  Christmas Day was all normal until I (f16) went to my grandparents house (dads). I get along with them really well but I rarely get to see the, so I really enjoy Christmas with them. We had lunch and then 5 mins later someone asked when dessert was meant to be. My grandma said she didn’t know yet and my dad asked if I wanted some, I said maybe then he asked if I wanted it now. I immediately said no because I was full and would want to wait for a bit. It was said we would have desert in about 2 hours, which was fine with me.  A few minutes past and my dad asked if I wanted to leave, I said not really continuing my conversation with my aunt.   About 10 mins later he walks away and then walks back and just announces that we are leaving. Everyone , including me, was shocked and kinda hurt but I hate speaking up, especially to my parents so I just say ok.  I say bye to Everyone and dad takes me home and we don’t talk about it.    I asked my dad if he wanted to open his presents from me because we prefer to do that when it’s just the two of us. He said no and that he “wasn’t in the ‘Christmas mood’”.   This hurt me because I don’t see my dad often because I live with my mum most of the time and Christmas is one time I know we get to do stuff together and have fun.    I go to my room to leave dad alone for a bit. My mum ended up calling me and asking if I something she needed in my bag.   I looked and saw that I did have it so she said that she would be there soon  Whiles she’s on her way, she asked how it was and I said that we had already left. She was surprised and asked what happened and why we left so early. I briefly explained what happened.  When she go to my dads, she asked me more about it’s and I explained everything and I started crying because I felt bad cause I barely see my  grandparents unless It a day like Christmas and  how I wanted to stay but dad didn’t give me a choice.  Mum ended up asking my dad if she could take me back to my grandparents and he said yes. When I got in the car dad said, “don’t be surprised if I’m really drunk when you get back tonight”  This made me burst into tears when my mum started driving away and I started saying I didn’t want to go back to his house tonight.   Mum said we would deal with it later.  I went and a few hours later mum came and picked me up, we headed to my dads house, mum said that I wanted to sleep at her place because it would be better for my mental health.   I went home with mum.  I feel like a bit of an asshole now because it has almost been a month and I have not tried to contact him. Mum has made me feel bad because he is my dad and I should message him, but I’m still upset.

d70a6m9e	Edit: Grammar.  So I'm in my mid-teens, and I have a bit of insomnia. Melatonin doesn't always work and I tend to wake up at random with the inability to get back to bed. Whenever my schedule gets fucked up, I try to fix it ASAP.  My mom and dad are usually pretty inactive when it comes to...Y'know. So I really don't mind if they do it every now and then. But one night I woke up solely because I heard them going at it. The next morning, I told my mom that I heard all of it. She took that well.  But she seemed to get angry and offended when I said this: ' Maybe refrain from doing that until I get my schedule back on track. Just until then. When it's fixed, go at it. '  She got all pissy with me, telling me that I should ' just go to sleep ' even when she knows damn well I've been trying.

ivgu46rr	I (f30) live with my husband (m35) and three children (m8/ f5 / and m2). I work as a freelance artist from home and my husband works long hours driving. As a result, I do the majority of housework and look after our three children. Though when he's off work and home, he takes on his fair share. Our lives mean that we don't have much free time.    I enjoy cooking and as a mum, I make sure to give my children a wide variety in foods to eat. I want them to appreciate different cultures, flavours and different types of cuisine from all around the world, and to grow up kind and respectful of others,  so a few days a week, (3 out of 7 )my children and I cook together and make a recipe from another country. We all enjoy this and it gives a perfect segue into learning about a foreign country.   My husband on the other hand has a more plain palette, and prefers simpler english dishes that he grew up with, such as pies, fish and chips, roast dinners ect. We eat plenty of meals like this too.   A week ago, we hired a babysitter and went to a friend's house for dinner. (All Covid tested and negative) They cooked a beautiful vegetarian pie, with mashed potatoes and vegetables.My husband turned to them and said "Oh god, finally! A decent meal for once! Picklepiebanana is always cooking these awful smelly dishes." Hurt, I looked at my husband and asked him what he meant, and he said that " he only puts up with it, because he doesn't have time to cook something decent for himself".    The meal was a little awkward after that, but neither of us brought it up again while there, until we came home. I told him that I "wouldn't stop cooking foreign food with the kids and if he didn't like it, he would have to cook something for himself."  He once again said that " he didn't have time for that, and I should just cook him something he likes at the same time, " which I refuse to do, mainly because when he comes home after work he spends all his time, up until bedtime, gaming (this is around 4 / 4 1/2 hours of time after he comes in.) and has plenty of time to cook a quick, but decent meal for himself and enjoy his hobby.   Once again this week, I cooked with my kids and like I told my husband, I didn't leave him any. He was pissed, but ordered take out. The second time he went around to his parents house and his mum cooked for him. The next day, I got a phone call from my MIL saying I was " an asshole for not cooking for my husband, and that I spent all day doing my hobby (my actual job) and why shouldn't he enjoy his hobby? " Which again, he still can and does do. I also still cook for him on the days I'm not cooking anything foreign.

ivklyt9o	Growing up, my older brother (Harley) was vicious towards me. I never understood it but I think it had to do with being the last born and "overthrowing" him as the baby. Our mother handled it very poorly. Yes, she did things for me that she didn't do for him and things happened to him that she didn't allow to happen to me.  But the way Harley treated was horrible. It did scar me. Harley became a recluse up until our mom got sick. I had already married and have two sons. My wife said she expected some kind of monster.  Harley is very close with our other brother's nephew (Jack) who is 9. Harley is his "cool uncle." Jack is the same age as my son Brian. They don't understand why they can't spend time all together.  By no means do I think Harley would hurt either one of my kids. My issue is that I can't get over how he treated me and feel like it's dismissive of what he put me through.  Edit: To put it in perspective, Harley was like Johnny Lawrence growing up. Now he's like Uncle Jesse from Full House.	1642787313.0	s9ggfx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ggfx/aita_for_not_allowing_my_brother_to_have_a/	AITA for not allowing my brother to have a relationship with my sons?
aln7kw96	My roommate and I moved in together after being close long term friends. Unfortunately, since she moved in with me I can't help but feel that her lifestyle, particularly in regards to her boyfriend and their codependency issues, have been a point of contention. It's her first time living outside of her parents house, and since she has moved in with me she has dropped out of college and is smoking a crazy amount of weed. If her boyfriend isn't in our apartment, she is at his, which means I'm either third wheeling or alone completely. While I understand as a domestic partner she has no obligation to support me, as a friend I was really upset by her actions last night.  Me and my boyfriend broke up due to practical reasons (he will be moving abroad soon and we wanted to spare ourselves the pain of being forced apart at the last minute). My roommate came home from her shift and I asked her if she wanted to do something. At first she said yes, but that she would have to call her boyfriend because he was supposed to come over. Keep in mind they had last seen each other the day before last. She comes back to my room red faced and runny makeup, saying that she's sorry, she just really was looking forward to seeing him. I would rather get no support than support that isn't earnest, so I hid my shock at the disregard for what I was going through, and told her to go to see him. I understand I told her to go and that's on me, but I feel bad for being hurt.

I work in a hospital and seeing some very difficult decisions over the past year, I realized I really needed to get my legal affairs in order.   During this process, I had a conversation with my wife about end-of-life decisions. There are a number of situations where my quality of life and function would be low enough that I would want care to be discontinued. I expressed these concerns with my wife and what I would wish for her to do under these conditions. She insists that she would never discontinue care under any conditions.   At this point, we've had this discussion a dozen times, with no resolution and a lot of arguing. As far as I'm concerned, I'm unmovable in how I would want my care to be delivered. I will not risk being a patient with no chance of recovery, suffering in silence. I ultimately decided to name my oldest friend as my MPOA, because I know she will honor my decisions under these circumstances.  My wife is pretty pissed at me.

39lr977q	Some context before we start: - I’m 22F - I’m living at home with my mom (50F) & grandma (75F) This conflict is mainly between me and my grandma.  - This is my first time dating in 3+ years. - Not sharing deets about my love interest cuz that would be hypocritical LMAO just know that this stems from a desire for privacy rather than secrecy.  ———  So! I’ve met someone that I’m really interested in via a dating app. In a month, we’ve progressed from texting sporadically to calling for 5+ hours a day, and we finally decided to plan our first in-person date!  As a courtesy, I tell mom/grandma about it. They grill me about surface level personal details (name, photo, degree, location, etc.), which I was already expecting.  Then my grandma asks for their social security number.   Now, my love interest is very private. Doesn’t put their business on the internet and would strongly prefer to keep it that way. Truthfully, she wouldn’t even learn much by cyber-stalking.  My grandma, however, does not trust internet-based relationships. At all. The second I mentioned we met via a dating app, she assumed that I was being catfished. No room for debate - that’s her perspective.   Before she can ‘approve’ of this relationship, she wants to run their SSN through some reporting websites to confirm that they’re a real person and all that’s been shared between us is factual.   I am fully against this. Not only do I think it’s a severe invasion of privacy, I already have enough proof to confirm that they’re real. We have mutual friends from high school, who I’ve already talked to. We’ve FaceTimed. My mom has even talked to them. But that’s just not good enough for my grandma.   So, I put my foot down, said I wasn’t willing to share that info (I don’t even have their SSN lol) and ended that conversation. She’s been pissed about it ever since. However…the date is tonight, and I can imagine that the tension will be worse once I mention that I’m heading out for it.

35i9b	Being quite an active person in an enclosed space can make your room smelly quickly. So I try and open the windows any chance I get, to get some air running through. I also run very warm and don't mind cold temperatures compared to other people. I also live in southern california where it doesn't particularly get that cold.  It's also one of those houses where everyone keeps to themselves so I'm mostly in my room at home.  So when I go to work, I used to leave my windows open and the door to my room open. Before this housemate moved in we also used to keep the kitchen and verandah door cracked to improve airflow, we stopped this at her request already.  My housemate who works from home has recently asked me to close the windows while I'm at work at the cold air is coming in. I thought that was a fair request, so I started closing it.  I did notice a change in the smell of the room though. So I figured I'd close my door instead and just leave the window open. There is no other window open or anything to cause a draft either.  I just received this text -  *I've been feeling the cold air coming through again since I work from home and I'm here basically all day, I kindly asked you to shut it and that's not a wild request. but if shutting your window while you're away is not open to compromise, just know it might raise our electricity bill if I'm using a space heater to counteract it since it's making me cold. Thanks*  I replied back -  *Sorry, I thought the door being closed would be enough. Will close it now.*  This has just really irked me the wrong way. I feel I've been quite generous already and controlling what I do in my room with the door closed seems a step too far. The space heater thing sounds like an idle threat as well (a laughable one at that).  She also must be standing at my door and feeling for the air underneath the crack or something, it's really weird. There's nothing to promote a draft so she shouldn't be able to feel anything anyway. I think the blinds might be moving and making a little noise, which is how she knows the window is open rather than it actually being cold.  Am I being the asshole here or are these requests becoming overboard?  Edit: There isn't any security concerns. It's an apartment on the 3rd floor with dogs at the ground level and sight to two streets. Weather is 50-70 like everyday.	1642788331.0	s9gv0i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9gv0i/aita_for_having_my_window_open_in_a_sharehouse/	AITA for having my window open in a sharehouse while I'm at work?
4e4bwtfb	I, 32, F am an ECE Assistant at a huge daycare centre. I have been in various rooms, have taken on various shifts & have experienced everything over 8 years. I have grown in my profession & had many co workers as well as many children come and go.  A month after my dad's death (he passed away in October), I had a hard time with my dad's passing & fell into a deep depression to the point where I was put back to on call. I stayed on call until January of this hear. It still bothers me, but not anymore to the point where I can't work or go anywhere.  In January, I kept getting hit with the whole "potential hours" & "I have you in mind for any upcoming hours." I thought that was my fate so I saw what else was out there and applied to other daycare centres.  I got hired into a new daycare center close to home, full time hours, as well as being a 20 minute walk & less than a 5 minute drive from my house. I put in my two weeks notice to my current employer & it was on a good note.  While some of my colleagues are happy for me. I overheard someone say "She is going to another centre for more hours! She can eat her words!" & word got out fast.  I can't help but feel guilty & am beginning to question my decision to leave where I stayed committed. However, I ended up falling on hard times because of the two to three months without working. I also knew that I needed a fresh start after my dad's death.   AITA here? Should I have stuck it out?

I didn’t tell y’all have I got the shirt but like a couple of week ago me and her was in the kitchen and we made a mess so my shirt got dirty and her mom said I can wear her shirt.

83oz9f8v	Hi I’m sure this title doesn’t make much sense but hear me out. Im a 15(f) and my mom a 40(f) (nearly 41) has her birthday coming up, and she had asked me if I wanted to with her to buy a bag. I said sure and asked where we’d be going since we were going the next day, and she said we would be driving to a place an hour away from our home to which I replied without really thinking about her birthday “haha you must really want a bag” to then her drastically changing her tone and saying “it’s my birthday soon. I always do everything for everyone in this house for their birthday I always spend my money for them and never myself. You need to learn to be more appreciative. Never mind I don’t want to go tomorrow.” Where I then just sat in silence next to her because honestly I had no clue how to respond! I felt so bad for saying that and I wish I had thought my answer through.  Even later she kept ignoring me and giving me the silent treatment and I had no clue how I could talk to her again. I tried talking to her later and saying that I was so sorry and that we should go to the shop and buy her bag and I would even buy something for her, to which she said fine and then later we went to bed at roughly the same time. But I felt so bad the next day when I had woken up around 12pm and my mom telling me that we weren’t going anymore because of me “waking up late” to which i told her that if she had told me what time we’d be getting up then I would have set an alarm- to which she told me it’s too late for that already and that we weren’t going for me to argue again that it was only 12 and we still had time to then her telling me it was a long drive and she didn’t want to do it anymore to which I just accepted any moved on but am I the asshole?  *clarification* I wake up at noon on a regular basis when it comes to school breaks/weekends, the only days I wake up early are for school (around 7am)	1642788884.0	s9h2qn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9h2qn/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_must_really_want_to/	AITA for telling my mom she must really want to buy a bag?

ivm0vjno	I'm fourteen, parents were never married, I'm a one night stand baby. My dad remarried again last year (seventh wife in fourteen years). My mom and stepdad have been together for ten years, with two younger kids.  My parents have split 50/50 custody, and so, one week with one set and the other week with the other. Pretty simple.   My dad moved in with his wife and her daughter (12). She's very possessive of him. If I'm there I'm second best. She's calling him daddy all the time, I never get ten minutes with him, she wont even let him pick me up alone. She's always there.  To top it off, we have to share a room, which she kicks off about, so she gets to sleep in their bed.   Last week I got upset. My dog had died and I was trying to talk to him about it, and she wouldnt let me. After twenty minutes of trying he told me we could talk later and left to go take her to the store or something.   I called my stepdad to come pick me up and take me back to their house. My dad was really upset, and apologised. I told him it wasnt good enough. He needs to prioritise his actual kid over a kid he'll probably never see again in a year or two when he inevitably moves on to the next wife.   That made him quite angry, but mom intervenes before he can really say anything. I told her that I will not be talking to him until he agrees to set up a day just me and him where he can actually make it up to me.  She agreed, and relayed info. He's been really angry since, and tried messaging me on my socials, but I blocked him. I've been talking to my mom and she says he's been really upset, but hasnt offered to set up a day just us.  I dont want to go back on what I said, but I feel awful. I miss my dad and we all know this wont last very long before he does move on and then we'll be back to normal.   I also feel really bad for what I said, I know it really upset him, even if it is true. My stepdad has said we can alter custody; so I only go on the weekends, or every other weekend, instead. Or I can just have days out with him or something. I dont really know what to do.  But anyway. Am I an asshole for saying that to my dad and refusing to see him?	1642789457.0	s9hak4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hak4/aita_for_telling_my_dad_he_needs_to_prioritise_me/	AITA For telling my dad he needs to prioritise me over my step sister, and then refusing to see him?
iu74qh7b	 I got a Instagram DM from a girl asking "heyy girlie, are you Ethan's ex" and I didn't know her.   I've only had serious relationships with two men in my life, none of them named Ethan. So I replied "nah think u got the wrong person" and didn't think too much of it.  Then she replied with a screenshot of me and a dude I'd had a short fling with in college, I'd actually forgotten about him briefly. But we were kissing in the picture (cringe lol)   She sent me a pretty rude message calling me a liar and I replied saying "chill, we never dated, I forgot we hung out in college"   She texted back asking what hung out meant and I asked why she had so many questions.   She said she was dating him now but back in college she and he were also seeing each other and she wanted to know if he was loyal.   I was like "he was with you when he was in college? Yeah sorry girl but he's kinda a player, I hung with him a couple times then found out he was also hitting up both of my roommates   She asked if I was for real and that she couldn't believe it... So I found screenshots of my texts with my old roommate group where we all realized we were being hit up by the same boy. And all being like 'girl nooo we're all blocking him"   I said that she outta block him too because he's such a player and she kinda blew up on me! Saying me and my roommates were whores??  I texted back saying none of us ever slept with him cause we all caught on real quick he was being a fuckboy and that it was real rude of her to ask me for favors and then insult me!  She blocked me then I got a message from the dude who unfortunately works at the same place I work so he was able to get my business number even though I blocked him on my personal phone.   And he literally called me mad I called him a fuckboy to his girlfriend? I was so shocked he called me on my WORK PHONE and I hung up and blocked him.  But I got an email from him telling me that I was a bitch, for telling his girlfriend she should leave him because... He rejected me and it made me jealous (???)   Bro what... I didn't even remember him let alone be jealous years later!  I feel like I might be poking my head intp something I shouldn't of?

dpstkbam	Hey guys,  So my (20F) boyfriend shares a room with his friend for rent to be cheaper (both 19M). I really like his friend and he’s super nice (sometimes a little rude when he’s being sarcastic) but overall cool. The problem is that he’s really desperate for a girlfriend and is consequently superrr thirsty. I appreciate that he’s comfortable around me enough to talk about the girls he likes, show me pretty girls on Instagram, etc. but recently I’ve been bothered because he always (and I mean like once every five to ten minutes) shows my boyfriend some half-naked woman on Instagram, models or actresses, past gfs or current crushes, and naked butts and boobs, or describes in detail why and how some woman he met or knows of is hot to my boyfriend (“oh she’s so hot have you seen her ass?”). Not only do I find it a bit disrespectful sometimes to sexualize random women so much, but I’m starting to get fed up with having to watch my boyfriend look at this stuff while I’m there. He never reacts or agrees with his friend and always just says “she’s pretty” or nods or something which is nice of him. But I don’t like that every ten minutes he’s reminded by his roommate of the sexiness of these random women and sees it. I know everyone still thinks others are attractive while they’re in a relationship but god I wish I didn’t have to watch it happen all the time.   So would I be the asshole if I asked the roommate to stop, at least when I’m there? And if I did, how do i do it or what do I say,?   Thanks!  Update: the reason I think I could be the asshole is because idk if it is an overstep of rights based on an overreaction or like breaks some sort of bro code   I also don’t want the friend to no longer like me if I confront him	1642789595.0	s9hcej	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hcej/wibta_if_i_told_my_boyfriends_roommate_to_stop/	WIBTA if I told my boyfriends roommate to stop showing him pictures of sexy women while I’m there?
f14fz19b	For context, my daughter is eighteen years old and received money from her brother (27) for Christmas, specifically for the tattoo. We don't have problems with tattoos in our family, since both her mother and I have multiple. So it's not the actual concept that's the problem.  Today was her scheduled appointment and I dropped her off at the parlour before leaving. Around 20 minutes later, she called to say she was finished. I was a little surprised because I expected it to take longer, but I didn't ask questions. On the drive home, we made idle chat about how it went and she said it went fine, that it didn't hurt and that she'd want another. When we got home, I asked to see it and she showed me. To the right of her spine, kind of near her shoulder was a simple swan drawn in "line-art" style or whatever she called it.   I'll be honest, I didn't really like it even despite its sentimental value. Two years ago, my mother and my daughters gran, passed away. My daughter took it hard as we all did, but she was less closed up than the rest of us about it. She wrote a beautiful poem for her funeral, and she lets her emotions out in writing. I could tell she was heartbroken, as her gran was akin to her best friend. She loved her so much and due to covid, didn't get one last chance to say goodbye at the hospital. The swan was a memorial tattoo for her gran, since we all affectionately called her "Granny Swan".   So I say that for the price she paid, I probably could have done it for free with a sharpie. Which is true, it looks like something anyone could draw. I then asked if she intended to get more, to which she said yes. I'm fine with this, but because of her answer I tell her that a couple years down the line when she has more tattoos, that she'll definetely get this covered up. She disagreed since the tattoo had meaning, and she wouldn't get rid of it. I insisted because I'm certain that when she has other, hopefully nicer tattoos, that her bad one will suddenly be a lot more obvious to her.   Now she's upset about it, and told me that she doesn't like it anymore and is glad it's on her back so she doesn't have to see it. To which I'm thinking, if she really loved it then why would it take her father disliking it, for her to hate it? Seems like a waste to me and I honestly think she's being dramatic. I don't have to like it, and neither does anyone else but I'm not going to lie and say I love it when I don't.  So am I the asshole?	1642789634.0	s9hcwr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hcwr/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_shell_eventually/	AITA for telling my daughter she'll eventually cover up her new tattoo?
iv2wzw58	I (17) was born when my sister Ari was already 18. She stayed at home till I was 10 doing her university and masters. So my parents obviously spoiled me cause I was the miracle boy. But I always remember it was Ari who taught me to be polite, chew with my mouth closed, how to clean even, be nice and all the stuff like that. It was so much better when she'd make food than my mom. I remember when I was 9 she and her boyfriend (husband now) took me to the park, someone asked if I was her son and she said close enough and I when I asked later what she meant she said I was their practice baby.  But when she left, she left and she's like stayed gone. I've seen her so few times since. Like there was her wedding, my other sister's wedding and funtions like that.  Point is in those 10 years, she kept me from being the spoiled brat my mom and dad were definitely turning me into. So even if she didn't wanted to see me in the last seven years I'm still grateful.  So university applications are being filled out and I want to do software engineering at Waterloo. My mom wants me to stay local. Yesterday it turned into a big family zoom meeting where Ari was involved. She said if staying with family was an issue, her family was moving to Kitchener and her husband heard and he piped up saying he'd love it if I could stay with them.  I thought that was cool cause I'd finally get to see them again and meet my niece. But my mom said no, you're not going. So I got really mad and I asked why not. She said you're going to need your mother when you start university. That made me angrier and I said before Ari left she was a better mom to me than you anyway.  That didn't go well since my mom ran to her room to cry (so I couldn't see), my dad said I was being ungrateful and my sister (not Ari) told me to stop being an asshole. So... I don't know.  edit for anyone confused: Kitchener is a city right next to Waterloo	1642789864.0	s9hg7h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hg7h/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_my_sister_was_a/	AITA for telling my mom that my sister was a better mother than her
dcrqbxx7	WIBTA if I organize holidays without my gf friend despite asking her if she wanted to come and her say yes ?  Typing on cellphone and english is not my first language. I (30M) want to take my GF (28F) for holidays and since I know that it’s the kind of holidays her friends would like, I casually asked if they would like to join and one of them (close friend of my gf) said yes. The thing is, we dont have at all the same ideas on what housing or transportation should be for the holidays. I make good money and I dont have that many days off so I wanted the holidays to be a treat with a very nice hotel and restaurants for diner. My GF friend is carefull with money and my gf says that she will want to spend less and save money on accomodation and food, think a airbnb and home made diner. I dont want that so I offered my gf to pay for everyone’s accomodation and take a very nice one but my gf is saying that her friend will not be confortable with that and will not want to spend money on restaurants or first class transportation either way. She suggests that we only go together so we can take the Nice accomodation I had in mind and splurge on restaurants and so. She says that she will go with her friend another time for cheaper holidays. I feel like kind of TA because I feel its snobbish from me not to go for the cheaper option so we can go altogether.

She was telling me how I was nothing and saying, quote on quote, "You shouldn't have been born," and then yelled at me for crying because of it. Then she played the guilt card so me, being anxiety ridden as hell, snapped at her, saying: "It seems like neither you nor dad really want me, so why don't you just get rid of me already since I'll be better off without you."

19w0lc37	I’m 18 and live under their roof. I got a puppy against their will (I’m the A for that) but eventually they fell in love with it and is now an accepted member of the family.  Flash forward to him now 8 months old, he is now 30lbs and considered big for a puppy, he’s developed this habit of being overly excited when seeing Mom after not seeing her for awhile (and by that, I mean at least 30mins of her being in another room) and everytime he sees her, Mom always greets him with “Hello Loki!” In her friendly high pitch voice which ofc drives my puppy crazy all the time and starts jumping at her, paws up to her face and she always holds both his paws in a standing position even though she’s telling him “no”,  or “stop” which obviously doesn’t work because any touch or verbal sound at all is stimulating him even more. Then she tops this off by giving him pets right away which then becomes like a reward for the behaviour.   So now I’m keeping him leashed whenever she’s coming to the room so I can control the puppy. I’ve also suggested Mom to not approach him right away and let him calm down first. And I’m pretty sure the way she verbally greets him too is part of the problem because it’s eliciting the same overly excited response. So I told her to change that too, and just ignore him when she gets in the same room as him.   But that made her think I’m being ridiculous. Says I’m being to strict. That it’s just a dog and doesn’t understand. That I’m trying to make it perfect. Which is not true, this is a habit that can be corrected through training and proper discouragement/reinforcement, and it’s what responsible dog owners do because this is a bad and dangerous habit for them to develop. What if my little cousins come over and Loki does this? Jump on their faces and scratch or knock them over? This is what I am trying to avoid.  So now that I know she’s not willing to follow how I train him, I’m trying to keep my dog away from her by keeping him at my side at all times and leaving the room whenever she comes. Am I being unreasonable? My dog never does this to me, or my sister or my Dad. And Loki sees my dad and sister less than Mom. So who’s the problem here?	1642791104.0	s9hwaf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9hwaf/aita_for_keeping_my_puppy_away_from_mom/	AITA for keeping my puppy away from Mom?
goy1hv5h	I (nb 18) don't like my coworker (f 18 and we'll call her M for the purpose of the post) M, and my whole store knows but I choose to stay civil enough to get work done. M is in highschool still and I'm in college but when she calls out for whatever reason I or our other coworker are usually the one to cover for her and we do so frequently. Like once a week, which causes me to occasionally miss lectures or time I allotted for homework which is fine I guess I don't mind the extra pay.   Anyway, I got off work last night and was told that my biological mother was in a car accident and was in the hospital and might need blood so I had decided that I would be going out regardless. I couldn't find anyone to cover my shift today so my manager said I should go and she'd work it out. Apparently "working it out" was scheduling M to work in my place and she was extremely upset that I called out. she told me that she had plans and I could just see my mother over the weekend seeing as it's Friday and I don't work weekends. (I haven't told my coworkers except for my manager that my mom's in the hospital only that something came up and I need to see her) When I said I would not be coming in I was already in the next state over she got mad and said that I "didn't understand what it's like to actually have a social life" and "didn't get her need to see her friends because I have a happy home life" and I don't I have a relatively good home life.   Here's where I think I might be the AH, this isn't the first time she's done stuff like this to people to get her way and I was so exhausted from being up all night driving and in the waiting room I sent screenshots of her tantrum to my manager and said I didn't think it was appropriate for her to be talking to anyone like this and I will be back on Monday but I do not wish to work with M until I get an apology.  Our coworker texted me telling me she came out of the managers office crying because she's on probation as this was her third strike. If she get's a complaint again she will be fired. Some of our coworkers are saying I didn't need to send those screenshots to our manager and she's just a kid and I should cut her some slack and should've just come in or let it go like an adult but I don't think I'm in the wrong here.

4r95nb1d	I (51F) was my family's scapegoat; my sister was the golden child. I was blamed for things I never did, and my grandmother and mother made me prioritize my sister's wishes, especially after my dad died when I was fourteen. It messed me up, and I've had many other bad relationships as a result.  Now I'm in a friend group that formed about twelve years ago. It includes people I've known since I was a kid and other people I met when the group formed after a trip. A guy in the group whom I was close to in high school and until several years ago, "Ted," went cold on me and gave me the silent treatment for five years, including blocking me on social media. It hurt, but he'd always been hot and cold and pretty narcissistic, so I didn't chase him and beg for forgiveness for whatever he thought I did like I used to.  (I found out later he was jealous that his friends liked me when the group formed.)  A woman in the group who was my best friend as a kid, "Pam," pressured me for several years to love Ted again, "be the bigger person," "just not have hard feelings," etc., which hurt and made me doubt myself. But I held my ground, stayed away from Ted, and that felt right.  Since all that I've been avoiding Pam and just have hung out with the people in the group who didn't pressure me about Ted.  Recently another woman in the group, "Laurie," texted me about how she recently lost a high school friend, and she's sad I'm no longer close to Pam. I don't know Laurie extremely well, but I like her and she seems more emotionally mature than Pam or Ted.  I'm not sure if Laurie has my best interests in mind or is advocating for Pam. I'm trying to give Laurie the benefit of the doubt.  I don't want to be close to Pam again. But I'd like for the group (including myself) to feel more comfortable. For instance, I'd be okay if I just saw Pam at events other people have organized. I don't feel like inviting her to my own parties, though. My family's hard enough.  Bottom line:  On one hand, it wouldn't be fun for me to invite Pam to anything I plan.  On the other hand,  I really like being in the group, and I realize it can be a pain for other people to deal with conflict between others. So maybe I should make more of an effort to include Pam in my events. Laurie and Pam live in a town 200 miles away from where I and other members of the group live, so it's not like I ever have see Pam a lot (luckily, Ted is 1,000 miles away).  So, WIBTA if I just told Laurie I can't be close to Pam anymore, but I can see her at other people's events and not offer more?  &#x200B;  Edited to add: I think I may be the AH because maybe I'm being petty because no one's asked me to love Pam, so maybe not wanting to see her is immature and I really should be a bigger person.	1642791798.0	s9i5w7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9i5w7/wibta_for_telling_a_mutual_friend_of_someone_i/	WIBTA for telling a mutual friend of someone I don't like that I'm not going to reconcile with the other person?
5hs227a4	So I (22M) live in a house with 3 other guys around my age. Long story short, all three of these guys claim to be hot all the time. Over the Summer it was not uncommon to walk downstairs and see the AC set at 61 degrees. Now, I honestly prefer a cooler temperature but this was very uncomfortable and made the electric bill extremely expensive. I was looked at like I was crazy for complaining about this.  Anyways Winter has rolled around and it is pretty cold outside, with outdoor temperatures getting into the mid teens overnight. And for whatever reason the heat will not cut on. I've tried messing around with it and restarting the unit and I can't get anything to work. I'm not knowledgeable in HVAC and clearly someone needs to come out, diagnose the problem, and fix it.   Only one of my roommates has the landlord's phone number and does not want to contact him because he doesn't think it's an issue, he doesn't want the house to get "too hot", and probably thinks the landlord will scold him for being messy. While I have a space heater in my room, the rest of the house is cold, say around 60 degrees. I'm sick and tired of being uncomfortable when I walk downstairs and I'm worried about a pipe freezing/bursting.  Anyways, we have a property manager who mostly just handled the lease paperwork and whatnot. I have his contact information and could most likely have him send over the landlord's phone number so I can contact him about the heat. However, I'm worried that my roommates will hate me for this, we are all friends but I'm simply miserable living like this.  TL;DR - Heat won't work and roommates don't think it's a problem. Only one roommate has the landlord's number and won't contact him.

ivmt0qz4	Last April I was approved to move to Japan to teach ESL as an ALT and I moved here in August. I'm in Wakkanai, one of the more remote areas of Japan where I've only met two other Japanese people who spoke English and zero other foreigners since then. The program allowed my spouse to join me, and my girlfriend of four years was ecstatic to come along.  She wants to go home but I can't. She can leave whenever she likes but with shared finances, it's not an expense I want to approve. Nor can I. A ticket to the airport and then a ticket back home to Canada is about $2,400. The only way it would be possible is if I ditched my job and went home, too, because that blow to our finances means I'm out of a place to live. It's too much: she has to truck it out until we penny pinch enough or my contract ends.  Why does she want to go home? She's overweight which is stigmatized heavily here. She has stopped going outside because the comments she gets from my colleagues and even strangers has made her very self-conscious. I'm currently trying to find a gym that will accept foreigners for her to attend and she called it insulting. I can't change the culture here. She was a private music teacher (violin and piano) but stopped it when students would push her belly like the Pillsbury Dough Boy and make comments.  I'm between a rock and a hard place. If she continued her work, she could save up, but she is mortified. She wants me to front the bill when it would jeopordize my living if she left me here.

67o00t5f	For some background, my girlfriend (24f) and I (19f) have been together for six months recently and those six months have been really good. We have been able to communicate super well and make eachother super happy. However, this is a different case and I need to know if I’m being an ass  So long story short, I got a vape for Christmas. This isn’t one of those disposable vapes, it’s a proper mod with a refillable tank, changeable coil and chargeable batteries. I did a TON of research before actually asking for one, as I do with ANYTHING before I actually get it. I researched the different types of mods, why someone shouldnt start vaping, the dangers that can come of it, listened to stories of people that have been vaping for 5+ years, did research on the different types of e-juices and ingredients that can cause adverse effects, etc. I have one now and it’s been great, I love the juice I’ve got as I know it comes from a reputable company and I take great care in cleaning it and all that.  However, my girlfriend is not happy about it. First of all, she was extremely upset that I didn’t ask her about it before I got it as she feels that is something I should have done. She gets very upset any time I have mentioned anything about vaping, to the point where we have had multiple arguments about it (I use the term “arguments” loosely because I do not feel that we were arguing as this happened over text messages and I was just trying to discuss it with her). The topic of me vaping would come up when she asks me what I’m doing (and I felt no need to lie to her).   The most recent incident happened when I posted a video of me vaping on my whatsapp status, where I was taking a video of my shadow smoking. She saw it and after an hour asked me to block her from my statuses about vaping, which I understood so I did. We then got into an argument after I asked if she’s upset about it (I have diagnosed ADHD and have a lot of trouble reading some situations so I tend to ask questions like this).   After she said yes, I got fed up and explained to her that deciding to vape was my decision, and that it was extremely unfair of her to get so upset every single time it’s mentioned. That I’ve done the proper research and decided for myself that this is something I could do, and while she didn’t have to like it (as she’s entitled to her opinion), she does have to respect that this is my decision to make at the end.  She got very upset with me after that, and basically said that she’s not gonna say anything related to my health anymore, and that I was basically saying “fuck your concern for my health”.  Today she told me that we should make our relationship private on social media because we “probably won’t make it” if we keep arguing like this. Obviously this hurt me a lot and is making me rethink this whole situation, and I need to know if I’m in the wrong about this	1642792587.0	s9igli	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9igli/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_me_vaping_was/	AITA for telling my girlfriend that me vaping was my decision to make?
88i6j	My wife has suggested we go snowmobiling in the past. And by suggested, I mean she's said "oh we should go do that!" but has never made any of the plans for us to do so. Neither have I, to be fair. This isn't something neither of us have done before nor that we could just go do easily for the day or something. It'd be a long weekend or week trip, something like that, because of where we live.  Anyway, I'm going out of town for a conference soon for work. And my supervisor randomly calls me one day asking if I'd like to go early with a couple of other employees to hang out and go snowmobiling. My immediate thought when he asked was, "oh my god, my wife is going to kill me." I said yes, though. I was hired during covid, and thus mostly work from home, and haven't really had many opportunities to hang out with fellow coworkers.  Eventually I tell her and of course she's upset because it's something she's wanted to try. I then decide since I'm paying for my own room that I'd at least ask my supervisor if it's cool if she joins. Granted it's only going to be 4 dudes, 2 of which have worked together for 20+ years, one that was hired 2 weeks after me and lives in a different state, and myself. So most of us haven't really interacted with one another in person for any extended period of time.  Actually kind of to my surprise, my supervisor says he'd like to keep it to just the four of us. Of course now I'm in a panic because when I say my wife was upset, I meant pissed. So now she's going to be REALLY pissed.   I was going to make arrangements for us to either go early and do things or plan a big trip late spring to make up for it. She saw a charge on a credit card and brought it up (I hadn't told her my supervisor said no yet). So now she's seen a charge on the card, realized she can't go, and won't listen to me or accept I'm trying to make it up to her. And also expects that I don't go anymore. Despite bookings that are made and that I'd increase the costs for the others by cancelling. Also despite that this is only happening because of a conference, meaning we're not all just going out of state to do this for the hell of it and no other spouses or significant others are going.  AITA for trying to get permission for her to go and for still going?  &#x200B;  Thanks for your time.	1642792672.0	s9ihp2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ihp2/aita_for_doing_an_activity_with_colleagues_my/	AITA for doing an activity with colleagues my wife has also wanted to do?
fquzs7qk	i, f22 am a mom of two baby boys, one is 2 years and the other is 3 weeks. i strongly believe in freebirth. i’m what you could call a “crunchy” mom. my first son was born in my home bathtub, no doctor present. only sister and husband in the room. i caught my own baby, and everything went very smoothly. but my last pregnancy, and birth, was very rough. only because of my family though. for context, my sister is infertile. it would be almost impossible for her to get pregnant. and she doesn’t like the idea of a surrogate. i told my sister i was pregnant during the second trimester, in front of my entire family, she begged me to not only watch, but catch my baby. i immediately shut her down. but my parents are enraged. understandably, because birth is something she will never experience. but it would be very traumatizing for me to have another person pull my baby out and hold him first. when i went into labor, i only told my husband. he watched, and the birth went smoothly. but when my family found out i actually didn’t let sister catch the baby, they went crazy. calling me a selfish brat, a every other offensive name under the sun.

4kewy38x	My boyfriend was out with his friends recently and one of them told him a lie about me. My bf didn’t bother to ask me about it, he assumed it was true. I only found out when I reached out to find out what was going on and he told me. Fortunately (unfortunately), this lie involved someone else as well, who was able to provide the proof I needed to give my bf, that what was said wasnt true. That resolved the issue between us, but left me with some doubts.  I feel strongly, that my bf should confront his friend, or at least ask why he said what he did. Initially my bf said he would, but he never did. Instead, he decided to just stop hanging out with his entire friend group. IMO, this is a really strange way to handle it, but my BF says there is no point in bringing it up, that he’ll likely lie again and doing so would likely make things worse for me. My concern is 1. this lie isn’t the only one he’s told, 2. that his other friends might believe it if no one clears the air, 3. his friendships are important this has an impact on them, and 4. he doesn’t give any fucks  about my integrity.  I want him to stand up for my character, and what’s right. Instead he’s blown it off, unconcerned about how this makes me feel.  Relevant side story; this isn’t the first time something like has has happened. Years ago, a woman who was interested in my bf said some awful things about me, in an effort to get us to break up, and it worked. In this instance, the lies were malicious and I lost more than just my relationship with him over it. Inspite of the 8yrs he’d known me, I found myself having to prove the truth. He never confronted this woman about her smear campaign, and I was left to  repair my character w/out his support.. The experience was very traumatic and it took me years to work thru.  This time it isn’t as serious, but the circumstances are such that it has caused a lot of old emotional baggage to resurface.  I told my BF I really need this whole situation addressed. He doesn’t see the big deal, nor understand why it’s important or why I won’t let it go. He thinks I’m giving him an ultimatum. I just want to trust that I can count on him to have my back and stand up for the truth. I don’t know if I can be with someone who takes others words over mine, or who requires ME to prove myself, and who isn’t concerned about protecting my integrity.  He gave it some thought before agreeing to say something to his friend, but he was begrudging about it and was/is really mad at me for pushing this.  I don’t think this should be such a difficult choice. It should’ve been dealt with when it first happened, so we wouldn’t still be arguing about it. I don’t want him to force him to do something he doesn’t want to, but leaving it unresolved, isn’t going allow me to “drop it and move on” as he’d like me to.. As I did in the case from years ago.  So, AITA for allowing myself to so upset? For not letting it go? AITA for expecting him to hold his friend accountable and clear the air?	1642793756.0	s9iwdm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9iwdm/aita_for_expecting_my_boyfriend_to_stand_up_for_me/	AITA for expecting my boyfriend to stand up for me?
ivndxr0b	I came out as a gay when I was 15 and surprisingly my family  especially my parents were pretty accepting, but my parents definitely weren't accepting when I brought my black boyfriend/now husband home from college. With my brothers shaming them they eventually begrudgingly accepted it  and even helped with our wedding and it was fine for a while till we had kids. Me and my husband  had two boys. Our oldest Marvin (14M) and our youngest Keivan (12M). We used the same surrogate who also happens to be black for both boys so that' theyd each be biological related to us and to each other  if anything were to happen.  I've noticed a few things over the years where my  parents would seem to treat my kidd differently from their cousins. They seemed kind of cold to them sometimes or get on them about things more and not always get them as expensive gifts as thoer cousins. It was nothing super overt and so it never turned into a full argument with them. Until recently when I found out they tried to force Marvin to cut off his dreads while me and my husband were out of town visiting his sick mom. My older brother picked them up and they stayed over his house till me and my husband got home Wednesday.  I confronted my parents about why they' tried to make Marvin cut his hair and they told me cause it looked "nappy" and as the brighter skinned one he should have a more professional cut so that he wouldn't stand out as much  and they I should've at least used a white surrogate so both boys weren't to dark( Marvin is biologically mine).  I yelled at them about how racist that was and that they could go fuck themselves. My dad got upset and said he couldn't believe I was treating my parents this way and I cursed them further about how they've always treated my kids and left.  My older brother says I shouldve cussed them out sooner, but I've gotten calls from extended  family and my younger brother saying that maybe I was to hard on them and that they're just old fashioned.

dbsd9wbw	Sorry for bad grammar I‘m not a native speaker.   I (15f) and my best friend (16f) have been friends for almost 7 years. We were always really close and told each other everything. She’s more of the outgoing type while I’m more shy and quiet and honestly I don’t have many other friends besides her.  We always had something to talk about but recently our conversations became really dry. I tried asking questions but she only gave me one word answers and I had nothing to tell because I was focused on school an drawing and didn‘t have much time for anything. Also my friend had a few problems with her ex boyfriend recently.  But in the last few days it got really bad. Sometimes my friend is tired or in a bad mood and will almost stop talking to me for a day but we would still go to classes together and everything and that was always okay for me.   When I asked her to go to her place, she said yes and we went together after school. I tried talking but she was really quiet again so I just stopped trying. But I also felt really uncomfortable. At her house she fell asleep while watching TV and I left because I still had classes. The next day I texted her, where I was waiting, because we always spend our breaks together. She walked by with another friend of hers, said hello and left me standing there in the cold. I felt really confused and embarrassed but I didn‘t say anything.  After our next class together she just went out of the room without waiting for me. Even if she was tired or in a bad mood she at least would wait for me.   So I didn‘t see her again at school and wrote her a text message, asked if she‘s angry or something. She didn‘t reply but I know she saw it.  So today I saw her waiting for me in front of the school and she said that she‘d rather talk to me personally. Then she told me that she can‘t deal with my affection (I really don’t require as much attention as it seems. I do have a few other friends I talk to and I really like to spend some time alone) right now and that she wished I had asked her if she was okay when we went to her place. She said that I shouldn‘t be so afraid of confrontation and that I shouldn‘t rely on her that much anymore. And maybe we could go back to normal later. I said that it was really mean of her to ignore me without telling me and she could have just told me.  She has been ignoring me in classes ever since and it‘s not like she doesn‘t talk at all anymore, in fact she is quite normal with her other friends.  I‘m not going to school for a week because of an operation and I don‘t know how it‘ll be when I come back.   At first I kinda felt she was TA here but the more I think about it the more I feel like TA. I probably should have asked her sooner. She asked me to leave her alone so I‘m going to respect that, but I don‘t really know what I did wrong for her to start ignoring me. So, AITA for not taking the initiative to make sure my friend is alright?	1642794139.0	s9j1mf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9j1mf/aita_for_not_asking_my_friend_if_she_is_okay/	AITA for not asking my friend if she is okay?
itqwsldy	My son(26M) has always been fond of older guys and he always dated men older than 35+,just like his fiancé, Thomas(46M) who is actually a very successful cardiothoracic surgeon and he also supports my son in his career(he is a resident in Internal Medicine, also we do not live in USA so there isn't a thing called school debt here) and I(53M) never saw my son happier. The problem is my family. They never approved of him dating with older guys and it was also a big faux-pas on their eyes that they have met in hospital(Thomas was a guest lecturer for the residents in my son's medical school while my son was a medical student at age 21 so they do not definitely work at the same hospital) so they are not speaking with him since 2018 other than my widower dad who thinks all of his family is bullshitting and they need to get themselves together.  His fiancé buys stuff, like a lot and he likes to spoil him because he says "he just needs to focus on his residency and graduate from it with minimal damage." He also paid for his first car when he was 23 and he bought a house and has written my son's name on the deed with him after they got engaged at February 2021. We were planning to have the wedding this summer but Thomas lost his mom due to a fatal stroke and we decided to postpone it to May 2022. It is gonna be huge, they both invited their clinics(which will be at least 150 peoples from there) , at least 200 people from their medical schools are attending and since we are still living at the city where my son was born, my son invited all of his high school crew and Thomas also invited his extended family so there are definitely 750ish people in the list currently. His bio mom and family never showed any interest to kid and left him to me after he was born because it would ruin "her reputation(luckily they moved very far away after this happened and they paid all of the child support and provided a good medical history)" (it was a one night stand but I don't regret it one bit) and my family is not invited other than my dad.  After he announced he was engaged,most of my family started to post on FB and Instagram how my son found a sugar daddy to milk on and how he was a disgrace to entire community and I was a terrible father for letting him move.I was phonebombed by my employees and my partners.I had to explain this and it was very hard and grueling for me and my son. Then I called my lawyer and he suggested to have a RO for harassing online.We managed to get one in 3 days.  Now,it has passed 2 weeks and everyone in the negihborhood blames us for getting a RO and not having a talk with them.Honestly, I don't want to and they can rot in their houses but my dad thinks I went too far and nuked their records.

emptx5lt	Aita for being mad at my friends for having a secret relationship?  For a bit of context, we used to have another friend in our friendship group (Roma) who started sneaking around with a boy that we didn’t like. My best friend tracy was furious that roma would lie to us about seeing someone and did not agree with the secrecy.   Eventually we cut contact with Roma as she was acting in a toxic way and sneaking around which was not okay with Tracy. Anyway flash forward about half a year, and  Tracy starts hanging out with another guy in our friendship group a lot more (my best boy mate of over 10 years who me and my family were very close to.) I was sure that this was platonic as me and Tracy often made jokes about how we could never see this boy (let’s call him clive) in that way.   Me Tracy and clive used to hang out together as a 3 pretty much everyday. We went everywhere together and we told each other everything. However, after a few months I noticed that Tracy and clive started hanging out a lot without me, even going to the pub right next door to my house without me, or cancelling plans with me and then hanging out together. I was extremely upset about this and convinced myself I was paranoid. However it did get to the point where I questioned myself, maybe I had done something wrong and they were mad at me?   One night they came over to my house with one of our other friends also present. We were having some drinks and then Tracy suddenly announced to me “me and clive are in a relationship and have been for 4 months.” I was absolutely shocked by this as Tracy was my best friend and I thought we told each other everything. Not only that but I had convinced myself for months that they weren’t leaving me out and I was just crazy and paranoid. Anyway I reacted in shock and basically told them I thought it was a really shitty way to go about things, and that Tracy should have really had a private conversation rather than telling me in a group at my house. They insisted that their relationship was none of my business, and that I should have been happy about the news. Eventually, my boyfriend came over and he basically said to Tracy that she was acting no better than Roma, and that they have been treating me shitty. (I didn’t ask him to say this, this was completely his opinion.) Anyway it caused absolute uproar that my boyfriend had compared Tracy to Roma, and after leaving my house Tracy sent me a message to say that I should have stuck up for her against my boyfriend. I apologised for the way that things blew up and asked if she wanted to come over so that me and her could have a chat and iron things out. I got ignored and then a week later on my birthday, she didn’t message me. Then I realised she had blocked me on everything. My best friend of 10 years! Am I the asshole for reacting in this way about them lying for months?	1642795048.0	s9jdmz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9jdmz/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_friends_secret/	AITA- for being mad at my friends secret relationship

8xk7jdjt	Background info: I’ve been friends with M (17f) for 6 years, just last year she moved 2 hours away and has made a ton of friends.   So my friend M moved and went to a new school and has since made a lot of friends. They are not the same type of people M and I are, and what our friends are. They are heavy drinkers and drug users, often out and about very late at night in a dangerous city high/drunk, going on public transport without any care for the panorama (not wearing face protection etc) and overall seem very different to M. M does not drink at all and never will due to family struggling with addiction so I don’t know why she would be around people who are getting so drunk they black out and vomit in the streets.   The friends are also very rude. M facetimed me once whilst being out with one of them and the friend told me that the area I live in was trash and for people in poverty. M just laughed and said the friend was really drunk. In the background I could also hear people using racial and homophobic slurs.   M talks about them non stop, but in a comparison kind of way. Like she would tell me that her friends are prettier than me, more fun than me, smarter than me, she has more fun with them than me. I have to admit I’m probably pretty jealous, because whilst I don’t agree with the excessive drinking/drug use what they actually do seems to be really fun. I think the jealousy is getting to me to be honest. They hang out every friday and saturday and my stomach drops anytime I go on social media and have to see the pictures of all of them.   Anyway, WIBTA if I asked M to stop talking about them as much as she does, and to stop comparing me to them?	1642795476.0	s9jjq9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9jjq9/wibta_if_i_told_my_friend_to_stop_talking_about/	WIBTA if I told my friend to stop talking about her friends?
bqieibb	They (pronouns changed to mask their identity incase they have Reddit and come across this post) have asked me 3 times now. The first time they asked I said no and they acted slightly huffy with me the rest of the week. The second time they asked I gave them it and they said they’d give me it back but they never did (it was £20). This time, it’s £40 and they’re again promising they’ll give me it back. But, I’m hesitant to give them it. I mean, they do use the money they get from the unemployment office to pay for vet and phone bills and are only left with a small amount of money. And they did tell me they’ve asked their parents and sibling already for the £40 but that they all said no because money is tight for them too. And I CAN afford to give them it. But, I work an 8 hour a week job and £40 is an entire week’s wage for me. The only reason I can afford to give them money is because I’ve been saving up. But, I’m saving up for my first car. But at the same time, they need the £40 to pay for an overdue bill that they forgot about because their head was all over the place because of something personal.

86yz3j1e	My (20F) roomate (21F) has recently broken up with her boyfriend and is now using dating apps to meet new people. Earlier this week she started talking with some guy and tomorrow they will have dinner together. The problem is, she says she wants to bring him over after their date and I told her I'm not comfortable with her inviting someone she doesn't even know to our flat. She asked if I'd rather want her to go alone to his place and I obviously told her no, but that that didn't mean I was ok with him coming. I suggested that maybe tomorrow they could just have dinner and then another day (when she already knows him a little) I'd feel a little bit more comfortable with the guy coming over. In the end, she just said that if she felt like it after the date, she'd bring him home. Our other roomate also said that I should let her do this and now I feel like an asshole for trying to hold her back.

1250h8	I’m a single mom of a 1 year old and a 4 year old. Both of them are extremely busy, energetic boys and some days can feel overwhelming. Their father is largely not in the picture, through his own choice.   We have largely been isolated from the outside world since the start of the pandemic. My oldest is in school, but pulled for a few weeks because I live in a place where covid is not being taken seriously. He had pneumonia recently and was very sick, so sending him right now isn’t a great idea.   Also relevant: SIL tested positive after spending several days with her at my parents house over, so we have been alone for a few weeks. Also, I was in a bad car accident a while ago and sustained a  serious brain injury. I deal with extreme fatigue and brutal migraines.   My parents know how overwhelmed and exhausted I am and my mom she wanted to spend a few days at my house, to give me a break, spend time with the kids, help me with meal prep, etc.   When we all had direct contact from my SIL and then got pushed back.   My mom called this week to say she would come up and spend the night on Thursday. I asked her if she could do Friday instead since I was doing a grocery pickup on Friday morning, so that would give me the opportunity to grab some food for the meal prep. She said that was fine.   She called me yesterday (Thurs) to tell me she was on her way. I was confused and reminded her she was going to come Friday. She said she could no longer do that because my brother wanted to come over Friday.   She largely spent the time she was here either looking at her phone or reading the newspaper. I made us dinner and cleaned up. She did play with the kids while I was doing that. We all watched a movie together and then I put the kids to bed while she lay on my couch and read.   I had to leave the house early for my scheduled grocery pickup thinking we were going to be doing meal prep. The boys were just waking up as I was getting ready to leave, but I still got their breakfast, changed diapers, brushed teeth, etc. I live pretty rural, so have to drive about 30 minutes to get my groceries. My mom asked me to get her a cappuccino while I was out. I did get to leave the boys home with her.   While gone, none of the breakfast dishes had been cleaned up, so I did that and changed my son’s very full diaper. Within 30 minutes of getting home, my dad came to pick her up and they were gone before noon.

ilw0p8i7	Little context, I'm a very bad writer and poorly explain stuff so if it comes off bad, just know I suck. My uncle has a girlfriend who said some bad things to my mom and about my family a little while back to the point that my grandmother said she doesn't want her back in the house. My uncle didn't take that too kindly. So he would just leave on Fridays and go to her house and he even brings back food from her because he doesn't want to eat from his mom's (my grandmother) food. Now, before I got involved I was in the States graduating and getting it all over with. My dad informed me that in Israel I have all of my mom's family and there's a lot of drama surrounding my uncle and his girlfriends relationship with the rest of the family. He told me to specifically not get involved with any of it na davoid it as much as possible. So I avoid it and I'm very close to my uncle unlike almost the entirety of my family. My grandmother would complain and cry that he won't eat her food and brings back food and utensils of her own so he could eat his girlfriend's food.  One night, I was starving and my grandmother didn't prepare much food, but the entire day she was on the verge of tears because he (uncle) pushed away the family and doesn't eat her food, etc. I was starving and texting my uncle if he could bring back food preferably from a restaurant. He comes back with a big bag full of food from his girlfriend, and says "Feel free to take." I took the food and was munching it completely. I went to throw out my plate and hear her crying because he came back and had the food and all of that and told me not to eat the food because it's poison and she's evil, etc.   AITA for eating it or not?	1642795846.0	s9jonk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9jonk/aita_if_i_ate_my_uncle_gfs_food_knowing_my/	AITA if I ate my uncle GF's food knowing my grandmother dislikes her and said GF messed with my family?
dzuh7pvr	I’m currently in a bad mood and out so excuse my bad wording but hear me out.   I’m out with my partner having a chat and a chill at a restaurant with a few of his friends and I’m having fun as I’m getting away from the stress at home. My best friend is usually very supportive but whenever I am out with my best friend it’s “why tf are you at X area” and she won’t listen to a word I say. I told her about my problem at home to get a “sure” instead of the usual reassurance and advice she would give. I don’t expect advice all the time but she gets advice from me every single day as everything is always about her. It’s kind of bothering me but she’s “normal” in the groupchat with her boyfriend. So would I be the bad guy for ignoring her and getting on or should I try and get her to be back in a good mood.	1642796297.0	s9juvg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9juvg/wibta_if_i_ignore_my_best_friend/	WIBTA if I ignore my best friend?
ikfnayqt	In about 6 months my brother in law is getting married in an extremely expensive destination. My husband and I have been hit hard, I’m currently the only one working.    Last night, my mother in law wanted to book the flights. I had told her months prior that going for over a week wasn’t really a possibility for us because of my job and my husband's lack of one.   The whole thing is that they’re giving us this “vacation” for “free”. Using points they have from an airline and their timeshare to get us out there. Which is still very kind, but I get no say in how long, when, or how I get there.   She didn’t ask, but told, that she was booking us and it would be for 10 days away. She “asked” if we were okay with that time period. When I said I would need to talk with my boss if that was even possible, she flipped out saying she needed to book right that minute, and reiterated “free” vacation. So then, she calls my husband as I’m trying to figure out if that would even work, and my husband commits to it because she said we either come on her time schedule or not at all. It was decided we would fly to his sister's home first and spend a night there and then all go on the same plane together, adding an additional 2 days onto the trip.   Each time she would “ask” and when I said no, I would prefer to do this or that, she became upset and repeats the “free vacation”.    At this point I don’t want to even go. Not once has my opinion been taken into consideration, and we are really struggling financially. I don’t get PTO, if I miss work, I don’t get paid.    I know it’s his brothers wedding so it’s so important to be there. But for over a week? His parents flew into town for 3 hours to come to our small wedding when we eloped. Then when we had our bigger wedding, his whole family was there less than 2 days. They’ve never come to visit us where we live for more than a day.   I decided to tell her to forget it and that my husband would be going alone. My husband freaked out saying he would be mad at me and embarrassed. Then his mom told us she already booked the flights so now I’m trapped. They said the options are don’t go, or go for way too long. But apparently not going isn’t even an option. I was shut down if I tried to compromise.   They are paying points for the entire family to go. Had one of his siblings or their spouse needed to leave early for work, they would make it happen. But my job and schedule aren’t important. My job is beneath them. Not as important as the other’s.    Yes, its very nice and generous of them to get us there. If we were in a better position financially, I would be fine and just let my MIL do things her way. But going on this trip, for that long, when I don’t have PTO to cover some of the difference, is insane. The trip is still going to cost us a great deal of money we don’t have.   So AITA for being angry, not wanting to go, and not wanting to put myself at further financial risk and hardship?	1642796755.0	s9k13p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k13p/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_to_my_brotherinlaws/	AITA for not wanting to go to my brother-in-laws wedding?
ivq28mv6	Me (15M) and my bestfriend José (15M) have known each other since we were born. Our parents were friends from college and we were born on the same day. Our parents even own a business together and we live down the street from one another. We normally celebrate our birthday's together just the two of us like a bros night and have a birthday party   the weekend after with our extended family except for this year.  December José met this kid Mark (16M) who eventually asked him out and they've dating for a month and few weeks  now. This is the first time either of us has been in a relationship before. Mark is constantly around and coming in between us or taking up all of José time and I've been holding my tongue cause Mark is his first boyfriend.  Our birthday was last Saturday but José didn't tell me that Mark had asked to take him out for his birthday. I found out from Mark that Friday at school. I confronted José about it and he said it was true and I  got upset that'd he even consider it and he told me that wasn't fair and that we'd always celebrated our birthdays together didn't mean we had to do it all the time and I yelled at him that of course he'd pick Mark over me like he'd been doing and  to just go and  I stormed off. He ending up going of with Mark.  I've been trying to cool off and for the last few days I've been ignoring him even though he's tried apologizing.  My dad told me that I was being mean and unfair to José and that his parents told him that José had been coming home crying and locking himself on his room cause I'm not talking to him right now. My older brother told me I'd understand José position when I got my first girlfriend.

bq8ciyj8	My ex broke up with me 5 days ago on my birthday — it was not mutual, we were together for more than a year, lived together for half a year. We share a room in a 2 bedroom apartment, the other room is occupied by a couple, they are good friends of ours. We are all in university and our lease doesn't end until September.     I am broke because I am trying to pay for my education/housing with my money (had a full time job last term, I am in a "coop" program), but I could receive financial support from my parents if I asked. My ex had a part time over the summer and received some financial support from his family.   Since we are sharing the room, one of us, or both of us, will have to move out. I don't have many choices, I cant move home because of classes, so either we both move out and sublease, or one of us moves the other stays.   If both of us move, finding a new place will be difficult. We have been searching and there is hardly availability for places to move asap, they are well over $200 above budget. They are all short term places and the thought of having to move everything again 3 months from now sounds awful. None of these places are nice either.   He is much more keen on moving than I am. He found a decent place that is only about $50 over his budget and is actually quite nice — it was luck, a rich acquaintance is willing to sublease for little. He kept telling me that I should take that place and he would find somewhere else for himself since it was a nice place and he feels bad for what he did. In this case, he would also have to settle for a substancially worse and more expensive place, which would make me uncomfortable since it is pretty clear he actually wants to live there but is too prideful to admit it, the other places are really terrible.   I spoke with my parents, our other roommates, and some friends and everyone thinks I should stay at our apartment. Roommates offered to cover 1/3 of his rent to help,  parents offered to cover all of it, he also did since I can't afford to take the entire rent myself.   My parents think he should have to continue paying his part of the rent but will still cover it if necessary. My issue with this is that although he offered I know he can't necessarily afford to pay his rent here and elsewhere too. He would get by but it would be tight. I understand the situation is his doing and since he broke up with me in a rlly shitty way so he should take responsibility of the arrangements, but to me its arbitrary whether he or I leave the apartment and suffer the consequences.   I've already told him several times that I don't want to accept his money and I really am not comfortable taking it from him. But WIBTA if I did I accept it despite telling him I wouldn't? I feel like I might be an asshole if I refuse to move out and make him pay the rent here which I know will be difficult for him.	1642797304.0	s9k8lk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9k8lk/wibta_if_i_made_my_ex_pay_rent_because_he_broke/	WIBTA if I made my ex pay rent because he broke up with me on my birthday?
d60w8j0g	I am a person with friends. My best friends are J, L, and T. I have more in common with L and we have the same humor, and L, J and I are a friendship group. L, T and I are also, but not break times it's the group with J, not T.  This may be confusing, brace yourselves.  Picture it like a Venn diagram, with L and I in the middle, and J and T either circle.   The thing is, J hates T. There is so reason, she (J) just thinks he's (T) annoying. (Which, yes he is but he's still a good friend and good person)  T has always been nice with J, but J always gives looks, as if she's looking down at him.  Yesterday, L was away and a strange thing happened. It was J, T, and myself, but J kept giving me blatantly obvious looks, and she said "D (me) do you need the toilet? I think you need the toilet" when T was right there (J and I are both female so the toilets would have excluded him)  I played dumb and said 'no I don't need it' but she kept going, eventually he just walked off.   When we got home, I politely texted her if it is ok if she doesn't be rude to him because it is obvious and I was on call with him and he was talking about it. I added lots of ":)" to not see, so bossy or rude.  She didn't reply but said she was busy, and when I saw her today ( L was back too) she said she doesn't like him and I said I hear you, I know that and I'm not asking you to be friends with him, talk to him, or even be nice to him, but just to not be so obviously rude. It hurts his feelings.  It turned into an argument, so I just kinda stopped listening to her because she wasn't listening to anything I was saying, and I started to talk to L  We haven't spoken since.   When we all got home, I'd still been speaking to L, who is kind of like the Benvolio of the group, and she says that J says if I don't stop making arguments out of stupid things, she is 'threatening' to sit with her other friends. I said 'good I hope she does'  L is trying to get me to apologise because she knows that J can never admits when she's wrong. (An example being when she spoilet the end of a film I was watching at claimed it was my fault because I was there)  I said no (while keeping good spirits with her because I want to remain friends) and I am standing my ground. A wise man once said, "never put passion over principle" (passion being the desire to be friends again, and principle being... well, my principles.)

ivo649it	  For some context, I work at a small privately owned center. My Coworker is F in her late 50s, and I F29 are the only ones on our team and both started the same day. Our manager only comes in 1-2x a month and gives us a lot of freedom, which I love!Issues started to arise 2 weeks into our employment. My coworker was in an incident resulting in a broken foot. She required surgery for her foot. Since we had both just started working, we didn’t have many personal days accrued. However our boss is a very kind and compassionate lady, and told her she could work from home during this. My coworker was out of work for over 4 months, leaving the bulk of the responsibilities on me. Keep in mind, this is an office type job. No manual labor and her only injury was a broken foot. Following her return she has many, many appointments for followups as well as things completely unrelated to the injury. Scheduling them all in the middle of the day, arriving for the final 30 min of work, and not using any of her time off. In the past 3 months alone she has had, eye surgery, strep, ear infection, rebroken her foot, and a stomach virus. All while taking no time off. I never said anything to my manager because I never felt it was between her and my manager. Fast forward to last week she told me she was sick again, and tested positive. I spoke to her on the phone and she sounded genuinely ill, but she said was working from home. This is our companies busy time of year, and I have been beyond swamped. I tried delegating some of the load to her but every request was met with an excuse about being too sick to do it. This sort of rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like if you are working from home you need to genuinely be working and if you are unable to, then use sick time. But, after a week of her doing nothing, I bit my tongue. Then this morning our boss came in for her monthly visit and while there she made the comment “Im surprised she has any time off left”. At that moment, I realized our boss had not been clued into this whole working from home thing. Any time I have been sick I have used my personal days only to find out this coworker who has missed months of work has more personal time than me. I called my coworker, giving her the benefit of the doubt, and told her our boss did not know she was working from home. Her response was “thank god she wont call and bother me then”. I am beyond furious and not sure what to do. My friend in another department says that I should cut her a break and that its an asshole move to rat her out while she’s sick.

afca0qz7	I am 13 (M14 in March) and my younger sister (F10, 11 in April).  My younger sister used to be my best friend when we were both younger but as time has went on things have gotten really bad.   She gained a health issue around 2 years ago which caused a foul smell that lingers for hours, and she refuses to do anything about it. She has a bedroom right by our set of stairs and this causes the smell to slink down the stairs and halfway down our hallway. I ask her to close her door whenever she can and open a window to help, but she just yells at me and slams the door in my face.  I’ll admit I’ve lashed out before about it and I’m not proud of that. I’ve tried not speaking on It and even not talking to her in general but it gets worse and worse the more i let it go.   The rest of my family hates it to but everyone lives with it. Sometimes me and my older sister rant to each other about my younger sister, which that helps knowing someone understands.   Not to mention her poor attitude and anger issues my sister has.   She is really into fidgets and pop it’s and I eventually dabbled in them too. I started trading with her and got some good stuff I genuinely liked. She handed me her BEST pop it’s and said here for my largest one and she played with it for a few mins before yelling at me to give them back and that it was “a joke”. I was forced to give them back because I didn’t want her to hit me or running to my parents.   A week later she snuck into my room at night and stole my fidgets and left $5 on my bed expecting that money is an adequate payment for breaking and entering + stealing. My dad didn’t punish her at all and in fact almost rewarded her before I stepped in. I kept pushing for her to get punished because she has broken into peoples rooms before and she never got in trouble. In fact I was in trouble for telling my parents to do something about her.  If I try to talk to her or say anything not positive to her (not even negative, just not positive)she just screams yells and cries.   I love her and I want better for her but I know she won’t learn if she just gets a slap on the wrist.

8xhyxxvn	My mom has an unhealthy tiktok addiction. Every free minute she has is spent watching them and she once made me babysit for 3 hours when she knew I had to get to an online class on time just so she could sit in her room watching them.   This evening she played the same one over and over of someone saying ‘I farted if tickled my but cheek jiggled I liked it so I did it again HEHEHEHE’ and after about 10 times of it my stepdad asked her to stop. 20 times in and I ask her to because it was really irritating to hear the same high pitched voice squeaking some rhyme   She immediately went off on me saying nobody’s allowed to have a laugh anymore because of me and when I tried to bring up how every time someone finds what I like annoying I’m forced to stop with it completely my stepdad cut over me telling me to fuck off. I tried again and he told me to get out or lose wifi privileges (I pay part of the bill might I add) so I told him to let me speak and to stop cutting me off.   That just pissed my mom off more and she told me to fuck off if I was intent on ruining everything and continued to play the video. I groaned and she screamed at me to stop and to let everyone have fun.   So I yelled that I’m not even allowed have feelings anymore unless they’re approved by her and she told my sister that she’s have to stop playing it because I was intent on being a bitch.   AITA? Should I have just ignored it so they could have fun?  And to clear things up before the judgement begins:  Yes I have a job  Yes I pay rent  Yes I’m planning on saving up to move out. Kinda hard on minimum wage and monthly pay  I have really bad misophonia and am prone to migraines and am suffering with both as I type this.	1642798129.0	s9kjpy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9kjpy/aita_for_getting_angry_when_my_family_went_out_of/	AITA for getting angry when my family went out of their way to annoy me?

I was pretty upset, but he said that my husband is a part of the family as I have been with him over 10 years. I was pretty upset by this, because he's my husband he is a member of our family on MY terms. I told my brother he can do what he wants but I'm not coming if my husband does.

iuujtam8	To start off my girlfriend 21F and I 21f went to Vegas this past weekend for a small vacation with the little bit of time we had off. We both work full time jobs, so getting time to ourselves is difficult. The beginning of our trip went great we drank we went sight seeing in all it was going well. On our second night my SIL her older sister calls asking us why we didn’t invite her and her husband and if they could meet us out there. My girlfriend says sure if you want to come you can but we are still going to be doing the plans we had made. SIL agrees and hangs up. We get a call the next day saying we have to take my second sister In laws 2 kids and second SIL back home with us because they made her come with them. I was already upset about that considering second SIL already lives with us and the whole reason we left the state was to get time away from everyone and we would be leaving early the next day so it was pointless. My girlfriend says they shouldn’t have brought her but it makes no difference they are already half way there. They get to Vegas drop second SIL and her kids off with some family and try to meet us. We don’t actually meet until 11pm. We finally meet and they start buying us drinks and they have to show off how much money they have so they spend $130 for 5 shots. They were trying to get us drunk enough to make us stay which I was not okay with at all considering they knew our plans. Fast forward a little bit SIL and her husband started fighting so they take us back to their hotel, which is on the other side of town from ours. At this point girlfriend is drunk I’m trying to get her to go back to our hotel with me and SIL and her husband are making a scene. I tell my girlfriend she’s pissing me off I want to leave before I get crazy with her. That’s when her sister buts in telling me not to talk to her sister that way. We all start to head to their room when that happened and her sister says that my gf and I always do this. So I said fuck this and took off to find an Uber. My girlfriend did not go after me or even really care it seemed like. I get a call maybe half an hour later saying SIL and her husband beat the sh** out of each other and that my girlfriend tried to stop them but ended up fighting the husband. All of my girlfriends family is saying it’s my fault because I left and SIL husband went after me. Everyone is mad and blaming me for leaving. This is not the first time SIL and her husband have beat each other up. It has happened many times before. Without us being there.

ivqyrtol	(throwaway because several people in the friend group have reddit, i also made up a fake name but the relevant sounds are the same)  I (21F) began hanging out with a few of my friends' extended friend group last year and it's been going great! I get along with all of them really well.  However, one slightly awkward moment happened in early December. We were all having a regular group conversation and at one point I said one of the girl's names, "Hayley."   Hayley paused and said something like, "This has been annoying me for the longest time, you've been saying my name wrong ever since we met." She explained that her name is pronounced "Hay-lee" and I had been saying "Hail-ee".   I hadn't realized there was a difference before, but hearing her say it made me realize that she was totally right! And I know how it feels, I have a name that people frequently mistake with another name as well (in a similar way to Ana/Anna). So I felt horrible and embarrassed and quickly apologized, correctly said "Hay-lee" so she could confirm my pronunciation, and promised to make an effort to say it right going forward.  The problem I ran into was that while "Hay-lee" and "Hail-ee" sounded different when I said them slowly, I genuinely couldn't tell the difference when said quickly and naturally, the way you'd usually call a friend. So I would think I was doing well and saying her name right, but she kept correcting me. I tried listening closely any time anyone else said her name to try to compare it to how it sounds when I say it, but it still sounded the same to me! I tried only saying her name slowly but she said that made it sound weird.   Last week, she told me in private that she found it disrespectful that I had learned everyone else’s names but wouldn't learn hers. I explained that I was sorry, but that my ears just couldn't pick up on the difference. I told her everything I'd tried and at the end, I said "I don't know what else to try, I give up!"  She said, "Really? You give up?" and walked away.  She's been ignoring me ever since, and not in a subtle way because the rest of the friend group is starting to notice. She hasn't explained the situation when other friends have asked why she's ignoring me, and I haven't explained either because I really don't know if I'm the asshole here and I don't want to look like an idiot defending myself to my friends when I'm actually in the wrong.

d1olwk8f	Little disclaimer before we start: I personally do not give a shit about gender. Never have, but our families made a big deal out of this because it’s our first baby so we decided to do a small reveal.   Okay so my sister got overwhelmed planning pretty early on. I offered to help because literally it can be thrown together in 5 mins and be fine but she’s my sister and insisted she could do it. A friend of ours decided she would help her get it together because she had I guess admitted to this girl she was overwhelmed and didn’t know what she was doing.   I knew this friend was helping but I was under the impression her and my sister had been communicating about the plans as they talk more frequently than the friend and I do. Due to the big C19 hitting my sister and some work schedule issues our party had to be moved from Feb 6th to Feb 13th…. Super Bowl Sunday. There’s literally no way around it SO we decided to do it super early in the day and be done super early as well as to offer the option of virtual attendance due to the big C19 and super bowl parties people need to prepare for.   In passing I notified said friend and she LOST IT. Told me I’m rude and inconsiderate and she has a party for the super bowl that day and pretty much how dare I not consult her before I selected a different date. I apologized and said I was sorry but I would not be changing it because I can’t keep accommodating everyone else. Then I got a bunch of messages telling me how dare I when I expected her to spend her own time and money on this (I literally said we would pay for supplies and food) and everything else. I apologized again but said again I would not be moving it and that I appreciated what she’s done so far but I would help my sister plan from here on out. I reached out to my sister and found out this girl has not been in contact any my sister doesn’t even know what she was planning. So Reddit, am I the asshole for moving the party date?	1642798896.0	s9kuh5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9kuh5/aita_for_changing_the_date_of_my_gender_reveal/	AITA for changing the date of my gender reveal?
p6z4l4d	My husband is very much an introvert and doesn't really like family gatherings, so we often use each other as an excuse to get out of doing things, especially when it comes to our families. They can make any get together stressful, so we usually just don't go, or one will go and not the other, so we'll trade off get together.  We missed out on a family wedding last year bc it was adult only and my MIL backed out of offering to babysit our toddler. I was pretty bummed, but we didn't have alternative childcare options, and he didn't want to anyway. MIL went alone and insisted we used our toddler's health vulnerability as an excuse to stay home.  This year is another family wedding, also adult only. The bride and groom have discussed adding childcare options for parents traveling from out of state. I was super happy to hear this, planned on attending, bought a gorgeous dress, shoes, etc. even though it was 6+ months away. Hubby is still concerned about health, but said we could go and he might step out early to stay in our room with our kiddo. MIL is content.  Welp, I'm now pregnant. Bummer that I can't wear the dress and there's not enough fabric to alter it, but I can get something different and it's over a month before my due date. Last pregnancy I couldn't travel a month beforehand due to being high risk, so I missed out on getting to go with my husband on a business trip, so MIL went, which is fine.  Fast forward to my recent doctor's appointment. Doctor told me that it's right at the cutoff week for travel and I shouldn't go, but I'll likely do what I want anyway. It's highly encouraged that I not go to the wedding bc of complication risks and logistics and I know my husband won't want to leave me pregnant and alone with a toddler. I was really bummed. MIL has already booked the hotel and planned on my family traveling with her in her vehicle.  We get in the car and MIL explodes saying "I just KNOW he's going to use YOU as an excuse to stay home!" as if I'm this huge ah for being pregnant and not forcing my husband to go. We hadn't even discussed it yet. She spent the whole car ride home angry and wouldn't talk to me. The thing is, I'm actually really bummed bc I want to go to the wedding, but my health comes first. We are considering traveling to see family earlier in the year instead, and not going doesn't prevent MIL from attending. Let's just say she's just got umbilical cord detachment issues when it comes to my husband.	1642798757.0	s9ks95	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9ks95/aita_for_allowing_my_husband_to_use_me_as_a/	AITA for allowing my husband to use me as a scapegoat?
bloda716	My younger brother (11M) is having his birthday on X day. Him and I both take part in taikwondo. To move up belts in taikwondo you have to take part in a "grading" which happen about 4 times a year. I know the material I have to know thoroughly. Due to being sick I missed the last grading. Moving up belts is very important to me since I don't want to be left behind by the majority of the class. It just so happens that the grading is also on X day at exactly the same time. Worse still, the next grading (in spring) I am away for, the next nearest grading is a 4 1/2 round trip away, and I would have to burden someone with driving me there.   The way it works, I would be going over EXACTLY the same material from September last year to summer this year, while the rest of the class practice more complex material. This would be insanely painful since I am already joint bottom of the class.   My brother wants me to attend. I really want to aswell.

33bfqwno	i’ve (17f) have just got my first job. i’m currently working 1 day a week (even though i want 2-3 days) and i’m not getting paid much. since i have a job now my dad (52m) wants me to pay rent since he started paying his dad rent when he was around 15 and refuses to buy me food because of this. He says that since i don’t pay rent he should put locks on the cupboards to stop me from eating the food he and my mum buys and that i should buy my own food if i’m not going to pay them. Every time i bring up that it’s his legal right to feed me because im his child and still a minor he just gets mad, says he doesn’t care and brings up how him and my mum don’t get child benefits from me anymore because i left college so that means i’m an adult (even though i’m going back to college next year and still have free education because im a child). A few weeks ago he literally took the food i was eating away from me and put it at the back of the highest shelf so i couldn’t reach it without using a stool and said i should pay rent or pay my mum since i’m eating the food she bought (even though she bought it for me when i had tonsillitis). My boyfriend (17m) and his mum (42f) both agree with me saying i shouldn’t have to pay rent since i’ve recently turned 17 and i’m only just becoming independent. It’s a bit off topic but he’s also refused to buy me a new bed when i’ve been asking for 5 years (i’ve had my current bed since i was 8) but bought my brother (11m) a new bed without him asking which is just really unfair since my bed is tiny and literally built for a small child and my boyfriends been telling me that it’s his job to do that for me and if social services found out about all this they’d be keeping an eye on him. Thing is, i’d happily put money towards the house, bills or vet bills if my parents couldn’t pay it (since i’ve helped before with my birthday money) but i know they can since my dad sometimes brags about how much money he gets from work, the army and selling stuff on ebay so that, the fact im under 18 and i don’t get paid much just makes me think i don’t need to pay rent yet. aita?	1642799209.0	s9kyoo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9kyoo/aita_for_not_paying_rent/	AITA FOR NOT PAYING RENT?
ilkjrh2d	Hi I 18 almost 19NB was living with my dad. I had moved in with my dad a few days after I had turned 16.   It was good at first, my mom kept me away from my dad most of my life. She wasn't the best mother, so it was nice to be with my dad. I was also living with my dad's girlfriend, but they had been together for so many years I consider her my step mom.   My step mom was kind and caring for the most part. Every now and again she would say things I found disrespectful or just straight up didn't agree with. But I also forget it the moment it happened because she was so nice.   When I had turned 17 I came out to them as pansexual. After I did I noticed my step mom got more mean, disrespect and hateful. But again I would ignore it because if I'm being honest I saw her as a mother.   But what had been the final straw was when I had came out to them as non binary. When I did my step mom flipped said stuff like "no your not" "there is no such thing and "you are a girl and you always will be. "  She then stomped upstairs and slammed her bedroom door. My dad went on to tell me that I was to emotionally immature to make those kind of divisions and other random bullshit.   Soon after that I moved out and had became technology homeless. After all that I had to couch surf and bounce from place to place.  I'm staying at my brothers and now he is pressing me to move back in with my dad. My dad had recently my dad has gotten a huge blood clot in his lung and if he gets to stressed and it breaks he could die. My brother is saying that I should stay with him and that because he is sick I should go take care of him.   After everything that happened with my dad and step mom I don't want to go back and I am not ready to try and fix our relationship. I will admit I wasn't perfect, I was messy didn't do dishes like I should and got pound with my dad sometimes but that is normal teenager shit and didn't mean I deserved to be treated the way I was.  So am I the asshole for not wanting to move back.	1642798200.0	s9kklc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9kklc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_move_back_to_my_dads/	AITA For not wanting to move back to my dads house now that je is sick.
568kwi7m	So my coworker, who since we met has used she/her pronouns and never asked for otherwise, have gotten more comfortable with each other and have started to casually talk about our personal and sex lives. She’s biologically a female dating someone who biologically is a male and as far as I knew they were a cis couple.   Now one day we’re talking about sex things, idk what exactly, and she mentioned that she wanted to see what she’d look like with a dick, so she posed with a dildo and took a pic. She asked if I wanted to see it and I said sure why not. And then she proceeds to show me a picture of her with a dildo poking out that’s she’s gripped around the base, has her shirt pulled up over her stomach, and is looking up at the camera with some pouty eyebrows and biting her lip.   Now, this immediately brings to my mind images of dick pics I’ve gotten from fuckboys striking this exact pose. That made me start giggling, and all the sudden she looked pissed. I stopped and asked what was wrong and she said “That’s transphobic.” I was confused, and asked how? And she said “I thought I looked hot like that, I was really feeling myself and I trusted you and you laughed.” and I apologized and tried to explain that the specific pose and angle reminded me of some cringey dick pics I’ve received and that I wasn’t laughing at the fact that she was pretending to have a penis, or judge her or think she’s silly for doing it. It was the the memories it brought up and I laughed without thinking. She was kind of just like hm, okay, and we went about our separate duties.   I can feel that she’s put off by me a little now. It also makes me feel bad, because my best friend of 13 years is a trans man who is married to a trans woman and I’ve mentioned that to her since we started talking more, so I’m hurt that she’d accuse me of being transphobic.   Am I the asshole for laughing?	1642799358.0	s9l0lc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9l0lc/aita_for_laughing_at_a_picture_of_my_coworker/	AITA for laughing at a picture of my coworker posing with a dildo?
ivrhrj3n	I (17f) have had a full time job at a grocery store for the past few months. The shop is rather understaffed but my bosses dont want to hire another person because that would mean less money for them, as they would have to pay another person. My parents have been planning our move 2000km across for years now, but I was never quite sure when we will move except that I knew it was this year, so when I started work, I told them just that. I am moving to another country in 2022. They said okay. In december, my parents told me that we are moving in the first week of march, so after christmas I told my bosses and coworkers that, then a week later that changed to February 26th, and I told them immediately. The firm my dad worked at is getting tight with money, and they are less and less successful, so two weeks ago my mom told me to be prepared that we might have to leave even earlier than that, because if my father loses his job, there is no point looking for one he only needs for a month.  Well, last week the job was lost, and now my flight is on 1st February, five days after theirs, as I begged for a few more days at work.  I told my manager, who is responsible for that kind of stuff immediately after I found out, and she said 'Okay, I will make sure we get another person to take your place from that day onward' and made no issue. Then she told my bosses and one of my coworkers, who also said, 'okay, we will find someone'.  Then my other coworker, who I have shifts with, found out. She told me I cant do that, and I need to give at least a month prior warning. I told her I kept giving updates about what is happening, and there was no way I couldve given that warning. She told me that I should call my parents right now, and let her tell them they cant do that, which I refused. She told me that because my flight is after theirs, and that I will essentially be under no supervision for those few days, I shouldnt board the plane and instead come to work. I refused and said I am moving with my family, because thats what they expect and we agreed that I wont make much of a fuss about it. We're moving so that my siblings and I can have a better life, and I am not going to give it away and risk fighting with my parents. She has been giving me huffs and sighs and dirty looks ever since.  AITA?	1642799537.0	s9l397	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9l397/aita_for_leaving_work_early/	AITA for leaving work early?
bisinxb9	Background: So unfortunately on December 9 my family house caught on fire do to faulty wiring. This goes without saying that it was traumatic for all of us but luckily everyone but my beloved cat made it out alive.Now to why I’m here: are Insurance has asked my family and I to make a itemized list of everything we lost, it took a while but I got my done. My parents and brothers however are not finished, after finding this out my grandparents yesterday told me that it’s my responsibility to get it gone for them. I told them no it’s not and I don’t have the slightest idea what they lost and what of theirs survived. They kept arguing with me telling me the same thing over and over again. I tried to remain calm and tell them over and over again no it is not my responsibility and it’s out of my hands but they kept pushing me and I finally snapped and told them that I can’t pull a list out of my @ss.

7ummz9pq	I (25, f) have just come out of a long-term relationship. I've had to sell the house I shared with my ex-partner. At the moment, we're still living in the house (we still get on, fortunately) while we complete on the sale, which will be in a couple of weeks.   While I re-apply for a mortgage, find a new house and go through the sale process, I'm having to move back in with my parents. I'm not happy about it - I haven't lived with them for more than the length of uni holidays since I was 17/18.   I get on with them mostly, although my mum can get a bit shouty when anxious (which is a lot) and is a very nosey person.   They got new handles on all the doors in the house a few weeks ago and asked if I could have a lock on my bedroom door - I'd never had one. They said no, they don't even have one on their bedroom door anymore.   I'm going from having a 3 bedroom house to myself, to only having a bedroom that's solely mine, in pretty traumatic circumstances. I just want privacy that can't be invaded without me allowing that.   I spoke to my grandparents about it, expecting them to take my side, and they thought I was being ridiculous.	1642800359.0	s9legd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9legd/aita_for_wanting_a_lock_on_my_bedroom_door/	AITA for wanting a lock on my bedroom door?
id5vtizs	Hii so I’m gonna start this off with thanks for reading my original post and commenting on it. I knew in the back of my head that I should’ve probably ended it with him but reading your comments really gave me the “push” to really understand why (idk if this makes sense lol).   Before I start though, his mom managed to get to my ex bf before he gave his dad the money. The money is safe and my ex bf’s phone was taken from him bc his dad kept sending him rude messages. He wasn’t ignoring me on purpose.   Here’s what happened:  His twin sister came over some time after I made the post and she told me quite a bit about why my (ex) bf is the way he is. I’m not going to say much as it is not my story to tell but what I will say is that I remember someone commenting and saying “parentification” and you were mostly right.   She then told me that he’s not allowed his phone but he did say he was sorry. I was also informed that he’s getting help and he’s not in the right mindset for a relationship. I agreed.   I know a lot of people were convinced that he isn’t a good person and he‘s this or that and I admit that I wrote that post out of frustration but he isn’t a bad person. The world isn’t black and white. I’m sorry I can’t give more context but there’s only so much I can say online.   I also hear he’ll be out of school for a week or two because he had a breakdown and is pretty unwell but I’m not going to avoid him or act as if I don’t know him once he does come back. Sure, we didn’t end things greatly but he’s been my friend for years and unless he doesn’t want me around, I’m not doing that.   I also want to thank everyone for telling me it isn’t on me to “fix” him. That I’m only 17 and it’s not my responsibility. Sometimes I feel a bit guilty ngl because it kind of feels like I “abandoned” him when things got tough but it’s like-what exactly can I do? He has his mom and sisters and right now I think that’s all he can handle.   Because of you know what, I’ve cancelled like all my plans and am currently watching that new disney film with my brothers and honestly it’s the most relaxed I’ve been for ages now. It’s nice knowing I don’t have this huge responsibility on my back. I don’t use reddit often so yeah tysm for being so nice to me :))  [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ryun04/aita_for_telling_my_bf_hes_not_the_fucking/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)	1642800486.0	s9lg0k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lg0k/update_aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_hes_not_the/	Update: AITA for telling my boyfriend he’s not the fucking superhero that he thinks he is ?
bw6bok7f	I have a friend that is 39 and I’m 40, we’re both single and she recently got back on the dating apps and I made an insensitive joke to “enjoy your last year because once youre 40 it’s over for the dating apps” because in my experience men don’t want to swipe on hot ladies over 40. Anyway she told me that was hurtful and I apologized without making any excuses and was sincere in taking responsibility for making a hurtful joke to her, and she accepted my apology.   I understand she can accept my apology and may not forgive me so I’ve been editing my usual joking and self deprecating humor about dating around her because I don’t want to be insensitive, I know that I can make jokes that are hurtful or say things to make someone feel bad  She has now texted and called me a few times to hash out this situation, asking me why I am editing myself around her now, to which I said it was to make us both feel safe. She’s asked me not to edit myself.  We had coffee the other day and I said something about her not getting a southern culture reference and today she called me to let me know I was taking a dig at her and I must still be upset about her reaction to my original distasteful joke. I know in my heart of hearts I was not taking a dig at her, and apologized again without excuse, that I hurt her feelings. She also complained I had missed a voice message from her from two weeks ago. She feels like these two instances mean that I am punishing her for bringing up how I hurt her feelings.  I then told her that maybe I’m not her cup of tea because this is how I joke and converse and that it’s ok if she isn’t into that, not a lot of people are. I told her it sounds like she’s trying to convince herself to be my friend. Am the asshole for wanting to tell her that we should just take a break from friendship? I’m sensitive to her needs, but not to the detriment to my own mental health, and this has derailed two work days for me already.   What else am I supposed to do aside from apologizing and taking ownership of my behavior? I’m frankly over trying to please someone who just doesn’t enjoy me for me.

dcrsk	I(25m) experienced 2 dramatic friendship issues in the span of a few days last month, & I'm still hung up on it.  Background: I’m bfs with M(25m). We roomed together in college, & our friendship enhanced when his current gf, R(25f), came into the picture. My wife(24f) & I moved away but haven’t lost contact with them, & they may be moving here soon to join us. We made new friends in our area, P(32m)+K(32f) & B(30m).  M+R came to visit us & we wanted to introduce them to a few of our friends (P+K & M).  We invited P+K & B to meet M+R at our house. P was already drunk (we drink often & do a fair amount of psychedelics) which was annoying. We all chatted until conversation was exhausted. M+R were excited to watch a movie & eat mushrooms (which they expressed to me & I was also excited, & I told P+K prior to them visiting), so I created the feeling P+K should leave & we proceeded to eat our mushrooms. P+K didn’t take the hint.  Once started, P+K commented on every scene. Rude & degrading things about the actor's bodies, adding their own lines, & seemingly needing attention. It was Guardian's of the Galaxy... Having enough, I paused the movie & told them off. I said they were being annoying & we didn’t want to listen to them. They were annoyed I made a "big" deal of it but understood my perspective & shut up after I mentioned they were acting like bullies.  Not 10 minutes later they continued. Cue the next few of rounds of me repeating myself. M+R were uncomfortable, so I basically kicked P+K out of my house without the actual kick.  This was unprecedented behavior of P+K, but the 4 of us had a great rest of the night.  A few nights later, we took M+R to our fave restaurant of which P+K knew about. On our way, P+K called me which I didn't answer. My wife texted them, & we arrived at the restaurant to begin dinner. We both received calls at the table we didn’t answer. No texts.  30 minutes in, our waitress says there's an issue. Someone called, asked for me, & said our dog is in trouble. We panicked, & I quickly ask for the caller ID and verify it’s P. We defused the situation (the manager & several other staff came over out of concern) & continued our dinner. My wife texted K it we were angry with them. We shut our phones off.  After dinner, I had a few missed calls & decided to call & resolve the issue in the car. We found out the restaurant misheard what P said about our dog (he didn’t say it was in trouble). He was noticeably drunk, & B was there drunk as well (he wasn’t part of the issue, but passively did nothing to stop it). I was irritated & hung up.  They didn’t apologize. K sent a video while drunk playing the victim because of my wife’s text (“she had no responsibility for the situation & we blamed her for everything”). We amended the issue because we don't care for drama & concluded we needed to distance. Summary: our dynamic has changed & they’re not happy (lots of texts inviting us to events & whatnot).

ivqpo65h	Sorry for format and grammar. I'm on my phone and English isn't my first language.   My sister (26) asked my mom (52) and me (24f) to watch my niece (1 but almost 2) this weekend to wich we both said yes.  My mom took my niece to my grandma (70) in the evening to just say hi and so she can see her. When we got there my grandma immediately asked for a kiss hello and my niece said no immediately too.  My niece started running around and playing. Grandma kept on asking for kisses here and there but my niece kept saying no back and started laughing (she probably thought this was a game because after some time she started saying no to everything you said or asked her)  I said almost everytime 'niece said no let it go' wich was visibly annoying my grandma and it also probably didn't help that my niece mostly spent time with me and wanted to cuddle with me.  My grandma is severely disabled and my 2 year old niece. That didn't stop her from trying though and I don't know what she wanted to do but probably give her a kiss, my niece said no many times and almost started to cry.  At this point I said loudly: stop trying to make her do things you know she doesn't want why are you not respecting her no's and boundaries?  My grandma started sulking and act coldly towards me and my niece. My niece even got hit with her first: you're never getting anything from me again.  Soon after we left with a teddy and she even gave my grandma a kiss goodbye (willingly)  After we got home my mom kind of lay it on me and asked me to stop being so disrespectful and harsh to my grandma.  My friend group is 50/50 so I just wanted to ask a neutral party about an opinion.  tl;dr: grandma asked my 2 year old niece for kisses but she said no. I asked her to respect the no and move on.	1642801269.0	s9lqn6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lqn6/aita_for_asking_my_grandma_to_stop_asking_my/	AITA for asking my grandma to stop asking my niece for a kiss?
4xjw5bxm	So,  I am F(19) and my best friend of five years is M(20) - recently he made  the offer to me to move in with him because I live with my parents and  I'm graduating college this year. The tension in the house is too much  for me and I'm tired of arguments constantly over little things. He made the proposal over a lunch meet up last Saturday & I said cool sure whatever because he  lives alone in a double-wide trailer and is only charging me $300 a  month to live there which is  an absolute fucking score for what normal  landlords charge for a single bedroom apartment in my state that doesn't  include utilities.  Everything  was fine and moving smoothly until a couple days ago when I received a  text telling me that the only rule he really and truly had for me that  would be heavily enforced was that my ex (whom I no longer  have contact with due to the manipulation and abuse) was not allowed on  the property at all because he simply "didn't like him" - I was confused  but generally okay and accepting of it because fuck abusers. It wasn't  until he followed up the rule with "Oh but just letting you know Maria  comes over" - I've changed her name for privacy reasons. One thing to  note about Maria and I is that she has never liked me....like ever. We  have talked a total of two times when they had been together a while back  (they are no longer together) - of in which nothing out of the way was said. Until a year ago when they separated and Maria sent a ransom text to Sam about how I was "such a whore" and "chasing Sam" for trying to cheer my friend up by taking him out.  Last  night I received a screenshot text from him - Maria wanted me to take  her number so that I could "apologize to her for disrespecting her  boundaries and her as a person" and so that "we could find a solution to  the issue" - an issue which literally never occurred until she  disrespected me and called me a whore. She said in the text that  she was "an adult that knew how to communicate" yet - was making Sam be  the middle man and mediate the request to me when she had my social  medias & blocked me on them. She literally could've unblocked me and  messaged me. On top of that - she told Sam she was "tired of getting a  shitty feeling in her stomach whenever he mentioned me" which Is NOT my  issue at all. I had liked Sam back in Sophomore year (2017) and we tread lightly on those lines until an intense personal argument and then  after that we quit trying to explore anything with that. Maria knows  this - and even went as far in her text asking for an apology to say "I  feel like she's still attracted to you and see's me as a threat" - I  never saw Maria as a threat because Sam and I are just friends and never  tried to step in the middle of their arrangement they had because  that's just shitty.  Sam asked me my honest feelings about the proposal to apologize for something I didn't even do - I told him no I wasn't apologizing .

ex27xxad	So this year we purchased a car, it’s under my name but we put down the same amount for the down payment while I pay it monthly and he pays the rent which are about the same. So we view it as both our car. However, whenever he drives he’s much more speedy than I am and is more prone to road rage so whenever he starts to speed I tell him to slow down and it’s always been like this. He gets upset because he feels like I nag him too much which I do but I just hate the idea of getting into an accident or being pulled over so I’d rather he drive safe. He tells me that he hates that I make him feel like I don’t trust him driving. It’s something we bicker over all the time as you can’t really avoid driving together to places. I insist on driving which I do sometimes but he says he enjoys driving so it’s about 50/50. For context, we are both 22 year old males and hard headed. I want to be ok with it and show I trust him but it doesn’t change that it stresses me out and is illegal of course.

bs857woq	Background info:  Me, my mum and dad all have a little banter between each other like saying I’m short, my mum doesn’t listen to my dad and me because she’s always on her phone. Honestly, I can’t remember what we joke about with my dad.  Now, tonight I wasn’t hungry and I didn’t take a lot of food and I hardly touched my food when I came downstairs and my mum saw and she said, “starving yourself won’t make you lose weight”   I just stormed to my room and I was very upset by this and my mum and dad think this is just “banter” I don’t think saying something like that is funny in the least. I’ve always had a hard time with food and the thing is, I’ve stopped eating food because I thought it would make me lose weight and I’ve done this multiple times.   I just think if I said this to my mum it wouldn’t be a funny little banter joke, I think it isn’t funny to say even if you are family.	1642801570.0	s9luta	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9luta/aita_for_storming_off_about_what_my_mum_said/	AITA for storming off about what my mum said?
ivsolshx	My best friend (16F) and I (15M) are incredibly close and give each other advice on various subjects all the time. She always reassures me that she finds my advice really helpful and that she loves hearing it.   For some context: I'm an all A student and have been all my life, while she is gets mediocre grades. Despite that, we both wanna go to University. In my country (Greece), in order to go to Uni, you have to pass exams in order to pass in a certain field and go to Uni. It's a point system, and the more points you get, the better opportunities you have to study in a good University. These exams are notoriously difficult and if you don't get a certain amount of points, you won't pass at all. Also, the grades you get in the 10th, 11th and 12th Grade contribute to the point you get in the exams.  We were discussing about our grades this year and she told me that she didn't think that she did very well, but she didn't care (she is in the 10th Grade). Naturally, I got worried,since the field that she wants to study in is quite difficult to pass in, so I told her that she should really be careful and really try to get as good grades as possible, with the above reasons.   She seriously did not like that. The first thing she said was "Did I ask?" and when I tried telling her that I was just trying to look out for her she replied with the same thing. She also started crying, said that reminded her her biggest inscurity and started calling herself useless. She also asked how I knew if she even wanted to go to Uni, despite the fact that she's said so multiple times.   I immediately apologized and comforted her. She forgave me and now everything is back to normal, but I can't forger about it. I don't think I'm in the wrong here and I think that she overreacted a bit.  So, am I the asshole?	1642801599.0	s9lv7x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9lv7x/aita_for_giving_my_best_friend_academic_advice/	AITA for giving my best friend academic advice?
ivrhrj3n	My parents (33M and 35F) dont give me (17F) and my siblings (9M, 7M, 2F) many rules. But if there is a rule, its a big one. 'Break it and you lose a lot of things' big one. One of those rules, is no lying within the family. You can lie about things like money and family business to other people, but you can not lie to the immediate family (parents and siblings). A few years back, we all got promised a dog each when we move back to our home country, since we have enough space and money, but there is a catch.  The only way we can get a dog to ourselves, is if we read a good couple of books about raising and training a dog, and pass a test our parents, who have also read many more books, make for us. I have already read a lot of books and passed the test, and as a result , will be the first one to be able to have a dog, just for me, that I can control what happens with and who comes near it, and I am ecstatic. My brother "N" (9M)? Not so much. He also wants a dog quickly, because of course he does. He is a kid. He asked mum and dad but was told that he needs to pass the test, which he agreed to do. Half an hour later, N walked into my room and asked me for the questions and answers to the test. I told him I will not give them to him, as it would be cheating and, essentially, lying. I offered to lend him the books that helped me most, so that he doesnt have to look for and buy new ones, and to help him remember the  parts that might not be on the test, but are important nonetheless. He said he doesnt want that and just wants the answers and questions. I said no, because not only would that be breaking the rules, it would also put my own dog and other people/animals in danger, if we have an untrained dog with us anywhere. He could bite and scratch anybody, especially our little sister who can barely run straight. He got mad and said I am a bad sister because I won't help him, but my parents said that I did the right thing. Then N got our other brother on board and now I am a bad sister and a good daughter.

9ob5ml41	I (F 35) agreed to watch my friend's (F 34) child (M 5) overnight when her dad had a medical emergency. She expected that she'd only be there a few hours, but at the hospital, her dad fell into a coma and she asked if it was okay if her son stayed overnight with me. Of course, I said yes.  The next evening when she came to pick him up she was livid that he hadn't been bathed although he was by no means filthy, just a little sweaty, maybe from the upset in his routine.  Here's the thing: Her son is autistic and terrified of showers. I did not have a bathtub at the time and knowing his terror of showers (I'd babysat him before and she had left directions to fill the tub without him in the bathroom because even that triggers him) I opted to clean him with baby wipes and a warm washcloth, which he was cooperative with.  She put him in his car seat and then returned to the house to say that I'd messed up his bedtime routine, she couldn't believe I'd send her son home dirty, and she thought I was a better friend than that, and I needed to be more sensitive to the needs of Autistic kids. She posted this rant on her social media once she arrived home.  Now, I thought our time together had gone well- he cried for about fifteen minutes after drop-off, but after, we watched his favorite show, ate a snack, and I put him to bed. In the morning he woke up asking for her, but no tears; breakfast and lunch were eaten, we played some of his sign language games, cuddled with my cat, then I wiped him as clean as I could.  So, AITA? Should I have pressed the shower issue? I admittedly have very limited experience with Autism, he's the only person I know who has been diagnosed and based on her prior instructions I felt I did the best I could in the circumstances.	1642801975.0	s9m0h5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9m0h5/aita_for_not_bathing_my_friends_child_when_he/	AITA for not bathing my friend's child when he stayed overnight?
69hsyfck	 My mom(F38) has been seeing a guy(M37) in our apartment complex over the past 6ish months. He has a kid (M7) and theyve seem to really hit it off. I personally have not been interested in either at all and don't want anything to do with them. They seem like great people, and the guy has a great job. The issue comes from the fact that my mom loves to spend as much time as she can with them. I on the other hamd would prefer to stay home and let them go out. She respects this 90% of the time yet I still feel like im being forced to have  an acquaintanceship with them. We have been recently discussing where we plan to move after our lease is up and she has brought up the idea of us moving in with them into a bigger apartment. I am not okay with this as it will violate my space. I've even threatened to move in with my grandmother if this were to happen. It's mostly concerning to me as the boy like to play with my xbox, and messes around with the cat and dog tiring them to an extent where theyre gasping for air. There are other details that i could mention, but none are needed for the story. I love my mom and want her to have a relationship with him, but I do not think it is fair for me to move in with people I barely know.

ivt8ziaj	My (m30) wife (f32) recently got pregnant and I could not be happier about it. We told both our parents as well as her sister & her sisters husband in the 8th week. Since they life abroad. But obviously want to wait announcing it to other people a bit longer.   Tonight she told me she is planning to tell her two best friends about it when she is in the 12th week but will only tell other people in the 20th week of pregnancy.   Backstory: My wife does not get along with brothers wife. She always wants to be in the spotlight and my wife is the pure opposite. Also it seems she tries to follow all the big steps in our life. She got married to my brother shortly after we married and when we got a new flat they moved in right next to us. My wife is now worried that she will also get pregnant as soon as she knows about it. It stresses her out a lot. For that reason she also does not want to tell my brother and her untill week 20.   We got into an argument about it. My point was that she should then also not tell her friends untill I can tell my brother since he is the only person apart from my parents I actually want to tell it.   She got very hurt and accused my of not beeing on her side and not understanding her. Now I feel like an asshole.

bmf8gbqr	First time poster. This happened this morning and I'm still fuming about it several hours later.   My son needed a doctor's appointment, so my husband made the appointment. After making the appointment he reminded me there was still a balance due and he'll pay it when he takes our son in for his appointment. I told him not to pay it and I do not agree with what they billed for and I told the front desk lady last week when I was there for my daughter's appointment and she told me to call the insurance company and she'll make a note in the system that I'm handling it.  Well at 7:30am I get a call from the Doctor's office. I answered it and it was the billing rep for the office demanding I make the payment right now because my husband agreed to pay the balance and now he is refusing. I said, my husband was unaware that I'm handling this with the insurance company because I do not agree with what you charged me for and I spoke to the front desk lady about it last week. The billing rep then said she is not responsible for who is responsible for what in my household and I need to take care of this right now! I'm not kidding, she was yelling at me over the phone. I was so taken back and raised my voice back that your office continues to charge me for well visits/vaccine visits when they should be covered 100%! She told me they code the claims and send it to the insurance company and they have an agreed upon amount they can charge me for visits. I said I understand that but you are charging me for well visits when I know my insurance covers those. She then said to me "I see right here that you and your husband both work for "said insurance company" so you both should know how claims work!" I was so floored by what she said that I calmly responded that neither of us works for or has anything to do with the claims department. She started yelling some more about some nonsense and I just hung up. I couldn't take it anymore.   By her logic, when the doctor is behind, she could step in and see children and write prescriptions because she works in a doctor's office. Completely stupid assumption, right?  When my husband got home I told him about what happened. He said I need to call the office manager immediately and  report what this billing rep just said to me. I said I will call, but I need to calm down first or I know I won't handle it well. He said I should call when I'm fired up. But I decided to wait. He also wants us to switch pediatricians now because he thinks their staff is very unprofessional now. I was telling my mom about the incident and she thinks while the rep should not have said that to me and I shouldn't have hung up on her. So AITA for hanging up while being insulted and yelled at by a ped's office billing rep?	1642803951.0	s9mrdp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9mrdp/aita_for_hanging_up_on_the_billing_rep_at_the/	AITA for hanging up on the billing rep at the Peds office?
d256azel	ok, so back in december i went to visit my family and spend Christmas/NYE with them. I was supposed to go back with my mom on Jan. 10th but my return date was delayed because i got covid, so i had to stay there a couple more weeks. I asked my roommates to pick me up at the bus stop and they agreed. I think it’s necessary to mention that not only are they my roommates, but also my best friends. So, due to this whole covid situation and lockdown i got really depressed and these last few weeks were really tough for me. I wasn’t eating or sleeping well, everything was just horrible. I made sure to tell them (more than once) which bus stop they needed to pick me up at, sent them my live location hours before getting there, letting them know ~30 minutes before i got there, etc. I finally get there, excited to get home and also to see my friends and they are nowhere to be found. Mind you, it was a 10h bus ride so my back was killing me and i also had to unload my luggage. I called them to ask where they were and they were at the wrong place. I got upset and took a cab home and we had a huge fight over it. None of them will apologize for what they did because they don’t believe they did anything wrong. AITA for being upset?	1642804724.0	s9n1t6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n1t6/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_roommates_werent_on/	AITA for being upset that my roommates weren’t on time to pick me up from a bad trip?
h25rh7qm	So my husband is a SAHD and I work full time. He is trying to learn German and had a girl from class over to study. As he was picking her up from the train station I was cleaning up cause he frankly doesn't clean. I put the roomba in the kitchen and as they got here picked up things here and there. After a while my hubby goes: do we need to go study in the office? I thought you were going for a walk with the baby. The roomba is so distracting. I'm like: well I thought it was at 4. The girl goes: well actually it's 5 min to 4 now... my hubby is like oh buuuurn. I'm thinking okeee, so you're kicking us out or what?   So I get ready, get the baby ready and tell my husband that my parents were gonna come by but not to worry, they weren't gonna come in. He asked why that would bother him and I responded so that they don't bother them, since they are kicking me out. I'm sure I was a bit snippy. Then he blows up and chews me out in front of his friend  what my deal was, how could I be so rude, how could I involve her in this etc. I said I hadn't involved her, he said I did by saying "they" are kicking me out. I didn't say anything about the snide "it's 5 min to 4" remark and told her that I did not mean to attack her in any way. She was like noo, no worries, all good. I'm sure she was more shocked and uncomfortable by my husband's behavior. They then took off. Husband is still extremely mad at me  won't talk to me, won't sleep in the same bed as me, won't come to what we had planned tomorrow...   but guys, they wanted to kick me and the baby out in freezing weather so we wouldn't bother them. So anyways, am I the only asshole here?	1642804726.0	s9n1u7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n1u7/aita_for_not_wanting_to_get_kicked_out/	AITA for not wanting to get kicked out?
iv7k2sto	I’m (16F) starting track season. My friend on the team is the fastest girl in the state. She is very celebrated and wins a lot of student-athlete awards.  Our classmate (16M) was volunteering at our practice to get his volunteer hours, and then he started going off to me that she shouldn’t be celebrated and doesn’t deserve any praise for being an athlete. He said athletic achievement deserves no praise because only people who are genetically gifted can become elite athletes, so they have an unearned advantage and their success isn’t inspirational whatsoever. He said she would never have been a star athlete if she wasn’t born with a runner’s build, as if we should care.  I said “spoken like someone who has never been first at anything in his life.” He hasn’t. He was like “as if I’d ever want to waste my time on some meaningless sport like a moron. In forty years, no one will care about your athletic achievements.” And I was like “In forty years, no one will care about anything you’ve done, because you’ve never accomplished anything.”	1642805091.0	s9n6ru	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9n6ru/aita_for_insulting_my_classmate_after_he/	AITA for insulting my classmate after he disrespected sports?

I asked questions like.. what if they can’t pay it back? Are you sure they will? Etc. the main reason for my questions is that I don’t think they have a the capacity to. Granted, her family are great people so I don’t have issues with lending them money but just worried but their repaying capacity.

ivvfsu6d	Some relevant context: I am financially well-to-do and my car is worth approximately $100,000.  A couple months back I was driving and turned left on a protected green light. I was hit by a driver coming the opposite direction who ran their red light. Thankfully no one was hurt. The cops came and I told them what happened, and a witness who was behind me backed up my story. The driver was a young lady and she apologized and said she was distracted and didn't see the red light. We exchanged contact & insurance information and the cops assigned her 100% of the blame in the report.  My car was totaled. Her insurance only covered about half the damages I was owed. Not a problem, that's why I carry underinsured motorist insurance, and my insurance covered the remainder and I was made hole.  A week or so ago I got an email from her. She said that I was ruining her life as she was being sued by my insurance company for the amount they had to pay over her insurance's max coverage. She would have to drop out of college and find a lawyer to fight the case, not to mention the damages she'd owe if she lost. She asked me to drop the suit and work out some other way to fix this situation. I replied and explained that I was not suing her, it was not my decision, I did not have any influence over what my insurance's legal team was doing, and that she had been judged as solely responsible for the accident so it was out of my hands.  She wrote back asking if I could personally loan her the money to pay off the damages and then she would work out some way to pay me back. I have ignored this email.  I was talking to a couple friends and told them this story, and one of them said that even though she was responsible for the accident, he could see her side of the story and I should consider loaning her the money since I could afford it (which is true).

nfob1	So my boyfriend (18m) and I (18f) like to play the Phoenix Wright games on our date nights. I've played all of the main trilogy before but he hasn't so we're playing it on his pc while he shares his screen on discord. I love to play it because I get to do voices for the characters and he likes it for the gameplay. We also obviously both love just interacting with eachother.     Usually, it goes just fine and he mostly figures it out on his own with a couple of hints from me from time to time when he's stuck (if you've ever played an Ace Attorney game you know that sometimes it just doesn't tell you where to go/what to do so you just have to shit there and throw things until they stick. I give him small hints to make this easier).  This evening, however, he got stuck twice and refused help both times so what ended up happening was we made a little bit of progress, I got to do my voices and we learned a little bit more about the story. Then he got stuck. For a solid 30 - 45 minutes. Where we sat in silence with me begging to give him a hint every so often just to progress the game and he'd refuse stating "all the fun for me is figuring it out". Then after a tiny bit of subtle prodding, he ended up getting something right out of sheer luck and we got another 5 minutes of gameplay. Then he got stuck for actually an hour and a half. Where he spent a solid half an hour staring at a single menu and making thinking noises.  I had already got upset about him taking so long the first time so the second time I was super angry. It was date night and I was forced to sit there for an hour and a half on my phone while he was thinking. He eventually decided he was done for the day after that hour and a half so he left.  I told him how unhappy I was that I got to do nothing for most of the evening and he was saying it wouldn't be fair if I had helped him because then he wouldn't have figured it out on his own. Now he's mad at me for being upset. AITA??  &#x200B;  TL:DR I was forced to watch my boyfriend sit there and think instead of actually getting to play the game we wanted to play. I got upset.

ivulel2j	Hi,  I'm(16f) still going to school, with my mums approval i have started colouring my hair pink since i was 13 as i like pink and it looks pretty. Since that I was hearing rumours how much I remind a character of one of the stories a girl in my school wrote. She is a bit older then me and 2 grades higher. Through friends I have managed to trace the story and realised the girl in the story is basically me. Not only she was described to have the same looks as me but also acts similar to me but older and with different japanese name. I freaked out as I'm not comfortable with it and the plot of the story is scary (it seems like a horror story where I eventually die in a brutal death). I have scrolled further in her profile and found several stories about me but using the same weird name.   I have confronted the girl about it while she was surrounded by her classmates and asked the story to be taken down as I don't feel comfortable with it being up. I was expecting her classmates to ask questions but they all laughed and she told me to "stop being so self centered and do more research before accusing people" and her classmates fully supported her.  I have spoken to my mum about it and let her read the story and yesterday this girl was called in directors office. She wasn't happy when she came out and since then a few people in school called me an asshole for what I did because I weren't comfortable with somebody else's hobby. I don't think it is hobby since the story clearly is about me and is upsetting to read. I feel she should of asked me first instead of sneakily writing stories about me for over a year as this feels creepy.

5w72of7g	So some background info.  I do digital art and post it to places like tiktok and Instagram, I have a bit of a following and I'm well known around my highschool for being "the one art kid that can draw really well". Because of that, my teachers also know about it. We have a local multimedia fair for my school district with a bunch of entrance categories, digital art being one of them. All of my graphics teachers were really looking forward to me entering because it would be an easy win for me and my highschool.  I wasn't feeling up to it to begin with but I decided to do it anyway. I also told my mom about it because she'll ask me like once a month what's going on with me.   I got super busy this week and wasn't able to finish my piece for it, so I didn't get to submit it in time (today was the deadline). I had doctor and dental appointments during the week and was busy with band/drumline things, so I never got a chance to work.  But my school called my mom and she texted me for the first time in like a week (I'm staying with my dad for right now for unrelated reasons) saying that she and my teacher were very disappointed in me.  She called me lazy and said I never do anything, and that when I go back to her place things are going to change. She said some other nasty things too but I don't want to repeat them.  I've posted to this sub about my mom before so I hope it's not a pattern or anything.  So AITA?

bv3zee37	Me (28F) and my fiancé (28M) are due to be married in a little over a year. I am considerably more excited to be planning our wedding and quickly realised he didn't wish to input much, or be consulted. The few decisions I've asked him to weigh in on have either been met with an eye roll and a sigh, or a "why don't you just pick" type response. I appreciate he isn't as interested in this but as there is a lot more planning to be done I am finding it stressful undertaking this alone, my bridesmaids and maid of honour live all over the world so its difficult to lean on them. I confronted him and he took offence and said he asks me to make the decisions because he wants me to have exactly what I want. I'd like it to be our day, not just mine, and I find the idea of making all the decisions a lot of pressure. Also I'm not sure I believe his response and feel he just doesn't care, he was pretty offended by that but continues to be irritated if I ask for his help. He shows me he cares about me in so many other ways and if it's true I guess it's nice he wants me to have the day of my dreams.

ivuchymy	Hi,  So I was picking up my husband’s brother from school and there was a red traffic light. I tried slowing down but the car wouldn’t stop, and I was about to hit the van in front of me, so I swerved left onto the median to stop an accident from happening. I tried moving the car but it was stuck so I called my husband to figure out what the best option was.  He was asking me where I was and he was going to come out to help, etc. but then some passersby came out of their cars to help direct me (told me to straighten my wheels and then stopped traffic so I could safely back out). On that phone call, my husband also said that he’d drive his siblings from now on. I felt hurt because I’ve never gotten into an accident before and it’s not like I’m not a safe driver. I don’t know.   I was able to make it home safely after that.   My husband is mad at me, and he doesn’t understand how the car wouldn’t stop. He says it’s my fault (which I agree to an extent; if I had been driving much slower, maybe I could have stopped). FYI the road is downhill and I was driving 30 km/h or 19 miles/hr. I was aware it might be slippery especially since it’s downhill, so I tried slowing down earlier but the car just wouldn’t stop.   We had a huge fight. We’ve been having problems besides this event, so I feel like that’s part of it. He said he wants me out of his house. I think he’s just super upset and needs to cool off.  I don’t know. I personally just am grateful everyone was fine and safe and that we didn’t crash into a car.   Am I the asshole? I feel like shit.   FYI, we are currently living with his younger sister and brother as their mom is out of the country.	1642807988.0	s9o908	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9o908/aita_for_almost_crashing_the_car/	AITA for almost crashing the car
fkw9p9pu	When I lived in my studio it was owned by a shady family business. I would deal with the oldest son and I lived there for a year with minor problems but nothing too major until the last couple of months I lived their.   These people hated the police at the property which was sus.  There was a time someone tired to break into my room while I was in there, I scream and I called the older son (I know I’m stupid) and told him I’ll call the cops and he said no, he would sort it. (Again I know stupid). After that I didn’t like living there and it went from bad to worse. After awhile my landlord wanted me to pay more money because I managed to get a job. Repairs were never fixed (washing machine wasn’t replaced for 3 months, internet was always unpaid, everyone was experiencing leaks and mould in their studio, plus slugs were frequent visitors). Also the second son harassed me, which was the last straw for me. I was finding apartments to move into at that moment.   One day a form tenant called the cops and the police came told all the tenants at the house that my landlord was arrested for fraud and tax evasion and wanted to know about our tenancy.    My original plan was to find a place and give 30 days notice, until the oldest son tired asking me for rent (which I didn’t owe as I was up to date). I said no I don’t owe you anything for the next few weeks plus I don’t feel comfortable coming to the door (it was past 9pm and I wasn’t decent).   He got so mad at me calling all types of names and attempted to open the door. I was scared, and in survivor mode, so I picked up a something to protect me and scream “you dare open this f****** door I’ll call the f****** police, because either me or you are going to prison and I damn sure no it’s not me”. (Said something along those lines). He stopped and tried to guilt trip me instead for 20 mins and left saying he’ll come back in a few days. Called my parents and they came and got me with my stuff, I just left the key in room with no warning. Before living I called the police and report the whole thing. The landlord son called me a bitch and now the investigation against his whole family is getting worse. I don’t feel bad for them but I do feel bad for other tenants. Was I AITA?  NOTE: A very important piece of info is that I never signed a tenancy agreement, the first few weeks I lived I kept asking but I ended up forgetting and never got it. But I did sign something else but it was about the government paying a certain amount of rent on my behalf.

ivxhpa0l	This happened a week ago and thankfully the dog is okay. My neighbor next door lets his dog chill outside on their balcony sometimes and I (29m) took mine out that morning for a walk. He went right next door in front of my neighbors lawn, he wasn’t anywhere on his property though. Just on the sidewalk. His dog sees mine and starts barking at him. Which ofc makes mine bark right back. Neighbor’s dog got really riled up and he accidentally fell through the railing off the balcony. It wasn’t high up thankfully but the dog still got a broken leg.  My neighbor was there and he was pissed. Now he’s saying it’s my fault his dog got hurt and I owe him money for the vet. He showed me the bill and it was a little over a thousand. He said because my dog was the one that provoked him it’s our fault he fell from the balcony. Which to me is bullshit because one, his dog was on *his* balcony alone and without anything blocking the gaps in the rail and he’s a small dog too. And second my dog wasn’t on his property, also what if he’d just seen any other person or animal walking by and fell?   It was an accident. For me I love animals and I’m glad his dog is okay. The reason I’m asking if I’m TA is because i would’ve been willing to help cover the bill. But the way he came at me aggressively. Demanding I give him money really pissed me off and I don’t like that. So I guess you can say for petty reasons I don’t want to help him for how he’s been acting with me even though I do have the money to help.

915g9s2f	As the title suggests, my F(34) husband M(30)  is constantly making noise. Either whistling (but like the half whistle where you're just blowing out air), humming, tapping, or listening to podcasts. The podcasts he listens to are sports or video game related and it's like they're always yelling instead of talking. I. Can't. Stand. It.   It drives me crazy, when he starts I try my best to deal but within minutes I feel like I need to just leave. I make excuses to go to the gym or go run errands because I can't take it. I've asked him to stop repeatedly over the last couple of years. His response is always that it's not al and I need to chill out. I need a reality check here, is that a normal thing and I'm the asshole just being sensitive?	1642808075.0	s9oa3v	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oa3v/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_how_much_noise_my/	AITA for being annoyed at how much noise my husband makes?
5baqf2tg	I purchased a motorcycle for 700 dollars 2 years ago. Since the pandemic prices for motorcycles have gone way up. Especially for this particular model. So I decided to post it for sale. Before I did, I texted my cousin who showed interest in the bike since I had bought it. I said I plan on listing it for 1,500 but I’d sell it to him for 1,300 which is what I’d let someone talk me down to. His first response was “how much did you pay for it” when I said that’s neither here nor there he called me a greedy pos and told me to go eff myself. (He and his wife are both multi millionaires, I have never had more than 10k in my bank account) I said where not friends anymore and don’t talk to me at family functions. (We we’re pretty good friends our entire lives stood up in each other’s weddings etc) Listed the bike the next day sold it within the hour for 1,500.	1642808715.0	s9oii6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9oii6/aita_for_not_selling_my_cousin_a_bike_for_the/	AITA for not selling my cousin a bike for the same amount I paid for it.
ivx1t8vc	So I (28f) and my fiance (33m) have been together almost 7yrs. He has a son (10) from a previous relationship. As long as we've been together, the boy comes over having not showered for days, wearing the same clothes (underwear, shirts, etc) as the last time we saw him, and most of the time having those clothes be thrifted (but not "nice" thrifted, I love thrifted stuff! But like "why did you buy that" thrifted). This particular situation being a Wednesday to a Friday. He came over on the Wednesday wearing a shirt, and then when we picked him up again Friday, same shirt. As much as he's only 10 right now and doesn't really stink yet, we (father and I) don't want to have to try and reach him these habits when it gets to that, we want to start now and build those good/healthy habits. I ask son why he's wearing the same shirt as the other day and he says because he likes it/it's comfy. I say that's good, but we need to make sure we're changing our clothes regularly so we can stay "fresh". He says ok. I know it won't stick because his mother clearly isn't bothered. So I'm sick of this and I text her and ask if she had maybe done laundry Thursday and he just happened to grab that one out of the pile first today(Friday). She ignores my text and just texts my fiance that she's not going to even respond to me... I want to text her again but it'll just get her attacking my fiance instead of talking to me.

crpv0gib	    My spouse bought a very cheap older car for us temporarily after losing his job (engineer)due to covid (didn't have one before). I am not working right now (I was previously), I am trying to finish my bachelor's. We are very stressed about money. We have been budgeting super tight and living in a less nice neighborhood to save up money now that he has just gotten another job about 3 months ago.  Recently, the cheap car he bought broke down. We live in a major city where it is very hard to get around without a car. We had already planned to pay off his debt (7k) and save 3 months' rent the next few months by being really tight and paying cheap rent, then we would buy a new car. His father has allowed him to drive his car (also very old and unreliable) which I can't drive. I am going back to class in person and really want a car because it is very difficult to get to this new campus.  Pre-face: His family is Mexican (I like them), I am American. His mother knew a place to get the car fixed (a neighbor). He didn't want to pay money to fix it if it was expensive (replacing an engine in an old car isn't worth it). I wanted to know how much it cost before he said no because it will make getting to my classes without a car very hard. (It is easy for him to say "go without a car" because he has been able to drive his dad's extra car and has not had to be the one to go carless). I wanted to call and ask how much it would cost, but he wouldn't give me the number because the repairman will tell his mom when they know what's wrong. When I pushed that I would be fine to ask if he doesn't have the time, he told me they probably don't speak English. I kept asking and it took about 3 weeks to hear back if they could fix it.  He just told me that they did fix and it would cost a decent amount (at least $500). I asked him why they fixed it without asking us first since if it was too much, we would wait a few months until we are ready to buy a new car. He told me that his mom and her husband paid for it because "she didn't want him going without a car" despite him telling her at first that he didn't want to pay. I am mad (at him not her) because spending this means we might have to put off getting a car to stay within budget. We both have made the budget together and have sacrificed comforts to pay off his debt, but a car is important to me.  I understand that they were trying to help, but because we are married, making financial decisions (like this) should be between us and should not be made by his mom. I know this is very thoughtful of her, but we are trying to not take out debt (like we don't put anything on credit and keep old phones instead of upgrading). There are different mentalities around spending money (my family would never loan/borrow money). I also don't want to make it a reoccurring thing that we borrow/loan a large amount of money from each other.	1642809520.0	s9osxk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9osxk/aita_for_getting_mad_at_spouse_for_letting_his/	AITA: For getting mad at spouse for letting his parents pay to fix our car
2fzi13aj	I (19f) was chatting with my (21nb) friend amongst our group and they wanted to vent about their(20f) best friend (I do not know this woman personally, only through stories). Their best friend has been in an emotionally abusive relationship for the past five years until about a month or so ago. That is until yesterday she moved back in with her abuser, and our friend came to us to vent, which is understandable as watching someone you love go back into such a horrific situation is.. indescribable. I was trying to console them and tell them like hey I know it’s awful and all you can do is let her know no matter what her bf says you love her and you care for her, and they said “No, I’m done, it’s over.” They told me how they’ve talked to her countless times about how bad he is for her and that they’ve put up with him for years for her, so I offered more advice that it generally helps when you’re there with her you try to stand up for her whenever he tries to manipulate her or see him act shady just to let her know you are on her side and there for her in spite of what he tells her. And then they said they can’t even stand to be in the same room as him let alone speak to him, he’s just that horrible, which I can understand not blaming them for that. They went on to say that having to put up with this and her putting him above everyone else including herself is too much for them. They complained that this is like abuse to them, not having their best friend anymore and her prioritizing him over everything no matter what. At that point it just really pissed me off that as someone who has both witnessed and experienced emotional abuse in my own home how could you think that as a bystander your experience is comparable to hers? I told them this and asked why the hell are you blaming her for being i  this situation, to which they told me I don’t know their life, her life, and their experiences and friendship. To them I was way out of line and asked how could I get on my soap box during something like this, and they left and drove home. And now it’s been a week and I regret how I went about this. To lose your best friend again to something like that as I said is indescribable and it’s not the time you want to hear how your wrong/ did something wrong, but I still stand where I stand; emotional abuse warps your entire sense of reality, and affects your entire way if thinking; just telling your friend she’s stupid for sticking with her first serious boyfriend isn’t gonna do anything, and telling her after she’s gone back you’re done with her and she’s dumb is making her situation worse. I’ve tried texting them because I realize I did come at them really strong at an inappropriate time when they’re going through something like this and I wanna talk about it, but they said if it’s not a full apology for everything I said I can fuck off for good.  So am I wrong in my reasoning? Am I being an asshole woke-scold? Do I eat my words?

ivw5o6ct	I \[16m\] am one of four, but I only have one brother “Luke” \[15m\]. It was obvious that Luke was gay since we were really young so when he came out a few years ago nobody was really surprised. Through his dance group, he met his current boyfriend, “Harry” \[18m\]. Luke and Harry have been dating for about a year and Harry has come on family outings with us a few times.   I don’t like Harry. He drinks a lot (not illegal here) but he always offers Luke alcohol even in front of our parents. He is often late and he will grab Luke and make him sit on his lap even if he doesn’t want to. He also takes him on late night drives for hours without telling our parents so they are always worried about where he is.   This week was my mother’s birthday and I put myself in charge of organising her surprise party because it was a milestone birthday. I booked a table at one of her favourite restaurants near the beach, ordered her main present and invited some of her friends and family. I didn’t invite Harry.   Everything was going well, we had a nice meal, my mother caught up with her friends, until my mother asked Luke how Harry was doing. This prompted Luke to go on a long rant about how angry he was that Harry had not been invited when our sister \[20f\]’s boyfriend \[21m\] had been, which is ridiculous because they have a child together. Luke said that it is unfair I am unwilling to treat Harry as ‘family’ and that I don’t like them just because they’re different to me, which is not the case, I do like my brother, although we don’t have much in common, I just don’t like Harry.   Luke’s outburst ruined the tone of the night and he resumed complaining when we drove home. He said that I need to accept that Harry will always be a part of our lives now, but I think he needs to understand that not every event needs to include his boyfriend. It wasn’t about him, it was about our mother.   However, my mother later confessed that she wouldn’t have minded if Harry came just to appease my brother as she knew it means a lot to him to feel accepted. AITA?

9guepjze	I am a lawyer, licensed for less than a year, so very much a baby who knows nothing. I got hired by a solo practitioner right after I graduated from school.   I am his only employee. I received one day of training by his previous assistant and then was expected to figure everything else out on my own.  We rent an office space with other lawyers and he likes to work when it's quiet, so he usually gets into the office around 4pm (if he comes in at all). My hours are supposed to be 10-6. When he's not around he never calls or emails me with work to do. I used to always check in every morning asking him to let me know if there was anything I should work on, and he rarely gave me anything. I stopped asking after a while.   Sometimes there are things to do, but for the most part I spend a lot of the day playing around online just trying to pass time. I used to try to make an effort to read textbooks to study the field, but I stopped because I wasn't getting much out of it.   A few times he asked me to write down my hours and what I do every week before he pays me. In the beginning I used to do it, but I stopped because I don't even know what to say I'm doing. Today he brought up that he asked me multiple times to write down my hours, and he needs to know what I'm doing.   He pays me well, relatively. And I am generally not a lazy worker or someone who takes advantage. But he doesn't show me that he cares at all about anything, so I don't really put in effort anymore.   I'm most likely leaving the job soon anyway because of life circumstances, so I guess it doesn't really matter, but he is sometimes really snappy with me and I don't feel like I deserve it. And I have such a hard time standing up for myself. There is a lot more I want to mention, but can't fit in this post. So, am I wrong in this situation? 	1642809763.0	s9owit	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9owit/aita_for_being_a_bad_employee/	AITA for Being a Bad Employee
iva09d4v	My (27M) friend (25M) recently got a tattoo on their wrist. It was of an animal since it was part of their middle name in Swahili. They aren't the biggest fan of the animal, but decided to get one of it anyway, since they said it's part of who they are, in hopes that the tattoo artist could make it look nice.  So this is where the conflict comes in. He sent me pictures of the new tattoo on their wrist asking if I liked it, was it nice, etc. I replied that I only really like dogs (I just never really cared for other animals/wildlife), but that if they liked it and had some sort of sentiment then that's really nice! He then proceeds to send me a handful of paragraphs saying that they were not happy with what I said. They felt like that I was being passive aggressive/trying to hint that I thought it looked bad. He says it doesn’t matter if I liked it or not but that I should have at least said one nice thing about it because the tattoo was going to be permanent on his body.  I tried to explain that it was not the case at all, and that I had simply meant that I would not personally get it and that since it was something that had sentimental value to them, then that's all that really mattered. He then goes on to say it doesn't matter, as this is something permanent and because of the way I reacted, they're going to forever doubt the tattoo.  I understand that I may not have been as kind in my response as I could have been, though I don't feel like it warranted such a reaction or defensive response from them either.

ivxslt7r	I have lived in my townhouse for about 5 years. My neighbor and I share a walkway up to the house with another neighbor and our doors are inches apart(we share a common wall).   They moved in about a year ago and they have a toddler, probaby a little over 2 now.   For the last year they have been leaving the bags from theor diaper genie on their doorstep so the husband can take it to the dumpster when he goes to work in the morning.   The problem.is their doorstep is also my door step, and I leave for work at 3am.   They will leave the bag put there over night  and I regularly have to see and smell this bag when I leave my house (yes the liner is clear, so you can see what is in there.   I have asked them to stop and she tells me she would take it put herself but it's raining and she has no one to watch the baby.   I told her to keep it inside then until it can be taken out and she said she would, bit went right back to it. After that I started taking picture and sending it to the company that manages pur HOA and they now receive a $50 fine any time it happens.

7nel8rqw	My FIL is in poor health and has been for quite some time. Things recently took a turn for the worse, but not dire. He has heart issues, had surgery in 2020 and recently lost his brother due to the same heart condition. So he's become acutely aware of his own mortality, but it's not like his doctor has told him to prepare for the end or he's in hospice or anything.   I recently became pregnant, just crossed over the first trimester mark so decided to share the news. It was unplanned, and honestly I thought I'd never have kids (mix of apathy and was told I'd need fertility treatments to try) so this is all a bit of a surprise.   My FIL is basically demanding we name our kid after him as his "dying" wish. I tried to swat this away by saying "oh but it's gonna be a girl" (we don't actually know yet, by choice) and he's like "that's okay just used the feminized version" and finally we just told him flat out no. Our kid, our choice.   Issues I have with the name. I've leaned on 2&3, he should be aware of 4, is probably aware of 5 (and is probably part of why he's pushing so hard).   1) it's an ugly generic name (think "Marvin" but more common) that I just don't like. Sorry Marvins out there, nothing personal.   2) my weirdly competitive cousin is also pregnant and has already chosen this name and absolutely would get weird about it, no matter the cause.   3) I have known many shitty people with this name and dated one for 3 years and am still in the same circles, it would just be weird.   4) My BIL has this name. He will almost certainly never have kids of his own (married someone old enough to be his mom) which is why the pressure is on us. FIL has always played favorites with Jr taking the lead so it's almost certainly going to create a weird dynamic for my husband (his thoughts, he is totally on board with not using this name).   5) Just seriously fuck this dude. He's always been a prick, he's a massive control freak, bigoted, and everything always has to be about him. I keep that to myself, but the last thing I want is to be reminded of this asshole everytime I think of my kid.   More importantly- I feel like I don't owe him shit. As mentioned above, he's a total control freak and this is 1000% why he's making this demand. His dying wish isn't to have this kid carry his name, it's to die knowing that he forced me to do something I'm uncomfortable with and will have to live with for the rest of my life. Lying would still give him that satisfaction.   Almost everyone (minus husband) is telling me to lie just to make him happy and that I'm just being petty/stubborn. But he's not actively dying and he's probably going to be around after kid is born. What, do I keep up the act until he croaks?   It's creating serious tension and all the pressure seems to be on me and my husband to back down. My husband's relationship with his father was always strained, but now it's at the breaking point and I feel guilty. My husband agrees but it's essentially on me.	1642811815.0	s9pmed	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pmed/aita_for_refusing_to_lie_to_my_fil_about_honoring/	AITA for refusing to lie to my FIL about honoring his "dying" wish?
ekvoc0oj	My roommate and I (F23) were invited out by one of our closest friends (M24) for a birthday celebration with a couple friends of his that were in town. For context, we all went to the same small high school together, so we already knew of each other but my roommate and I weren't close to his friends.  Everything was going fine at first and everyone was getting along well with each other, but one of the friends -- we'll call him Visitor (M25) -- was definitely on the quieter side. However, he would randomly bring up weird comments about how popular he was in HS (my roommate even called him out for it a couple times).   Fast forward a couple bars later, and we're all much drunker and rowdier. I thought Visitor and I were getting along just fine and had been chatting throughout the night. I had made a comment that I didn't know what his personality was like because he was so quiet. He told me he is a shy guy and takes longer to open up. We played ping-pong as a team and were even chest-bumping, basically acting like we were BFFs.  10 minutes later, Visitor makes a huge scene in front of the entire group saying that I'm the most disrespectful person he's ever met in his entire life and he doesn't want to see me ever again. WHOA. He's looking around like everyone should understand what he's talking about, but no one does. Everyone is as shocked and confused as I am. I found out later that my roommate had even said to our friend right before the outburst that she thought we were hitting it off. LOL.  I've been known to be pretty loud and outspoken, especially when I'm drunk, but I've never been told that I've seriously disrespected anyone before. I was actively trying to be nice to him and coax him out of his shell the entire night, which I don't usually go out of my way to do.  After his guests had left, our friend told me that all Visitor had to say about me being disrespectful was that I called him a "p\*ssy" and told him "he had no personality." Out of context, these sound mean, but 1) they hadn't been said maliciously or together, and 2) we had all been poking fun at each other the whole night. As I mentioned earlier, my roommate had also been giving him sh\*t, but he had no issue with her.  Our friend said that I had nothing to worry about and that this guy's reaction was out of left field. Visitor never took anyone aside or said anything  about how he was feeling up until he blew up at me in front of the whole group. Based on what people from our HS have said about Visitor, he thinks pretty highly of himself and doesn't know how to interact with women that aren't actively trying to get with him (when we first met up, he was super eager to boast about a random girl who had bought him a drink the other night). After I left, Visitor apparently even tried to change his flight to the next available one because he was "so disrespected."  Even though my roommate and our friend sided with me, the whole situation still blows my mind when I think about it.

My boyfriend, (33M) will sometimes call with things that can easily be explained thru text. It's been a problem in the past. Today, there was an actual emergency that required my attention... however, I was working with a client and didn't feel my phone go off (I keep it on vibrate while I'm working.) When I checked my phone, I was met with several missed calls and one very passive aggressive text message ("Well it's important. But I guess it can wait til too late") As soon as I realized, I called him back. He was pissed from the get go, and now he's just angry because of some unknown (at least to me) reason, and when I ask what his problem is, he refuses to tell me. Apparently, I should just know.

14w9m8	Me (30M) and my wife (29F) bought our first house after getting married back in August.   I've had a few issues with my sister in law here and there but she's always been really judgmental and kind of "rigid" Basically, she's had many struggles in her life but feels the need to constantly blurt them out. While at dinner once with her family, she tells me stuff like "No one came to our house when we were kids. Ours was the house we didn't want anyone to see." Currently, their family is doing well. My childhood wasn't the best either (I was poor until about 8 and had various mental/developmental issues)   So a few months ago before we closed on the house I was at my in laws house and showed them the listing. My MIL and FIL both congratulated us. My SIL however just rolled her eyes and went "What? Why do you guys need so much space?"  Fast forward a month later, I get a new car. I'm with my wife, MIL, my wife aunt, and of course my SIL. My MIL and wife's aunt are curious about the new car so they want me to show them some of the features, I show them the light show and cameras (It's a Tesla). As I continue my SIL pulls them away and says "Enough, no one needs to see your new toy..." I felt extremely disrespected. Furthermore, we all went to lunch and I covered the tab to which my SIL kept asking my wife why I did so and was complaining about it.   **For the record, I find those that bash on others for their success to be very toxic and I have cut people out for that. I can not stand people who do this. Not limited to people doing this to me but watching them do it to others.**   tldr: My SIL is a condescending miserable person that can't stand to see others happy and bashes them for success.

ivve2tvd	The oldest daughter is straight-laced and is doing the whole get married and have a traditional life.  She places a lot of emphasis on her upcoming wedding.    My youngest is the opposite.  While I don’t agree with some of her choices.  (She likes to take hallucinogens)  travel and, I guess, to be a modern-day hippie.  She likes the term digital nomad.  She’s an adult. She pays for her way of life.  There’s not much more I can do.   Oldest kicked my youngest out of the wedding party.   It’s because my youngest has eloped with her boyfriend.   The guy is about 10 years older than her. Divorced with 2 kids.    I think what set my oldest off is that her fiancé comes from money, and the wedding will be stupid lavish.   However, my youngest husband has a lot more money, and he wholeheartedly supports my daughter’s artistic temperament.    The oldest is being told by her in-laws that her sister doesn’t have the same family values as what she’s being married into.   My oldest has banned her sister from the wedding and says she’s going no contact with her sister over her lifestyle choices.   I told my oldest what done is done.  She needs to grow up not expect everyone to live by her lofty standards.  She also needs to stop being jealous of her sister, or she might as well make her wedding dress green.    Now she has banned me from the wedding.  My husband isn’t going to go now that I’m forbidden, or his other daughter is forbidden.    My oldest is going on a rampage on social media, talking about how her dad refuses to walk her down the aisle at the wedding.  I told her she was playing the victim for no reason.

ivuh2zzj	On Christmas my boyfriend went out of town to his family, called and said he got me a gift. I couldn't believe it and was really happy. I asked him twice did he really get me a Christmas gift and he said yes to come get it. I asked again did he really get me something and he quit responding for the next few days. He comes back and said the gift wasn't expensive but it was nice. So he comes home a few days later and we meet up. I ask for my gift and he says he left it at home and I have to remind him next time. We met up a few more other times after and still nothing, he "forgot" every time. During the time, I got him a gift because he said he got me a gift. I didn't have enough money on Christmas but promised I would get him something in Jan. I got the gift early because I really wanted to surprise him. Still, 6 days after Christmas no gift. So I just came to conclusion he didn't really get me anything because he stood silent when I would ask for my gift. I ended up giving his gift away to my sister, someone who actually got me a gift. I told him I got him a gift but gave it away and he's still so salty about the fact that I gave his gift away. Weeks later he is still mad at the fact I gave his away.	1642812525.0	s9pva5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9pva5/aita_for_giving_my_boyfriend_gift_away/	AITA for giving my boyfriend gift away
8vspqrst	AITA-I house/dog sat for a friend this week. I also do this on the Rover app but this was separate. She did not tell me she has cameras in her home. She has two dogs that I was watching; a 5 month old Samoyed puppy and an older husky. She stated she would pay me $80 night when my usual rate is $120/ night for house sitting. I charge this amount as I need to board my own dog when I house sit, breaks my heart but I need the income. She stated in her very detailed list of directions that “the dogs could be left for 4 hours, 5 hours max and the puppy in her crate”. I left the house for 5 hours and 20 minutes and she lost it on me, that’s when I realized she was watching me on cameras. She became very malicious and nasty towards me via text. Now she is stating she will contact Rover to report me (again, this wasn’t on Rover), she is going to contact my exam department to become a physician assistant and tell them I lied on an application, and tell all of the neighbors that I babysits/house sit/dog sit for that I neglected her dogs and left them alone “for more than 5 hours.” I’ve only been friends with her a few months and she’s very aggressive in a lot of instances. None of my friends care to be around her as she is an angry drunk. Am I the asshole for leaving the dogs for just over, probably 20 minutes over 5 hours? I really don’t know what to do bc #1 Rover is my source of income. #2 I could lose my chance at taking my Physician Assistant boards which means the last 10 years are a waste. #3 I love the families I care for-their kids and their dogs are so sweet and I would hate to lose them from my life. This person is scaring me. So unkind. Am I the Asshole for leaving her dogs longer than she had directed me to? Am I in the wrong here?   Update; after a lengthy tumultuous texting back and forth she found someone else to watch the dogs and I was relieved of my duties. I refunded her the difference.	1642813248.0	s9q447	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9q447/aitadog_sitting_nightmare/	AITA-Dog sitting nightmare
ivxtx0b2	So my GF and I have dated for just barely 3 years. She has met my immediate family and but she has never met my extended family.  So we have a tradition where once a month my grandmother hosts a Sunday dinner for the entire family at her estate. We all show up and if you’re old enough to use a stove you cook.   My girlfriend has never attended until very recently, the first time she did was in December prior to Christmas. This is because my grandmother would prefer to not have non family and partners that haven’t been around for a while present.   When she attended in December, I got word that my grandmother didn’t approve of her choice of clothing and won’t welcome her back if she doesn’t dress better. My aunt told me that grandma thought she dressed, “whorish”. Now I fully disagree and so did my family and my aunt. My girlfriend was admittedly dressed slightly less conservative than the other women but I wouldn’t call what she was wearing immodest at all.  So I told my girlfriend and asked her if she would dress more conservatively next time. So come January the dinner is this Sunday. I wanted to not have a repeat of what happened last time as I want her to get FaceTime with my family.   I asked my girlfriend to show me her dress before this weekends. She did and the dress was less conservative. Again, it wasn’t immodest, but just less conservative and I know it’d piss my grandmother off again. She said no as she really liked the dress and it was modest. I told her that what’s modest to her isn’t going to be what’s modest to a 89 year old woman. I told her if she wanted to buy a dress I’d pay for it.   She refused. After some arguing she proved that she was not going to budge. I told her that I’d she didn’t change it would be better if she just not show up and we try to find a solution for next month. She then said she wasn’t getting a different dress and I told her that it’s best she not come and I’d go without her.  She told me I was being unreasonable and putting an old woman’s outdated views over her freedom. I feel like I was being very reasonable.

ivxz1i9y	I'm 14 and I live with my dad and stepmom. My mom passed when I was 5, and my dad and stepmom got together when I was 9, and they got me to move in with my nan. 2 years ago my nan had a stroke, and she had to go to a nursing home so I moved in with my dad and stepmom.  Ever since my dad and stepmom got together I couldn't spend time with just my dad, my stepmom had to come too. I always got the vibe she didn't really like me so I had no idea why she always wanted to hang out with me. It made hanging out with my dad really awkward.   When I moved back in with them it got worse cos every time we were having a conversation she'd come in like "what are we talking about?" and just join in the conversation even if it had nothing to do with her. If she could she would stand or sit in between us too.  I mentioned it to my dad a couple times and he said he never noticed and he doesn't think it's true that it's every time, he was like "it's her house too, she can hang out with us if she wants." I don't think it was getting through to him that it was *every time* and it was weirding me out.  So next time she did it I was like "hey why do you always come in and join every conversation I have with my dad and stand between us?" and she laughed and said "oh I'm just a bit of a jealous person" and when I asked what she meant she was like "I get jealous when my husband spends time with other girls."  I told her that was really weird and I'm not another girl, I'm his daughter. My dad and stepmom keep insisting it was a joke but it really creeped me out and I can't help but take it seriously. I asked her to stop butting into our conversations and she was like "oh so I need your permission to talk to my own husband in my own home?" which is definately not what I was saying at all.  Now my stepmom is acting all hurt and upset and my dad wants me to apologize for hurting her feelings. He says I deliberately overreacted to her joke just because I don't like her and I was taking any excuse to be mean to her and exclude her. But I really feel like it was a weird joke to make even if she didn't 100% mean it like that, and I think I have the right to be weirded out by it, plus I think I have the right to ask to spend some time just with my dad and it doesn't mean I'm trying to exclude her.	1642814394.0	s9qhlh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9qhlh/aita_for_taking_a_weird_joke_my_stepmom_made_too/	AITA for taking a weird joke my stepmom made too seriously?
wa6qz	My wife and I have two young children below the age of two, and when the first one was born we decided to let all of the grandparents pick what they wanted to be called. We assumed that they would all pick something like pops, nanny, or meemaw. All of them pretty much lived up to this expectation besides my MIL. She is insisting on being called Abbi or Abuela.   I could understand this if she, her husband, my wife, or ANYONE in the family had any Hispanic heritage, but we are all super white. My wife's family is third generation Irish and they still take trips back to Ireland to see their cousins. And I'm from deep enough in the South East that my family doesn't even understand what Abuela means.   We have been living very far away from both of our families for the past few years, but we are moving back to where my wife's family is from in the coming months and this is going to become more of a problem.

She’s been attention seeking and aggravating, she is always making comments about herself wanting people to compliment her, like saying “I’m so ugly”. She also keeps sending bad pictures of me and T to a server we are in, we have told her to stop multiple times but she keeps going. I’ve tried to distance myself before but I got messages from her boyfriend telling me to just tell her how I feel about everything going on with her. I took his advice and told her how I feel, it ended with me comforting her because she kept saying “I’m sorry I’m a bad friend” over and over.

ivzw8odd	This is a long but juicy read.   Context: I (21F) live with X(22F) Y(20F) and Z(20F). Me, Y and Z have a solid friendship and never fight or cause drama, but we have all found living with X incredibly difficult. She starts unnecessary arguments, is passive aggressive and treats Y like dirt - she constantly puts her down and makes horrible comments about every aspect of her. The day X came back home in September, Y sat outside on a bench for two hours, too scared to go in.  X has her own issues and has OCD, which is why we let most things slide. I am pretty much the only one who ever confronts her (which is rare), as my housemates are very conflict-avoidant.  A couple of months ago, a traumatic event caused me to fall into the worst depressive episode of my life. After spending Halloween in a crisis home, I dropped out of uni and moved in with my parents to get back on my feet. Although I tried my best to hide it from my housemates, I know watching me get so sick was really tough on them.  When I moved back in and was slowly but surely recovering, X told me I had been selfish “letting them see me like that” and went on a rant about how hard my situation had been… for her. I asked if I’d ever done anything bad or taken it out on her, and she said no, but that “my energy was harmful”. Then, the cherry on top of the cake: “when you left and moved back in with your parents, everything got better. It was like a weight just lifted off our shoulders”.   I was absolutely distraught. I was still in a very vulnerable place, so hearing those things was devastating. Things stayed tense between me and X - I decided to ignore her until she apologised (I am stubborn and that is definitely a flaw of mine) but the apology never came and she never attempted to speak to me.  Yesterday, I told her that I’d waited for an apology but that I knew I wasn’t going to get one, and that I would rather just be civil to each other for Y and Z’s benefit and move on. X launched into a rant about how it was in fact me who owed HER an apology for ignoring her after the argument. I realised two minutes into talking to her that she was never going to accept that she’d said anything wrong. I knew that it would be easier if I just apologised… but I just couldn’t bring myself to apologise for having a perfectly natural reaction (I think?) to the abuse she had hurled at me. Furthermore, I never said anything negative or insulting beyond calling her selfish - I said nothing I regretted and nothing that (I believe) would warrant an apology.   I know that she probably lacks basic empathy skills - she comes from an extremely privileged background and is very spoiled so it’s not surprising that she’s used to getting her own way. But I KNOW I’m being stubborn by refusing to bend to her will and apologising to ease tensions. Am I the asshole?  P.S there are a lot of details that I had to omit due to word count so let me know if you need more information.	1642816376.0	s9r4vw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9r4vw/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_housemate_after/	AITA for not apologising to my housemate after she said my "energy was harmful" during my depressive episode?
iw1yan9x	 My boyfriend  (24M) and I (23 F) have been together for 4 years now. We started dating at the beginning of university, and we are now both out of school and are trying to save to eventually buy our own home. We both live our parents separately at the moment (makes sense for us financially) , but when we were in school, we lived together. The adjustment for me has been hard to say the least, but not for him. My boyfriends family is well off and do plenty of things together, where my family tends to work individually. My boyfriend is also very frugal, and will do anything to save a buck.  I find he depends a lot on his parents, especially when it comes to things like going out, or dates.  For example, during the pandemic it has been hard come up with things to do, (in Ontario, we have lockdowns every second month still). I often suggest my boyfriend and I go for a drive and get pizza, or have a movie night with Chinese food, or in the summers go golfing, as these are the only things open at the moment. When I mention going on a date, I have full intention to pay for the activity, and by no means do I expect my boyfriend to pay for the date fully, as we are trying to save money and he knows this . My boyfriend will ask his parents every time if they would like to join us SO THEY WILL PAY FOR OUR NIGHT. For example, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to have a movie night and get some Chinese food. Later that night I get a text from my boyfriend saying his parents would like Chinese food too and for me to meet them for dinner. Afterwords, we all sat down and watched a 3 hour movie, where as I was intending this to be a nice night with my boyfriend. The one night I thought we could try playing a round of golf, where he again invited his parents to take us golfing, because he didn’t want to pay for it. Although I appreciate it, it seems to be getting out of hand and I’m not comfortable with it anymore. Not only does having his parents pay my way constantly make me feel absolutely horrible, I am also tired of spending every date night with my boyfriends family. Recently, my boyfriend and I had planned our first trip as just the two of us out of the country to Florida. We have our flights booked and my boyfriend informed me today that his parents are now coming with us and will cover the costs of our flights, after I insisted on paying for my own vacation.  Whenever I bring this scenario up to my boyfriend, he says I am ungrateful and I instantly feel even worse. Am i the asshole for wanting to go on a date without his parents?	1642816676.0	s9r82x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9r82x/aita_for_not_wanting_to_go_on_dates_with_my/	AITA for not wanting to go on dates with my boyfriends parents?
i50vnh6c	My brother (16m) wasn't home this evening so I (14f) played his xbox in the basement.  He has forza and I like driving around and painting the cars in it.  He always paints his cars black and paints the rims black too which looks dumb, so I paint them a lot nicer colors and put stickers on them.  So what made my brother mad, he didn't care that I painted his cars, was that I did online races and was talking to a guy.  He sent a friend invitation and I accepted it and he also gifted me a couple cars that must be really good and a Jeep because I said I really like Jeeps.  I don't think I did anything wrong, if the guy sends a message or something my brother can just say his sister was playing.	1642817386.0	s9rgen	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rgen/aita_for_playing_my_brothers_xbox_and_adding_a/	AITA for playing my brothers xbox and adding a friend with his account?
50qyjq7	So I boarded a plane and  sat in the window seat assigned by the airplane company. To get to it, a couple sitting in the middle and aisle seats had to get up to let me get in. When boarding is finished, the woman sitting next to me turns to me and tells me to feel free to move to a different seat if I want. It's clear that the translation was "please move so that I can be more comfortable " and it did not sit well with me. I explain that I haven't slept well and need a window seat so that I can lay my head on the wall. She says no worries. Then a few seconds later her boyfriend says a passive aggressive comment supposedly directed to her but meant for me. He said in a loud voice and angry tone something to the effect of "as if the row right behind us doesn't have an empty window seat".   I turn around and I see that a lot of rows do really have empty window seats. I got angry and uncomfortable and started second guessing myself and thinking if I was an asshole for not moving. At the same time I felt that moving is something that should be a personal decision and I should not be guilted into it, and it is not their right for me to move. I reasoned that if they feel so strongly about social distancing they can split up for the duration of the 3 hour flight instead of pressuring me into moving by fake niceness orders or by saying snarky remarks.   I got really uncomfortable and felt awkward and decided that they should be in the same uncomfortable position. So I turned to them and said you both are clearly uncomfortable. I'm okay with moving but only after you take permission from the flight attendant. The girlfriend now gets embarrassed and says: it's okay you can stay, but the boyfriend says okay I will talk to the flight attendant when she comes by. He found himself in a predicament because if he does that he would sound weird for asking for me to be moved and he would risk being labelled as a racist because I am brown so he just decided not to do it and we sat together for the rest of the flight.   I felt that being caught up in the emotions of the moment might have clouded my judgement.

8omos6uo	I don't know how I would be the asshole in this situation, but maybe I'm just a narcissist. So my friend hates whenever I argue with her, but she actively tries to shut me up and prove me wrong whenever I say something she doesn't like/agree with. Like if I say I'm ugly, she says adadadada, nope. And constantly tries to shut me up whenever she thinks shes right or if she thinks what I'm saying is stupid. It genuinely pisses me off when she does it, but I don't usually say anything. One time I told her I won't shut up, cuz she'd get mad if I did that to her and she just left the call. She'll even leave our call if I say something totally opinionated and she disagrees. When I don't disagree, she leaves and tells me she won't come back until I agree with her. Now, today when I said something about the youngest girl to get pregnant, I said she was like 2 or something. She didnt believe me, so I searched it up. When I searched it up, and found out that the youngest girl to get pregnant is 5, told her that I even have proof and she got mad at me, left the call and then started to tell me I have a problem. She told me that I'm not always right, and that I have to get it through my head. And right now, it seems the other way around. I know its childish as hell, but seriously. She insults me over a stupid argument that neither of us should be mad over. I wasn't really mad until she insulted me. I don't understand why this is a problem. I'm probably being a huge asshole and narcissist here, so please just tell me if I'm the asshole or she is	1642817917.0	s9rmmq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9rmmq/aita_for_proving_my_friend_wrong_in_an_argument/	AITA for proving my friend wrong in an argument?
unhh704	 Sorry this a novel but bear with me. I (20F) have been with my partner Chris (19M) for 3 years. We’ve had a happy relationship and I love him a lot. Because I love him and want what’s best for him, it really bothers me when I notice people taking advantage of him. Chris is always willing to help anyone without expecting anything in return, and rarely ever confronts anyone when he feels like they have done him wrong. Because of this, a lot of people feel like they can use him. And they do.   After Chris and I graduated high school, Chris moved out into a friends house. Chris’s new roommate(24M) (also acting as landlord) very quickly started to mistreat him. He would charge Chris “maintenance fees” that were all clearly BS, talk trash about Chris behind his back, and even occasionally hit Chris’s dog, even when Chris made it clear that he wasn’t ok with anyone hitting his dog. I was infuriated by all of this, but Chris refused to say anything because he “didn’t want to make things complicated.” He paid all of the roommates fees, and never said anything. In fact, after Chris moved out, he texted his roommate and apologized for “not being as friendly as he should have.” Naturally his roommate accepted his apology, and didn’t have anything to apologize for, and is now even engaged to Chris’s sister.   Despite me begging him to move into an apartment with an actual lease so he couldn’t be taken advantage by a roommate again, Chris now lives with his best friend (19M) and best friends dad (60M). His best friend doesn’t pay rent, even though they live in HIS house. and instead of the dad making his son pay rent or just covering it himself, he went to Chris and asked him to cover that part of the rent, as well as his own. This has happened twice. Chris went broke for a period of time because of this and I had to pay for his gas and groceries. I was irritated, but Chris said it was his best friend so he didn’t want to say anything.  I could go on and on, but those are the big examples. When his coworkers started bumming rides from him w/o paying him gas money, I snapped. I told him I was tired of him letting everyone walk over him. He said I didn’t understand the importance of giving grace. And because of him giving grace, it will help those people draw closer to Jesus (my boyfriend is very religious.) I told him that giving grace and letting people treat you poorly are two different things. He said that I was being a jerk, and I didn’t know what these people were going through or why they were acting the way they were. I could tell I hurt his feelings. I totally get where he’s coming from, but I think that you can show grace and be a nice person, but also set firm boundaries with people and stand up for yourself.

cc01mjh5	So recently my roommate rescued a kitten from outside. She immediately fell in love with it and decided to keep it. She scheduled its first vet appointment and told me and our other roommate she was planning on keeping it before discussing it with us/asking if it was okay/asking for our input. I brought up my frustrations, and she is mad at me because she doesn't think she needed to ask for permission to bring a cat in. I tried expressing to her that I would not have told her no if she came and talked to me about it, but that I just view asking beforehand as a way of showing respect for the other people (and animals) living in the house. She told me I was being a controlling friend because I was upset about it, and that I turned a situation she was excited about and made it about me. I really am just disappointed that she would not ask us, especially because she and I (and our other roommate) are all very close friends. I am now just confused by the situation and need some opinions.

ivx22stf	I (23f) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (25m) for 9 months now. My bf and I live together but he still spends a night by his parents once a week. He says it's to spend time with his little sister Anika (16). Anyways their relationship is really weird to put it. His sister will call once a day and they'll spend about an hour on facetime talking, her mom might not buy her something then she asks my bf and he'll buy it for her, he'll call her bubs, etc. But I think the weirdest parts are how they act with each other and i'm only seeing it now that I go with my bf whenever he stays over at his parents. Anika steals whatever of his she can get her hands on, & practices makeup on him. My bf will just allowed it and he turns so childish with her, it's embarrassing. They toss insults back and forth and play fight too often. He also has a bad habit of cursing that he seemed to pass onto Anika which is just sad. One time she asked him to grabbed her a kitkat as he was going to the kitchen to get something for himself. He ends up returning with one of those small sand pales filled with kitkats and dumped it over her head and her making it worst by throwing some at him in retaliation.  Well earlier, Anika had posted a bad pic of my bf for her friends to see and when she showed my bf, he threw a pillow at her. The pillow knocked her phone out her hand and fell on her face. My bf just snickered while Anika gave him the middle finger. I followed my bf to the kitchen after that and finally called him out on it. Basically I asked him if he didn't think what he was doing was weird for a grown ass adult. I told him he was childish to still be acting the way he does with his sister and that it was embarrassing to watch him bully someone 9 years younger than him. He got really upset about it and called me an asshole for trying to make him feel bad for his relationship with his little sister. That isn't true and I told him as much and that I just want him to act his age. He's ignoring me now but I don't think what I did was wrong.

iw22xr18	At the start of this new year, I decided that I was going change my spending habits and start budgeting to spend less and save money.  I decided that my family and I were no longer to going to spend money on eating out and focus on home cooked meals only  I have a son and we have been a one income family for the last four years because of childcare but now my boyfriend has a steady income.  We were living paycheck to paycheck and werent able to save as much as we wanted to as a one income family but now that my boyfriend works, we can start focusing on our financial goals. We need to save for a car, downpayment for a house, braces for myself and my son, paying off student loans and and definately setting up an emergency fund. This year, I really wanted to be smart and start saving money for the future. OK so now am I the asshole? My sister is having her first child and asked me if I would like to contribute 140 dollars to her taco catering for her baby shower and that I could pay her 35 dollars a month if that were easier for me. I let her know that I felt that 140 was a little extreme for tacos and I didn't want to pay that much for food. She proceeds to tell me my older sister is giving her 140 as well for the taco catering and her friends are contributing more than as well. She also told me 140 is not even a lot of money. I told her that 140 is a lot of money to me and I don't have that kind of money to spend on her taco catering and that there cheaper food alternatives for her baby shower that wasn't so expensive. She then tells me her friends don't have money like that either and they have mortgages and car payments but they are more than happy to contribute. My sister make twice as much money as me and she lives comfortably and does not worry about money. I didnt even have a baby shower when I was pregnant with my first because I couldnt afford one. Long story short, she's upset that I won't give 140 for the catering. Personally, I would rather spend the 140 on baby gear. Spending 140 on tacos is not even including the cost of gifts I plan to buy as well. Am I the asshole for not wanting to pay 140 for tacos because I feel its out of my budget or should I just make the monthly payments.	1642819231.0	s9s1qh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9s1qh/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_catering_at_ny/	AITA for refusing to pay for catering at NY sisters baby shower?
3gwf1iei	So my friend, we’ll call her Lily, asked me to patch a hole in her jeans temporarily until she can get it done professionally. Said hole, was on her bum and she was desperate, took me just a few minutes with very little denim colored floss. (It was a small one but still visible from afar) She was very thankful for it. I’ve known Lily since I got here (moved may 2021) and we are juniors in high school. I have been embroidering since 4th grade and I just love doing it and consider myself to be pretty skilled at it.  Now a classmate acquaintance heard about this. She asked me if i could do two large long rose patches on the side hip part of her jeans, with quite detailed and complicated with multiple colors and it would have used significantly more time and floss to complete. Im not talking less than an inch, its going from hip to mid thigh and very colorful and large. And i barely know this girl, not even her name just that she sits across the room from me. She never even spoke to me at all before this. I said it’d be 15 dollars. She scoffed and told her friend who told the teacher who then telling me that that was rude and its not like im a professional or anything and im so full of myself to try and charge for something that takes five minutes. I let it go and she is mad at me, saying i didn’t charge Lily so why would i charge her.  This piece would take 5 days up to a week. Im not sure anymore cause im not a professional, just been doing this for a while. I don’t know if i should have just done it for free or something or just flat out said no. I would have been happy to do it, maybe charging was taking it a bit too far?

crn5btn	Back story parents passed away in November from a horrible accident. Family friend started a go fund me for funeral costs and then what was left would go to youngest sibling. Younger middle brother decided he was going to be the boss so to keep the peace I kept my mouth shut. He made me cut a lot of corners planning the funeral so he could pocket the money for the youngest sibling. Well fast forward to this week we didn’t have a headstone on the graves yet so I asked my siblings when we were doing that we had over $8000 out of the go fund me and the headstones were $2335. Middle brother told me I was greedy and money hungry also that headstones aren’t part of the funeral costs and if I wanted them to have one I would fork out the money.   Woke up this morning to a text from middle brother saying that I shouldn’t contact him or his family again and I am toxic for pushing to have headstones. Now grant it this was out of left field bc we all celebrated Christmas together and just had a baby shower for the sister in law.   AMITA for thinking the go fund should have been used for what it was raised for and not for middle brother to pocket? Or the fact that he’s dictated when we could and couldn’t go spend time in our parents house.	1642819381.0	s9s3mt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9s3mt/aita_for_thinking_headstones_should_have_been/	AITA for thinking headstones should have been covered

iw2kmev5	Involved in this story is Me(F35) my husband(40m) our daughter “Lola”(F), our Nanny “Mary”(F38) and her husband “Joe” (40?m)   When I was pregnant with Lola I spent 14 weeks on bed rest and my husband hired Mary to basically be “me” while I couldn’t. She was an angel and quickly became a part of our family, she was with us when Lola was born and I really saw her as a sister/best friend.    We have never had any issues with Mary, she’s always been great with Lola, so sweet and loving. Lola has only recently started to speak a few words and because of this Mary is one of the few people my husband and I trust to take care of Lola for over nights etc.. Mary’s resume included a whole host of previous childcare positions and childcare eduction.   A couple of months ago, Lola was chatting away and mentioned “Mommy Mary” I wasn’t too concerned because she has very limited vocabulary and I know that multiple childcare providers can be confusing for toddlers. A few days later the “nanny phone” was vibrating constantly in the drawer and driving me crazy so I got it out to turn it off and saw the notifications were instagram comments and one said “Mary you and your Lola are so cute” I was kind of confused, we have an agreement with Mary that she doesn’t share Lola on her social media and we also follow each other on instagram so I know she doesn’t post her, so I opened the comment to see a photo of Mary and Lola, from an account I didn’t recognize.   After going through the profile I found out that Mary had a secret instagram hidden from her friends and family where she pretended to strangers that Mary was her daughter. I was completely disgusted and freaked out. My husband and I went straight to lawyers and the police and filed a restraining order against her and my husband wants to press formal charges, although I’m not sure what they could charge her with.    I know we are not in the wrong for this but her husband recently messaged me explaining that Mary has been suffering from infertility issues and a miscarriage about a year ago triggered her and that’s when she started the profile. He said that she never meant any harm and that she truly loves Lola. I do not want to drop the restraining order but it does mean she will likely never work with children again. I’m torn because I don’t want to be responsible for ruining her career when she truly does love children.

booay1nq	I (F19) grew up Mormon and my parents are very strict with the church rules and ideologies(using fear as a way of raising us), causing me and half of my siblings to stop going to church due to the trauma linked to it. My parents aren’t happy about it and are constantly commenting about our family not being together in heaven(among other things) and just making us feel guilty for leaving.   My brother (M25) who is still Mormon, just got married a few weeks ago. He and his wife had a normal wedding ceremony for which I was a bridesmaid and afterwords went to a Mormon temple to get “sealed”. For all that don’t understand Mormon lingo, it’s basically a Mormon wedding that means you’re together for eternity not just until death.  I am technically still Mormon just “inactive” as they call it. I am in the process of getting my records removed but my parents don’t know that. Because my parents still have hope I will come back to church, they invited me to the ceremony at the temple after the wedding and reception. Besides the fact that I was tired from the wedding and had just recovered from COVID, I really did not want to be near the temple for my own mental health. Plus, I wouldn’t be allowed past the foyer anyways because I haven’t been going to church.   Going would mean a 1.5 hour drive each direction to just sit inside in an uncomfortable environment (or wait outside in the cold) just to congratulate my brother and his wife when they exit the temple. I figured congratulating them when they got home or the next day would be fine. Obviously my parents did not agree.  I argued with my parents about going even up to an hour before they had to leave because they thought I should still be there to support my brother. My brother told my mom he didn’t want to make anyone come if they were uncomfortable but she didn’t care. I ended up not going because I stood my ground. However, my mom has given me the cold shoulder since.

iw3okn35	Throwaway account. So this issue has been coming up for some time now, in our old apartment my husband kept forgetting to lock the door. Fine, I’d remind him to do that but would just end up locking it myself cause he’d usually forget.  Now we’re in a new apartment that has a security guard, but the problem has escalated to him straight up forgetting to close the door entirely, sometimes multiple times a week. Once there was even a shoe still in the door so it was even more open.   He leaves early in the morning and I’m alone and sleep naked, and the guard isn’t gonna constantly be at the front desk (bathroom breaks, shift changes, what have you). So I’ll wake up to find the door just open, lately its been happening a couple of times to a few times a week.   I feel extremely unsafe and vulnerable when he does this, and this sort of absent mindedness could cost us our possessions or even something to happen to me. I feel like this is just a really simple, basic security thing to make sure the door is closed, and all he ever says is that he’s so sorry it happened and that he needs to set up a system of reminders to make sure he does it. Anyway today it happened again and I got to a point where I said if this keeps happening I’ll consider going back to stay with my parents for a while - I was getting really freaked out and may have overreacted in saying that, but it feels like this is becoming a habit, and we’re not always gonna live at a place with a guard so what would happen then? I shouldn’t have to have my safety compromised in this way by my partner and I should be able to trust him to do such a basic thing!  And maybe if I’m not here the lesson would hit harder if he came back home and realized he’d left the door open all day.   To add to that, he went out with his friends after work and it’s already past 10pm so I’m guessing he’s gonna just come home late instead of trying to sort this out with me, which is just pissing me off even more.

iw3vmn6x	My mom is pretty and my dad is not good looking. It was not something I even thought about but one asshole went through my insta found pictures of me with my parents and then started make fun of me for being a child of rich ugly guy and his trophy wife. It was really awful and a lot of people made fun of me and  even my friends would casually poke at me about it. I defended  my parents because I knew that they loved each other.   I have not really talked about this with them but I am close to my aunt and I was whining about something that happened that day. She said they were idiots but I was old enough to know that it was kinda true. She told me that mom was reluctant to go out with him at first and then did convince herself to go out with him because he was rich.   I feel like such an idiot, I thought they loved each other and I was so confident about it. I was mean to a lot of my friends and it is true, Their marriage is a sham. I really fucking hate this. That night, I was kinda quiet but when dad asked me why I was so quiet and I don't know I just expolded and yelled at them about what aunt had told me. I said aunt had told me how their relationship had actually started and It had fucked me up. Mom looked guilty and I knew it was true, I have not been talking to my parents. I know my parents are really sad about this but I just feel like an huge idiot who couldn't see what was before her. I feel so horrible, I really wish my aunt hadn't told me this and I just feel so fucked up right now.	1642821830.0	s9svdt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9svdt/aita_for_getting_my_mad_at_my_parents_after_i/	AITA for getting my mad at my parents after I learned that their marriage is a sham?
davd1ovd	My cousin is 38F and im 26F.  Cousin recently had a health scare-colon cancer runs in the family and her colonoscopy showed some bad results. Thankfully it’s not cancer, but she had surgery to remove polyps and it freaked her out that she didn’t have any last wishes written out. We had a talk over zoom where she told me that she’d be leaving everything to me in her will (I’ve been here beneficiary for years now) because she wanted me to follow her last wishes and they would make her parents/brother/boyfriend upset if they’re still alive when she dies and “all my money and stuff will make up for all the crap you’ll be stuck putting up with.” She laid it out that her parents/brother/boyfriend think she’s nuts for wanting to be cremated and have “all or at least most” of her ashes be spread at a beach. She also said I’ll be her power of attorney if she can’t make decisions for herself one day and went over what she’d want in that case too. I just said “okay, but try not to die anytime soon, I like you more alive than as dust on the beach!”   Her boyfriend doesn’t live with her, but was there when we were talking about this. He must have been listening because he flipped out and said “we’ve been together for 4 years and you don’t trust me?!” My cousin said she was choosing me because I’ve never said anything bad about cremation and she was worried he would just bury her if she left it up to him because he wants them “together even when they die” and she wants to “spend eternity on a beach somewhere nice.” They started fighting and she said we’d talk more another time and hung up.   The boyfriend texted and asked me to talk to my cousin. I said no. He said “you don’t need to convince her, but you can’t tell me you know her better than I do or that you care about her more than me.” I responded that he needs to stop texting me and sent screenshots to my cousin. He texted me and said I was “a rude child that doesn’t understand how important things like this are.” And then got my cousins parents involved and they told my parents who are now telling me I’m causing family drama and being a jerk for not even being willing to discuss the whole thing with my cousin again. My aunt and uncle said I’m just in it for the money because why else would I make everyone unhappy by doing this.	1642822292.0	s9t0g3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9t0g3/aita_for_being_the_executor_of_my_cousins_will/	AITA for being the executor of my cousins will?
iw3kg00e	I (31F) has a beautiful 6yo daughter “Ruth”. I have no sisters so my best friend from high school, “Jess” is the closest thing Ruth has to an aunt. Jess recently got engaged l; I am the MOH and she also asked me if Ruth would be her flower girl. I said yes, knowing there would be some costs to all this. I fully expected for pay for both mine and Ruth’s dresses/shoes and maybe her hair, and also a manicure and makeup for myself if so required. Based on other weddings I had stood in, I budgeted what I thought was an ample $900 for all of this: $500 for my dress (including alterations) and shoes, $150 for my hair and makeup, $50 for a manicure, about a $150 for her dress and shoes, and another $50 *if* she needed to have her hair done; I didn’t think this was super necessary bc I could curl her hair myself but if Jess wanted a specific style I’d allow it.  We’re about three months from the wedding and Jess texted everyone on the bridal party asking us to Venmo her for the 50% deposit to confirm the hair/makeup stylist. The total was $170 each, so a $85 deposit, which I felt was a little expensive but whatever. She didn’t say anything about  a price for Ruth’s hair so I assumed she wasn’t expecting that; I was relieved about that part so I sent her the $85 for myself. Like 10 minutes later she texted me, “Thanks but you forgot the deposit for Ruth!” I was like okay what is the cost of Ruth’s hair I’ll send the 50% right now. Without rehashing a lot of back and forth, she was expecting $85 for Ruth to have a full hair and makeup! I was like what? In what world goes a six year old need $170 worth of hair and makeup done for a wedding? She ultimately explained that not only did she expect Ruth to have both her hair and makeup professionally done, she wanted her nails done too! I pushed back and said I thought it was ridiculous that a SIX YEAR OLD needed full hair, makeup, and nails to stand in a wedding. This wasn’t disclosed when I was asked, and I said if that was her requirement I expected her to foot the bill. I would pay for her hair as I thought that was semi-reasonable, but makeup and nails was on her. She said that is standard and didn’t think it warranted a separate discussion. My husband thinks I’m being absurd over what’s amounts to and extra $200 but I think it’s the principle of it. I almost want to tell her at this point to pay for it all - she wants my kid to be in the wedding; why should that cost me money to begin with?

89guunvh	My (32F) grandma (94F) passed away at the beginning of the year. She lived with my mom’s sister (let’s call her Kara) and her husband (let’s call him Paul). My mom has 5 other siblings. Only my mom and Kara are local. Everyone else lives in another state or abroad. We have extended family that live nearby.  At first, Paul and Kara said that the funeral would be open casket. A few days later, Paul texted the family group chat said that the viewing would be for immediate family only (no extended family). And the funeral would be closed casket. And no one would be allowed to take photos. And no one could touch the body. If the non-locals wanted to see my grandma, they could call himself or my aunt.  My mom was pretty upset since she wanted to take a photo to keep for her own memory. I personally don’t understand why she would want that, but it’s pretty important to her. She requested permission to do this from Kara, but Kara refused saying that she didn’t want to disrespect her mom by having photos of her dead body circulating. My mom countered saying that she was also a daughter and wanted one last photo of her mom and it was for her private collection. My mom isn’t active on social media and isn’t the type of person who would circulate private stuff like this. After much arguing, Paul gave her permission to take one photo, but said that no one else could.  A few days later, Paul texts the family group chat saying that the viewing would only be available for 10 min (originally an hour) and no one will be allowed to do video calls to pay their last respects. Half the family was disappointed (the o ther half was silent) and individually tried to reason with him. He didn’t budge.  A few days later, he messages the group chat saying that the viewing is now closed casket (what’s the point of that?) and the casket will be locked and only he and my aunt have the authorization to open it. He also said that the person who he gave permission to take a photo (my mom) can no longer do that. He also said that the requests they received to be able to view the body were disturbing and morbid. (They weren’t) He said that anyone who deviates from the program will be escorted out by security.  Mind you, this isn’t even his mother, it’s my aunt’s. They paid for the funeral (they refused my parents offer to split the cost). No one in my family has ever been disrespectful to a deceased person. Or caused any shenanigans at an event.  I originally wasn’t planning on attending the viewing portion, but now I want to just to video call with my non-local family so they can pay their last respects. (Even if it’s just a closed casket viewing now) i supposed I could get thrown out from the funeral home, but I’m don’t care anymore.  TL;DR: My aunt’s husband changed his mind about the viewing and is preventing 85% of our family who live far away and cannot attend the funeral from paying their last respects. I want to video call them during the viewing despite his explicit instructions not to.	1642823188.0	s9taa8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9taa8/wibta_if_i_video_called_my_family_during_the/	WIBTA if I video called my family during the viewing prior to the funeral?
iw329yhj	AITA for calling the comps on my elderly neighbour over dog sh\*t?     Me: 30F single mom of 2 youngsters, Elderly Neighbour 70+M (Ed) , Landlord 40+M (LL)     I feel like I'm losing my marbles over this one & currently I am not backing down but I'm looking for an unbiased independent opinion on this one so if you'd care to please read on. Thank you.      I've live in this apt  about 6 years now. Over that time I've been dealing with Ed, who I feel is narcissistic, progressively less to full on ignoring. Lots of creepy behaviours, if not for a few convos, I would just chop up to "clueless old man". The events that changed it was during one of his very long, drawn out convos, where he'll try to keep you despite best efforts to leave, he said "you know, I don't actually care about these convos, I just try to see how long I can keep people talking, toy with them, I just enjoy trying to see how much of their time I can waste"...I was shocked. Just nodded, politely said goodbye, & decided that I wouldn't be manipulated like that by him again. If I didn't want to talk, I wouldn't, if I did & wanted to leave I'm walking away. Full stop.     Later on he's outside blocking the back door entrance (most used & close to my unit) so all who pass HAD to engage him, I just kept walking. I get past him &, he called me a "B\*tch" under his breath. That was the final straw, I ignored him & all the other weird attempts to screw with the building patrons (removing the shared outside hose during summer, posting gross passive aggressive notes on his door, one directed at a neighbour who died, stealing the recycling bins, smoking in hallways all day etc) & just lived my life.      Until last night. I went to do laundry (in building). Put a wash in, went back upstairs. Later I go down to check on it, as I walk through the hall I see Ed peeking out of his unit looking at me then pop back in when he sees me looking at him...I enter the room & immediately upon entering the room it STANK. I go to the washing machine to check on the load & notice the timer has more time on it than expected... I open the lid & to my absolute HORROR there is a semi washed piece of dog sh\*t starting to mix in with the rest of my laundry. I'm guessing there were more pieces that fully dissolved due to the colour of the water & "floating" bits...     I'm absolutely disgusted, horrified & pissed off. I call the cops, I don't expect much but it'll help when I fully go after Ed for the damages, either the pro cleaning cost or the replacement cost.   The cops managed to get Ed to confess by some miracle. Apparently I'm a "menace" & I "deserved it" for being a "stuck up b\*tch". Ed called our LL who then called me in a rage, yelling & screaming at me, calling me over the top & deluded. I told him I'm not backing down, hung up, sent him the photos of the washer & silenced my phone. The clothing is in a garbage bag on my patio till I have time to ask a pro.      AITA, am I over reacting? Should I seek a different path?	1642823347.0	s9tby0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tby0/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_elderly_neighbour/	AITA for calling the cops on my elderly neighbour over dog sh*t?
d6c71bh9	Decided to tell my dad about a funny story where my mom took me to a restaurant to get brunch, saying it was a super popular place but when we got there, it was a dumphouse and the food was horrible. Both me and my mom found it funny at the time but today when i was telling my dad about it i accidentally said “fancy restaurant” instead of popular. I stutter alot and i admit it was my fault. Mom swiched up and started getting mad at me saying “dont switch up the story!! If youre going to say it say it right!” It was kind of annoying because it was a simple stutter that i couldnt control and i apologized for getting it mixed up. I tried to keep telling the story as my mom kept attacking me so i told her to tone it down a bit and that i am just trying to tell a funny story- still confused on why she was mad. Eventually she started calling me annoying which i responded with “im just trying to tell dad a funny story! I dont know why youre so mad, this doesnt have to do with you either” i meant that last part as a way of trying to tell her that i wasnt making fun of her for taking me to the place as i am very greatful that she took me there, just that i found it funny how popular it was because of the horrible food (macaroni in litteral warm water:macaroni soup) so eventually i shed a few tears of fustration because  1. I  didnt even get to finish my story and 2. I was getting attacked over a stutter Mom carried on to say that “this generation should be more grateful” i left to my room speechless.

gdjmm5b9	I've been in a living arrangement since mid October 2021 where I rent out the second bedroom in my landlord's house for $500/mo plus $150/mo for utilities. I've always paid in full and on time.   I haven't been able to work since December 27th - just a few days shy of a month - because my landlord got a positive COVID diagnosis and my works policy is that you can't work when you or someone in your household has COVID. Once they are negative and you get a negative test, you have to wait 3-5 days to return to work. He only just got a negative result the other day, and I get my test to clear me for work tomorrow.   When he first got sick, he (verbally, no written record unfortunately) told me he wasn't going to charge me the $500 in rent, since I couldn't work because he was positive, and just asked that I pay the utilities, which I did. Now, he's saying since I'll be working again soon we'll need to talk and figure out when I'm paying the $500 for January rent. He's also expecting me to pay the standard $650 for February.   My mother has instructed me to tell him I won't be paying it and has said she's willing to pay to take him to court over it if he tries to make me pay it since I couldn't work because of him and cannot afford to pay double rent this month and get by. I admit I don't know if I have any legal grounds to not pay (we're in Illinois) but I don't feel I should have to given the circumstances.	1642823451.0	s9td7k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9td7k/aita_if_i_refuse_to_pay_rent/	AITA if I refuse to pay rent
bz6zhsm6	Important information: My(14f) mom’s boyfriend has lived with me and her for about 2-3 years. They’ve been together for 4-5. He has a son, 13m.   Story: Me and my moms boyfriend have been getting closer for the past year or so. I see him as a father to me, and I know he sees me as a daughter.   However, my brother (his son) is very possessive over his family. Whenever I go near his father, he’ll hug him and tell me “this is MY dad.” As well as other things, I guess in attempt to state dominance. Yet, correct me if I’m wrong, but I feel I have the right to be upset about that.  However, the problem now comes in when I want to call him dad. Everybody says he isn’t used to not having both parents, even though it’s been about 5-6 years since his parents divorce. My brother gets very upset when I spent time with his father, and I’ve been told just to not push it further than it must be, as it’s hard on him.  I still see my brother as a brother, though. In fact, even though all of the moving around, I’ve never felt a family situation I’ve loved quite like this. But, I’m worried that I’d be an asshole to my brother if I do call his father dad as well, as he seems so against it.

hd9ucy1k	I (F/24) has know Ash (F/24) for 5 years when we worked together. She moved with their 2 kids 4 yrs ago.  Turns out she moved back! We make plans twice to hang out & both times canceled. She messages me asking if I can watch her pets & kids bc her landlord is coming over. I said, "My apt is having some work done &  I'm not allowed to have more then 1 pet but maybe we can work something out" She says, "well I just scheduled it for Monday so I will be there Monday, so figure it out" This was very rude but I let it slide.  Monday comes, I put her pets inside. She said she wanted to go out, so us & her kids go to a mall. Then entire time she's talking about how she has no money and wishes she could buy this and that. She's a SAHM and both her and her husband are living off his retirement money, (he's a bit older then us).   We decide to come back to my apt as soon as we got in the car she says, "oh I wish I had a pizza, I don't have money for pizza" I thought this was werid & just ignored it. When we were getting the kids out of the car she said, "yeah my kids would love pizza but I don't have the money". We get inside and her kids instantly start getting into things, dumping water, and causing a huge mess. She doesn't do much to stop them, kinda laughs it off. I wasn't really mad about this bc they are kids and I expected them to be curious.  She starts talking about how her and her kids NEED pizza and starts showing me a ton of ads for pizza. At this point the only thing she'd talk about is pizza. As she's showing me the ads her husband texted her that they were all done. She also starts having her kids beg me.  She gets clearly frustrated and asked if I would by her pizza. I said, "isn't your inspection done?" She said it wasn't & they are really really hungry. We hadn't been having out for long and I've offer her and her kids food. I said that I already ate and she's allowed to have anything in the fridge. 'Suddenly', she says the inspection is done & starts going to the car. We walk out to her car, she confronted me about not buying her stuff or pizza. That it was really rude to 'invite' her over and not buy her stuff ESPECIALLY since she has kids and I should have put her kids first. I said, "well maybe we can get pizza next time" just bc I wanted this to be over so bad.  She got home and messaged me about the inspection & how she will probably have to have me watch all her pets & kids with her again at my apt & will give me 24 hrs notice each time. I said, "well maybe we can just hang out one day for fun" she said "maybe idk about that" at this point I stop opening up or replying her messages. She has now over the past week sent me 20+ messages about how I need to run her multiple favors. She keeps saying she really needs me to do this. I feel really bad, but I also feel like I'm just being used. AITA for now helping her even tho she might be kicked out if I dont?	1642823859.0	s9thth	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9thth/aita_for_not_helping_a_friend_in_need/	AITA for not helping a friend in need?
e3t6vyb8	My dad left my mom when he found out she was pregnant. Between then and now, my mom abused me, my grandparents got custody of me, and both my mom and my dad only saw me 3 times a year until I was 15 then a text was good enough. Now to the story at hand.   My boyfriend of 6 year FINALLY purposed last week. I excitedly told my parents and my knew she would only be in the audience. My dad on the other hand said he was so excited to walk me down the isle which really confused me. I told him he would be walking me down isle. My grandpa would be because my grandpa actually raised me. My dad of course pitched a fit and is now not talking to me. Which isn’t really effacing me because we never talked in the first place.   His side of the family is saying I just need to let him walk me down the isle because ‘it’s been his dream to walk his oldest daughter down the isle’ well it looks like my youngest sister will be the only daughter he will be walking down the isle. But I do feel bad because he is my dad. So tell me Reddit AITA?	1642824305.0	s9tmz2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9tmz2/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_dad_walk_me_down_the/	AITA for refusing to let my dad walk me down the isle?
ccqa1sjl	So to start I do photography as just a hobby. Nothing to serious right now. I really got started as a photographer for a wrestling promotion. I told them I just wanted to practice and if they liked my work they could pay me and I would do all the promos for wrestlers at the shows for free.  Well I eventually move to another state to help care for my grandmother full time as well as the house and animals. I haven't done any photography here and my boyfriend can tell that I've been a bit depressed lately and knows photography cheers me up.  He let's people from a wrestling promotion he's part of letting them know he got the promoters permission to come by on future shows and take promo pics for them at my cost per choosing.  I decided on $5 unedited photos and $10 edited or a bundle deal of 2 unedited and 3 edited for $30. Well this guy messages back saying he doesn't like that I'm charging because the last photographer did it for free and he doesn't want to pay for the photos. This other guy messaged before my boyfriend could and told him he didn't have to get pictures from me if that's the case.  Well I told my boyfriend if the guy does end up wanting pictures that I'm gonna add on an asshole fee for him not wanting to pay someone trying to make some extra money. His reasoning is that it's bullshit that I could potentially make more than him that night when I'm not getting paid by the promoters but by wrestler who want new and updated pics for their fans to see.

gywewxxj	The title might look a bit confusing but let me explain. This Christmas I wanted merchandise recently released by a YouTuber so I sent a link to my parents and said I would like it for Christmas this year. The day of Christmas came and I was greeted with brand new hoodie branded by the YouTuber, I was super excited and thankful. It's now been a bit since then and recently I got my mom a new mouse because she needed one for work, while I was on her computer setting it up I noticed a file that had the same name as the YouTuber. Out of curiosity I opened the fine and saw the exact same designs as my new hoodie. Being confused I asked her why she had this on her computer, she replied with "That's how I had the hoodie made for you." Now after hearing this I was actually pretty shocked and upset so I just went to my room. Now before I make myself look like a spoiled brat I just want to say that I specifically wanted the official merch so I could show support for the YouTuber who is currently dealing with cancer. The sad thing is the day I got it they told me it was real so they had just flat out lied and didn't care. Even after explaining to them the reason behind it I'm still being called selfish and ungrateful even though I'm trying to help someone else who is suffering from something horrible.

chgsf7b1	   So I (15f) have social anxiety (I'm not so anxious around my mom, sister and dad) and my father(53m) doesn't understand that he just tells me social anxiety doesn't exist and he was shy as a kid too, I try to tell him that being shy and social anxiety are not the same thing but he doesn't understand.  One day my father randomly walked up to me and said he signed me up for a singing contest I didn't know what to do or say I just started crying. He called me a crybaby and a drama queen and told me I had to do it I just ran to the bathroom and locked myself inside and had a mental breakdown, when I got back outside he started screaming and scolding me I just ran away to my only friends house, and told her everything she understood cuz she has social anxiety too.  when I got back home (around 8 pm) my dad was watching tv he turned it off and told me I had to sing I told him I just broke down and told him I hated him and never wanted to see him again and locked myself in my room.  its been 3 days since and my dad wont talk to me unless its about the singing contest and I've started to feel anxious around him and try to avoid him but I still feel kind of bad since he seems quite mad whenever he talks to me.	1642826475.0	s9u9ye	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9u9ye/aita_for_telling_my_father_i_hate_him_and_never/	AITA For telling my father I hate him and never want to see him again
apy2ov7a	Went out with a few friends for dinner the other day. I don’t have a lot of friends so it’s quite important to me when I have the chance to. Asked my gf a few days before and she was okay with it, but asked when I’d be home. Told her we were having dinner and probably a few drinks after so quite late would be my guess. The day comes and I end up having a quite busy day at work (but she knows I will be home late since we discussed it before leaving for work) but I send her a text just before leaving for dinner about other stuff to which she replies. It didn’t require an immediate reply so I decided I’ll reply to it later in person since I am in a hurry. At around 21:30 I get a short hello? To which I reply promptly. She replies passive aggressively that she is going to bed and nothing else (usually means she is mad).   AITA for not keeping her consistently aware of my whereabouts and ETA? Why not just ask me when I’ll be home before she’s already decided to be mad about it?

h3oua3qn	Throwaway account. Names changed for anonymity. Ok this might be stupid but it’s been grinding my gears all day. I work in an office-type setting with several employees sharing a common floor with a common kitchenette.   There’s a toaster oven that is clearly labeled “Johnson-team use only” that was purchased jointly by the Johnson team at work, which I am not a member of. My cubicle neighbor Veronica, who IS a member of the Johnson team, was swamped at work. She was taking calls all day and hadn’t eaten lunch so I asked her if she wanted me to go heat up her meal. Veronica very appreciatively said yes so I walked over to the toaster oven and popped in her food.   Thirty seconds later, Ms. Johnson, the leader of the Johnson team, came up to me standing in front of said toaster oven and asked me kind of tersely if I had read the sign stating only Johnson-team members could use the toaster oven. I said yes and explained I was heating up Veronica’s food. She again quite sarcastically asked me if I had read the sign, implying I was having difficulty understanding the rule. She then told me that since I did not chip in to purchase this toaster oven that I should not be using it no matter what.   Realizing that she wasn’t accepting my explanation even though I made it clear I was simply doing my friend a favor by heating up her food, I removed the half-heated meal and returned to Veronica’s desk. I can’t help but feel that Ms. Johnson was just being petty. After all Veronica is on her team, DID pay for her part of the toaster, and I was just trying to be nice.

d6skg56l	I (15F) have a (19) brother and he very often is arguing with my dad and grandmother.  Ever since I was young I remember hearing my brother arguing with the adults in my family, verbally, physically, through a window, a door, 1 am, with police, I think you get it at this point.   As I got to an older age (12/13) everyone would start to include me on the arguments and would ask me advice on if they were right or what to do.   Ever since my brother reached 17 these arguments have gotten out of my range meaning I have no idea what the hell they are talking about for example: his license, I had no idea how any of that worked at age 13 and I didn’t care.  But as I started getting more involved and giving my input it seemed like It was just backfiring at me because they would use my words against each other then I would get yelled at the other party for getting involved when I’m just a child.  So when 2022 started I decided to just stop giving my advice by absent mindedly agreeing with whatever they said. I kinda of just tuned them out and would go “uh huh” or “yea” or “oh ok.”   Apparently my dad/grandma brought up the fact I agreed with them and my brother said that I had agreed with him. When I got home from school they let it rip on me saying if I wasn’t going to listen to them I should just say so instead making them feel right  I just said okay I have homework and left. Now a day later and car ride with my dad explaining why I shouldn’t do what I did I kinda feel like an ass.	1642827667.0	s9umod	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9umod/aita_for_agreeing_with_both_parts_of_an_argument/	AITA for agreeing with both parts of an argument?
h6z4ob6n	AITA? My MIL is on a fixed income. For the 10 years I’ve been married, we’ve paid for her phone, insurance and various other things. We’ve paid to get her eye surgery and I got her a reliable car when hers broke down. I found out she asked my husband and his brother to pay off her mortgage so she could have some money to enjoy the rest of her life. I think it’s silly because realistically the house and land will go to the boys in the end anyway. But I make good money and we have the cash so I agreed. But today I heard them on the phone and my MIL was crying saying that in order for her to let them pay off her house they also needed to agree to replace the flooring and repaint inside because she deserves some place nice to live. Now might be a good time to say she’s a hoarder and a chain smoker in the house. And we’ve all spent multiple days getting it clean only for her to trash it again. I feel like I have been generous and loving enough to her. I agreed to pay off her mortgage, which doesn’t benefit us at all but helps her. Now I’m seething with anger knowing she’s not only ungrateful, she’s demanding more. I’m ready to just never speak to her again.

6dq38y5o	To be clear:  It is loud enough that I can hear it from inside my apartment with over ear headphones on.  It's about 11:30pm and this has been going on for an hour now, with this person intermittently revving their engine. This is also a residential area with a lot of students/ medical personnel living near a hospital as well as small families.   I only reported the license plate to the landlord to ask them to ask the person parked to not do this in the future, they usually send out mass texts to the complex for minor issues if they can not identify the individual. (this isn't the first time this has happened, but I could never find the car doing it and IDK if it is the same car, but either way)	1642829320.0	s9v3tu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9v3tu/aita_for_reporting_a_someone_playing_loud_music/	AITA for reporting a someone playing loud music and revving their engine in their car for several hours at night in the parking lot of my apartment complex to the landlord?

My parents are outwardly supportive but the way they talk about it, I think it is just a phase.  My mom was talking about it with her and she said that it was normal to have crushes on girls and everyone found woman attractive. I said that that wasn't true and I didn't find women to be attractive. I said I did notice it when a woman was well dressed or beautiful but it did nothing for me and I never had a crush on a women.   My snapped at me and said I didn't know what I was talking about. She also privately told me not to lie to support my sister? It is weird, My mom has been a bit closed off and less willing to engage in conversations and my sister is hurt.

59vob046	I started making a lot of money lately. 200K to be exact. Its been quite the jump from my last position at 80K. Its significantly higher than anyone else in my family.  During the pandemic I quit my previous job and moved home with my sister and mother. It hasnt been... ideal. But the rule was everything split equally. Rent, food, utilities, ect. Once I got this job my mother has been asking me to pay more in rent. Not to lower my sister rent, just to raise mine since I can "afford" it.   I said no. That I put in equal amount in like everyone else because that was the agreement. She was upset, said she would like to save money because she makes less(she makes 75k). She stormed off and ended the conversation. But now there this passive aggressive tone when anything comes up money/rent wise.  The whole environment has gotten worse lately and Ive been planning to move out. I was just hoping to save a little more beforehand.  Im worried shes going to do this for the rest of my life as I move my career higher. AITA for saying no?

dx57hkf7	Throwaway account and hopefully people I know don’t recognize this.  A bit of background: I have 3 roommates, all of which I’ve been friends with for several years now since we’ve started college. Some I admittedly consider closer than others. My family is half not-American, and so I have a very direct connection out of the country and with that culture. My mom lives out of the country, and so does every other part of that side of the family.   Recently, one of my roommates (we’ll call him A) and I have been planning a trip for spring break to go out of the country and stay with some of my family. Room and transportation would all be covered, so all we would need to pay for is plane tickets. I also invited another one of our friends (we’ll call her B) along for the trip. I’m very close with both A and B, and my family is a-okay with them visiting and staying.   Now here is where my problem starts.   My other two roommates just got back into town just as our semester is about to start up. My 2nd roommate (we’ll call her C) asked us at dinner what our plans for spring break are. I said that A, B, and myself were planning on going out of the country. She seemed very excited for us and asked if she could come along. I was a bit hesitant and said that we’re not 100% sure yet because COVID could potentially shut down our plans, and also because I would need to ask my mom/family about more people joining.  To be honest, that’s a part of it! But also, I just kind of don’t want her to come with us.   C is not a bad person by any means, but I’m not nearly as close to her as I am with A and B, and she has her own... quirks I guess. She grew up mostly as an only child, and kind of expresses herself as “spoiled” for lack of a better word. She’s a very picky eater, expects things to go her way a lot of the time, stuff like that.   I’m very very hesitant to invite her on this trip because I don’t want anyone to be made uncomfortable due to her very outspoken preferences. I also don’t want her to be uncomfortable or upset if the trip doesn’t go exactly her way. I don’t want to have to constantly be expected to accommodate her with language, food, destinations, etc. when the entire point of the trip is for us to kick back and maybe hit some bars and what not. Again, I don’t think she’s a bad person by any means, but I really don’t want to put in the effort to plan a bunch of destinations or day trips (A, B and I are pretty go with the flow and haven’t planned any sight seeing things), have my family worry about food (C has a lots of allergies, dietary stuff, and a very picky eater), etc. At the same time though I feel like if I don’t extend the invitation, she’ll feel left out or as if she’s not our friend. We all just have different preferences and ways we do things, and I don’t want anyone to be stuck in a situation they don’t enjoy.

1bbjkatf	I know how the title sounds be here me out.    My fiancé does not work, to be honest we don't need her to. I work in the USA and we live in Mexico, I cross the border daily, leaving my house at 7am and getting home around 7:30pm 5 days a week. She was working for her mom until March 2021 but she asked if she could quit due to her mother's attitude, that story is a whole different post.   When she asked if she could quit her promises were; clean house, laundry done, dinner and my lunches made for work. On my days off I help with laundry, I do the dishes every night and take the trash out as needed. Also in the mornings I clean any mess our dogs make.   On to the issue, this morning when I left for work I asked my fiancé to please do some laundry since I needed a specific outfit for work on Saturday, by specific I mean my uniform shirts.  She did do that and she did do more loads of laundry, tonight while getting my clothes ready for work I asked her if she knew where my brand new sweater, that she gave me as a Christmas gift and only wore 3 times, was because I wanted to wear it tomorrow. She answered in the washer so I went to put it in the dryer, when I noticed that there was bleach stains on one sleeve.   She claims it was an accident and had a  "it is what it is"  attitude. While I was [am] genuinely annoyed about it, because like I said, it was a gift I literally wore 3 times.   I feel like I might be the asshole for getting annoyed because let's be honest I'm lucky to get my clothes washed for me whenever I ask. However she's not working, I give her spending money every 2 weeks, I'm paying for 90% of our wedding in November, and honestly she didn't even wash whites that could have explained the bleach.     We're not fighting over this, I'm just annoyed and wanted to know if I'm justified or if I'm an asshole.	1642832170.0	s9vwvr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vwvr/aita_for_getting_annoyed_at_my_fiancé_for/	AITA for getting annoyed at my fiancé for accidentally bleaching a new sweater?
8ygvx3tl	I told my dad about my relationship with my current boyfriend on Christmas Day (I know really great present) he was of course surprised and pretty sad and worried since I am the firstborn daughter and the last expected to get a boyfriend. But I am already 18 (I was 17 when I told him) and I can do some decisions with my life now (please note that my dad is also really strict and did not really let me go out to hang out with friends which I don’t really mind now, it’s whatever.)     Well a couple weeks go by and I tell my dad multiple times that he’s going to meet my boyfriend two days after my birthday and that I was only going to invite two of my cousins over. He said that it was fine and that he had to meet him eventually but he also mentioned that he was nervous on meeting him. Well when I got home from work on the day before my birthday party my mom ends up telling me that he invited my aunts and uncles from his side without even telling me or asking me anything. Even though it’s my birthday party. This gets me pissed because for the last 6 birthdays I’ve had my dad never ever invited anyone over to celebrate and now that imma bring my boyfriend he decides to finally invite people over. I have not confronted this to hi yet and if I do confront him about this he’s just going to get mad and make excuses on how his side of the family is going to feel left out if we don’t invite them. And somehow put the blame on me since he never ever wants to admit that he’s wrong.    He does not care on how I feel about things, he has always have cared about what his family thinks and it’s been pissing me and my mom off for years now. I just wanted him to talk and get to know my boyfriend for a little bit since my dad is very judgmental and his family is as well and I really did not want to put my boyfriend in a uncomfortable situation yet with my dad’s family. But now we both have to get through it together now and hope for the best.     I literally want to yell at my dad because what he did was not right in my opinion but I also don’t want to yell at him because then we are both going to be mad at each other for the rest of the day and I don’t want him to get mad and moody when my boyfriend comes over. I feel like I’m in the right but then also considering my dad’s feelings he is probably scared that I’m finally growing up and experiencing some new things now. Since I know that he would have never let me before. AITA for hating him and not wanting to talk to him at all? I know that I just turned 18 and I’m still young but this is my first real relationship and I’m actually being open about it to my parents and my dad pulling this up got me upset.	1642832442.0	s9vzel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9vzel/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_dad_for_inviting_his/	AITA for getting mad at my dad for inviting his family over when I told him he would meet my boyfriend
68se7l2d	Right so my second eldest is trans. He is still trying to find a name that he feels comfortable with. We have had 2 names so far and now they have found a name that they really like.    The first name was Willow but they didn't like how feminine it felt ( I believe they chose that name to placate me as that is what I originally wanted to call them), I called them Will to see if it helped.   The next name was Bloody. I was not happy at all with this name and I did tell them that but said I will use the name. After a while they they did agree it was not a good name.    Now he has found a name that he really loves and we like it as well.  Now the issue I'm having is my friend thinks that I'm an asshole for letting him change his name so often and that it's disrespectful to the trans community that he keeps doing so.

iwa3k06o	So my(40F) son (16M) recently snuck out and got drunk with friends. Obviously I'm not happy about it, but he got an Uber home and admitted to his dad and I what he did. Here's the thing when you're raise a teen, a lot of them go through rebellious stages when they're in high-school or in early twenties. It's part of growing up. He's never gotten drunk enough where he had to take an Uber home before so this is a first time thing. And honestly I'm glad that even with peer pressure and fear of getting in trouble he still decided to do the responsible thing. He had drove his car to a friends house where they got drunk and didn't trust himself or anyone else to get home safely. So he called and Uber. The next morning before I even noticed his car was missing in the driveway he confessed to everything and apologized for sneaking out. Now his dad (46M) and I are divorced and when he told his father his dad was understably upset. And said as punishment we should not allow him on a trip with his friends that they've all been saving up for since August. Now don't get me wrong, I don't agree with his actions but he's been looking forward and putting work into this trip for a really long time. In my opinion seeing as how this is the first time he's done this, and he made responsible decisions I don't think his punishment should be that harsh. Every child needs discipline but sometimes you have to give your children room to make mistakes without harping on them. Too strict parents, just make sneakier kids. I talked to him about what happened and told him I'm expecting him to call me and not sneak out next time he wants to hangout with his friends. And im trusting him to do that. And alot of times with teens you have to give them a reason to trust you before they give you a reason to trust them. Obviously if this happens a again I will deal with situation more seriously but eventhough he made immature actions I'm more focused on the mature actions he took later that night regardless of being drunk. When I told his dad that I was still going to let him go on the trip he blew up at me and said that I was enabling this behavior and he was just going to do it again. And to be honest my son might, but I feel like as a parent sometimes you have to give your kids second chances. Other wise they feel closed in and trapped, and that just makes them act out even more. His dad has been speaking to family members and now everyone has their opinions about it.

e1jubths	me (50 female) my son (14, male)   My son recently moved from his old school to a new school, and he can't quite catch up with his studies. He spends quite some time talking with his old friends using the app "discord" during the week. Therefore, I have restricted him from communicating with people from his old school online from Mondays to Fridays as I want him to catch up with his studies in his new school and meet new friends. After following this rule for a few months, I  realized that he still spends way too much time socializing with people from his old school and playing video games with them. Therefore, I have restricted him from socializing with people from his old school and playing games for 1.5 hours on weekends. He seems very distraught about this and seems upset about this, he now always gives an attitude when talking to me.

I never really developed any solid relationships with my dads family. I got engaged on Nov 2. Thanksgiving morning we decided to see my dad's family. As soon as we walked in, my aunts demanded that we announce we're engaged. I was uncomfortable, but my fiancé assured me that it was okay so I said something like  "This is  ___. We got engaged a few weeks ago and the wedding is set for Month day year." In Dec we were trying to figure out budgeting for the wedding. My dad kept pressuring us to ask his family for money, but we both told him we would rather focus on starting payments ourselves. My dad was insistent but I said that we don't want to *ask* for money. We're fine paying for things if we need to, and if someone *offers* we'll be grateful. He got huffy but dropped it. On New Years, one ofhis nieces announced her engagement. When I saw my mom I made a little offhand comment along the lines of "I don't think Dad's side of the family is gonna be helping us with the wedding now that they have hers to help with" This side of the family has a history of planning things on or around the same time as me even if I let them know years in advance. I'm not upset it, because like I said I'm not close to any of them. Anyways when my dad got home we talked about what we would sponsor for her then he asked if we were going to ask them to sponsor anything for my wedding. I told him that I still don't want to ask for sponsors, especially now that she's getting married too. (Dad) "that's not fair. You can't exclude my family like that" (Me) "I'm not trying to exclude them, but I know they're a lot closer to her than they are to me, so she's gonna be their priority." "But I want my family to be a part of your wedding" "They can go if they want, but I'm not going to beg them for help" "I'll ask them for help then." "I dont want you to do that." "How are they gonna be a part of the wedding then" "Like I said they're welcome to go" "Your mom's cousins are gonna be sponsors" "Because they offered. I'm not gonna turn down offers, but I'm not gonna beg for things either." "You just hate my family. You always do this just because you grew up with your grandfather and not my family. If my family cant help then you cant accept help from anyone else. Including your grandpa's family" My grandpa died when I was eight, and it hit me really hard. He was my best friend. Most of the sponsors I've gotten for the wedding are from his side of the family because I grew up with them.  My mom thinks I should've just told him I'd ask his family, even if I wasn't going to, just to make him happy. My fiancé agrees that we're not going to ask anyone to help, but we're not gonna turn down offers either.   So reddit, AITA?	1642836753.0	s9x41d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9x41d/aita_for_not_including_my_dads_family_in_my/	AITA for not including my dad's family in my wedding
iwa4lmng	Throwaway: I currently run a session of D&D for myself and 7 players which started in early January 2020 (great timing I know). Because of that the campaign has been sporadic in it's meeting due to lockdowns, scheduling, etc. Despite this we have kept the game going in no small part due to the effort of Dave(Fake) who generously provided a location to play D&D at, his empty office. It was this location and his help setting up a video chat for players who couldn't play in person that allowed the game to continue. Without Dave's generosity and resources we wouldn't have been able to play. I was grateful we still could meet and play a game we all loved. However I started to notice issues. Dave played in another game of mine held online. His character started to become apathetic, downright hostile toward other players, even at one point trying to derail the who entire campaign to implement his "master plan" which would have ended the campaign and instantly, with no rolls needed, made him the master of everything. Eventually it got so bad that once that game concluded we agreed as a group not to include him in the next game. In the main game his character began developing the same personality, he would actively antagonize other players tricking them into fighting each other. He would say he was just playing his character and that they needed to "play their Allignment". But still it got worse and worse. Entire sessions would get derailed because he started a fight for the fun of it. He would get angry any time a ruling didn't go his way. If any of his plans didn't succeed exactly as planned he would scream out "Planning and strategy don't matter". I'm not without fault in this, I run a high fantasy campaign and the players are all pretty powerful, especially Dave. I feared if he didn't get what he wanted he would leave the campaign. His actions are getting worse, other players are beginning to fight amongst themselves in real life because of his mind games. I'm worried if I don't do something the game might die. I try to say something but I find myself holding back, trying to justify his actions to prevent conflict. Yet when another player is doing something similarly disruptive I find myself not holding back, asking them to correct their behavior. I see that double standard, and I don't want it to continue anymore. But maybe his actions are justified, maybe the other players do need to learn to separate themselves from their characters. And maybe I as a DM need to ensure they play their Alignment more? Or maybe, I feel like I have to justify his actions because the alternative is confronting him, potentially losing the location we play at. We will have another location coming at the end of the year. Would it be wrong to just let his disruptions continue until we get a new place? Is it wrong to only let him stay in the game because he has a nice place to play at?	1642837129.0	s9x725	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9x725/aita_for_wanting_to_remove_a_player_who_has/	AITA for wanting to remove a player who has helped keep a game going through a pandemic, and WIBTA for letting his behavior continue just to stay at the location until the new one is ready?
aim4rapa	Me (23F) have always struggled with my birthday celebrations because is in January and usually on that date everyone is still on holiday so usually, I never celebrate my birthday.A few days ago my best friend (22F) texted me inviting me to a friend's house because her girlfriend left town and she wasn't want to be alone, so I agreed since was about the 3 of us having a girl's night, the next day I confirmed to my best friend where and how we were going to go to my other friend's house, we decided to meet later that day. I suffer from anxiety and depression and my best friend knows about this, I expressed to her that I wasn't feeling very well emotionally speaking but I was doing my best to put myself together so we can meet, while I was getting ready I received a very important call that led me to stay an hour over the phone and couldn't leave the house on time so I could meet with my best friend but I explained to her why and she just told me that was okay and that we could meet up in my friend's house (my other friend recently moved in and I didn't know how to arrive bc I don't have a car) I told to my best friend before that not knowing how to get to the house alone was triggering for my anxiety for previous experiences and she just LOST IT.  She texted me why I was making excuses and why I didn't tell her from the begging that I didn't want to go to the meeting and how selfish and self-centred I was, since I felt pretty bad I didn't respond immediately to that I just tried to calm her and explained that I was getting ready that I was arriving late but that wasn't a real issue so she didn't need to worry, I have to say that my friend is that kind of friend that is ALWAYS late, so I thought she understood, she was very pissed and told me not to go and a few minutes later sent me a picture of the decoration for my birthday that she and my friend made with the caption: we still love you anyway.   I felt pretty bad bc my best friend ruined my surprise just for the fact that I was arriving late even when I told her why I couldn't make it on time, things escalated very quickly and I told her that for me that was wrong and that you can't ruin a surprise just because I didn't arrive on time, my best friend got very angry and started telling me that I had to accept my mistakes and read all our interaction and notice how rude and uninterested I was about going to my friend's house and that she had to beg me to go, I responded that I didn't know why they wanted me there and that she couldn't just throw shit at me just bc I was late for the first time and she was on time, she didn't like my answer and told me to suck it up and decide to stop whining and go to the party or just keep being a big baby. This made me feel so bad about myself since I told her the hard time I was having just to get out of the bed and that my anxiety was real but she just said that I was making excuses and using my problems just to not go, that hit me so I just decided to not go and ignore her that is why I want to know if AITA?	1642837547.0	s9xau5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xau5/aita_for_not_going_to_my_birthday_party/	AITA for not going to my birthday party?
bc4j407y	AITA For being angry that my partner asks so many questions?  This is going to be long and I'm sorry in advance, I've tried to shorten as much as possible.   Ive (24nb) Been with Partner (24nb) For two years, lived with each other for half a year. I have never once voiced my opinion on this because I'm scared how to communicate it gently. Partner and I are very happy and typically able to communicate very well. Ever since we met I have noticed how many questions they ask, constantly. Whether it's mid movie, mid convo, in bed, out in public.   When I met their parents for the first time, they mentioned this lightheartedly. How their child drove them "nuts" with questions and would ask them the same thing repeatedly. I did not know what to make of this, I am unfamiliar to "healthy" fam dynamics but did get a little bit of a red flag from how they were talking about my partner. Partner has many issues with their parents and childhood. After dinner partner discloses how upset their comments made then, and how they hated that as a child their parents would frequently tell them to "just google it."  As we've moved in together I've realize the true gravity of their "curiosity". They ask me questions about everything, like, "What really makes cars run?" when one passes, and be visibly disappointed when I can't give them the answer. (I'm sorry if some mechanic is upset that idk  i'm a 24 year old english major give me a break) I've never once asked them to "google it" because I don't want them to associate me with their parents.  The boiling point that made me realize i needed input, happened recently w/ something stupid. Around dinner, I made a comment about wanting to try letting my cats run free in the apt at night, bc they are nocturnal. Immediately I dismiss my own idea, because one of our cats yowls loud at night, and I do not want him disturbing our other roommates.  Well an hour later my partner asks me "why are you shutting the cats in here" (our bedroom) Confused, but assuming they just weren't actively listening to me earlier, I say "bc.. they are too loud? I said I wasn't letting them out" They dont respond more than "oh." Finally the point that got me fuming was when at midnight when we are laying in bed, they turn to me and ask "is the bedroom door open?" Frustrated I say no and they ask why not for the cats? I tried my best to control my tone and say slowly and as clear as possible. "(cat) has been yowling since dinner. (roommate) has to wake up at 5am. For the third time tonight, I am not letting them out"  This is a bizarre situation, it happens constantly, multiple times a day. It makes me upset but i've tried to be quiet about it bc clearly they still have issues with their parents about it. I'm definitely wondering if i'm just the asshole for not being more patient. It makes me angry, but then I feel like I am an asshole for disliking something about my partner that I can admit, is pretty weak sauce compared to other potential issues.	1642837648.0	s9xbnc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xbnc/aita_for_getting_angry_over_my_partners/	AITA For getting angry over my partners never-ending questions?
4tcksiwt	Some things changed for privacy because my mom uses Reddit.   I (16F) am an avid reader. I am always reading & buying books constantly. However I have one singular standing shelf and it only holds about a quarter of my books.   For my birthday my parents asked what I wanted, and I said I just want more shelves—floating shelves, because I only have wall space in my room. I got them early December, and I got 8.   For some context, my mom and I have a bad relationship, and neither of my parents are good handymen. My dad always complains about these things, he barely even knows how to use his phone, let alone buy a Drill.   Anyway, when we installed the first four, they just wouldn’t hold. Even my friends parents who work in that field didn’t understand the issue. My mom and I ultimately decided that a certain type of construction glue should do the trick. It’s been nearly two months, and my mom finally got around to buying the glue. We got four of the shelves up properly using some, we just have to get the next four up.   Another thing, I’m very busy. I’m in school and I have a job, and my dad is always working. My mom RECENTLY got a part time job again & started taking online college classes.   I went to her today saying that I just want the rest of my shelves up, that it’s been nearly two months and instead of excitement it feels like a burden. She was telling me that my dad could help me, I laughed and said “No way. He whined about buying a drill for this, it would be a pain in the ass for him to install four shelves. I don’t even know if he knows how to use a drill.”  My mom went on saying that she’s too busy and she’s stressed and doesn’t feel like doing it. I responded saying that she’s not the only one who’s stressed about things, and that she’s finally understanding work stress that my dad and I have been enduring for a long time. She got mad and said once again that my dad could help, I kept refusing.  I feel like I could be the AH for not having sympathy for her.

32zapins	Hello, I've been a longtime lurker and this is my first post!  This is a situation that recently happened and I'm torn about if I'm wrong or not.   So my (F23) parents (F 45, M 48) are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary in the next couple months. They want to take a week long vacation somewhere. Originally, they asked me if I could watch my sisters (F 17, F14) and their 3 dogs because my sisters had school and they are too young to be by themselves for that long. I live/work  full time in a town about 30-45 minutes away from my parents house  with no traffic, but about 60-90 minutes with traffic.    I originally agreed because my sisters are doing online classes (bc of the panorama) and could hang out with dogs. So the plan was that I would go to work, come back and cook dinner and stay the night for the week.    A few days ago, my parents told me that they were bringing my sisters with them now and that they just needed me to watch the dogs. I don't feel comfortable with that because the dogs would be locked into a small room with no access to the bathroom for 10 hours (8 hr workday and at least an hour traffic each way). Imo, that is inhumane. I told them that I didn't feel comfortable and that boarding the dogs would be a better option.   They are really mad at me bc they say they don't have the money to board the dogs and they mostly sleep all day so it's not a big deal and how I am angry and intentionally ruining their trip. I feel a little guilty, but I just don't think it is feasible or good for the dogs to be locked up all day. So reddit, AITA for going back on my promise to house sit?	1642838638.0	s9xkkg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xkkg/aita_for_not_housesitting_for_my_parents/	AITA for not housesitting for my parents
5mtf0xz1	So to preface I’m 17 male and my dad 38 male is currently in prison. We talk weekly and I’m planning on moving in with him and my stepmom to make up for lost time. He’s getting out mid February and his birthday is  February 27. I have an opportunity to go to phx to visit my grandparents (his parents) during a small school break which his birthday falls into. I’m paying with my own money btw. I talked to my grandparents and my mom and they think it’s a great idea. my moms parents and family live there as well It would be a great opportunity to see them all. I talked to my dad about what he thinks and he seemed hurt and said he wants to make up for the last 5 birthdays he spent in prison. I should also mention this is his second time in prison and my mom has been a single parent for as long as I can remember. He’s not exactly the ideal father. I  guess I could see how making a trip after he gets out during his birthday is insensitive. I understand he wants to make up for lost time but at the end of the day he put himself there and it’s not my fault he lost time with his family. it’s a 4 day trip and he’ll survive. I want to take his feelings into account but I’ve never been a priority in his life so why should I make him mine? I know it sounds selfish but we’ll have lots of time regardless especially if I move in with him. My grandparents are getting older and their health is declining. They’re not too bad right now but in a year that will likely change.  I think I have every right to go even if it hurts his feelings . I also just found out my grandpa hasn’t been feeling well, I don’t think it’s from anything serious but he is turning 80 soon and anything could happen.	1642839351.0	s9xqpl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xqpl/aita_for_planning_a_trip_during_my_dads_birthday/	AITA for planning a trip during my dads birthday ?
9abqv1z4	I (30M) have been dating my boyfriend (36M) for over a year now. When we met, in fact on our first date, I told him that I love dogs and that I have two dogs and they’re basically my babies. His initial reaction was “aw, that’s so cute!”  When he met my dogs he acted kind of weird with them, but honestly I did not give it much thought. Fast forward three or four months into our relationship, he casually told me while we were watching a movie (in which a dog appears) “I HATE DOGS” I was stone cold with his statement, he saw my face and tried to fix things by saying “I like your dogs, don’t worry, but I just hate dogs in general”. And after that he has randomly worked that same statement into our conversation a few other times.  After that, a lot of things started to make sense, like whenever he came over to my place he avoided to pet, touch or get close to my dogs. If we were sitting at the couch and one of the dogs jumped with us he said “get them down they have you all the time, I only see you 3 or 4 times a week”. One time when he got drunk he told me “I only tolerate your dogs because of you”. Like, dude, what the actual fuck?!  The next time he tried to complain about the dogs I reminded him that from the very beginning I told them about my dogs and that I love them very much, and that if he ever tries to make me choose between him and them he will loose. He got really offended and told me that apparently I don’t love him as much as he loves me, that they’re “just dogs” and that he is my partner, and that I should not threaten him like that.   I do love him but honestly if he ever tries to make me choose I would choose my dogs over him in a heartbeat.   In fact, his attitude towards dogs, specially my own dogs, makes me second guess our entire relationship, and the truth is because of this I’ve been thinking of ending things with him.  So, WIBTA if I chose my dogs over him?	1642839103.0	s9xoli	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xoli/wibta_if_i_chose_my_dogs_over_my_bf/	WIBTA if I chose my dogs over my BF?
9vlg8lr9	I lost my job during the pandemic and my MIL pressured me to find another one. I finally managed to become an entrepreneur and she isn’t having it this way, pressuring me to get employed and “get a real job” even if what I’m making on my own is waaay better than what I would have expected if I were employed. Anyway, my husband and I asked her to keep it a secret, not telling anyone what I do (for personal reasons), and she promised me to keep her mouth shut. I don’t want people to know what I’m actually doing and I believe that it’s isn’t my duty in any way to tell her what I do but I did it ONLY out of respect for her.  She didn’t have it that way and went to tell all of her friends about me (I knew it since one of her friends came to ask me about the job, how I like it etc, so I told her that I don’t know what she’s talking about since I’m still unemployed, in front of my MIL who passed as a liar, which she actually is, for promising me not to tell anyone and failing her promise)  Since then, I tell everyone that I’m still unemployed, in front of my MIL or not. Not very long ago, she asked me why I didn’t want to say what I did and I replied that it’s none of anyone’s business. Shortly afterwards, my husband asked me to stop saying I’m unemployed (he’s been sent by her I’m sure) because it “doesn’t seem right” I went into a huge fight with him, the least I could call her was “ a cunt” and that “she could go fuck herself” and that she got what she deserved to be embarrassed in front of her girlfriends and to seem a liar and that I shouldn’t step down on what I wish concerning MY job because she couldn’t keep her mouth shut on something I asked her to do, and she promised she would.  Now my husband is mad at me and he wants me to do as she says, but I don’t care.  So please tell me AITA here?  TL;DR: I have asked my MIL to keep a secret and she couldn’t resist but tell all her friends about it.	1642839418.0	s9xraj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xraj/aita_for_asking_my_mil_to_keep_a_secret/	AITA for asking my MIL to keep a secret?
ba8vji3i	Woke up at 2AM to my 2 year old crying, he usually does this and usually my wife and I let him crawl into bed with us. I picked him up and his crying quickly turned to gagging then choking, I knew he was about to throw up.  We are currently staying at my MIL’s house who is very OCD even with kid’s stuff so I picked up my son and ran to the bathroom where he would throw up somewhere that could be cleaned. He throws up, starts hysterically crying, and I start undressing him and trying to calm him.  At this point my brother-in-law is just standing there like a zombie, my sister-in-law and mother-in-law are both coming out and my wife is yelling from the other room wondering what’s going on.  So I start to panic a little because now the whole house is up and staring at me in my underwear while I’m trying to calm my naked son.  I yell over to my wife that I need an extra pair of clothes but she responds asking what’s wrong, I thought I heard my BIL say “choking” but at this point I’m pretty flustered and for some reason I just wanted to get my son calm and dressed first and foremost.  I walk back into the bedroom and my wife asks me again what’s going on, I know I should’ve collected myself a little better and explained what was happening but my son was still naked and crying so frustration took over and I said to my wife “I could use some cooperation right now”  That sentence really pissed her off, we finally got our son calm and back to bed but she’s very upset that I “made her out to be a bad parent in front of her family” and that I left her out of the situation by not immediately telling her what was going on.  Looking back I feel bad that I panicked and lost my composure but now I’m sitting here as the bad guy in wife’s eyes and from my POV I was just trying to keep our son from throwing up all over us at 2 in the morning	1642839556.0	s9xsfp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xsfp/aita_for_panicking_while_my_son_was_choking/	AITA For Panicking While My Son Was Choking?
e3wdgjhv	I’m so sick and tired of it at this point. I’ve always felt like some dog on a leash or something, getting dragged around everywhere because of it. I’m tired of getting called to the living room or kitchen so many times a day to translate something for her. I’m tired of having her cellphone shoved in my face to translate a text AND respond back to it. I’m tired of having to make phone calls for her. Anything that requires reading and talking, she always needs help. And if I don’t know how to translate a word from English to Spanish, she gets mad at me. I’ve offered to help her learn but she always says she has no time. Yet she has time to watch tik tok videos for hours.  She and my dad have been in the US for 20 years, almost 21. (I recently turned 19) I’m an only child. I never felt like I had a purpose other than to translate. She treats me as if I’m some personal interpreter she can call on anytime. When I refuse to help it always ends in an argument, or I get yelled at and name called. She will barely try and says she doesn’t know, then demands I help. It wouldn’t bother me as much if she ACTUALLY TRIED. My dad, who works a lot, has made the effort to learn enough English to get by on his own. He hardly ever asks for my help, and when he does, it doesn’t bother me because I know he’s trying. I look forward to going to work, because it means I get a break from my mother. She was a stay at home mom during my childhood, with no children other than me, so I don’t understand why she didn’t utilize that time to learn more English. Right now, she isn’t working full time, so she has time.  I should mention, she DOES know very basic English words, but that isn’t enough to get by on her own. I feel like I do have some blame, for probably enabling her, but how am I supposed to refuse when she can literally come up to me, angrily, and demand I help her??	1642840233.0	s9xycf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9xycf/aita_for_not_wanting_to_translate_for_my_mom/	AITA for not wanting to translate for my mom?
71kj3bkf	 Okay I’m going to try and keep this as short as I can but give the needed information. My husband (23M) and I (23F) are expecting our first planned kiddo who we very much wanted and are excited for. My pregnancy has been rough in some ways but baby is doing great. I’m 36 weeks and 5 days. And today we went in to the hospital because I thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. I’ve been dilated and trying to keep this little guy in for a few more weeks sense I was 33 weeks.  So we go into the hospital today. I’m more dilated, having contractions that are strong etc. if I was 2 days further along they would induce me at this point. But sent us home because they can’t induce yet sense I’m not “full term”. Needless to say it was a very stressful day for us both. Before they sent us home I got my cervix checked one last time and for whatever reason this last check was PAINFUL. Like brought tears in my eyes, pain lingered after for our drive home. Just miserable. I know it sucks for my husband to see me in pain and not be able to help. We get home and I take Tylenol and go to take a nap. My husband and mom made food and brownies and just all around took awesome care of me. It’s just a matter of time at this point and I could go into labor any minute.  So my husband drank 12 beers tonight and is pretty drunk. A little shitty considering what if I go into labor. But I can always drive. I didn’t realize he drank so much though because normally he doesn’t/can’t drink anywhere near that. Usually 6 and he’s pretty drunk. So when I realized how much he had I said “holy shit you’ve had that much. Let’s hope he stays in there for the night.” My husband then seemed to take this as me attacking him and said I can just stop “laying into him about it”, got really defensive with me and started with how hard and stressful the day was for him and how he  was just decompressing etc. I looked him in the eye and said “I know it was a stressful day” (this is where I may be TA) and then he said he feels like he can’t do anything. Which wtf? I wasn’t attacking him for drinking or anything. He and I have talked about that that I think he needs to be careful how much he drinks and stuff because he does have an addictive personality, but that is not at all what I was saying tonight. And I don’t get after him often or expect him to never drink or anything of the sort. I leave him be to play video games and do whatever Most of his free time. Him saying he feels like he can never do anything has me so pissed off and hurt. I won’t be having someone who is acting like that in the delivery room with me. Am I over reacting?

cte5rndp	I C (f18) have adhd in a family of neurotypical people, because of me being different I was always treated badly and still am as my family doesn’t believe in neurological conditions or anything with mental health. About 10 years ago my cousin B (f32) had my little cousin A. A (m8) was diagnosed with autism my family started whispering about it behind B and A so they wouldn’t hear what they truely thought. Hearing what they’d say was heart breaking about a little boy who can’t help his diagnosis. Recently over the past two years A has been feeling ashamed of having autism and being different (I think he heard someone in the family or one of them said something to him about it.) being fed up with the treatment by the family for me and him being different I decided to start to work with A on realizing that being different is okay and amazing even as he can accomplish anything he wants.

iwbqjzfy	So apparently my entire friendship has fallen apart because of this, so I'm leaning towards I may be the AH but I just want to be sure.   My best friend (or ex-best friend) likes to get photos of me when we're not together, I personally hate taking them it can be triggering due to my upbringing but she insists on new photos all the time. Sometimes, I just can't, so I recycle photos that aren't that old, that she hasn't seen before.    It saves me from getting in trouble for not sending her photos and I don't have to go through the anxiety and panic of facing a camera.   Needless to say she found out and she cut me off real quick (I don't blame her) she told me I ruined us by lying and I told her that her constant pressure made me feel cornered enough to get sneaky, I'm not happy with what I did but it was getting exhausting to keep up with demand.

452u6kb6	I (F 23) have recently had a disagreement with my roommate (F 20) about heat. For weeks my roommate had the heat on 80 degrees and I expressed my discomfort for this multiple times. Finally I asked her to meet me halfway and she proceeds to tell me “I will not be uncomfortable in a place I pay to live.” Which is extremely unfair as if I don’t pay rent here too.   This results in her not speaking to me when I’m in a room and acting like I’m not there. I can admit it hurt my feelings, so I blocked/Unadded her on all my socials. Which I later get a paragraph texted to me about how she couldn’t believe I would do something like that and goes on to tell me “how I’m a terrible friend and she doesn’t deserve the treatment I’ve been giving her.”   The treatment in question is her claiming I’m too involved in her relationship. Meanwhile her and her boyfriend treat me like I’m their personal relationship therapist. They come into my room to have their arguments and make me play referee.

365eol1k	One morning my girlfriend and I had to run some errands. We live in Chicago, and this was about a week ago when we were having snow and ice storms. We were going to pickup a Togo grocery order, stop at the liquor store, and we were going to grab Starbucks on the way.  So, I asked my girlfriend if I drove, would she run inside to Starbucks to get the coffee, because the one she was ordering from didn't have a drive thru. It was early, and I knew she'd be in and out as the passenger. I would drive and handle the other 2 errands. Before we left I saw her putting on sandals and questioned her choice of footwear. She replied saying that it was her choice what to wear, so I let it go. We leave and while we're just walking out of the condo she turns to me, and goes, "oops I forgot to wear shoes! Would you be sweet and run in and grab the coffee?" So, I asked, "how did you forget to wear shoes?" It's 10 degrees outside and snowing! We could see it snowing outside our floor to ceiling 15 foot open condo windows! How did she forget? We had also both taken dogs outside for walks that day. We ended up having a wild argument about it!  Tldr: Am I the asshole for thinking that my girlfriend wouldn't just tell me she didn't want to go outside to get the coffee, and purposefully wore "inappropriate footwear" so that she had an excuse not to?  Now she has made it a point to wear her socks and sandals outside in the winter again and say, "look I forgot to wear shoes again!" Like it's something that happens all the time? Does this happen to other people too? Is she being manipulative, is there something I'm just not understanding, or am I just an asshole?	1642843285.0	s9yovo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9yovo/aita_for_not_understanding_how_my_girlfriend/	AITA for not understanding how my girlfriend forgot to wear appropriate footwear?
6ojlmfkm	My husband (33M) and I (29F) really enjoy playing Nintendo switch together. We recently downloaded Mario Golf Super Rush. Usually with new games I am on the slower side figuring out the rules, controls, etc., and therefore lose a lot when learning. I never get upset with losing because I know I need time to adjust and know it’s just a game.  Last night we decided to play a round of 18 holes. Somehow I magically did really well and actually won the game. My husband however lost. He got an extremely low score which is what I was normally used to getting. He got really mad and starting yelling about how it’s frustrating that he can play a game well one day and then can’t the next. I tried to be supportive and say things like “yeah you were robbed of so many points” and “the game was super picky with you” but he wouldn’t let it go. We originally agreed to watch a movie after playing but he kept moping about it and refused to enjoy the rest of the night.  I have also noticed he will get upset if I beat him at other games too (like chess).  I eventually lost it. I told him we had been playing this game for a while now and I have lost every single game (really badly) but I am always a good sport about it. I never try to bring down the mood or become irrationally angry about it. I told him it’s ridiculous that he gets so upset about losing/playing poorly in a stupid video game. My husband has been in therapy for a bit now working on regulating his emotions and overall self esteem. During the argument he said “you know I’m working on it, can’t you be a little more patient with me.” I told him I know it’s something he is working on but that doesn’t mean I have to tolerate his nasty attitude for the rest of the night. I then told him I no longer wanted to play video games (or any games) with him since he can’t lose without becoming angry and moping about it.

3hn5x809	I (40f) am trying to lose weight. This has been a struggle and I might even have food addiction. I am planning to address my good issues with therapy. However my family isn’t supportive. I have certain foods that trigger me. For example, chocolate chip cookies. If they are in the house I will have a taste. A dietician suggested replacing the junk foods with healthy options which is fine for me. If I don’t see the junk foods I will just snack on the healthy options. My family refuses to get rid of the junk food. They think that I should just not eat it. It’s not that simple and if I was an alcoholic I know they would not have alcohol in the home because it would be a trigger to drink.

3z2ev2cm	 Little bit of backstory, me and my girlfriend are together for roughly two years and I think we have a relationship where we can ask each other anything. The other day she had a mildly revealing cleavage and people were staring. I was constantly saying that those people have no rights to stare and you should wear whatever you are comfortable in. After many of those incidents, I asked in a casual tone “Does it feel good to show cleavage?”  She said that she thinks I have a bad mentality and that I endanger her.   I only asked her how it feels psychologically and have always before and after the incident encouraged her to wear whatever and that my opinion on this shouldn’t be taken tbh.   She has called me a piece of shit and having a bad mentality among other things.

ilmpvm1i	Long story short: covid happened, a relationship break-up happened. The result is me (older sister) moving in with mum, and then younger sister moving in shortly after. Younger sister brought a cat, a dog and an autistic toddler with her. The house is therefore crowded and loud. But they've been here over a year and we're all getting used to it.  The dog is easily trained - I have taught him stand, sit, stay, spin, paw, fetch (yes, I. Not we. It's one of the few things I enjoy about him, is that he loves learning tricks.). He's food motivated so it's not hard. But whenever my sister leaves the house, he screams like he's lost a goddamn leg. I've tried buying him calming treats, but my sister threw them out because she didn't want me using them.  The dog is needy and whines CONSTANTLY. He scream-cries every time my sister goes to the bathroom. He howls every time she goes to get dressed. He literally claws at the door when she does so much as accidentally close it on him. She does NOT discipline him, or otherwise train him. She just turns music on in her room when he does this, and ignores his whines. You will never understand it unless you hear this dog - seriously, "scream-crying" is the only way I can describe it.  Last night after my sister was at her job and mum was already in bed, I was so frustrated after over an hour of constant dog-crying I had enough and (after taking him outside for toilet time) led him in to his crate where he sleeps. He seemed perfectly happy and didn't whine once! He went straight in and laid down. I then went upstairs myself.  But my sister came home from work at her bar job and woke me up, telling me it was out of order for me to put her dog in the crate before his "assigned bedtime". Mum won't get involved because (quite rightly) my sister and I are both adults. But - and here's where I might truly be the AH - my lack of sleep self screamed, that she was a bad dog owner and she was responsible for her horrible to be around, whiny, needy dog. That all he does is cry all day and you don't do anything to comfort him or correct him.  Now everyone is mad at me. I am mad at myself for losing my temper, but feel like I am justified. You, the reader of this, do NOT appreciate how this dog is. He is so loud, and just screams and cries constantly. ALL DAY. I'm apparently in the wrong for putting him in the crate. I feel like I did the right thing by removing him from my situation, because the alternative would have been me losing my sh\*t and smacking him. And he was perfectly happy in the crate!  It's hard to post this because I know I'm going to get some negative feedback. But honestly, if I hadn't put the dog in the crate, I would have ended up smacking him or worse. I  was so tired and frustrated, and ready to lash out. How could I have handled this better? And what would you do in my situation, where it's not \*YOUR\* dog, so you can't make significant changes?	1642848035.0	s9zu8f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zu8f/aita_for_putting_the_dog_in_a_crate/	AITA for putting the dog in a crate?
e7x3b667	My son's mother disappeared years ago. She has a back story that is so insane, if I put the details of it in this post, you could Google it and figure out who she is, who I am, etc.    So I will add this: She had a legitimate tragedy happen to her, probably the worst thing in the world that I can imagine happen. This happened a couple of years before we met, and it really fucked her up.  Fast forward, we had a brief fling, and she wound up pregnant after only knowing each other for a month. We decided that, although she and I would not make a good couple, to co-parent, that she would keep the baby.   Right after our son was born she relapsed. The courts got involved and she lost custody of all of her kids. ( She has others that are not mine ) She is not legally allowed to see him, but she is allowed to talk to him if I allow it.  I have been taking care of him on my own ever since. She came and went for a while, putting together a couple of weeks of sobriety here and there...and then she left.   She ended up in a bad place: selling her body, stealing and robbing to survive. She would email me every couple of years, telling her general location.  I have been checking the obituaries for her, every week, for the last 6 years. Every time she has reached out to me, I have offered to get her help, and to cover all the costs of long-term treatment. I have sent her money for "plane tickets" and "groceries". I have done everything that I believe a decent human being should do for another person. And I have raised our son to be a wonderful kid.  So Jackson is now 9 years old. She has not seen him since he was 2. I got married a few years ago. Before I got married, I told my future wife everything about my son's mother. Her literal words ( which I will never forget ) were "I will love him like my own". And she has. The day after we got married, he started calling her Mom. ( His decision ). For the past 5 years, we have been a happy blended family.  BOOM. Biological mother pops up out of nowhere. The same song and dance as every other time: Everything is good, no drinking, no drugs, no drama, just wants to see her son.  I asked her some basic questions which she refused to amswer.  She literally said " I am with a friend and it is so pretty here. Can I talk to my son?"  Now, I have no problem with her. I have a problem with anyone hurting my son. Her MO for the past decade has been to get cleaned up for a few weeks and then disappear. ( I forgot to mention, I have already agreed to let her talk to him twice, 3 years ago and 5 years ago, and she never called ) The first time I made the mistake of telling him, and he was heart broken.   The idea of her disappearing again, and disrupting his stability, is intolerable.	1642848429.0	s9zxmm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s9zxmm/aita_or_should_i_let_my_son_talk_to_his_mother/	AITA or should I let my son talk to his mother?
iw34kh0q	Hey everyone. I’m new to Reddit, so please bear with me. I will preface this by saying that prior to pregnancy, my boyfriend and I would go out to the bars multiple times a week. I am now 37 weeks pregnant and measuring ahead, so my doctor says the baby could come at any time. Throughout the duration of my pregnancy, my boyfriend (29) has gone out drinking 2-3 times a week—not a huge deal. We’ve had discussions numerous times about his drinking habits and my anxieties about him not being able to slow down before the baby arrives. He always promises he’ll do better, but that typically ends in the form of a 3 day bender. Recently, I’ve expressed to him that I really need him to be sober these next few weeks 1. so he can drive me to the hospital when the time comes and 2. to be a clear minded and focused “emotional support person” to help guide me through labor. This evening, he went out to the bar, and he didn’t get home until 4 am. I reiterated my expectations of him as my partner and father, and I told him that should I go into labor, I will not try to track him down at a bar or allow him in the delivery room if he’s been drinking. Him being drunk, he didn’t like what I had to say, but I still mean what I said. I don’t want the added stress that I know he’ll bring along with him.

I have two sisters (mentioned and 5) the five year old is mostly golden and I’m not super close with the rest of my family, however, L (well call my sister) is like a dark cloud over my house. She can’t be told anything without arguing or starting a fight.   I don’t understand why because my parents have tried spending more time with her, tried giving her space and yet nothing seems to calm her attitude. I can be in a good mood while home alone but then it’s completely ruined by L getting home.

103cvg	My brother has recently split up with his partner of 5 years and obviously it's a difficult time for him and i do want to help him however i can.  The assistance he asked for was to store some of his belongings at my house and if he needs to as a last resort, to live in my spare room.  Myself, my partner and our almost 2 year old son inhabit our house. I'm currently seeing a counsellor for depression, my partner suffers with anxiety on a daily basis and can be quite debilitating.  We agreed as a last resort he could stay with us as it would be a strain on ourselves one way or another.  The issue is he is now disregarding all his other options, council or private housing or our shared brothers house who he said he would be able to stay at first. He is now trying to convince me, repeatedly, that it would be more convenient for him if he stayed at ours without trying anything else first.  Am i the asshole for insisting he sticks to the original plan/agreement?

iweckaxe	I  (21F) married my husband (26M) almost 6 months ago. Before we got  married my brother-in-law (19M) always got second hand phones and had a  job which paid him the bare minimum. BIL's phone broke a few weeks  before I got married and as per my husband's request I gave him my old  phone. That day I told my husband that he should buy BIL a new phone  because he keeps getting second hand phones which are in bad shape.  Fast-forward a month and my husband buys BIL a phone. I didn't ask for my old phone back.  I treated BIL like my own brother and we were extremely close up until his cousin (28F) moved back home a few months before the wedding. He became distant from me. She's the only girl in the family from the mother's side and husband has 4 brothers. And  since we are from South Asia, extended families are extremely common.  They grew up considering her to be their sister even though she's a cousin. So I knew something was wrong and that they were talking shit  behind my back but I had no proof to show my husband. So a few weeks ago I  took the phone BIL gave me and gave it to my nephew without resetting  the phone knowing fully well that he would snoop. In all honesty, I needed the proof.  Alas, I was  right. My nephew snooped and found conversations BIL and cousin had  where they called me a gold digger and were criticizing and judging me for every breath/step I took. They called my husband "henpecked", called me  ugly, shitted on my cooking skills and so on. I got hundreds of screenshots of them talking shit about me. Also, I also got screenshots  of BIL and his gf where they said I can never bear the child of my husband and if I want kids I would have to get with another man.  For the record, I didn't marry my husband for his money. He's not rich but  he does earn a decent salary. I have a job too and I pay for everything I  do, with the money I make and everything else goes into savings.  I  sent the screenshots to my husband and confronted them. BIL had nothing to say.  The cousin on the other hand held her ground and didn't even bother apologizing. She said I was an asshole for taking the phone, invading  someone's privacy. BIL did apologize in an I'm sorry I got caught kind of way.  So...AITA?	1642849381.0	sa06pt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa06pt/aita_for_taking_my_bils_phone/	AITA for taking my BIL's phone
718d3ss9	actually I am apathetic to the whole situation as I feel nothing but hatred for my family but I guess insights would help in consideration of this situation.  for that its important to introduce you to some things that will help you determine your perception of all of us. my 'dad'(45) is in air force so his entire livelihood depends on pay check to pay check as he deliberately let his family take advantage of him so all he has left is his retirement. he never went to college as the requirement of those times were just being a graduate from school. after 10 years of failed persuasion of both me(19) and my sister(22), they never actually able to purchase a land to at least get a land and go in agriculture after that. on top of that we have a 6 year old baby brother which will require more assistance that they surely won't be able to do.  my mom occasionally taunts him for the debt he owes to her so he 'joked' about how he plans to take 80% of her first salary to pay off his debt which of course would incite spark in anyone and it did. But she bought in everyone into this, our relatives, neighbors and now its a whole entertainment shit show for everyone. She accused how her parents never loved her even when she's the most loved out of all of us. they paid for her prep school of one year and then college for another four. she gets her wardrobe reset every another month even when its already full by our parents. she's been spoiled to the point she has never worked for, or helped anyone. and never gets out of her bed. literally wakes up at 1 pm goes back to sleep at 9. she gets her ego hurt whenever someone disagrees with her even in the slightest or doesn't want to work according to her Even when she treats them as absolute trash they still wound up back to her because they know she'll be their personal bank from now.  but now when she said straight to their faces that they wont get a penny out of her they also blasted their voices on loud volume and said how their money has been wasted off on her. (on side note: I found out how my mom is a misogynist as she encourages predatory behavior against women) and they intend to disown her if she does leave them. ( really wont make sense as she plans to leave them too)  then she accuses me of how I never took a side when I've been living my life protecting her from her questionable relationships( dated a 27 year old when she was 16) from them and everything else she has been in trouble for.  I just told her its not my business as its her own personal choice and handling their reactions  (even after that I did protect her and sided with her but she didn't see that)  and she answered with she wishes I was dead(me too)	1642849471.0	sa07fy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa07fy/aita_for_being_apathetic_to_my_sister/	AITA for being apathetic to my sister?
9aev5xoh	For a few months I (F27) have been caring full time for my mum who is currently unable to walk, requires a wheelchair and additional help to get to the bathroom or into/out of bed. While assisting my mum to the bathroom, in the bathroom and then back to her chair, I received multiple messages from my boyfriend (M26). In between rooms I opened the messages but was preoccupied with helping mum and didn't think to reply. My boyfriend is accusing me of not communicating and saying it would take 2 seconds to reply to his messages. I tried to explain that replying wasn't my priority in that moment and that helping my mum when she calls is more important than sending a reply to update him when I would message him within a few minutes anyway. He kept insisting it only takes 2 seconds to reply and that I had time to open the messages so I had time to respond. But I honestly didn't have room in my brain to consider sending a reply, my brain was preoccupied and I think I only opened my phone out of habit.  I said "If she calls me for help it could be because she's hurt or fallen or can't move, do you think replying to messages is more important than checking on her?" And he responded "I think two seconds aren't going to make much difference". I'm really hurt that he is putting me replying to his non urgent messages before the needs of my disabled mum when it would not harm him to wait a couple minutes.

dw5gga1t	My (35F) uncle is transferring my grandma's (call her W) ashes to my state from where she passed, for them to be interred with my grandpa (G) at a military cemetery. My mom forwarded an email chain between her and my uncle about scheduling etc. From the sounds of it my sister (40, narcissist & estranged from me), is possibly traveling across the country to attend, but I'm not sure. Knowing my mom (74, also narcissist), she's going to want the whole family there for W's interment.   Here's my struggle. 1) when G died, I was not allowed to go to his burial. Yet my sister and her husband were allowed/able to go. Idk why, or if I was even given a reason since I was 14/15, had just lost both of my grandfathers within one week of each other, and we had just moved my other grandma (call her H) up from California. It's possible that's why I had to stay back now that I think about it, to take care of H, who had dementia.   2) I have yet to be to G's grave, while my mom & sister have been multiple times. There's just never been "room in the schedules" for me to go.   3) I wasn't close to W, not like my sister was. I mean yeah I spent time around her and helped her after a cancer surgery when I was 10/11, but ... Caretaker vs family. Not the same.   4) I REALLY don't want the first time I get to visit my G's grave - the grandparent I was closest to - to be while also dealing with my mom but mostly worried about dealing with my sister (long story, lots of drama, short version is she's a liar and toxic, & I cut her out of my life 2yrs ago). And without knowing when W's ashes are being moved, I can't know whether there's time for me to get to the cemetery alone first.  So.

2zb9bg5u	Long story, but I will try to make sense.   Background: I live in a shared flat with 3 other people. A couple (let's call them Linda and Jeff) and a girl (let's call her Sharon). Me, Linda and Jeff are in our mid 30's, Sharon in her very early 20's. I'm on the lease and have a roommate contract with the others. I've known Linda and Jeff for years even before we became roommates. Sharon however moved in less then a year ago.  Things has not been working smoothly with Sharon; we've tried to include her by asking her to watch movies, play games and have dinner with us but she almost always declines or doesn't reply. Most of the time when I greet her good morning or say hi she just mumbles back or doesn't reply.  Before Christmas I announced that I was moving and since I'm on the lease I suggested that one of my roommates could just take it over, if it's ok with our landlord (which it has been before, that's how I got the lease). We decided to have a meeting. Sharon said she didn't want to take over the lease since she probably will move in early summer. She was VERY annoyed with the stress of the situation that she might have to move out before her studies finishes, which I can understand. She was however quite rude during the whole meeting saying we've been lyio to her and haven't been very including. So the question went to Linda and Jeff. Now, they had just days prior gone looking at a house and were honest with their plans to place a bid. With the housing market in my country being absolutely crazy the prospects of them getting it were unsure.   About a day later they tell us they got the house and are also moving. We now have three months left in the flat.  Now to the problem: Sharon can't stay unless someone takes over the lease, she has to move with the rest of us six weeks before her school ends. She involved her parents in all this and they seem to think that me, Linda and Jeff have some sort of responsibility towards her and have asked us to stay in the flat until she's done. That however puts us three in a financial strain. The other option they see is we fix her another accomodation for the last six weeks as she doesn't have many connections in this town. I spent all evening making calls the other night, trying to find a place.   I totally get her situation because I, and almost every one I know, has been there! I can't help to feel that even tho this is hard, it's a part of life. I haven't broken the contract I signed with her, but am I missing something here? Do I have any responsibility outside our contract?

erwbe6hg	a friend of mine has had issues recently, mainly regarding being stuck in a complicated relationship. I want to help them, but I've never had any experience of what it's like to be in a relationship and I don't exactly know how to console them properly. I want to try and be helpful to them, but it's quite clear and obvious that I don't know how they feel and I'm afraid they might perceive me as insensitive or worthless if I refuse to console them. I try to understand their situation as much as I can, but they claim I "never listen" and I'm worried if I might've been subconsciously doing something to hurt them. It hurts my heart that I don't know how to make them feel better, and I can't help but feel that it's my fault. Could I be the bad person in this situation?	1642849153.0	sa0435	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa0435/aita_for_not_being_there_for_my_childhood_friend/	AITA for not being there for my childhood friend?
iwgbuqp9	   I (M36) divorced my exwife 3 years ago, we have a 6 year old daughter together. My exwife got remarried recently to this guy named "Aaron", He's 2 years younger than me and he and my ex had a LDR. I had some concerns about that specifically because I really believe that my daughter and Aaron didn't take enough to time to get to know each other.   So anyway, I went on a business travel that lasted well over 8 months, I stayed in contact with my daughter but I didn't know that every toy I sent her since I went away was taken and dumped by Aaron. Now I didn't know the full story, all I knew was that my daughter didn't recieve any of the toys I've been sending her for the past few months. I further investigated and found out that Aaron was responsible for the disappearance of these toys for some unknown reason.   I came back last week and I had a long discussion with my exwife about it, turns out Aaron admitted to her that he threw away every single toy before my daughter even saw them. my exwife mentioned something about Aaron struggling with a mental disorder and some of the toys had triggered him. when I spoke to him he said that it's his house and he had the right to decide what is and what is NOT allowed in it. I got so mad we had a big argument when we started screaming at each other, I told him I expect him to pay me for each and every toy he threw away or I'd take his ass to court. My exwife urged me to leave but I told her I'm not letting this go.  She called my family asking them to get me to drop it because, again.... Aaron is going through mental health issues and can not: (A) be held responsible for some of his behaviors and (B) afford money to pay me back for the toys because of medical debts.  My family said they're just toys that my daughter didn't even know about, and said that clearly Aaron's dealing with some stuff and I should be more sympathatic to mental health struggles since they're real. I said I won't let this go and that his issues aren't my issues. Though, my family are known to side with my exwife just to keep the peace and I'm sick of it, She's begging me to let it go still but I refused.	1642851759.0	sa0ryr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa0ryr/aita_for_demanding_my_daughters_stepdad_to_pay/	AITA for demanding my daughter's stepdad to pay for every toy I bought that he threw away?
cuhneu0u	My father was in a toxic on again, off again relationship with a woman. He was engaged to her.. but he has proposed to three women in a 4 year time span. So to me it means very little. My father passed and he was living at this fiancés place. He had no will and I am next of kin. So legally all of his belongings go to me. She isn’t being cooperative. She said her lawyer said she could keep anything in her house that isn’t registered to my dad. Legally I guess that’s true but morally that is a terrible thing to do. At this point I don’t really want a thieving liar at the memorial. Some family agree and some think it’s the proper/right thing to allow her to come. What say you all?

i0joj2hz	Context: my family is very christian, and most of our gatherings are because of the religion. We live in a painfully conservative and christian country, and these topics often appear in politics despite imo having no rights to be there.  I (16F) am strongly against it, and seemingly I am the only one in my family. This was always a huge thing, and it's treated as the “only correct belief”. But I don't care. It might sound selfish, however I think I am the only person who has the right to choose my own path.  Having said that, I am planning to make an apostasy once I turn 18, so I will be officialy treated as an atheist. But I'm worried. Lots of events require you to not be an apostate, so sooner or later they will figure it out. I feel stupid because it's like showing you don't care for the family, while in reality I only don't care about the christian part, especially when I was told repeatedly my existence was a disgrace and I don't deserve to live by christians.

iwi7uwi1	  My daughter Avery (24) and her husband Tom (29) are expecting their first baby together, They're both very excited and been getting so many things done in a short time. Because they've been busy lately we haven't seen them in 2 months.   Yesterday they visited me at the house to talk about the baby mostly. Tom asked me if I had emptied one of the rooms so I could turn it into a nursery yet, I was confused by his question and asked him why. He said that he expected me to, I asked why again, he looked at me and said that every decent grandmother prepares a nursery at her home specifically to welcome her grandson as a new member of the extended family and went on to give exanples of how common this tradition is. I don't know why but gis words irked me. I asked why can't his mom prepare one for her grandson since this is her grandson too. He laughed and said that his mom already has one prepared that she paid for herself. I have to mention Tom's family is well off unlike us, we don't have an avaliable room or money to afford a whole nursery, yet, Tom insisted it's necesary and that I make efforts to make sure my grandson gets everything he needs whenever they visit. I looked at my daughter wondering if she agreed with this and by the looks of it, she did.   I told Tom that I don't have the space or money to make this happen but he argued that not making this happen will affect how many visits I get compared to his mom who's fully prepared and "considerate" of her grandbaby's needs. Avery finally spoke up but told me to please try to move my 16 yo son to stay with his 14 yo brother. I said no the boys are old enough to get their own room but Tom pitched in saying boys can share a room since they're boys but I wasn't convinced. In fact, I was upset they came up with this suggestion. Avery didn't like that and took it as in I don't care about her baby and don't want to do anything for him but that is just not true. The conversation turned into an argument and they left minutes later.  Avery must've called my husband because he yelled at me when he came home saying this was no way to treat my daughter and our grandchild, I told him the story and he accused me of favoring the boys over Avery like I always do but this time I just don't think her request is in any way reasonable.	1642852631.0	sa0zl8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa0zl8/aita_for_refusing_to_turn_my_sons_room_into_a/	AITA for refusing to turn my son's room into a nursery for my grandson?
iwhyqpsy	AITA? Backstory-my Mom died a few years ago and I've been taking care of my Pops since. My brother has never visited/called/texted him and and only seen him twice in 3 years for about 10 minutes each time. My Pop was diagnosed with Cancer last year and I once again took care of him. Every appointment/op/recovery I've been there at every step. He's my Pops and I'm happy to do it for him. my brother hasn't seen Pops once during all his treatments. This week, Pops has been for a small op to remove a growth, unsure if this is cancerous or not yet. My family has been grounded with covid so the in laws stepped up for hospital trips (so grateful). Anyway, I've had his animals at my house as we can't leave yet. I've said nothing to brother and sil as I'm exhausted at letting them know stuff when they can't be arsed to speak to Pops or even visit him (they travel past his house several times a week). Sil is badgering my friend, asking about Pops and if he's been in hospital and saying it's not right they don't know if he has been in. AITA for not giving them the information when they don't bother with him or even me?  I'm tired of them expecting me to tell them what's happening when they could speak to Pops themselves.	1642852803.0	sa1117	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1117/aita_for_not_sharing_information/	AITA for not sharing information
iwheqcva	Based on age alone this feels silly. But I'm so fed up with this that I am just going to put this on here.   So here is a bit of background. My(18) sister(9) lies to my parents about pretty much everything. I have no clue why because most of the time it's about pretty pointless stuff. Most of the time it is absolutely none of my business and I don't care about it, I am not her parent.   Lately, it HAS become my business in the most infuriating way possible. Anytime I talk to my parents (either about her or in general) she quickly and bluntly tells them that I am lying and that whatever I am saying didn't happen. First few times it was something silly like her asking me to make her something to eat and then refusing it in front of my parents because she "didn't ask me for it." Sure that's annoying but come on, she is a child, whatever. But of course, if that was the issue I wouldn't be on Reddit. Today she had a pretty bad day, I won't go into the details of that, but to make her feel better I gave her one of my bracelets and a necklace to wear so we could match. I am not typically a jewelry dude but I do own quite a bit so I figured today I would share it with my little sister who really likes that stuff. She was excited that we matched and excited to wear my stuff. I had told her to just be careful and not break anything but didn't think into it much. Sure enough, she completely snapped my bracelet and the beads went everywhere. I was frustrated but just asked her nicely to pick the beads up so the dogs wouldn't find them and eat them. I was pretty visibly upset about it breaking but it was an accident. Before I could say anything else she runs off crying to my parents. So I followed her. In front of my parents, she starts screaming and crying about how I snapped my bracelet in front of her and yelled at her and was going to lie about her breaking it so she would be in trouble.   This didn't go over well for me. Not only was something of mine broken but now I was going to get in trouble over a lie she told. At this point, I was beyond being just a little frustrated and told my parents that she was lying and snapped my bracelet. That the beads were on her floor and it was the bracelet they saw her wearing. I was fuming and a being little loud at this point. Not quite yelling but outwardly showing that I was angry about the lying and not just my stuff being broken. I told my parents that she lies to them daily about almost everything and that I wasn't going to ignore it and get in trouble for my own things being broken. She got in trouble and was sent to her room but my parents are still angry with me. They said she is a kid and that it's stupid and mean of me to be angry or to "tattle" on a child. I feel bad that she is so upset about this but I don't want to have to defend my every word just because she wants to say that I am lying, especially over my own property. An adult fighting with a child seems absolutely ridiculous but AITA for calling out her lies?	1642852951.0	sa12yu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa12yu/aita_for_telling_my_parents_how_much_of_a_liar_my/	AITA for telling my parents how much of a liar my sister is
iwgz9g9u	TL/DR: Meet up with an acquaintance from high school was not enjoyable to say the least and I would rather not meet up with her again eventhough she's invited me out several times. WIBTA for not accepting and giving her another chance.   Just for context, I was never close with this person on high school. Just knew her from middle to high school. We would sometimes talk but she was in a way.... Weird? Like her social skills was lacking a little which made it uncomfortable to talk to her but I would do so if she approached me anyway since my mom would encourage me to do so to be friendly and nice. She was always weirdly competitive and loved to compare anything and everything with herself but at the same time, would be very aloof or dismissive of other topics of conversation and would only give one word replies of you try to venture and talk a little more with her (sorry if this is hard to understand. She's hard for me to understand as well)   Fast forward a few years, a few months ago, we recently got in touch with each other again and agreed to meet up for lunch. Honestly, I was excited to meet up with her again because I don't usually see friends I knew from high school anymore. Well, long story short, I met up with her and she was the exact same person I knew from high school and like I remembered, very uncomfortable to talk to her.  She didn't start conversations so I had to keep the communication going. Was rather dismissive and analytical of what I was doing currently with my career. She asked me what my plan for the future was and I responded by saying I would like to take a MA in Counselling. Her response to that was "Really? Your plan for the future is just to study?". She bragged about how many guys she's dated before and how many boyfriends she's had. And on top of that, she ended the meet up by saying "I think we'll end this here since I have run out of things to say to you". Like??? I understand if you want to go home already, fine, go ahead. But she hardly asked me anything about myself unless I offered the information. So it wasn't an enjoyable meet up to say the least.  But recently she's been asking me if I want to meet up again but I always turned down her invites since I don't really wanna waste my time if every meet up is going to be this way. But WIBTA if I didn't give her a second chance?

169i32	AITA for standing up for my mom? I was on the phone with my mom and oldest brother (26 M) discussing my sister’s (16 F) inappropriate and dangerous long distance relationship. My mother then finally dropped the bombshell I already knew she had decided upon. She told my brother that this is why she won’t be taking placement of my younger sister who is in foster care. For context, my younger sister is always involved in drama, has a past of serious accusations (she accused me of attempted murder at one point), and has a past of not listening to adults or parental figures in her life. She is a ticking time bomb when it comes to accusations, I won’t blame her for the m*leststion accusation that was made up when she was young as that was my dads effort at trying to ruin my mother’s life more, however my sister has posted publicly about said accusation on TikTok after saying to my mother that she didn’t believe it happened. For even more context, an investigation was done, the story didn’t add up, and I remember my dad coaching us outside of the police station what to say. Anyways, when she told my brother she would not be taking placement due to those things, (her husband has had 4 heart attacks and can’t have any stress) my brother began yelling at her calling her a horrible mother. Both him and his wife began to gang up on my mom in this group call, so I ended up stepping in and I completely shut them down. Since then they have convinced my younger sister that I talked our mom out of taking her, which couldn’t be further from the truth, and they have been posting here (on Reddit) twisting the stories to make everyone else but them seem like horrible people. They have told me I’m a horrible person for standing up for my mom, I think I may have bta when I included myself in the argument despite it having nothing to do with me.

3qgl46le	I (27m) am not a gambler, not a drinker, and do smoke cigarettes. My whole family (parents (50s m/f); sister (22f) and her boyfriend (25m)) and my partner (24f) went out for dinner together in the city. We live in seperate parts of the city and really only all get together once or twice a year (adults, life, work yada yada yada).   On our walk back from dinner, we walked past a really big casino in our capital city. My dad hinted that he wanted to go in - he has terminal brain cancer and will likely not make it past June 2022, so this is probably the last time we’ll all “be together” - and I asked my partner if she wanted to come. She pulled a face and said no. I then asked if I could go play a few hands, and she got really shitty and said “go do whatever you want”.   Evidently, I didn’t go and am now sitting in a hotel room, with a partner that’s shitty at me in the bathroom. She told me that her dad used to gamble and that used to not be able to make rent when she was a kid. I apologised because I didn’t realise, but asked if I’ve ever put her in that situation - she knows I’m a tightass when it comes to spending money; I rarely even go out for dinner despite being on an incredibly generous salary - and she said that it’s not the point, and proceeded to scream at me for an hour.  I understand that her upbringing may have been rough due to her parents poor decisions / addictions / mental health, but is me asking to go to a casino (without knowing any of this) problematic?

g2ogfmtq	Everytime someone asks me (17) if I have any siblings, I tend to say I'm an only child, when in reality I have an older sister (22).   My sister is used to treating me badly, always insulting me, stealing and/or breaking my stuff, and as of now, not helping me with my medical needs that I would not like to discuss here.  Recently, I got asked about it again by a classmate and my mother was present at the time, and when I said I didn't have any siblings, she got extremely upset about it, saying that even if my sister treated me badly, she was family and I couldn't just ignore her existence, even going as far as telling me to apologize to my sister for pretending I didn't have any siblings.  Mine and my sister's relationship is not the best, both of us mistreat eachother some way or another; I've thrown my fair share of insults towards her, so I'm no saint. My sister also struggles with BPD and other mental issues, so not all of her behaviours is her fault, but I can't help but wish she wasn't related to me because of the way she treats me.  So, am I the asshole?	1642853752.0	sa1aa9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1aa9/aita_for_saying_im_an_only_child_when_i_have_an/	AITA for saying I'm an only child when I have an older sister?
iid5r5nk	I (f19), my mom (f42) and my sister (f9) have two bunnies in the house. I adore these bunnies so much and I love them to the world and back. We recently got our second bunny but our first bunny, we’ll call pancake has been around since he was a baby. My mom randomly came home with pancake one day and didn’t alert me at all. It wasn’t really an issue because I fell in love with him.   What was an issue for me was that I was doing every single thing for the bunny despite my mom saying he wasn’t my bunny yet I was treated like he was (cleaning litter box, brushing, nail clipping, cleaning up mess, feeding, water, etc) while nobody else really wanted to do any of the work.  Soon after, mom and I were looking for bunnies online so we could get pancake a friend. We found a sweet bunny named Oreo and decided to adopt him, mom told me Oreo would be their bunny and not mine, and that pancake would officially be mine so I was really happy about that.   When it came time to pick up Oreo, he was so sweet and we all fell in love with him as well. But the same thing keeps happening again, I’m expected to do everything for Oreo and while I wouldn’t mind if he was actually my bunny, it’s clear my mom says he isn’t. I’ve complained about this a couple times and how  it isn’t fair on me when they have equal responsibility too.   It can get quite stressful for me taking care of two bunnies especially when it comes time to brush or clip their nails since they both hate it.   I can’t just stop taking care of Oreo either because he would be neglected in his needs. Whenever something needs refilling like food I get accused of being cruel an told “look at him he’s begging for food hurry up and give him some food” and sometimes I snap back and say that’s their responsibility and she should do it. My mom then resorts to acting offended and says things like “it’s a human living thing with a soul don’t be like that!”   Don’t get me wrong I love both of those bunnies so much and they’re my world, I always try to make sure they are happy but sometimes I do feel like I could be  A huge AH when Oreo depends on me so much and prefers me over the others in the family. I also think, if I would be fine taking care of him if he were my bunny, why can’t I be fine taking care of him if he isn’t.   I’m not going to stop taking care of him because I worry for his safety and health and I am quite sharp at spotting things out of the ordinary with them, but sometimes I need a break too, if they only have the luxury of having alll the good sides of a pet while I get stuck with the nasty.

iwg8coxk	I've been stalking reddit for a while and this is my first reddit post and I'm using a throwaway account for reasons.    I am an only child (15F) and my mom and dad is 49F and 51M. Yesterday, my mom came to me and asked if I could edit a birthday video for her friend's birthday on Sunday. I didn’t want to because of multiple reasons. One, school will resume on Monday after a very long health break. Two, I find it very frustrating to do especially with all my school work piling up. Three, I edited videos for her friends' birthdays before and told her multiple times to either learn how to edit or hire an editor. I guess she doesn't want to or she doesn't have the time to.     I tried to make it seem like I didn't want to without outright telling her because I can’t say no. I asked her if I had a choice and she said no. That upsets me and I just say I don’t want to. She offers to do things for me but I refuse. She says that it's just a favor and that I should help her. After a while of arguing, she decides to leave me alone. Later that day, she was with her friends on a call, recording audio and videos.  Earlier today, she bought me food, even when I refused. I guessed it was so that I would appreciate it and agree to help. She told me to edit the videos already. I say I don't want to. She got mad. She said that editing was easy for me. That she knows I animate a lot and it’s harder. Both of them are hard. I only do so when I have free time. I just kept quiet. She said that I'm being selfish of my talent. She goes on to say that her friends want me to edit. That they think that I'm good at it. How her birthday friend did so much for us back then.    I felt bad but I was too upset to agree. I went to my dad for help but he was on my mom's side. I get scolded by both of them. They kept telling me to just edit it. My dad said how I didn't appreciate their efforts. I think that's my fault for not acknowledging that. My mom then went on about how good her friends were to me. I started to cry. I don't know what happened. I think I got too nervous and under pressure.     They kept asking me what was wrong. They said it's not like video editing is hard. I did not say my reasons because I know they would always find some way to downplay it. I just kept quiet the whole time. Now I'm here in my room. I'm glad they left me alone but I'm scared they will go to me later and keep urging me to. I feel like I'm being selfish but I know I have to prioritize my schoolwork, especially with me being a big procrastinator. In the meantime, I'm going to continue my work.     I apologize if the info seems vague. This issue probably isn't much of a big problem from an outsider's perspective. I still feel quite overwhelmed and I would be glad to answer any questions or inquiries.    TLDR; My mom wants me to edit a birthday video even when I'm busy with schoolwork. She doesn't give me a choice not to and I refuse. Both parents are mad at me.	1642854100.0	sa1dox	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1dox/aita_for_refusing_to_edit_a_video/	AITA for refusing to edit a video?

gddd4gcm	So for context I (21F) stay 4 hours away from my hometown for studies. My mom(41) has a very rocky relationship with her family because of some familial issues and doesn't mingle with her family much since her marriage to my dad (49). And because of their animosity I too am not close with her side of the family but very very close with dads side of family since we all have practically grown up together.  Few days ago a marriage was fixed in my dads side of the family which I really am excited to attend (marriage is tomorrow- 23rd Jan). Coincidentally there is a house-warming ceremony on my mothers side on the same day. Since I'm Indian (specifically a South Indian) we are expected to be closer to moms side rather than dads.  When I told my mom that I'd like to skip the house warming and attend the marriage which my mother was originally okay with. But my dad absolutely blew up saying how terrible of a human being I am who doesn't want the family he's trying to put together since his marriage (more like forcing us to attend ceremonies and functions) to get together. Now even my mom wants me to skip the marriage and attend the ceremony because I'm a grown girl now and must try to get along with her side of family. But she herself is not going to attend the house warming and is going to the marriage because she doesn't want to. And in my moms absence my dad wants me to behave like a responsible adult.  After hearing all this I argued with them saying that I am not trying to isolate myself from her family and if the marriage and the ceremonies were on different days I would have attended both. Since I have to chose one I'd like to select the one where I feel good with all my close [cousins. Here](https://cousins.Here)'s  where I think I might have been TA by telling that I don't want to get involved in all this dramas and to stop monitoring where I want to go as I'm not a kid anymore.  After this incidence my dad has been giving me the silent treatment and my mom thinks that I'm growing disrespectful and over reacted. So AITA here?  Additional info- Here as per my tradition it is the eldest girl who has to take care of the house and she also gets the most in property share. My grandmother was the eldest daughter, my mom is her eldest daughter and I'm literally the last eldest daughter of my family because except my grandmother all others in our family has had boys. And once married the boy belongs to the brides family. Not the other way round as normal is. So Yeah! I'm pretty much a celebrity in our whole lineage. If I have a son in future , my mothers lineage ends with me.

iu2mj7ga	I (19f) am staying at home with my family. I don't pay rent (mum insisted against it as I'm going back in early Feb) and I don't buy my own food (again, my mum insisted against it) but I buy my own snacks. I always put my name on them.  I have a sister (14f) who has one friend (Jane-15f) over all the time. I don't know much about her, but I know she's been in and out of foster care and is recovering from an ED (she's currently living with her older brother). The issue is that every time she comes over, she takes all my snacks and will even put the ones she didn't eat in her bag. It's very annoying. And she knows they're mine because they're in a basket with my name on them. I would gladly share them with her if she asked, but I'm getting to the end of my rope with her stealing them.  Yesterday I came downstairs and saw her holding some of the crisps I bought. I asked her what she was doing and she said these are her favourite flavour. I said 'I know, they're mine. I'd share them with you, but you cannot take them without asking.' I recognise that I probably sounded a little douchey, but I had spoken to her about this before, but it didn't get through. I asked her for my crisps back and she held it out but wouldn't let go. I took the bag from her hand and poured her a bowl with some sauce. I also chopped some cucumber and carrots for her.  My mum thinks I'm a huge asshole for this. She says that Jane has had a hard life and the least I could do is let her eat my food. I said I did, but I'm sick of her taking it all. I said she needs to learn not to steal because others might be as generous.

hpz11qrf	Throwaway for obvious reasons.   So for some backstory, I have four roommates. Recently I’ve been having a lot of issues with some of my roommates. Two of them more than the rest. I’ve been getting frustrated by how they’ve taken up all of the freezer space and I only have four small items in there, despite paying equal rent. I’ve brought it up to them and they just give me excuses like “well you know we buy in bulk” and stuff. I’ve always been bothered by the state in which they leave the kitchen and dishes. They leave food all over the counter and dirty dishes all over the counter and fill the sink. We have a bug problem because of this. This has been discussed multiple times and nothing changes. They leave dishes to “soak” for several days before I get fed up and clean them myself. (FYI: we have a dishwasher right next to the sink and they’ll leave everything like this even when it’s completely empty.) I’ve asked them multiple times to clean up after themselves and to respect my dishes and cookware by cleaning it the same day as it was used. They always acknowledge and agree and then don’t follow through.   So in a recent night, I got into a discussion about something unrelated. One of the roommates made a disgusting comment about a very touchy subject. This comment hurt me and made me very upset. After this comment was made, I told them that what they said was disgusting, hurtful and uncalled for. I was made out to be crazy for getting angry at what was said. I ended up leaving for a couple hours and coming back. When I came back I had decided that I’m no longer going to allow them the privilege of using my things. They have lost my respect and my friendship after being so heartless to me. So I spent the entire night getting all of my dishes, cookware, and bakeware and locking it in my room to go into storage. They still have dishes and cookware, they just won’t have as much, so I haven’t left them with nothing. If they don’t respect me and they’ve proven they don’t respect my items then I don’t believe they should have access to my belongings.   So AITA for taking all of my things away from them?	1642855544.0	sa1rin	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1rin/aita_for_hiding_my_dishescookware/	AITA for hiding my dishes/cookware?
iwiqk466	  To get the full context of this, I need to give some backstory.  I (21F) have been my gran's uber driver/delivery service etc since covid started. I don't usually mind, as her medication dispensary is by my gym, and as long as I get notice I can organise my day around driving her where she needs to go.  My gran's behaviour is an issue, though. She's gotten it into her head that she's a burden. I have always told her she's not, that I'm just paying forward what she did for me when I was a kid, etc etc. But this has culminated in her not telling me she needs something until she's already run out of it, so I have to go that day, regardless of plans.  Fast forward to last week. She can finally go get her own prescriptions but doesn't want to uber. Fair enough, covid is a thing. She asks me to take her the next day. I ask if it HAS to be the next day, as I already have plans that start at 9:45am. She says "No. I suppose my blood thinner can wait." Sigh. I say I can take her, but we HAVE to leave at 9. She says of course. We plan to meet outside my house. She lives in a cottage on the property.  I was running late, and only got there at 9:03. So I wait. At 9:15 I call her. At 9:25 I go looking for her. She was gardening. I asked her what happened to 9 am sharp. She says "Oh, you weren't there so I was just doing a few things." We get into a passive aggressive fight, which I know I'm wrong for. I let her know I'm going to be late now. She goes "Well... I guess I'll just uber, even though you know I hate that."  I respond "If you'd been there you wouldn't have to. Uber then, because I'm leaving."  I understand it was unnecessarily aggressive, but I don't regret my sentiments. She hasn't once apologised, and even complained to my mom about it, and now my mom thinks I'm the AH, as does my sister. They both agree she was wrong, but apparently because she's old I need to suck it up and throw my plans out the window to drive her around. Which I've been doing for two years now. So, AITA?	1642855794.0	sa1tx2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa1tx2/aita_for_leaving_my_gran_behind/	AITA for leaving my gran behind
iwik3u82	Me (29m) and my fiance (27f) are supposed to get married in a couple months. We've been together 3 years and we haven't had too many major conflicts and none we couldn't get past. Her brother Ryan (31m) and I, however, don't get along. He's kind of a jackass.  He's got the kind of personality of someone who never grew up after his freshman year in college and never takes anything seriously.  I recently found out that my fiance's family has a "tradition" of organizing pranks on the bride and groom. Some of it is just stupid stuff that causes a temporary disruption (think pretending to lose the ring for 5 minutes or orchestrating a fake mix up with the cake). Some of it is more elaborate. I heard that at my fiance's aunt's wedding, they somehow managed to keep it a secret that they'd put bubble wrap under the entire carpet leading to altar before the bride walked down it.  The pranks are supposed to be a bonding experience and a sort of induction for new family members. The examples I've heard about have been annoying and disruptive, but on the whole, mostly harmless.  Personally, though, I hate pranks. I feel that regardless of stated intentions, there's always a bit of maliciousness hidden in the act. And sometimes, even without meaning to, the pranksters go too far and genuinely hurt their targets. Ryan is definitely the kind of person who would pull a prank that went too far and has already started making jokes about how much fun he's going to have at our wedding.  I talked to my fiance and told her that I don't want any pranks at our wedding. I don't want our day to be ruined by childish jokes or, what I'm more worried about, her brother pulling something more mean-spirited.  She said that this was her family's special tradition, that it was harmless fun meant to bring people together. Some of her favorite family memories came from this "tradition."  We argued. Eventually, things got heated and I yelled something along the lines of, "There'll be no F'ing pranks at my wedding!" My fiance got quiet and then left.  I immediately knew that I'd made a mistake and tried to apologize, but all I got was silence. The next day her brother called to tell me that I was a jackass and to stop being such baby. They're just pranks.   I can't help but wonder if I'm overreacting. I know that this is a tradition my fiance values, but, again, I hate pranks. Even more, I hate the idea of having pranks being played against me.  Our wedding is supposed to be a celebration of each other.  While setting it all up is stressful and while I understand that not everything will be perfect, there's a difference between dealing with an unexpected accident and actively incorporating something I loathe into the ceremony.

bn9e1e5k	Reposting to stay under 3k words.   ""Had to take a bunch of details out about how we (me, husband and 1 kid) were overseas and a distant cousin really really wanted us to stay at their place for a night. So we stayed a night with them.  Out of the blue we got a text from them they were in the country and will be staying with us asking for out address. Had to reluctantly give out our address. Reluctantly because we had a horribld time at their place due to their kids.""  They arrived with their 3 kids aged 8, 5 and 3. My kids are 4 and 2 at this point. My home was turned completely upside down within the hour. They knocked down the outdoor unit of my air conditioner within a minute of arrival. One kid kept choking my cat. The kids were trying to beat my kids while I try to shield them and plead the parents to control the kids. The pleading and begging the parents have 0 effect. They dismiss me telling me to "let them play".   All 3 kids were non verbal and was very clear they had something wrong with them. Trying to be accomodating to their condition I try asking whats the diagnosis on the kids. Whats the mental ailment they have? The parents are dodging the question and keep telling me how it is normal for 8 and 5 year olds to not speak and that the 3 yo is too young to speak anyway.  In all the mayhem my and the husbands main focus has been to try and save my kids from harm and injury. Having a look at the house I have probaly taken a few thousand damage already. My plants have all been uprooted, half my kids toys are broken, my tv screen has been scratched, my kids are getting scarred for life.   I see the 8 yo jumping on the glass dining table. I ask him to stop and fail so I ask the parents to stop him. Again I am dismissed with "relax, the fall may teach him a lesson". I am picturing myself his kid with glass shards once the table breaks and trying to explain the paramedics why no one stopped him.  After a while their kids start fighting in between them. The 8 yo is grunting and screaming and throwing anything and everything at his 2 siblings and hitting them everywhere. It dawns on me that all the facial scarring on the 5 and 3 yo are caused by him. The father tries intervening but then is hit by 3 hotwheels in the face, his face bleeds while he begs him to stop. He's bleeding and has a look of sheer horror on his face. I try asking him to stop but am hit with a hotwheel in the head.  All the emotion I was bottling up suddenly errupt and I just want to scream at them. Takes immense patience while I politely tell them to "gtfo all of you" while my whole face twitches.  They packed all their stuff and left. They have now shared with the entire family how I kicked them with their 3 disabled kids out at 10pm when they didnt even have hotel lined up to sleep the night.  Since everyone in the family already thinks IATA. Just needed the final confirmation from here.  P.s It made me irrationally angry just writing all of this down. Alot may be missing from the middle to stay under 3k words.	1642857113.0	sa287x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa287x/aita_for_kicking_guests_out/	AITA for kicking guests out
ema00902	So, it's been about a year and half since a family member decided to (bc of covid) work remote and live in a van and travel the country. Sounds nice for them, what a great opportunity to see the sights, right? Well little did I know they are kind of a shopaholic and have used my address as their mailing address while they are away (wife's family member, wife says she told them it'd be fine, didn't run it by me).  At first I was like "yeah that makes sense if they have some important mail it makes sense someone is around to receive it" but bc of the shopaholicism it's gotten way out hand. I now have an entire closet, a cabinet, space in the attic, and space in the outdoor shed taken up with boxes from online orders shipped to my house.   I don't have a big house. The space these packages take up is actually quite a bit of my house's storage. Not to mention the time it takes to put them away, dealing with delivery drivers (a lot of the stuff requires signature), trying to organize my own stuff to make room for their stuff, and just the general feeling that I'm being used.   I've talked with wife but she says it's family and we need to help them out, end of discussion. I am getting increasingly frustrated with not having the storage available for our things, and other rooms are quickly becoming disorganized bc we don't have enough space to store stuff due to the packages.   I am not good about confrontation, so when another box comes I just get all *meh* about it and it generally puts me in a bad mood and I have some obvious resentment about it, which comes through in my dealings with wife. I know I could handle my reactions better, but AITA?

ei9dgyv2	Accidentally went over character limit before and was instructed by a bot to make the post again so that's what I'm doing.   So, context. I got frustrated looking for something in our room earlier (yes we have to share a room, being poor is like that sometimes), and I have a hard time not being vocal when I'm upset. I did not yell or stomp, I did not drag everyone else into my problem by asking/whining for them to help me. I just continued my search and was voicing my frustration, but keeping my voice deliberately as low as I could.  I accidentally woke my sister up doing this. She's had a really hard time falling and staying asleep lately, so I told her I was sorry for waking her, that I was doing my best, and that she should just go back to sleep if she could. I admit I said this in an annoyed tone of voice.   Instead of laying back down, she started harping on me for waking her up. She also started "looking" even though I did not ask her to. By looking, I mean she sat up in her bed and scrutinized what I was doing with blurry sleep eyes. Eventually, I just told her to fuck off and leave me alone, because I was already really frustrated and she wasn't helping.  She did not leave me alone, though, and then argued with me more. Eventually I just dropped my search because I wasn't getting anywhere and it was causing problems for more than just me.   After calming down a bit, I decided to get some food and relax. I ordered Chinese takeout, and they gave me a free small sample of some egg drop soup. I don't enjoy eggs very much, but my sister likes egg drop soup, so I figured maybe if she ate she would calm down and it would serve as a peace offering. She had decided to just get up at this point, since she couldn't go back to sleep, and was walking out of the bathroom when I tried to speak to her. She looked at me, brushed me off, and closed the door to our shared room in my face.   I opened the door and ask her wtf that was. She acts like she doesn't know what I'm talking about and insists she never heard me or looked at me. I don't buy it but I let it go. I told her I was just going to offer her something, and she cuts me off and told me she didn't want it before I could even tell her what it was. I told her she was being unnecessarily mean at this point, and she said she didn't care and to leave her alone.  I stormed off after a bit more back and forth. I left at about midnight, and came back at 3am. It's been a few hours since and we haven't spoken a word to each other.   WIBTA if I just did what she told me to and stopped talking to her entirely for a few days? I think it might make me the AH because the silent treatment is petty and childish by default, and by giving up on communication entirely, I wouldn't be helping either of us. We're really close and usually good abt this stuff.	1642857336.0	sa2ak1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2ak1/wibta_if_i_gave_my_sister_the_silent_treatment/	WIBTA If I gave my sister the Silent Treatment for a few days?
fki6r6q9	For some backstory me(13f) and my dad(44m) have always had quite a good relationship. He supports me most of the time. However he hates short hair to the point he has always said that he’d be mad if I cut my hair. During the last 2 years I’ve experimented with my hair a bit. Bleached, dyed, cut. A week ago I decided that I needed a bit bigger of a change so I cut my hair almost to my shoulders. Dad was a bit mad but I was expecting more. Today my parents were talking (i was there as well). My dad starts by saying to my mom that I shouldn’t have cut my hair. My mom responds by saying that I can do whatever I wish to do with my hair. Then dad says that he believes that it looks ugly and unflattering. My mom reply’s by saying that it’s not unflattering and that hair will grow back and I’m expressing myself. I chime in by saying that I needed a change and didn’t feel pretty in my old hair. Dad gets mad saying that I am a girl and that girls should have long hair. That’s when I called him old-fashioned. He continues by saying that no one ever likes when he wants to give an opinion.

iwk481dm	I 35 female and my brother 34 used to be very close. He met a women online and decided to leave his family to be with her. At the time he already had a child here from a previous relationship. As his family was concerned over his repeat pattern of chasing tail and leaving his child for the family to take care of. We were against him leaving. He swore he was doing this to make a better life for his kid. Fast forward a few years later he’s been down there for a few years and the pandemic hits. His BM decided to let his child go down there and stay with him temporarily until school started again. When his  BM decides that it’s time for the child to go back home he refuses to drive the child back. So his BM flys out there to get the child only to be told by police where he lives at that she can’t. The BM has to go to court to get the child back. During all this both of our parents ended up having a stroke. He then informs everyone that in 60days he will be marrying this women as they had a child together. We inform him that we will not be able to go as we were still in the height of the pandemic and we’re concerned with the health of our parents. He proceeds to calls all of us selfish for not wanting to be there to celebrate his marriage. During this time both he and his wife begin posting this on social media bad mouthing my family. He begins to play the victim something he’s always done since we were kids but leaves out just how much our family has done for him and has always forgave him no matter what he did. I refused. The way I saw it is if this is what you want then you don’t need to be in my life. He made my child cry one day while they were on the phone and she began asking me what she did wrong and why doesn’t he love her anymore. I of course go into protective mom mode and inform her she did nothing wrong. He has since cut all ties with his family and has even blocked his eldest child off from social media and continues to bad mouth all of us. So am I the asshole for saying I now I have one brother instead of 2?	1642858461.0	sa2myf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa2myf/aita_for_saying_i_have_1_brother_now_instead_of_2/	AITA for saying I have 1 brother now instead of 2

404mvtdk	Backstory: I got my license about 3 months ago and have been driving my boyfriend (of one year) around since I got it. This includes trips several times per week to his house, the shops, hour long commutes to the beach, and a 7 hour drive on the day I got my license all around our area. Fuel prices went down about 3 weeks about and just recently went back up due to COVID. Before that, they were extremely high when I had to refuel. I only ever asked for money from him, because he’s the only person I drive basically, for half a tank when we drove down the coast. This was a long drive and I had no money and it caused a lot of arguing because he didn’t want to pay for it. BF got his license 3 weeks ago and has driven me about 10 times. He has always been weird about money, doesn’t pay for the things we do (it’s mostly me) and doesn’t pay me back unless I badger him. Recently he asked me to pay for his tank on his third drive with me when we went for about 40 mins to a movie. I refused and opted to pay for the $40 movie ticket for us (drive in).   On to it - I don’t have my car and asked him if he could pick me up tomorrow from a friends house. It’s about 5-10 mins from his house then 15 minutes to my house from there. He’s demanding that I pay him fuel money for this drive. I told him that the drive is only worth about $5 so he’s told me that’s what I’ll have to pay him because it’s a drive out of his way and fuel is expensive. I refused. I’ve done constant drives ‘out of my way’ for him to pick him up from his place, take him back to mine, drive him back home, then drive myself back from when we hang out. I pay for most of the stuff we do together, he makes double what I do at his job (I literally have $4 in my bank), my commute is 3x longer than his to work, I drove him around very often when he didn’t have a license, and put more effort and money into gifts whether randomly or for occasions. No one else is available and Uber is out of the question due to money. My friend is on my side but BF told me his Mum is on his side although I’m not sure she would have got the full story.

c7re00nj	I am the oldest female in my family with four other siblings. My parents married for over 20 years until they divorced in early 2020. For background, I do have older siblings, but I'm sure anyone from an ethnic or maybe a strict household knows that the eldest daughter is the second mum which I have been. My parents had divorced once before, in early 2018 but got back together around late mid of same year. During a couple of months of divorce in 2018, my dad had been with someone else but left them to get back to my mum but never told anyone.  Flash forward to early 2020, my mum discovered the relationship my dad had in the period they had broken up and filed for divorce. That's when my problems began.  My mum has been psychologically and emotionally abusive and manipulative; It doesn't make it better that I was such a naive child and always wanted to be enough for her. I was constantly told, "why can't you be more like your skinny friends" she even took it as far as going up to my best friend in yr7 and telling them to make me run around in the park and not to let me sit down when I'm around her. And that's not even a sliver of what she has done.  Anyway... After my parents divorced in 2020, I stepped up along with one of my older siblings to being parents for my younger siblings. This included taking the kids to school, dentist, doctor, school programmes, paying bills, being in school, and getting good grades. Somehow my brother and I did it, he graduated as an engineer, and I graduated high school with a scholarship to university. All was happening, and my mum refused to do anything. She would sit in her room,  becoming more manipulative and awful to everyone.  Last year (2021), I started university and had less time, whether it be online classes or classes that begin at 8:30 in the morning; I didn't have time. So she was forced to do work in the house.  Until one day my dad decided to move back. My mum went ballistic when she found out he was moving back to our hometown.   Sidenote: even after the divorce, my dad was still paying for the mortgage and bills in the house my mum lived in with us.  My dad said he would rent a place till he could buy a house (COVID days housing values were not good), but my mum said, "I'm moving".  Her moving was a shock to us because my dad hadn't even arrived in the country, and she had packed her bags in June and moved out. I was left to raise my siblings by myself while still trying to pass my classes at uni, so I didn't need to repeat as well as to keep my scholarship; my dad arrived in the country in September, so for 3 months, it was all me.  This all seems pretty cut and dry when I type it out, but the feeling of being an asshole comes from a week ago. I visited my mum, and she just started screaming and crying, telling me that she needed me and I wasn't there to help her in her darkest times. She said that "no daughter would ever do this to their mother."  My aunt has told me that what I did was wrong, so AITA.	1642860482.0	sa39f2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa39f2/aita_for_not_moving_houses_with_my_mum_after_she/	AITA for not moving houses with my mum after she took the divorce badly?
iwknrrqz	On mobile so please excuse ant grammar mistakes. Also English is not my first language.   A week or so ago, when a big snow/ ice storm came threw my town out in the country. I had a tree that fell, we did not notice until my neighbor came to my door yelling about it because it was causing her to miss her doctor appointment.        I was not home at the time so my wife sent my 14 male son down there to see if he could cut some of the tree out of the street so she could get around it.          He goes down there and she starts cussing him out and threatening him, blowing her horn. (She is about in her 60s so not a young person.) I have told my son to never retaliate unless someone does something horrible, or he feels like he is in danger.        He eventually gets enough of her, so he just leaves till I get home to help. I work close to the house so I'm home in about 15mins. I'm 35 male good size work out about 6 foot. When I walk down there to help he made good progress on it. So it is relatively easy. Note I told him to stay in the house but he came down anyway. ( I think to prove something?)     When we get the road clear, I stop her and say.

i5c457ev	I (23F) recently started taking a real estate class and when I did that my bf offered to pay my expenses while I was in the class and until I could start building a client list and making money.  My old job that I left was at the gym, I was planning on going there to work out and just paying the monthly $50 fee.  My bf currently goes there and that's where we met.    I asked him if he could add me to his account and he said that I can just come to his house because he has everything I would need to work out.  I told him I like the gym better, and he said that I an being stubborn and I can go if I pay for it myself.  I feel like the deal was he would pay my expenses, and this is a reasonable expense.  He is the one who convinced me to do this, I was planning on staying at my job.	1642861414.0	sa3kfm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa3kfm/aita_for_wanting_to_go_to_the_gym_instead_of/	AITA for wanting to go to the gym instead of using my bf's home gym?

I'm required to be at the store, clocked in, ready to go at 8 am.  However I don't have building access. I have to have a manager open the doors.

2n3wrqat	I have a best friend of 17 years and 6 months ago asked if she wants to be my maid of honour and she said a big YES!   2 weeks ago, we had a small gathering with the people who is a part of the wedding to finalise the wedding plans and that’s when i got to know that she’s 6 months pregnant. She didn’t make an announcement during the gathering or look pregnant as she was wearing a baggy sweatshirt with jeans. Just that she was eating a lot and one of my bridesmaid teased her if she “got a bun in the oven” and she just laughed it off. Later during the gathering, the same bridesmaid teased her and saying “how amazing your food baby seems real” while rubbing my best friend’s belly and only to realise that its an actual baby bump.   The crowd went crazy and congratulate her but at that point, i felt a little uneasy as how she will steal my thunder during the wedding since most 95% of my guest knows her. She then thank and told everyone that this gathering isn’t about her and it’s about me, and it will be the same during wedding.  After the gathering, i called her and told her that I was upset how she didn’t tell me about the pregnancy and how it will steal my thunder during my wedding. She told me that she only plan to tell about her pregnancy nearing to the end of the pregnancy itself and as of now, only her and her husband’s family knows and the people who are at the gathering. She told me that her dress is not tight fitted and there will be a drape covering front of the dress and it will not show the bump and I don’t have to worry because all focus will be on me since I’m the bride.  I felt like she didn’t know how I was feeling since she didn’t have a wedding like mine. Hers is a just a small solemnisation with a high tea and it was a quick one as she always like it close and intimate ceremony.   I told her that I don’t want her in the wedding as she will steal the show and will definitely look very pregnant walking down the isle and might not be able run her maid of honour duties. She told me it’s fine and she’s just attend as a guest but told her not even the wedding and i don’t think I’m inviting her anymore. She told it’s fine by her so she can just get rested before bursting. We both hung up.   The following day, few of my bridesmaid told me that they don’t want to be part of the wedding after knowing that i uninvited my best friend. I got so furious and asked my best friend why she told everyone that shes uninvited and she told me “If you think i told everyone that you uninvited me just because you think i will steal your thunder since I’m pregnant, you’re just kidding yourself. They got to know since i met them to plan a surprise hen night for you since i wont be in the wedding but it seems like you don’t deserve any kind of surprises.” I felt like she’s just creating stories and stirring shits about me.  Now, most of my bridesmaids wont be a part of my wedding and they’re calling a selfish mean bitch just because i dont want her to steal my thunder.

5cq7wdqt	I called my freind crazy last night out of frustration, he has mental health issues and self diagnosed autism I gues and he got so upset he called me so many really hurtful names I wouldent say to someone thats rly my freind an he said he dosent wana be my freind if we dident talk about what happend I guess but I really dident want to because we were arguing all night.  Context is I picked him up cuz he was not in a great mood so I drove him around an it started when he kept messing with my radio and continuoly because I gues his audio sensativity was acting up even know we listen to music all the time he said it only happens in cars idk.  But thats all fine who am I to say what he does an doesent feel I jus want him to be happy.  However he eventully just kept putting stress on me when I explained to him I was rly stressed from collage an other drama ,but he really could not stop like basicly saying how his mental health is fucked up an he's messed up and he wouldent even let me comment because he constantly interrupted or talked over me which he blamed everything he did that could be considered inconsiderate on his  mental health also kept saying that I don't understand an all this stuff an I talked to him about it for a while engaged an such but after a while I was exhausted an explained to him he was stressing me out which he did not like just kinda got mad at me kept saying I don't understand an im doin everything I my power to help him feel better.  Fast forward to my house he's basicly getting on me about what I was saying to him an stuff he kept bothering me such as I was just talking to him about his lifestyle / medications and how he feels about them etc..  well this turned into an argument an he was so adimate about squashing it but I'm so tired I just wanted to forget it so I said let's not talk about it again an then he dident wana be freinds an this turned into a heavier argument cuz that rly suprised an hurt me we've been freinds for a while an so after much more back and forth I called him crazy then he said a bunch of really hurtful shit about me an I told him it was a mistake I was just frustrated cuz I don't rly think he is but hes just like YOU THINK IM CRAZZZY AHHHI HATE THAT and stuff which I totaly understand if he dosent I dident mean to but he went so far I explained to him it was a mistake I apoligiezed and he deleted me on discord.

h4lrlyjl	So right now I feel pretty bad, because what I said was pretty mean. I just wanted somewhere to ensure that I was in the right.  I (35M) live on a homestead in North Carolina. It's great, I hunt and fish for a living. It's important to note that I never borrow any money, and I don't have to pay for food, water, or electricity (I have solar panels going, I hunt, trap, and fish for food, and i filter my own water). My sister (20F) lives in NYC, doing part time college so that she can try at a modeling career. She hasn't had work in a long time, and my parents pay for all of her expenses.  I was calling my mom and sister when they all of the sudden latched onto how I don't really have a job. I tried to explain that I don't need one, because I have a lot of private property where I get my own food and water. They insisted that I was going to be a failure in life is either my wife or I didn't get a job.  I blew up, and said that my sister was setting herself up for failure by dropping all of her classes, latching onto a nonexistent career, and not making any money, despite really needing to make it.  My parents have texted me, cussing me out and saying that I shouldn't have been so harsh, but I think I was right.

fo6wwlq2	For context , me and a group 8-9 guys were at a bachelor party. I knew about 4 of the guys including the groom from college and the rest of the guys were High-school friends (HSF for short) of the groom.  I was also one of the best men- it matters because I feel like it might have made the high school friends of the groom feel some type of way.  During the day we are all drinking having a good time and getting along. However the group of HSF would normally go inside around 11pm for bed- which seemed early for me and my group of friends, as we wanted to keep the party going. So we kept the party going, playing music around the fire outside a good distance from the house-albeit it was loud, but no neighbors were home, and it was a good distance from the house. We were there for a good time and a celebration. The next morning one of the HSF made a remark about us playing music and staying up late, we all laughed it off and went on as a group to do bachelor party things.   The next afternoon we are playing beer darts , where everyone sits in a lawn chair. I grab a chair from the deck and bring it 50 feet to the area. Again having a good time, eventually it’s getting dark and someone started a fire , I bring the same chair to the fire and sit down next to everyone.  Here’s where I might be the asshole. We have plenty of seating for the group, and I’m sitting next to one of the HSF. He goes, that’s my chair you need to get up and change with me. Both of our chairs were just lawn chairs nothing fancy. At first I thought he was joking and I laughed it off, but then he insisted again louder. At this point everyone just kinda looking at us, and I asked him if he’s really gonna make me get up? He insists again. I get up and said I didn’t know we had assigned seating here’s your damn chair,  gave him his chair and got my own- a different one from the one he was sitting in.

Well, he gets back and surprises me and my other younger brother with tickets to the packer game today!    We both of course say yes, since we've only been to one other game in our lives. However, my wife (married in just October 2021, been together since 2016) is very upset. She is mad that she will be home alone all day and night until I get home around 1am.   I've explained to her how we do everything together, and that this one day isn't the end of the world. She is still very upset.

5ydxzo8n	This happened yesterday morning. I went to a coffee shop near my work to pick up a hot chocolate before work. Now, I know when you go to a coffee shop, you are expected to order coffee. But I enjoy the taste of their peppermint hot chocolate and it was a cold morning after a busy and stressful week at work. This was my treat for myself. I order through the drive through and nothing seems unusual. I get to the window, pay, and as I’m waiting for my drink, the barista starts to strike up a conversation. Usually I don’t mind this (I know it’s a part of their job), and no one was behind me waiting. BUT, the barista was just rude! She started out this conversation by saying “So why didn’t you order coffee? Just don’t like it?” Now, the reason I don’t order coffee is because I have a multitude of health issues and caffeine can make it harder on my health and could cause my meds to interact so poorly that it can cause liver damage. But I’m not about to tell a barista that, so I just say “No, I enjoy coffee, but I have to stop drinking it for health reasons.” To which she replies “Oh let me guess, your doctor said to cut back on caffeine because it’s bad for fat people. Don’t worry, my doctor said the same thing to me.” Now, I will admit I have some fat, but who says that to a complete stranger. By that point, I had my drink and I went to work. At the bottom of the survey, there was a survey and while I rarely do these, this was not something I could ignore. So I put the entire conversation down and explained how upset it made me. I got an email from the corporate office saying that that kind of behavior is not tolerated and that this person was let go. Whether or not that is true, I don’t know. I feel like I’m the AH because I didn’t want her to get fired, especially in these conditions because it can be hard to find a job. But at the same time, I shouldn’t be shamed for getting something other than coffee at a coffee place.

90plj4lx	So I live with my grandparents at the moment as I don't have the money to live on my own. I also adopted a Siberian Husky during this time. I am financially responsible for her and am currently working on paying my grandparents back for her December vet visit. I couldn't pay for her December vet visit due to being wrongfully terminated the week before Thanksgiving in November and the Grinch stole our Christmas (Covid. My grandparents are fine and I never got it).  When I adopted my husky in 2020, we had no idea that she had any medical issues. After adoption, the first piece of medical equipment we got for her is the donut cone as she had gone through spay surgery two days before adoption. Come April of 2021, she got very sick and was attacking her ears at lot. She found a way around the donut and so I went out with her and my grandma to get an actual cone. My grandma went to help me keep her from scratching in the car. She had developed 3 ear infections at the the same time which we later find out in June that it is due to a potato allergy. She has been to the vet 7 times in 2021  My grandpa sees both of these medical devices as stupid, silly, and not necessary, and will remove them before a walk, against my wishes (he will never tell me those reasons, so I got them from my grandma). He walks my husky as he loves to walk her. They will travel up to 6 miles on nice days, on a 30 ft leash. Each time My husky needs to wear either her cone or her donut, I tell him that she needs to wear it due to x reason. This time it is due to her having developed 4 strange spots on her face that has me and her vet stumped. 2 of the 4 spots are now gone. I have confronted him about it several times and each time he tells me that he does it so she can sniff and interact with other dogs and ignores what I said.  I am frustrated and at this point tempted to bring up the fact that I pay for her things and so me and her vet makes the rules about what medical devices she needs to wear. WIBTA if I did that.  My grandma stays out of disputes between me and my grandpa as she does not want to be verbally abused by my grandpa	1642864027.0	sa4f7s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4f7s/wibta_if_i_put_my_foot_down_when_it_comes_to_my/	WIBTA if I put my foot down when it comes to my dog
bz4r251c	I (30F) am getting married to my fiance in May.   I was adopted when I was a baby and my adoptive parents did their best to raise me and support me through college. We always had a good relationship and I obviously love them.  When I was 23 I decided to search for my biological parents,and long story short they were teenagers when they had me . They are still together and they have 2 more children. They said they wanted to keep me but they couldn't raise me so they decided to put me up for adoption. The thing that really hurt me was that in my childhood and teenage years they tried to contact my adoptive parents and have a relationship with me,but my adoptive parents refused.  When I confronted my adoptive parents they said that they were afraid that I might prefer my biological parents,so they tried to keep them away.  I was hurt and disappointed and decided to go low contact. Over the years we managed to build a better relationship but it's not like before.  So ,for my wedding I decided to ask my biological father to walk me down the aisle and he obviously said yes. When my adoptive parents learnt it they were hurt and said that their worst fear had come to reality and if I insist to put my biological parents before them then I shouldn't invite them to the wedding.  My answer was that they are not invited then. Since then all my adoptive family are calling an asshole. So AITA?

2pfao4gv	Roommate and I have known each other for 10+ years. We moved into an apartment together in 2019. To our living room, I brought a futon, and Roommate brought a couch.  * In 2019, I expressed interest in buying a sectional. I never have because Roommate wanted to keep the couch, and we didn’t have anywhere else to put it in the apartment. * We moved into a house in late 2021. It is way more space, but the couch doesn’t fit through the bedroom doors or down the stairs to basement storage. I have moved my futon to an upstairs bedroom. I want to buy a sectional for the living room. * I spend most of my after-work time and weekend time in the living room. Roommate spends ~15min per week in the room, chatting and/or petting the dog. * The couch in question is covered in dog hair and drool, has a large rip in one cushion with stuffing peaking out, and is generally not well-maintained. * Roommate has no emotional attachment to the couch, and I would buy a sectional with enough seating to replace it. Roommate states the reason for keeping the couch is that buying furniture is stressful, and if we hypothetically stop being roommates, they do not want to have to shop for another one. * I offered to give Roommate $600 for the couch, to make it my couch to decide what to do with. They state that the stress of having to buy a couch in the future is worth “thousands of dollars.”  * I asked them to put it on the curb, since it won’t fit anywhere else in the house, and I want the living room space for a new sectional.

8m37z6yk	My brother has always been a lot more sociable. I’m more of a shut in nerd who likes to read and play video games. Yesterday, my brother decided to pay me a visit and showed up to my house without telling me. So I let him in we talk a little and we go back to what I was doing(reading and replaying Pokémon Black). Around lunch I’m not hungry so I don’t think about it. Then my brother’s friends come over. I wasn’t really thinking and closed my door like we did when we were younger. Except for now we don’t live in the same house, he’s visiting. I am not confrontational, and, while I’m good at wielding the many swords and knives I own, don’t like threatening people or making them feel threatened. So I think,‘they’ll just hang out for a bit and then leave.’ I was wrong. A few hours later my brother says that they got food and I could have some if I wanted. I checked the time and my stomach was right about wanting dinner. I’m really uncomfortable eating around people I don’t/barely know, so I tell him I’ll eat later. Later never came. After a few hours he asked why i wasn’t eating, and I told him that his friends being here was making me uncomfortable. He was like,‘ but they’re my friends’ and I told him it didn’t really make any difference. One of my legs started hurting(not that uncommon and I keep a cane around in case it gets hard to walk) so I moved to my bed which didn’t help much. I ended up falling asleep. When I wake up I sit in my bed a little longer. After a minute I hear a vehicle moving on my driveway, and I see one of his friends leaving. My house is silent. I ask where he is and don’t get a reply. So I guess he’s with his friends wherever they are. I grab a change of clothes and take a shower. This is my priority since I take showers later at night but, well, who takes showers with strangers around. After I’m done showering he says he’s with one of his friends and the others left. Oh, and that he left me a McGriddle. So I microwave the McGriddle and eat. Then I clean up the glasses, McDonald’s cups, pizza boxes, bear cans. Wait, I don’t drink and don’t keep alcohol. Whatever. So I wait, fearing apple car play, for him to return to ask the question of the day. When he does return, I ask if he and his friends could hangout somewhere else so that I wouldn’t be as uncomfortable. He said that there wasn’t anywhere else they could and to suck it up. So I’m wondering if I’m taking this too seriously and possibly inhibiting his ability to hangout with his friends, but either way I still don’t want them here.	1642864492.0	sa4kzq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4kzq/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_he_and_his/	AITA for telling my brother that he and his friends should hangout somewhere else
63s1cghq	I don’t know if I’m the jerk or not but I feel really frustrated. Since I was about 16 I’d planned with my step mom to go get our first tattoos together. I turned 18 last year and due to Covid we weren’t able to go get our tattoos. She eventually went out of state for some family issues and while she’s been gone she ended up getting a tattoo without me.   The reason I am upset is the fact that we both promised to get our tattoos together and have been discussing them for the past two years I even designed the tattoo she was originally planning to get. It’s not matching tattoos or anything but it was a very special thing for me. I was going to get the tattoo with her specifically because my own is a very special tattoo that celebrates two years of sobriety. And she was the main factor in helping me get sober which is why I was going to go with her. But now I feel like she didn’t care about that at all she left and just got it done and didn’t even tell me. I had to find out from someone else entirely and bring it up to her. Now here is where I feel like I’d be the jerk if I told her how I feel.   The person who did her tattoo just lost their 16 month old and wasn’t able to complete the tattoo for her so it’s not a complete first tattoo but I feel like if we where to go get hers finished and mine started it would defeat the entire purpose of going in the first place I’m sad and hurt but I don’t want to be selfish because I know her intentions weren’t to hurt me she just wanted a tattoo	1642865257.0	sa4uds	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa4uds/aita_for_being_disappointed_that_my_step_mom_got/	AITA for being disappointed that my step mom got a tattoo without me ?
ijlx2ufe	 I apologize for the formatting as I’m on mobile.  I (ftm19) live with my mother(55f), boyfriend(19m), and sister(31f). My mother has always let her friends-in-need stay at our home for a few days at a time, which is perfectly fine since she’s been doing it since before I was born, until recently.   Her friend “N” (43f) has been coming over for maybe three days, leaves for two, then comes back. I get it, we’re still in a pandemic, sometimes life is hard and people just need a little help. I never had an issue with her until she started getting a little too comfortable.   The thing is, she just opens the bathroom door (there’s no lock so we knock) while someone is in there, no knocking at all! One day I heard my boyfriend scream and when I opened my door (adjacent to the bathroom door) I saw her just staring at him, I asked her what the hell she was doing since the shower curtains are TRANSPARENT and she said “I need to pee, but I got caught off guard by your boyfriend, he shouldn’t scare me like this!” I told her to get out and wait until he’s done but she insisted she needed to pee now. I pulled her out and shut the door and told her she’s making him uncomfortable In his own home. She said he doesn’t need someone to speak for him and he can tell her how he feels to her face. I told her to knock because this isn’t her home.  Onto the issue, I was showering today and when I had gotten out, the door slightly opened, now I have extremely quick reflexes and immediately hit the door shut, I’ll admit pretty hard, but I was butt-naked! She screamed, I quickly covered myself and opened the door, She started screaming at me, I tried to get her to calm down but I was also pissed that she again invaded my personal space, I told her it’s her fault for not only not knocking, but just opening the door in general as she knows we keep our bathroom door open if it’s not in use and that she needs to take the damn hint.    I told my mother who agreed she needs to stop doing that, but admitted I was out of line for slamming the door in her face, and that I should have said I was in there, I tried to explain previous incidents and that she doesn’t even give me time to say anything with how she basically whips the door open, my mother acknowledged it and still said I need to apologize for slamming the door.

A lot of the times I’m not at the apartment because i work and take care of my grandmother so I figured I would let my brother stay there. But he has his girlfriend (17 yo as well), and a big ass dog over that im not allowed to have in my apartment since I already have two cats (although they are not there right now.) My mom sucks and didn’t raise any of her children right and I was raised by my dad who was an amazing man so don’t come for me due to the fact that he’s 17 and letting his gf stay over there. Im not his mother.   I set clear boundaries, no sleeping in my bed, no fucking in my bed, cut shit off when ur done cause IM THE ONE PAYING ALL THE BILLS CURRENTLY yet I come over and the fucking TV has been on all night and find them both sleeping in my damn bed that I paid for. I was nice enough to let him stay because my mom can’t let him stay with her cause she doesn’t even have a place of her own, and because his grandparents kicked him out and called the police on him (I paid his bond and bailed him out lol) He has nowhere to go.   I’m so over this. I don’t like being confrontational and my dad isn’t here to give me advice on what to say or how to go about it. My grandmother had a bad feeling and was pissed about him staying with me, I guess she was right. I wouldn’t mind if it was just him even though I’d still prefer him to not be in my bed.

It was overall a fun night but - a lot of the girls were spending so much time on their phone. Many of them were taking pictures, which I usually don't mind - but it became quite excessive. After these photoshoots had taken place, the girls sat with their phone for at least 20 minutes, followed by conversations of how fat and ugly they all felt like they looked. They were all beautiful, which I also told them.  Then the conversation at the table started to revolve heavily around talking bad/gossiping about other girls. It got kind of mean. There was this one girl, whom they referred to as "the forehead", since they thought she had a "big ugly forehead" (mind you, this girl was stunning). Then they (including my friend) moved on to some other girls instagram, where they laughed at a picture she had taken with her friends, cause "they look so pretty, and she is so ugly" (again, this girl was beautiful".  This went on for quite a bit, and at one point I said something about them all being beautiful, and that there was absolutely no need for speaking this ugly about other women. When they said that some of these women were terrible, I said that they were probably just insecure - and that we should only pity that, and then pay it no mind. It wasn't a big thing, and they agreed a bit, but continued the trash talking. I stood my ground, and (in a nice way) reminded them that these "ugly" girls were insecure, and that we shouldn't talk so bad about them.  When the night ended I felt bad, even a bit sad. I refuse to speak negatively about other peoples appearance, ESPECIALLY other women, who very likely struggle with body- and selfimage, since unfortunately most of us do.  So - today I spoke with my friend about how I felt, and she disagreed with me heavily. She told me, that she had actually been wanting to talk to me about this night, because she was disappointed in me. She said, that I had been acting better than everyone, and had been putting her down, embarrassing her (she refers to when I told them, that they shouldn't speak so bad about these other girls on instagram). She said that I took it way too seriously, and shouldn't act holy, since I used to participate in this kind of talk/gossip. I told her that I don't like it, and that I think we're getting too old for this.  Although I do stand my ground, and refuse to speak this way about other girls, she did made me doubt a bit; Am I taking stuff like this too seriously?	1642866477.0	sa59lm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa59lm/aita_for_not_wanting_to_talk_about_other_girls/	AITA for not wanting to talk about other girls?
daswe3x9	I (27F) got married a few weeks ago. My husband (28M) and I had a very conventional wedding except my dad (53M) didn't walk me down the aisle. I was very uncomfortable at the idea of being "transferred" from my family to my husband's family like I'm something to be owned.  My dad is a veteran and pretty traditional with marriage. He has a lot of childhood trauma and has overcompensated by being extremely involved with my life even when he was on duty. When I told him how I didn't want to walk him down the aisle, he got very pissed off, called me an AH, and said I was overthinking something that was just supposed to be a sweet moment.  He showed up to the wedding but was very cold towards me. He has not responded to my texts or calls either. My mother (53F) and two brothers (30M and 33M) are also calling me an AH because apparently my dad has been talking about walking his only daughter down the aisle for years.  I still think my dad is an AH for making such a big deal about something so small. I don't know if I'm being stubborn or if I did the right thing by holding my ground.

iwo6r3n3	First off: alt account, my BIL uses reddit.  I (35F) have a husband (37M) who has ADHD. This isn't anything new, I knew about it when we started dating 16 years ago. We have one child (7M).  Because of his ADHD, my husband struggles with a lot of everyday tasks, especially ones that require him to remember to do things. This has been a source of problems for our entire marriage, and we have spent a lot of time and effort getting things to where they are now. It's incredibly frustrating at times, but I don't blame my husband for that (I'm frustrated at the medical needs, not at him). But the point is, we have to do things differently to keep the house functional.  For some tasks, I just do them myself for the sake of "It makes everyone's lives easier if I just do it". I'm the one who wakes up my husband in the morning (I get up earlier than him anyway so this isn't a problem), and I remind him to take his medication (either in person or by text at the right times). Beyond that, we have a chore chart. Myself, my husband, and our son are all included on it. It's a little more detailed than the usual chore chart though, because I also list the times people should be starting their chores on it. We tried it in the past without times listed and my husband kept forgetting if he did them or not. Chores are split with our son handling a few of the age-appropriate chores and the rest are split 50/50 between myself and my husband. This is the arrangement we came to after years and years of trial and error in finding ways that worked with my husband's needs, and we're both happy with the results.  This last time my in laws visited (we're all vaxxed so we do visits sometimes), MIL saw the chart and said it was demeaning to my husband because I didn't write 'start by' times on my chores, only next to my husband's and son's chores. I pointed out that our son got stickers for finishing his chores but that my husband didn't (I think giving stickers to my husband actually would be demeaning to him), but she said that didn't matter. I tried to explain that he needed the reminders to actually do the chores and that we had worked this out as a way to get him to do his chores without nagging him. She said that including times on it was still nagging him, just indirectly.   Later that night I asked my husband if he felt like I was treating him like a child, and he just laughed it off and said "You know how my mom is. Don't think too much about it, I'm not bothered." But it still is bothering me. My husband was treated as incapable for most of his childhood because of his ADHD and I don't want to treat him the way his parents and older siblings did. They weren't horrible to him, they just tended to go "let me do it" instead of helping him do things on his own. He's my partner, not a second child I need to mind, and he deserves the respect of a partner. So, AITA for my chore chart?	1642866454.0	sa59bj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa59bj/aita_for_having_a_chore_chart_for_my_husband/	AITA for having a chore chart for my husband?
91mkudm0	She was out with her friends and I was out with mine…middle of the night we meet up and decide to stick together…on the way we run into some guys who are my mates but she barely knows them. Anyway, she says “hey baby” to them (there’s 3, one which she never even speaks to) and gives them each a hug and a kiss on the cheek….I texted her and told her how I felt. After 5mins we run into a friend of mine that she met last week and guess what…same thing. “Hi baby” kiss on cheek and hug. I told her I was leaving because I didn’t feel comfortable. One of the guys even looked at me weird, the look was like “are you sure this is your girl” kind of look…it was long and awkward but we got past it. Idk how to feel, this is all happening right in front of me. Can’t blame alcohol at the end of the day because who knows how she is when she’s out and I’m not around. I told her i felt sick and I just wanted to leave, she cried and said sorry but that doesn’t exactly fix everything.

iwo6pn69	I'm new to this and i'm sure it'll get no responses but it's worth a try.  Okay, so I'm a woman in my 20s and I have a few siblings, and lots of nieces and nephews but no kids myself. We were all going to stay at our parents' house and I was pretty excited. I got there and everything was good until I was informed by my mother that I was going to sleep on the couch.. Now, I grew up in that house and although I do not live there anymore I have my own bedroom that I sleep in whenever I stay there, so I was confused as to why I'd have to sleep on the couch. She told me that two of the kids were sleeping in my room.  Now maybe it's my fault for not thinking through all the possibilities of where everyone could be sleeping, but this was kinda strange to me. Couldn't they have moved mattresses onto the floor of their parents' room and slept with them? I brought this up and was told by my brother and sister in law that they assumed they were gonna get the night to themselves. If they really wanted the night to themselves, couldn't they have slept on the couch (there's certainly enough space for two)? I brought this up and was told I was being very rude and inconsiderate.  I wouldnt have cared that much, but it's quite cold in the living room and the couch in my parents' house isn't very comfortable, like it's actually pretty hard. Look, if I had to sleep on there I would. But I didn't have to, I could've slept in my room, there was no reason for the kids to sleep in my room. I'm also a very light sleeper and I know that some people in my family wake up very, very early and I wouldn't have appreciated being woken up at 5am to someone making breakfast (the living room is right next to the kitchen). So yeah, it was all a recipe for a hellish few nights for me. And I was pissed. I told my mom, brother and sister in law that they were the rude ones and that they were making something that could've been dealt with easily into a big deal. My brother said that he didnt understand how sleeping on the couch was a big deal.. Long story short I ended up staying at a nearby hotel (with my own money) and am still pretty annoyed but my family insists that I was in the wrong. Fast forward to now my friend told me I should post here and here I am.	1642866753.0	sa5d35	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5d35/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_up_my_bedroom_in_my/	AITA for not wanting to give up my bedroom in my parents' house for my nieces/nephews?
7wqzaa94	I work in a lab together with a few other students, one of them is a 20-something guy. Problem is that he stinks so bad that it's unbearable to be in the same room as him. He constantly smells of old sweat, like he hasn't showered, washed his clothes or used deodorant in weeks. Even after he has left, the smell hangs around in rooms/corridors where he has been. Even his jacket smells so bad that when I approach the coat rack I instantly know that the jacket hanging there is his. A while ago me and the students and teachers that work at the lab went to a bar to get some drinks, including the sweaty guy. I dared hoping that since we were going out he would at least shower and put on some fresh clothes, but no, he arrived at the bar stinking just as bad as he normally did.  I'm not sure if he truly doesn't know how bad he smells or if he just doesn't care, but I often find myself going to sit in the cafeteria instead of doing the work I'm supposed to be doing because of how uncomfortable the smell is. Surely I can't be the only one that's bothered by this, but I doubt anyone else has said something. We are both master's students and will both be looking for jobs in a short while, and I'm just imagining him turning up to a job interview smelling terribly and obviously not getting the job. Other than the smell he's a nice guy.

iwnj3tta	My mom and i always had some issues. She wasn't the best mom, I think she wanted me to be more like her, and she was more focused on how much my dad hurt her than on being a mom. She met "Eric" when I was 15. He had his 14 year old sister "Daisy" living with him because his dad is an alcoholic and he just kind of took Daisy and the parents never did anything about it.  Daisy was kind of mean and would play little pranks on me when she had friends over. Eric never took on a parent role with Daisy and acted like an older brother, not a dad, so she essentially had no rules, no discipline, and my mom didn't care because she was so in love with Eric. Daisy was very attention seeking and would make rude comments to get attention, but she was also more like my mom and I think my mom liked her more than me.  One day at school I just lost my temper because she poured water on my chair and I said the reason she is such a bitch is because.... and exposed some of her childhood abuse that I knew about because I overheard Eric telling my mom. Other kids did hear this and Daisy went home crying. Eric screamed at me and called me names like evil and jealous, and my mom didn't really do anything. My mom told me she was ashamed of me and made me stay with my dad and his 21 year old awful girlfriend for 6 months so Daisy could "recover"  I do see what I did was wrong, but it was a result of her picking on me for a year and them doing nothing because "kids will be kids" or "you're too sensitive" Daisy and I don't see much of each other as adults. Maybe the occasional family holiday but that's it. My mom and I have a strained relationship, but Daisy and Eric are still close, so she sees more of my mom. My mom also has some crazy narrative in her head that the reason we don't get along as adults is because I'm jealous of Daisy's marriage and my mom doesn't listen when I tell her that is asinine.   Recently Daisy texted me that she was throwing a surprise 25th anniversary party for my mom and Eric and wanted to know if I wanted "credit" which she clarified did I want to be considered a host because she thought i'd feel awkward if I wasn't involved. I responded that I wanted nothing to do with this party because they shouldn't even be married. My mom should have put her kid first and not put me in that situation, and Daisy should leave me alone after all she is the reason I didn't have a family growing up.  Daisy just wrote back lol, but my husband says I overreacted and she was being nice.	1642867340.0	sa5knb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5knb/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_stepdads_sister_for/	AITA for getting mad at my stepdad's sister for reaching out to me after she destroyed my family?
iwnun06a	Not sure if this is the place to post but want outsiders opinions. My sister and I were walking our dogs on a beach close to our house. This is known as an off leash beach before a certain time and you rarely see dogs on leash. We had our dogs off leash and we came across someone coming from the opposite direction with an off leash dog as well, our dogs greeted each other and then my sister and I called our dogs back (they came back to us) and then started playing and the other persons dog came closer to them to investigate, they were playing a bit rough, and it seem to scare the other dog as it then turned and hid by the owner. The owner then asked us to put our dogs on the leash, which we did. We also then decided to turn around to head back the way we came to go home. The other dog and owner were walking that was as well - and this person kept their dog off leash and the dog was running up by us (about 20 feet away, so not right next to us, but also not next to the owner). We ask them to put their dog on a leash and they responded that their dog was better behaved (there was no evidence from our encounter that our dogs were poorly behaved…). They then yelled “why don’t you walk that way” pointing the way they came. We said we live down here and just kept walking and deciding not to engage. The other person turned around. I don’t know if this is an AITA for asking them to put their dog on a leash/ making them turn around by saying we lived down the way we were walking?	1642866822.0	sa5dxu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5dxu/aita_walking_on_the_beach_with_two_off_leash_dogs/	AITA Walking on the beach with two off leash dogs, we run into another off leash dog
c7ijr3jr	So not a huge deal but I’m sitting here bewildered as to if I really am at fault here. My husband (48m) and I (30f) just had an argument over a pair of adidas slides. Originally I had bought them before Christmas as just an anything gift, he told me how comfortable they were and how much he liked wearing mine to do things around the house to do housework or just chill out in so I thought a nice gesture would be to buy him some. Well they arrived through fedex after 2 weeks and even though they were the size he told me they were too big. So I requested an exchange by mail and I asked him to take care of it since I work a lot and am barely home. He did and the new shoes came in and they were too small. I was a little annoyed because he still hadn’t chosen the right size but he told me we could just do the exchange by mail again and he would get it right this time. I submitted a request again and asked him to please take care of it. Well now the window of exchange has passed he didn’t take care of it and this morning I got an email saying they will no longer take them and now because it’s been a certain amount of time I can no longer exchange them at all. So I tell him let him know and I say “ you f-Ed up because you didn’t take care of this and now I have these shoes that  neither of us can wear”. I shouldn’t have cursed and he immediately told me so and I apologized right after and said I shouldn’t have said that but I’m upset you didn’t take care of this. That got him super upset and he said it’s too early for me to accuse him of things and I should shut the f up. When I pointed out that he shouldn’t be cussing at me because he told me not to he said “ I don’t f-ing give a F”. He told me I was trying to turn things around on him and now I act all innocent like I am trying to be the better person. I said my feelings are hurt that you didn’t give this enough thought and he called me a C word. He then tried to throw money at me because of the “money I wasted” and said he didn’t want to be around me and stormed out the door. I just feel like I was trying to de escalate a situation but maybe I should have handled his gift on my own. Am I the asshole for not handling exchanging his gift for the correct size because it was something I purchased?	1642867771.0	sa5q4u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5q4u/aita_for_buying_my_husband_shoes_and_not_getting/	AITA for buying my husband shoes and not getting him the size he needs?
itjm7xum	Recently one of my best friends was diagnosed with cancer. She’s expected to make a full recovery. However, I wanted to throw a benefit dinner for her since she couldn’t work and still had a little one to take care of. I asked her permission and she gave me the go ahead. I found a hall to rent put my down payment on it, I called the local high schools to put out feelers for kids to help work the dinner and earn community service hours to graduate. I wanted to do a Chinese auction and went to local businesses to ask for donations. I priced out spaghetti and had a local restaurant that wanted to donate the meatballs, the Pepsi plant was going to donate drinks etc. About 4 weeks from the date my friends aunt wanted to “help” me plan this. I let her call me and she tells me that I’m not prepared enough and I need to postpone it because she thinks I couldn’t pull it off by myself. She was extremely rude to me on the phone and asked if I had any cash donations and any cash needed to be given to her to hold on to. Which I that point I had not, she questioned me about how I was paying for everything without cash donations to which I told her I had payed everything out of my own money. She told me that I wouldn’t be getting any of that back out of the money raised. Her being so concerned about the money made me extremely uncomfortable.  Her aunt called me again and said that she wanted to go to dinner to talk about the benefit dinner with my friends mother there as well. We meet and go over things and they were still stressing the money situation and how expensive everything would be and how we should aim for a certain date after the holidays so everyone would be available. I called and canceled my hall rental and let the schools know the event was postponed. Months have gone by and nobody had reached out to me until two days ago when the aunt messaged me on Facebook saying that they needed the “stuff” I had for the benefit dinner because it was going to be on Feb 7th (which was not the postponed date). I told them I didn’t keep accepting donations and I never picked any others up because we didn’t have a set date and didn’t feel comfortable taking things for something I wasn’t sure was happening and told the donators that I’d get back to them with a set date, I also told the aunt I was expecting more than a two week heads ups and I wouldn’t be available on that date due to going to do training in another state for my job but I’d be more than happy to give her the locations and people who were interested in donating. She then told me I was ruining everything and didn’t care about my friend and they’d need my decorations and table coverings I had already purchased. I stopped replying and stopped answering her calls. Am I the asshole for not wanting to hand over my donators list/decorations after all of that? My friend hasn’t said a word to me about any of it.	1642867508.0	sa5mt9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5mt9/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_with_a_benefit_dinner/	AITA for not wanting to “help” with a benefit dinner?
hfpy0pg2	So I'm 23F and a friend of mine is the same, 23F. We are studying together in college, and although we aren't extremely close, we are close. She had her birthday around 2 days ago and although I wouldn't mind attending her birthday party, I had a ton of work from my part time and had to complete all of that. Furthermore, I had a kind of "quest" given, which if I could complete, I would get extra pay for a while and some benefits. However, the deadline was on that friend's birthday party. I told my friend that I won't be coming on text, and then started with the work. It took me quite a while to finish, and although I took frequent breaks, I was pretty damn sleepy afterwards.  Next day, I went to college. I did get my extra pay and benefits which were so good, you could call them a steal. In simple terms, I was filled with enthusiasm and energy down to my very last atom. But right when I stepped in, I saw that same friend completely quiet and sad. I figured it was because I didn't attend her birthday party, and well, I was right, but what was worse was that no one else attended it either.  I was plunged into a void where I compared her happiness to money. I am totally clueless as to whether I was wrong or not. I'm not gonna ask for advice to lift her up or not; I know what to do either way. All I wanna know is if I'm the asshole.

9zb99qel	This story involves me (M 32), my former friend (will refer to as "FF", F 28), & her best friend (F 29).  A couple years ago, I decided to participate in half-marathon with my FF's best friend. As the event wasn't local, we decided to spent the night near the event & FF decided to join us. This was a pretty big deal to me as I'd never participated in an event before or been on a trip with friends. It was also an excellent opportunity to get some good pictures of myself - something I desperately lacked, literally.  I have almost no pictures of myself & even fewer with friends, mostly due to not really having any friends until adulthood. It's something that's always been upsetting to me. I explained this to FF who immediately agreed to take pictures of me in the race since she wasn't participating anyway. She told me she understood, she'd be happy to do it, & that she was already going to do that anyway.   We do the half-marathon & everything seems fine: FF drives to several points & takes pics & video while cheering us on. A couple weeks after we get back, she still hasn't sent me any pics so I text her to see what's up. Turns out she deleted all of them!  In the months that followed, I attempted to talk to her about it multiple times, but each time she refused to apologize or provide any explanation as to why she deleted them, insisting they were her pictures since she took them & could therefore do whatever she wanted with them. After telling her that what she had done really hurt me, her response was this was my problem & I needed to find some way to deal with it.  To say I was devastated is an understatement. This was someone I had thought was one of my best friends. I tried for almost a year to keep being friends with her, but she seemed either unwilling or unable to even acknowledge my feelings, or provide any explanation or context for her behavior. I had trusted her with something extremely important to me which she had literally thrown away. After realizing I wouldn't be able to trust her again, I removed her from my life entirely & haven't had any contact for over a year.  Did I overreact?

iwmrm2nh	Me (28f) and my husband (29m) have been married for 5 years. My husband was a nurse until he told me he wanted to become a doctor. I was fully supportive and he is now in his first year of medial school. I have been supporting the both of us as he cannot work while in school, but recently found out our rent was being raised by $500 at the end of our contract (April). This was honestly the last straw as it pushed us past where we were financially comfortable, so I raised the idea of us buying a home.   This had been a conversation for years, but my husband had always said we could after he had paid off his school debt from nursing (paid off early 2020). I asked my mother (real estate agent) who told me that with what we'd be paying, it would be better for that money to go towards mortgage repayments and not rent. I brought this all up to my husband who shut it down almost immediately. He told me our agreement was to wait until he had paid off all his debt. I told him that was for nursing and that he was in school for 6 years, which was hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt and some doctors don't pay off their debt for 20+ years. I told him I had been supportive of this career change and by financially supporting the household, but that it was the best financial decision for us but also relieved the financial burden for me. I brought up the savings we had for our deposit and how we could afford something small and modest within budget, but he told me it was in our interest to use that money to pay off his loans. I asked him if he realised the financial burden this would put on me, but he said it was temporary and eventually he'd make more than me so it would be even and I'd agreed to this.  My mother called and asked if we were going to look into buying a house, but I told her we weren't and we'd be looking for somewhere cheaper to rent instead. She insisted we at least consider it because it made the most financial sense, and asked if it was because we didn't have a down-deposit. I told her that we were probably going to use that to pay off my husbands debt and he didn't want more debt until he was debt free from student loans. Days later, my mother and father came for lunch and told us they had news. They offered to gift us the down-deposit of a home. I was over the moon and shocked by the offer. Once they left, my husband exploded on me, claiming I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my parents. I told him I never asked for this but we should take it as it was a privilege most people don't get and would relieve so much financial burden on me. He refuses to talk to me or my parents until we apologise for shaming/emasculating him but I refused too. I apologised but told him I wouldn't make my parents as they'd done nothing wrong.

A few days ago he commented how i dont make any money and i should be working, i responded to him by explaining that i physically cant work yet which made him argue with me about how useless i am and how much of a burden i am, i went to my room soon enough because i cant handle arguments well and i tried to text my mother but he apparently turned the internet off (he has access to the internet even tho he doesnt pay for it) which meant i had to call her instead, my mother actually tried to convince me to go and apologize to him, i refused because he would get into another argument with me and i didnt want to risk it.  when my mother came back tho, she went to my uncle to try and find out what happened, i dont know what he told her but she told me to apologize to him and get this over with, it made me extremely angry and i tried to tell her what happened but she didnt listen to me.  after that ive been using phone data, even for school work. he still hasnt spoken to me and my mother is still trying to convince me that i was in the wrong and should have kept quiet instead of engaging with him in an argument.  im not sure how i feel, my mother always takes his side in arguments but im not sure this time, AITA?	1642868877.0	sa63r4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa63r4/aita_for_refusing_to_apologize_to_my_uncle/	AITA for refusing to apologize to my uncle?
57exqc9d	For some context: I am 22, she is 21, and we've been together for \~2 years.  I am very athletic and have been going to the gym for a long time (even before we met). Recently, she wants to come with me on every training. Now, I would love to go with her anytime, but she is always so "needy" in the gym.  She needs me to be there whenever she does a set, so basically I end up being beside her the whole time and barely do anything myself. I tried to tell her that I need to do my training too, but she says she feels insecure and thinks that people are watching her and needs me to be there so she feels more confident, otherwise she is too shy to do the practices.  So I thought alright, let's give her a week or two to get into the rhythm and feel more relaxed around machines, but it had no sign of stopping anytime soon after a week and a half.  I then told her that I will be stopping going to the gym for some time, but in reality I've been going alone while she is at work. My mom and brother both told me that she just wants to spend time together and I am too self-centered. I feel a bit bad, am I the asshole?	1642868486.0	sa5yzh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa5yzh/aita_if_i_go_to_the_gym_behind_my_girlfriends_back/	AITA if I go to the gym behind my girlfriend's back?
iwqbc7tp	I (16f) have a younger sister (14f) who i'll call Nagisa because of a show we watched as kids, and we have a childhood friend (13f) who we'll call Hikari.   It so happens that we went to visit her yesterday at her house, and the three of us were talking about our school lives and that sort of thing. but Nagisa wanted to talk about a specific topic, and the conversation didn't go there no matter how hard she tried, so she separated from us as soon as she could.   The rest of the night was spent away from me and Hikari, and she was on the verge of tears when my mother and Hikari's mother asked what had happened.  And after that, my mom said that i pushed her out by not talking about what she wanted or letting her do it, but i said i didn't even know what she wanted to talk about or that it was bothering her.   Nagisa has done this to me before: a friend of hers was interested in meeting me on her birthday, and although i tried to get her to keep talking to Nagisa, the girl ended up wanting to stay with me, and Nagisa behaved as if it was my fault for the rest of the week for this.   I said I wasn't going to apologize because I don't control her feelings, and I did nothing but talk normally. I also added that I am not a fortune teller to have known that she wanted to talk about something specific. i'm wrong?	1642869682.0	sa6dxt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6dxt/aita_for_making_my_sister_feel_displaced_and_not/	AITA for making my sister feel displaced and not apologizing?
iwohepu8	I was fired recently and I admit I didn't take it well, but in my opinion my boss has zero legal justification to fire me. I have never had any problems at work but a private conversation was overheard by his wife and it made her cry.   I also think the way he went about it was awful. He made me apologize to her, so I thought I had a chance of retaining my job, but then he fired me in front of her while she smirked at me. i was blindsided and asked if I could talk to him privately. He said no. I asked to please talk to him without her and he said he wasn't going to disrespect his marriage and kick his wife out of his office.   My biggest issues are that 1) he fired me for personal reasons, nothing to do with my work 2) his wife is currently going through menopause and I'm not trying to be weird, but she has been more sensitive lately and suddenly getting very hot, so to me it's obviously connected and yes he support her, but he can't make it everyone else's issue. 3) A couple years ago I heard her making fun of me and I didn't escalate like this.  I told him he was making a mistake and I would look into legal options. I said I would leave an honest review about this on social media (and i have). I also left a comment on his wife's private account about how she smirked at me and allowed her friend to watch me pack, and maybe this is slight asshole territory, but he gave me an hour to gather my stuff and then he left his office unattended. I took a sharpie to his pictures of her. I really liked this job and I'm hurt and furious right now, but I'm getting mixed feedback from friends and family.	1642870362.0	sa6mm1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6mm1/aita_for_not_leaving_my_job_with_grace_after/	AITA for not leaving my job with grace after being fired and threatening to trash my boss and sue?
3oypbmod	My brother in law was an addict most of his life, went into a recovery program and said he hadn’t been using. My spouse said he should move to our state from Arizona since he supposedly had his life on track and we’d help him get settled. So we found him a trailer park for his travel trailer and have helped him with food, gift cards, gifts etc to help him get started. Fast forward 6 months later and he is using again (apparently he never stopped), has blown through 7 jobs and only gets odd jobs here and there to pay weekly rent. Now he’s out of money and wants to live in our driveway in his trailer for a month (with no running water so he’d have to come in and out for showers and the restroom) to “get on his feet”. My husband feels sorry for him and thinks it’s a great idea. Note, we have dealt with my addict mother for years (who doesn’t live with us but lives out of state) and just got an addict daughter out of the house a few years ago. We finally have some peace and my fear is when that month is over the BIL will have some sob story to give and want to continue living here. My spouse wants to impress his older brother and is no good at boundaries. I don’t mind helping if it’s not throwing money down an empty well. I’d rather lend him money for him to stay on his own than him coming here. I think it would be a disaster in the making and put tension on the whole family.	1642869877.0	sa6gdv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6gdv/aita_for_not_wanting_addict_brother_in_law_to/	AITA For Not Wanting Addict Brother In Law to Stay With Us
d8lo5	Background, I (29) came out as trans and bi about 7 years ago. My family's responses varied but my (now 39) sister at the time had one of the worst responses, calling me a sexual deviant and keeping me from having contact with my niece and nephews (2 of which have ironically since come out as trans) and that continued for a long time. But I'm not the only one that had a... contentious relationship with this sister  &#x200B;  Both beforehand and throughout the past 7 years she's had a tense relationship with most of our immediate family, not unusual for our other sister to message me being like "what the fuck is her problem?" and she often pinballs between feelings as she'd repeatedly go from accusing our mom of being an abusive narcissist and not wanting her to see her grandkids to "Kids are gonna go visit grandma <3" and it had quite a toll on mom from the constant back and forth on feelings and "How will she feel about me this week?" I had limited contact with sister throughout this, usually hearing about all this second hand from other sister or mom, but occasionally would get messages from this sister trying to get me on her side about mom being a narcissist and trying to blame my relationship with our dad for me being trans.  &#x200B;  Fastforward to last year, two nephews came out to me as trans and both talked about their mom being kind of iffy and not the best about the whole thing. Another year and I suddenly get a message. "I'm representing our town at pride next year and petitioning the council to recognize pride month. Cool huh? A little forward motion. Wanted to let you know my views have changed dramatically." She then started talking about churches being political cults, the Bible is just astrology, tithing is fake etc. And I can't totally blame her if she's feeling that way (We grew up in a cult and since my coming out, all of our immediate family has left it, even if most are still Christian) but considering her past views and our limited contact this really came out of nowhere.  &#x200B;  I already was feeling kinda hesitant on this because it felt... performative to me? Especially with her making such a big deal of what she's doing to help, and never like... apologized for any of the stuff she said back then and such. So I decided to contact my oldest nephew, who now is largely publicly out as trans and ask for his input. While he did say his mom has been better about things and largely improved, one thing stuck out to me. He said "I came out to her last year and it was a bit iffy at first but things have improved." But when talking to my sister about it, she said "He came out to me 4-5 years ago." Which makes me feel even more like it might just be performative and "Look at how good and accepting I am now"  &#x200B;  I've brought this up with friends to mixed results with some saying to default to believing her and others saying I'm totally justified in being hesitant about her support. I haven't said anything like this to her yet, but WIBTA if I question her sincerity?	1642870826.0	sa6spv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6spv/wibta_if_i_question_the_sincerity_of_my_sisters/	WIBTA if I question the sincerity of my sister's support?
gfehg2r7	Sorry,I couldn't think of a good name. I can be pretty dumb sometimes. But anyway, let's get this over with,I'm a minor. There's that. It's sort of important in this? On with the story.    So,about 7 months ago my mom went into a coma-ish state,where she can only look around. She has no control of her body muscles,witch are very tight, and she can't talk. My dad has to drive 45 minutes to the place she's staying and back everyday,because there's no good place for her to stay in our town.  We're losing money,my dad has to pay bills,witch he. Hasn't really ever had to do because my mom always did them,considering he would work from 6-9 every day.  Hes stressed. I do softball,MMA, and show choir.topping that all off? School and scoliosis. I get back pains alot,so sometimes I just need to sit down.i never have a free day. My math grade is going down with a few missing assignments. Lately my dad's been yelling at me for everything,and I mean yelling. It's hardly ever just a talk anymore. We never have conversations about hard topics, he tells me them in my face and if I dare say something he gets mad. But the things I'm getting yelled at for are like, not turning the lights off,witch is causing our electric bill to go up. Forgetting to wipe down the counter one day, not doing the dishes witch makes it so we dont have room to make dinner,(he wont let me wash them afterwards bc of his stubbornness)or the cats not having food or water, (There's three,they eat fast too so I can assure you it's not me under feeding them. ) And most of all, my math grade. I'm not at the point of life where my grades gonna kill me, but he uses college and the fact that "if your failing school, and the house is dirty child services can take you away from me."( We've had a child services problem before) but it's hard for me to keep up.  I also have anxiety And adhd but that's probably not that important rn. Im genuinely scared to talk to him much about anything anymore. When he yells at me and I argue back I get called a follower,and he tells be being a follower is lazy and isn't going to get me anywhere in life. I've been told he doesn't care if I'm a failure anymore. But he tells me he hates yelling at me, and I'm just adding onto his stress with my excuses. I feel bad,like I should be helping more and  trying my very best, no matter how mad or tired or in pain I am. Like I know I'm being lazy. I usually get the stuff done, but sometimes I forget and it's like I never did the thing once in my life. Like I'm always defying his expectations that I'll never meet. So am I the asshole for not helping my dad more?	1642871025.0	sa6vj6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa6vj6/aita_for_not_helping_my_dad_as_much_as_i_can/	AITA for not helping my dad as much as I can?
iwq860qe	I started a new job recently and couldn't get childcare for the first three days and my MIL agreed to watch the kids. I'm super grateful because I've been trying to get back into the workforce for a year now and the pandemic messed that up.  We have an ok relationship with MIL but are fully no contact with FIL due to him vandalizing our home. We did sue and get money, but nothing will make up for the fact we had to clean paint, eggs, tampons, dog shit, and he makes good money so he didn't care about paying us. He knows we had to clean that disgusting mess he made.  MIL came over Wednesday to babysit. FIL dropped her off and pulled into the driveway and smirked at me. When MIL came to the door I asked why he was there. She explained that her car was in the shop and she wouldn't have it until Friday, so he gave her a ride. I said that I don't want him in my driveway or in view of my house and asked if he could drop her off in front of the neighbors house.   MIL called me childish and said I have to accept that he is her husband. I said she can be married to whoever she wants, but he is not welcome on my property in any capacity. We argued and she said she refused to be dropped off and walk literally a few extra feet (she is 50, able bodied, and has no actual reason for this) I ended up saying she isn't allowed to babysit Thursday or Friday and we had my mom drive two hours and stay with us.  MIL said I was ridiculous and petty and punishing her for having her car rear ended. I said too bad so sad, and once she gets her car back she can stop by and see the kids anytime, but I don't want her piece of shit husband even in my driveway.	1642871453.0	sa716z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa716z/aita_for_getting_mad_at_fil_for_being_in_my/	AITA for getting mad at FIL for being in my driveway though MIL was doing us a favor?
h1v9idtu	My girlfriend(23F) and I(24M) just moved in together yesterday. I moved into her apartment that she had shared with her roommate before I moved in. So the apartment was half furnished since her roommate took half of everything.   I lived in an incredibly small bachelor style studio so the only things I really had was a queen bed, a couch (that she hated) and a tv. We agreed to keep my bed and bed frame since she had a full.   She suggested we go to ikea to restock the house and she was super excited about it. When we got there she filled our entire cart with furniture, kitchen and bathroom stuff.   She was asking my opinion on stuff and I was happy to give it but I saw the bill racking up pretty quickly. She ended up getting so much stuff that I saw as pointless. Like bathroom rugs, a soap dispenser, a dresser even though she has one, she got a second matching beside table for my side of the bed, some art for the apartment and TWO giant rugs! One for the bedroom and one for the living room. And this is just some of the stuff I didn’t think we needed. There was plenty more.  We ended up having two full carts of stuff and before we even went to checkout she said “everything else we can just get on Amazon.” I was genuinely in shock she thought we needed even more then all of this crap.  But we went to checkout and just like I thought the total was almost $1,400. She asked the cashier if we could split the bill half way on two cards and I was horrified. I told her no way was a I paying half for all of this. She looked surprised and we quickly began to argue. She told me this was for the both of us but I disagreed and said I didn’t need half of this stuff. After about 5 minutes of arguing and holding up the line she paid and we left.   The entire hour ride home we argued and when we got home I was given the silent treatment after being called a cheap jerk.  Am I the asshole here??	1642871683.0	sa74eh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa74eh/aita_for_going_to_ikea_with_my_girlfriend_and/	AITA for going to IKEA with my girlfriend and then refusing to pay half?
iwqxmwfe	I work at our local government building, and for the past couple of years I've been in a relationship with the most senior elected official in our local government. I'll call her "Victoria". Because of the optics of her being with a staffer who is much younger than her, Victoria has always insisted on keeping our relationship secret.   We recently found out Victoria is pregnant and we're both delighted. She's announced her pregnancy publicly but hasn't revealed who the father is.   Victoria loves fashion and particularly shoes. She literally has enough shoes to fill a whole room at her place. Most of them are heels and she's always wearing them.   At work we always act completely professional to each other so nobody knows we're together. However today I was moving some equipment when I heard her talking to one of her assistants, about the new pair of shoes she was wearing. They were very high stilettos.   I've got nothing against her shoes or style but I'm getting a bit worried about it. What if she falls over in her stilettos? She could hurt the baby or herself. And while she says the shoes don't hurt, I can't imagine they will be comfortable for her when she's further along?   I innocently asked "are you sure you want to be wearing shoes like that now you're pregnant?" She gave me a cold look and said it wasn't any business of mine.   I didn't get a chance to see her for the rest of the day but she later sent me a long series of texts, firstly saying that what she wears is her business (and I agree with that. I was just expressing a concern), and then saying that me "speaking out of turn" risked exposing that we have a closer relationship.   Obviously I would NEVER try to make her wear anything she doesn't want to, but I didn't say anything to imply that we were together. I asked a question in a purely casual way, because I'm concerned about the woman I love, who is the mother of my child.

9bx6mkn8	 My ex and i split a year ago. We've been living together until dec, when i moved out. Im a fulltime student, but the past year i have been going through health issues, causing me to lose my license. I got diagnosed with an AVM (a cluster of malformed bloodvessels, which causes siezures and puts me at risk of an aneyurism).  We have two golden doodles. I had Bernard from before. We got Eigil 2 years into our relationship. I had no problem with him visiting them as much as he wanted.  We have the apartment until feb 1. I thought it was fair i paid my share of rent for jan in exchange for him painting and moving the rest of the stuff. I said i would come help cleaning. We agreed i would leave lamps for when he had to paint. He was to put the remaining furniture by the road for the trash collectors and sell the dishwasher and washing machine.   I called to set a date for the clean. He said he had plenty of time to do it. I said it was very nice of him, cause i was very busy with my exam. A week later he called in panic. He read the rent agreement wrong, thought he had to be out two weeks after feb 1 and not two weeks before, leaving him one week before inspection. At this point i had no time to help, cause i was busy. I said i would get the stuff and lamps today, despite being in hospital earlier this week and had my main arterie cut, put a tube in all the way through my neck to my brain leaving me temporarily blind on my right eye  Turns out the place needed to be painted and cleaned (bye deposit). He hadn't taken the lamps down and given them to the new renters. He had taken few things, leaving the rest in the classroom (we lived at an old school from 1860). The furniture was just thrown in, stuff packed in random boxes, washing machine not sold. Even his soda cans were left. I packed everything i could. I was pretty pissed as I had a seizure this morning.  I sent him a text saying i wasn't happy. He knew what i was going through and haven't respected all the days i put into making it easy for him. I wanted my part of the rent back + the value of the lamps, 920 total, since i held up my part of the agreement.  He. Blew. up. He said we made no agreement (selective memory is one of his most impressive talents), i just left everything for him to deal with, not offering any help, when i knew he didn't have time for it. It wasn't like he threw everything out the window. He said neighbours would help store the stuff until mar 1. It wasn't his problem i had an exam.  I replied reciting the agreements we made, offering my help, it wasn't my fault he can't read and he might as well had tossed everything out the window. I cant help him later, since I start my internship and might be scheduled for brain surgery. I ended with, if thats how it is, i wasn't interested in ever seeing him again including Bernard and Eigil.  aita?  dog tax https://imgur.com/a/ajKiM4c	1642872446.0	sa7eii	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7eii/aita_for_demanding_money_and_keeping_our_dogs/	AITA for demanding money and keeping our dogs hostage from my ex?
9y4ffauf	I (22f) do not want to go to my sister’s (25f) wedding because she didn’t ask me to be a bridesmaid and it hurt my feelings really badly, but she doesn’t seem to care, and doubled down on her decision when I confronted her about it. Her excuse was that she simply isn’t close enough to me and wants who she chooses and feels close enough to, to be her bridesmaids. The worst part is she asked two other sisters, (16f and 24f) to be her bridesmaids, and even asked the 16 year old one right in front of me, knowing she wasn’t going to ask me, with a little gift for her and everything. She also has friends being bridesmaids. So I wasn’t a good enough choice, but friends and other sisters, older and younger then me, were? Again, when I told her it hurt my feelings she doubled down on not feeling guilty about her choice and didn’t really seem to care that it hurt my feelings. Am I in the right for not wanting to go to her wedding? I’ll be miserable the whole time, but I KNOW my family will try to shame me if I don’t go.  TLDR; older sister asked friends and OTHER sisters to be bridesmaids and even asked one of them in front of me, but not me. Hurts my feelings, she doesn’t care.

7zejui2r	I’ve struggled with disordered eating for a few years now, and I was even almost hospitalized because of how starving myself was harming my body.   I live in an Asian household where being stick thin is praised and glorified, and my parents go on starvation periods occasionally to lose weight despite knowing that I have an eating disorder and it really triggers me.   Recently, I decided to choose recovery and I started gaining weight, which disappointed my parents loll. My mom has been obsessive about her weight loss and runs around 2 hours every day and eats basically nothing.   Being stuck at home makes me so aware of these things and it makes recovery so difficult. I keep finding myself slipping back into old habits because i feel guilty that I’m not trying to lose weight again like my mom is.   She says she has bad digestion, so she can’t eat much. Instead, she chooses to fill herself up on black coffee and packets of laxatives. I know I shouldn’t be caring this much, but I can’t help it.   I told her that she should eat more since I have noticed her losing a ton of weight and it’s concerning how little she eats while overexercising. She tells me I’m being inconsiderate because eating hurts her because of her indigestion issue.   I do feel guilty, since I don’t want her to be in pain. However, it’s hard to 1. recover in a household like this, 2. hurtful when she complains about meals I spend lots of time cooking because she doesn’t want to eat, 3. see her being more irritable and irrational which I know from personally doing the same in the past.   So, am I the asshole for telling her to eat more? I’m really conflicted.

3mxlrgf3	My boyfriend lives in the city where I go to university, and it also happens to be the second biggest city in my country, so full of opportunities, especially job-related ones.  While staying at my boyfriend's house I found a part-time job, that might allow me to move from my boring and sml city to the big one, and finally not rely on three types of public transport every day to go to classes.  But it's still going to be a little expensive, so I was looking for a babysitting job, to make a little extra money. I've been searching for one for months, but finally, after posting an ad on Facebook, someone answered me and offered me 10 dollars/hour, four hours a day, five days a week.   That would be pretty good and it would help me pay for my own place starting from April, but there's one thing: I would have to sleep (rent-free) at my boyfriend's place every night, because it would be too late to go home after babysitting in the evening.  My boyfriend says that it's not a problem and I just want to make things more difficult for the both of us.

iwqi3akv	So I (13f) have one sibling, "Terry" (11m).  Background:   We both sometimes do research studies. They last an hour, and they will give you a $25 Visa gift card.   I have done about 10 of those in the past few years. Terry was only eligible for 4. They seem to always want kids from the age group that I am in.  Last month, I did this study. It was for teenagers only (it was MRI brain scans and stuff) and I was paid $205. He was really jealous of me then. He got so mad, and was whining to my parents that I should give him half because it's not his fault that I was born first and am a teenager, and I'm super stingy and I have way more money than him.   On a side note, I usually just ask for money/gift cards for birthdays and Christmas. I don't have that much stuff. Terry always asks for a watch, or a pocket knife, or a bike.  I'm not stingy with him, IMHO, but that's just my opinion.   Two weeks ago, we went to Chipotle (my favorite place) and got lunch and I paid for his food ($14).  I give him good birthday/Christmas presents (at least $20).   Last year, I gave him 2 of the $25 gift cards I got, for an elementary school graduation present, because I felt bad that I got way more than him.  It's not my fault that I get accepted to more studies. He could ask for birthday money instead of toys and candy, but he doesn't. I don't think I'm obligated to share money with him.  He's been extra annoying lately, and my parents have been saying to 'cut him some slack' because he's just envious. If I talk to him or ask him a question, he says "Share your MRI money with me and maybe I'll answer" or "Share it with me and maybe I'll tell you." We bike to the grocery store sometimes to get snacks, and he keeps asking me to pay for his.   So should I share it with him, or is he being unreasonable?

We have been lucky enough to save a college fund, totalling $150,000 for Val. When looking at schools she was interested in, I sat her down and talked her through the process + her fund. (Mike lives in another state but knew we were having this talk). I told her how much she had and discussed different options. I told her how state schools are typically cheaper, and how she might have to take out a loan if she chose a more 'prestige school' or didn't quality for scholarships. I told her that if she didn't spend all the money on schooling, it would still be hers after graduation. I also brought up how staying close to home would save on living expenses if she didn't want to live on campus. I wanted her to make an informed decision with all the facts, especially financially. Because of this, Val has looked at a range of state/ivy schools.   &#x200B;  Mike called me furious, saying that Val was considering a school close to where I live and that it was only because I had scared her into it by telling her she couldn't afford other schools. I told him I'd had an age appropriate conversation about college, finances, and student debt with Val and she was making decisions that are in her best interest, not mine or his. Before this, Val had considered moving in with her dad as he lived driving distance to an ivy league school she wanted to go too. Now she is apparently looking at other schools and isn't as on board with that discussion anymore. Mike said that I had financially blackmailed her so that she wouldn't go live with him, and that I'd only told her all these things to scare her financially.	1642873086.0	sa7n33	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7n33/aita_for_financially_blackmailing_my_daughter_and/	AITA for 'financially blackmailing' my daughter and controlling where she goes to school?
g2vxhjpa	I know the title looks bad, but bare with me please.   I (15f) have a younger sister (8f) who still throws tantrums when she doesn’t get what she wants.   A little backstory, my mom didn’t give af about my little sister until a certain point . She forced her on my grandma to take care of her as soon as she was school age. As a result of this, my grandma spoiled her rotten. She is also behind in school. She is in second grade and still can’t read properly.   My sister learned at the age of 5 that she can scream her head off to get whatever she wants. My mom has accommodated to this and is making excuses for her behavior  Every time my little sister “cries” she just screams. No tears. She can stop and start instantly. It is like a switch  (Note they she didn’t do this before being with my grandma)  She wants to get my sister mentally evaluated. I desperately want to tell her that she just needs to own up to her bad parenting and neglect and admit that if she did better with her and disciplined her, she wouldn’t be like this.   My mom has now convinced her that she is special needs and every time she screams she says “I can’t help it, I’m special”   I am also thinking of telling my mom that is it may be best if my sister lives with her dad for a while cause he didn’t put up with any of that.

ivgzb7xh	Ok so 23 F here and I have a great relationship with my boyfriend of two years just this one silly issue that causes friction.  So first and foremost I want to say I don’t make a habit of peeing outside . You know just when I really have to pee and there’s no bathrooms close. Like on long car rides or more frequently when we go out drinking. I do not do it publicly I always find a spot where no one can see me. Despite this my boyfriend despises when I do this. In the past he  has called it “gross unladylike and embarrassing” I think he’s just being a prude. I think it’s more suitable for me to pee outside than to be super uncomfortable with a full bladder. We went out drinking last night and on the walk home around 2 am I decided to pop a squat because I had to pee and nothing with a bathroom was open. My boyfriend again brought up this issue and we got into an argument. He didn’t even sleep in bed with me. Although we were both really drunk so it was blown out of proportion. But now I’m curious AITA for peeing outside despite my boyfriends feelings.	1642873838.0	sa7wwn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7wwn/aita_for_peeing_outside_even_though_it_grosses_my/	AITA for peeing outside even though it grosses my BF out
3vwdtjzo	Now, obviously the title may sounds really bad, but hear me out.  I’m 20(M), and I love my parents, I love them to death, I wanna make that clear, they are great people with a lot of flaws.   We’ve been living in the USA for around 5 years, and because we’re immigrants our economic situation has never been that good.  We recently bought a house though, and we’ve been here for around a year and the two main sources of income are me and my dad.   Now, why would I want to leave? Here’s the thing. My parents have been in the verge of divorces since before we came here. It’s always a horrible fight in the middle of the living room telling themselves really awful stuff me and my little sister should never know about them. They include us in the fights and try to make us choose who’s in the right or wrong, and even if we say anything we just make everything worse.   There’s much more to this, but I’ll leave at that. Basically this has taken a really strong blow to my mental health, I cannot live in my house with some sort of anxiety that they’ll do it again and this time worse.   It has gotten to the point where I just want to leave and live my own life outside of them. I have the necessary money to live on my own but I would not be able to provide with my dad for his house anymore.  My dad has told me sometimes that he has “his calculations if I were to leave” which I believe, because he’s a very smart experienced man, but I would still feel like shit.   They need my help economically, but at the cost of my own mental health and happiness.   Would I be the asshole if I were to leave?	1642873733.0	sa7vio	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7vio/wibta_if_i_left_my_parents_house_when_theyre/	WIBTA If I left my parents house when they’re struggling?
2brg96ed	So I live in an apartment complex and we have valet trash Sunday night  thru Thursday night. In the lease it says to stick your trashcan out between 5-7pm and it will be picked up by 9pm the same night then you have to bring the trashcan inside by 9am the next morning.   The problem is my across the hall neighbor just leaves her trashcan out all day everyday. Almost every weekend they will stick their trash out Friday morning  and it will sit in the hallway until Sunday at 8pm when it gets collected. Their trash also reeks I can smell it in my apartment and it stinks up the entire hallway. I think someone has reported them before because the one weekend their trash smelled especially bad the leasing office sent a reminder about the trash rules and that they will start to fine people. The trash is again sitting in the hallway this weekend and I'm debating on reporting them to the leasing office. I would let it go if it was only once in awhile, but it's all the time. My only problem with reporting them is that this whole thing sounds so petty.  WIBTA for reporting my neighbor to the leasing office  because of their trash.	1642873895.0	sa7xm4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7xm4/wibta_reporting_my_neighbor_for_leaving_trash_in/	WIBTA Reporting My Neighbor for Leaving Trash in the Hallway
5s3nnei8	I (21F) am dating a guy (28M) and we’ve been dating for roughly 8 months now. For context (this does pertain to the issue) my boyfriend is a Venezuelan immigrant who came to the country 4 years ago with his whole family. Ever since I met him he’s been very much of a family man. His family is not in the GREATEST financial situation but they get by. I am about to graduate college myself in May with 2 full time jobs, and pretty much since i’ve been dating him i’ve been in quite literally the most unstable living situation i’ve ever been in and it JUST got to a stop.  My boyfriend has been essentially living between my places and his moms house (when i met him he lived with his mom, i get that. he’s an immigrant and hadn’t paved his way quite yet). He couldn’t always stay at my place because with my roommate/landlord situations there have been certain overnight guest rules that have been against him, but we have always intended to live together. he has been helping me with very small chunks of my very cheap rent and small bills while paying his mother about $400+ a month as “rent” i guess. this new apartment i just got he agreed to help me with the rent and move in together for real. the rent is significantly more but my mom is helping for the next 3 months until i finish college.   since i’ve moved into this new place and we’re living together, he has a key, a lot of his stuff, and groceries as well at the apartment. he agreed to pay whatever i pay in rent and bills, 50/50 which will total to about 700 each once i graduate.    He is continuing to pay his mother rent even though he hasn’t slept there in weeks and says he’s moving in with me. I am trying to get him to adjust his budget so that his money is a little more focused on me and our relationship and our apartment versus his moms house.  i’m not saying to STOP helping his family, I just think 400+ a month is a bit much when he’s moving in with me, and that money could really help for things around the apartment. for now he’s blaming it on vet bills because his family dog had to be put down last week very unexpectedly and left behind a bill equaling about 3K, which I understand completely but even then there are 3 other people in that house, so to me him dropping 400+ a month is a lot. He refuses to go any shorter than that for the time being, and has also expressed interest in giving his mother MORE. I am struggling to see if I am justified in being upset that he tells me I am the priority and that he wants to start a life with me, while still having a foot in his moms house both financially and emotionally. I am also struggling to see if this is a cultural/latinx immigrant family situation that I am just not understanding. I am very family oriented myself seeing as I come from a big italian family, but my parents would never ask me to put my life on hold to help them out.   so reddit, AITA for asking him to financially and emotionally focus more on me and our home together?	1642874071.0	sa7zwr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7zwr/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_financially_focus/	AITA for asking my boyfriend to financially focus on me/us vs his mom and family?
iw1z2vwu	tldr:  Would I be the asshole to attend a cancer benefit for my baby mama that stopped communicating with me and the child does not know I exist?  &#x200B;  I (41m) had a relationship with C (38f) 15 years ago. That relationship resulted in a child who will be 14 this year. At the time, C was separated and in the processes of a divorce, but several months after she found out she was pregnant she went back to her husband. She asked me to stay away and allow them to be a family. Due to the issues I had with that, I left the state and respected her decision. Her husband then got listed on the birth certificate. The only agreement we ever made was she would eventually tell the child I was her real father when she was old enough and allow the child to decide if I could be a part of her life.   I moved back shortly after her birth to the next town then more recently a few hours away. She has since divorced and been in several subsequent relationships. I have never had any contact with the child per our agreement, but sent C messages from time to time.  From time to time when the child was younger, she would ask for pictures of my other children so she could show others the resemblance. I have seen a few pictures here and there on Facebook and through mutual friends. I wish things would have been different, but as the child will be 14 this year, I have to respect the agreement we made in the past.   2 years ago, the ex-husband, who also helped raise the child passed away. I sent a message of condolence to C and she got angry with me and blocked me on every social media. All I said was I was sorry for her loss and would help in any way I could. Before she blocked me, she reminded me of the agreement to not contact the child. Contacting the child wasn’t my intention behind the message nor was it mentioned.   Today, through mutual friends, I was sent a link to a cancer benefit for C. It appears she has been diagnosed with cancer. I have no details about her condition or prognosis. I am still blocked on every form of social media. While I would love to meet my daughter, I am still willing to wait per the agreement. My issue is, if she doesn’t have a great prognosis and passes, what do I do? I have been led to believe that C has not said a word about me to the child. Do I reach out when she turns 18? Earlier?  If she doesn’t know I exist and has lost both the parents she knows, that will be even harder for her.   I would like to reach out to C and try to open some communication. I understand I have no rights, but I will reach out to child when she is 18 (4 years away). I have considered attending the benefit (open to the public) to try and communicate with C. Would I be the asshole if I went to the benefit? I would obviously donate and not say anything to anyone there about how I know C. Being a small town, some people will already know me and the situation. I don’t want to draw attention away from the benefit, but how else to I communicate?	1642873567.0	sa7teb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa7teb/wibta_for_attending_a_benefit_for_my_baby_mama/	WIBTA for attending a benefit for my baby mama?
1018uiy6	I (NB 19) am autistic and one of the things that I simply cannot handle are raindrops. The overstimulation of rain falling on me is one of the very few situations where I feel like my disability actually impairs me in my day-to-day life. Because of that, I very frequently leave the house with a very big umbrella. Even if it's sunny outside, if there's even a smidge of a chance that it will rain, I'm bringing my large umbrella (it's an expensive Golfer umbrella, these are usually the largest ones you can find. It straps to my back like a backpack.). My girlfriend (F 20) often makes fun of me for carrying an umbrella almost half my size (has a 1.20m diameter when opened) even when the sun is shining bright, but I don't pay her mind. I'd rather be safe and dry than sorry and wet. Raindrops are a big no-no.   Anyway. Few days ago, I was out with my girlfriend and since it was a date and I wanted to look good I decided to not take my wonky giant umbrella but instead a smaller one. As always, sun was shining bright. Not a single cloud in the sky. We hung out for a bit in a shopping mall (and she commented on my need to have an umbrella even on a sunny day and when we're mostly staying inside). When we were leaving the mall, however, it was raining a lot. A lot a lot. These kinds of situations are why I bring an umbrella with me at all times. The thing is, as soon as I opened my umbrella, she wanted to stay under it too. I usually wouldn't have a problem if I had my golfer umbrella with me, but sadly, I only had my tiny one. It was barely enough to cover my whole body (I'm 6'3) when I'm alone, so it wouldn't serve for anything if we were both under it. We would both be completely wet. I explained to her that it only makes sense if only one of us is under it. I argued that I should have it because I'm always the one who makes sure to come prepared and that my autism does not mix well with heavy rain, but she got really upset that I let her stay in the rain when I had an umbrella. She took an uber home and hasn't texted me back ever since.

9by6cmgt	So this happened ages ago but it recently came up in conversation and it’s a hill I’ll die on so here we go.  When I was about 10 or 11, my mother (no longer alive) and I stayed at a family-friends million dollar apartment in NYC with some other family members.  We had gone to NYC for an event and we needed a place to stay overnight and a family friend lent us their apartment they owned (they were very rich and didn’t use the apartment often).  It was me, my mother, my aunt, my uncle, and my cousin, who was 14 at the time, at staying in this apartment.  The apartment had a full kitchen, full living room, two bathrooms, one of which had a wicker couch in it, a master bedroom, and a bedroom that had two twin beds in it.  I’ll add that my aunt, uncle, and cousin had stayed their before, but my mom and I had never been.  We get back from the event very late at night and immediately go to crash.  My aunt and uncle obviously take the master bedroom and then pointed my mom and I to the other bedroom.  We get to the bedroom and my cousin has taken over one of the twin beds.  My mom asks where the two of us are going to sleep and my cousin demands that we’re going to share a bed.  My mom tries to explain that to 5’10 woman and her chubby 10 year-old daughter who is also quite tall cannot share a twin bed, at least not comfortably.  My cousin has a fit and runs to her parents to explain that she needs her own bed.  Please keep in mind that me and my cousin hated each other at the time, so there was no way we could share a bed either and she loved to terrorize me, so we couldn’t share the bedroom without an adult in the room.  My mom explains everything as well, and my aunt and uncle decide that my mom and I are each going to get our own bed and that my cousin can sleep on the very nice couch (like humongous and never used) that is in the gigantic living room with the big TV.  My cousin wanted me to sleep on the couch, but not only was I really young, I was terrified of the dark and really shouldn’t have been separated from my mother while in this giant apartment that is not really kid-proof.  My cousin was really mad, and then to be petty, she decided to sleep on the wicker couch in the bathroom instead of the couch in the living room.  I was recently reminiscing with my father about the whole day, including the story I wrote above.  My dad demanded over and over that my mom and I could’ve shared a bed, and that we were jerks for forcing my cousin to sleep on the couch.  I tried to explain that it just wasn’t right to separate 10 year-old me from my mom in a pitch black apartment that I’ve never been in before.  So AITA for having my cousin sleep on the couch?	1642875737.0	sa8lp4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa8lp4/aita_for_having_my_cousin_sleep_on_the_couch/	AITA for having my cousin sleep on the couch?
3h0s4y5e	So for a bit of background, she always requests me to do work for her and rarely accepts a no. I'm a computer science student and she always asks for help with laptop / programs / repairing stuff / electric stuff around the house and so on and if i try to say no she always makes me feel bad about it(i have to explain and give reasons to say no).  So 2 days ago her SSD died and she asks for help. I bought her a HDD as i was in a bigger city and found one for cheap and installed a Windows on it. But then she wanted me to install what she needs on it. Because it had some driver problems and so it took me over 4 hours, so i charged her $15(in my country that's a bit under the minimum wage for a day's work) and she didn't really wanted to pay but i made her and somehow she was all sad and said that we are family and should help each other and seemed a bit like she would almost cry. For other context, always when i said i don't want to do something she told me to charge her... now she told me she didn't say that...

2p803whd	Just a bit of background: I (20F) live with two “roommates”. One is also 20F and she is the one I co-signed the lease with, so we split rent and bills evenly. However, a few months later she moved her partner (21M) into our apartment over time. It started off small where he would come over on occasion but then after a couple months he’s moved in his stuff, stays over every night, and my roommate tells people her and her partner live together. She didn’t ask if it was okay for her boyfriend to move in and she also doesn’t make him pay rent, bills, groceries, etc. If he DOES contribute it’s to lower HER portion of rent. For example if our rent is $1000, I pay $500 and then her and her boyfriend pay $250 each. I mostly put up with it to keep the peace because I have extreme anxiety and just think it’s easier to keep my mouth shut then deal with any screaming or crying from them. Because of all this I told my roommate that I would be moving out when our lease is up in a couple months. She was pretty happy about this because her and her boyfriend could have the place to themselves.   So since I’m moving I needed to get my own accessories and furniture. Majority of things in the house we either split payment on or they’re her’s since she moved out of her parents long before I did. I invited her to go to a home and furniture store to start accumulating things. She was excited as she loved furniture shopping. While we were there she also started buying things. I didn’t mind and we agreed that at the end of the shopping trip since we had a cart full of stuff one of us would pay at checkout and then pay the other one back for their items at home (something we do quite often).   My roommate paid at checkout and when we went home she started dividing up the bill. She added up all the stuff I got but then started adding half of what her stuff cost to my bill. What should’ve only been a $70 trip for me turned into almost $200. I asked her why I had to pay half for the stuff she got. She said it’s because we always split furniture or things for the house. I said yes, but I’m moving in 2-3 months and she bought things we didn’t need like another garbage can. She said that the stuff she bought was to replace the stuff I would be taking with me when I moved. I told her that it didn’t seem fair I was paying for furniture I wouldn’t even use and that if anything, her boyfriend should be paying for half of her items. She got annoyed and said she wasn’t going to make him pay for anything. I, in turn, got annoyed as a) I wouldn’t use this furniture b) he never pays for anything despite living here and c) I recently got laid off and didn’t have $200 to throw around.   I put my foot down and refused to pay for anything that was hers. She’s mad at me and is giving me the silent treatment and her boyfriend keeps saying I’m being an unreasonable asshole. So, AITA?   TL;DR: roommate wants me to pay for furniture despite the fact I will be moving and will not use any of it. Told her no and now she’s mad at me.	1642877572.0	sa99k1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sa99k1/aita_for_refusing_to_split_the_bill_on_furniture/	AITA for refusing to split the bill on furniture with my roommate?
ibff4gk4	I, 24 yo female, just got engaged to my fiancé of 5 years.   I am still really good friends with my best friends from high school. There are five of us including me. We do not see each other very often due to life but we do have a group chat that is still very active about once a week. We also hangout at least once every month or every other month, so we’re very caught up in each other’s lives.   One of my friends, we’ll call him J, is definitely the friend that does not keep in contact as much as the others. J moved an hour away a few years back to be with his boyfriend & they got engaged soon after. Him moving an hour away didn’t change much, considering we all visited him as frequently as we could. We were all so excited because we always talked about how fun each other’s wedding would be. He told us they had no plans for a while, which was completely fine.   Over the last two years or so, J has become less talkative. He posts on social media all the time as a hair dresser or with his dog, but he never replies or even opens the group chat. It’s come to the point where we see him maybe once a year. His family is in our town & constantly comes here, but never lets us know. It wouldn’t bother me if it was just him visiting family but a lot of the time it’s his visiting his friends that he used to complain about. He would always say that we were much better friends because we made the time to go see him. We saw him about a year ago & it was weird to say the least. I felt like I didn’t even know him. After a few drinks, I told him how I wish he’d talk to us more because we miss him. Even just a simple reply in the group chat once in a while would be nice. He said he understood. Over summer he finally texted in the group chat asking if we would like to come on his boat that he’s had for over three years. I immediately said yes & asked if a certain day worked. He never replied & took someone else instead. He’s taken many people on his boat, none of us included.  A couple months later, we found out through Facebook that him & his fiancé got married. They eloped & he did not tell any of us. We were pretty upset, simply because he was our friend. We didn’t expect to be invited or anything, we just wanted to be happy for him.   Now that I’m engaged, my fiancé & I have decided that we want a small wedding to our close family members & friends. I’m almost tempted to not even invite him. I don’t want to cause drama or make anyone feel bad but honestly this one sided friendship isn’t fun. I feel like I don’t know him anymore but I think my other friends may give me a hard time for it.

dp94q3pk	I (28F) have been with my boyfriend for almost a year. His boyfriend comes from a big family who are rather well off. They have a fenced in yard and two dogs, a golden retriever and a Yorkshire terrier. A few months ago, I adopted a golden retriever puppy. He’s a very good boy, but his problem is that he’s very high matinance, and in my apartment, there’s just not enough space. I figured that he could spend some time with my boyfriend’s parents and his three younger half siblings, seeing as they have a golden as well and a fenced in yard as previously mentioned. He has been staying with them for a few days to a week twice a month or so since we adopted him.  Today we came over, and I brought my golden. Immediately, my boyfriends sister sees him and just sighs. I ask her what’s wrong, and she told me she was starting to become sick of that dog. I asked her why, and reminded her how well behaved he is. At this, she pointed at the wall, where there’s a chew mark, and told me he was the one who did that. I looked at it and told her that he shouldn’t be doing that in my apartment of how expensive repairs are. She snapped at me that repairs were expensive for her house as well, it was irritating her father, and that I should take care of my own dog. I am heartbroken.

d22ydmjl	Background info: I (26f) have two sisters (30&34). Ashley(32) is married with 3 young kids. S(36) is a single mom to a preteen and share’s custody with my nieces father. My mom(56) is twice widowed.  Every February for the past 15 years, our mom goes to Florida. Me and S try to go with her for at least a long weekend. The past three years I have not gone for I am in nursing school, and it’s incredibly challenging to miss class/clinical (if I miss more than 1 clinical per semester I have to go in front of the board and they decide if I fail the course or not).  This year, my sister A and her husband got an amazing deal to take their kids to Florida during the same time as my mom and go to all the parks. S usually doesn’t take her daughter but worked it out with her father so she can go with her cousins. It has turned into this huge family vacation, and my mom is pressuring me to go. I told her it’s not likely. What if an emergency happens and I have to miss clinical again? I would have to go to the board and tell them I skipped to go on vacation the first time, during a pandemic no less. S understands and isn’t pressuring me to go but A really wants me there for I’m the “fun aunt”. My mom is starting to guilt trip me about how I’m always “too busy for them”. I work full time and attend nursing school, which is a full time job in itself. I do feel as though I have been too busy for a lot of family time, but this program is tough and nonstop. I only have one more semester left and I don’t want to risk it. I told them once I graduate I’ll be way more available for family vacations, but my mom is saying that this may not happen again for a long time since it’s so difficult for everybody’s schedules to line up.

h7yhj	My step son is 16 and a massive pot head. His birth mother got him hooked at 13. Right now my SO is renting his parents basement. Stepson has pot stashes in at least 2 places that I know of. My SO doesn't want to put his foot down too hard on him smoking because he's terrified step son will run away to his birth mother and get back in acid, ecstacy, and Molly. With us he only does pot. We just got approved for a trailer park but one of their ground rules is no drugs.   I do NOT trust step son at all. I'm insisting he is throughly searched before he enters our home.

iwsqcp46	(Throwaway)  My(24F) friend (24F) had a baby last year. She and her boyfriend works and most of the time her sister takes care of the baby. So a week ago she tells me she will have an  important project soon, which needs her to be  away for long hours and her boyfriend will be at work. Her sister had gone back to her parents' home in a different city. She asks me to babysit her baby on Monday which is when she will have her project  and I say no, because I will be busy too.  She said OK and left but was back yesterday, pleading and telling me that she couldn't find anyone else to sit her baby and hoped I could do it.  I refused because 1. I have never taken care of a child before. I wouldn't want to do it for the first time in the absence of her parents in case there's something I don't know how to do.  I can't even change a diaper to save my life.   2. I will be really busy as well. I don't think I will have enough time to cook my own meals with the kind of workload I'll potentially have. I told her this and suggested she take her child to day care. She gave me a dirty look and stormed out on me. I didn't understand her reaction and called her a few hours ago to ask if I did anything wrong and she said yes. I shouldn't have suggested that a 5 month old baby be taken to daycare and I was being insensitive when I would be in the house all day. And once motherhood hit me I would understand.

e5y5z7de	My son’s (6 months) been cranky all morning because he’s teething. I (27m) had to go grocery shopping and since it’s just me taking care of him he came with me. Normally he’s calm when I have him in his baby carrier because right now he just wants to be held by me but I forgot that at my mom’s yesterday so went in with his stroller to the market.   The plan was to be in an out in under 5 mins because he really wasn’t having it today. This lady kept popping up at every aisle I was in.   Well it’s a small market too so not like she was intentionally following us.  He wouldn’t stop crying then she’d say “he’s hungry why didn’t you bring his bottle” and I would tell her no he’s not hungry he just ate 15 mins ago. Then it was “uh oh sure hope your daddy changed your diaper this morning” (diaper wasn’t dirty).    At some point I picked him up for a little bit, he calmed down when I rocked him then lost his shit again when we got to the check out line because I needed to put him back in his stroller so I could put everything on the counter and pay. It was already a stressful day for me, I’m overwhelmed trying to hurry up putting everything in a bag while my son’s crying.   This lady is at the checkout line next to mine and she says “maybe next time he should stay at home with mommy don’t you think?”  Normally I’m not a confrontational person but this one really got to me. “Well his mom passed away so why don’t you just mind your damm business already and go”   She looked at me a little shocked and then there was other people there too so she was red. The lady didn’t say anything to me at all but then at the parking lot she apologized about his mom but she didn’t think I needed to be rude and throw that at her face because she didn’t know what happened. I really didn’t wanna get into it anymore I just told her to get the hell out of my way and leave me alone. Got in my car and left. Im home now more calm and wondering if she had a point. Because like I said normally I’m not like that with people but since it was already a hard day and stuff it infuriated me so bad. Was it an overreaction though? I get sometimes people think they’re helping when in reality know nothing when it comes to calming a baby and usually brush that off.

37a99pnk	So I just yelled at my dad’s girlfriend. I never liked her much before but today 💩 really hit the fan.  My dad and his gf have always had an on and off relationship, despite this they eventually decided to live together, and she convinced him to sell his old house which was basically his only safety net. I know she didn’t force him to, but she manipulated him into doing it.  When I arrived she barged in yelling at him, at first I only said “you’re being manipulative by duking this out in front of me” but then I quickly couldn’t hold back all the resentment and anger. She told me I have nothing to do with this I responded that each time they fight my dad ends up homeless thanks to her and each time I’m the one that has to pick up the pieces, and that whenever they fight I’m the one that she contacts to “explain the situation” or to get a hold of him , my baby step brother is her son, so yes I am involved whether I want to be or not. When they fight I’m always caught in the crossfire. Her excuse for making a scene in front of me was that “you’re (i’m) an adult”  She then threatened me that I can go back to where I came from. I have genuinely tried to like this woman over the years, but I just can’t deal anymore.

6czy7043	My fiancé’s sister has been staying with us for 3 years, it was supposed to be a temporary stay. Her older son mostly stays with his dad. She randomly moved in her boyfriend of 4 months about a year ago, got pregnant shortly after. We found newer, cleaner place, not falling apart, moving shortly. So we’re not that angry about it. his sister is very ungrateful and spiteful. I watch their 5 month old more than anyone should watch someone else’s baby. Fiancé is always cleaning up after her and her oldest, he works 70 hours a week. she has no job, says she will not get one. I work 30 hours a week, have a son in school, clean, do our laundry dishes, etc. They leave their pup in a kennel, shut away in their bedroom closet most of the day. Sometimes she’ll leave super early in The mornings and have the pup waiting for us to wake up to. Which she’ll do so by coming in our room, peeing on the rug or bed. We barely leave our pup there during the day, if we do, 98% of the time he’s in his kennel. He goes to work with my fiancé 5 days a week. If we leave him at the house, or ask her to watch him, she throws a fit and says all kinds of things out of spite and calls fiancé a bad pet owner. She never asks us to watch her pup. Both 4 months old. Almost potty trained but can’t hold it in very long. She never gives us a heads up when she leaves her pup, even though we’re more than happy to have her with us. we love her. But we’re constantly taking care of her(feeding, taking outside, making sure she doesn’t chew on the walls, etc.)We don’t complain, until we ask if they can watch our pup for even an hour or two, then she starts a fight. So if we have to rush somewhere or something comes up and we have to leave our pup it turns into world war 3. we remind her of how much she basically forces us to watch hers, and have mentioned a few times how much we do for her aside from that. We don’t mind doing things for her boys at all though. Its the fact we never hear a genuine thank you, we are belittled or given a half assed “thanks”. She’s asked us to watch her pup 3 times out of the 4 months we’ve had them (fiancés 2 year old lab gave birth to them)We ask 9 out of 10 times if we end up having to leave our pup there. Most of the time we take her pup out of her kennel to cuddle and play with our pup. Sister gets mad at us. But will also get mad if we DON’T, and gets mad if she has an accident in her kennel or if we leave her pups ‘accidents’ for HER to clean as she does the same to us when we ask her to watch ours. it only happens when she doesn’t ask us, and leaves her out of her kennel. She says we can’t ‘neglect’ her pup, when we’re not asked to watch her in the first place 99% of the time. We’re very seriously thinking of taking her with us when we move out. Are we the a holes?	1642879998.0	saa4x6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saa4x6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_raise_my_sils_puppy/	AITA for not wanting to raise my SIL’s puppy?
iwvw8cax	I (44 F) have an issue with my best friend Janice (40 F) regarding me dropping out from the pregnancy classes we were taking together. When I was 20, I got married too young and had a baby girl Alicia. Over the next eight years, I was badly depressed and engaged in a lot of self-destructive behaviour. It ended in an affair that led to divorce that I used to justify my antidepressants addiction. It made me negligent and was left hospitalized after a bad accident a the gas stove that my ex used to get my parental responsibilities terminated while I got sent to rehab.  I tried my best to reach out to Alicia after that and her father let her see me on weekends but she was never happy. I was heartbroken when her father and stepmother posted an announcement that Alicia was being adopted by her stepmom. After I got engaged, I kept trying, even her father and mother pushed but she didn't budge. When I asked to her to be at my wedding, she angrily told me that I'm not her mom and to fng stop calling her. I don't blame her, I wasn't a good mother to her.  With my husband I've had one baby and have another on the way. Janice is pregnant at the same time and we signed up for local classes. They were going well but the normal instructor got sick and she got replaced by Alicia. I dropped out the moment I saw her name in the email. Janice is very introverted and has anxiety issues and was only confident enough to go cause I was going too.  When Janice went and I wasn't there she panicked and left too. Yesterday when we talked I told her why but she didn't understand. I pointed out Alicia deserves better than to see me. Janice called me an asshole for not wanting to face her and that things could change so we can still go together. Maybe I am because I know how much these classes mean to Janice and I blindsided her by just leaving.	1642880188.0	saa7e0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saa7e0/aita_for_not_going_to_my_bio_daughters_pregnancy/	AITA for not going to my bio daughter's pregnancy classes?
7ftc4e4x	So as with everyone in the world, the virus ruined something and in this particular case my 30th birthday (I always wanted like throw a descent party). Among other things going on like being jobless, my brother moving to another country and me not being able to see my friends in months. But my parents have this habit of always making things for me. So in the night before my BD she told me she had invited my uncle's (her cousins) and my cousins.  They are the only family we've got in this city but we just had invited the for NYE (2021), and they are the kind of family that is fun to see them just once every few months because our get-togethers are always the fucking same.  My uncle and dad always getting on political discussions, my aunt( my other moms cousin) just being the most anoying person I know and the last person I would invite to my BD, my great-aunt with dementia that just sits there being old ( she's very sweet but not like you can have the most profound conversations), and my two cousins that are very apathical after 2 hours in every family reunion. The older one (35) is just tired from his job and always sleeps on any of my couch after a few beers and his little brother (21) is just not the most social guy I know and after some time he recluse himself on his phone. So I always end up there at the table listening just waiting for everyone to go and I can go to sleep. My previous BD was exactly like this. And my brother's BD celebration was exactly like this but with the addition that annoying aunt brought her new bf that nobody knew or invited.  So, I snapped. I told her why she did that if she didn't even ask me first what I wanted to do, that they were the last people I wanted on my BD, and that last year was the same. She got upset, she told me what she already invited everyone so we can eat cake, and she does things for me.  Anyways, she's been like this before, speaking for me or doing plans for me and I just tired of it and feel like I'm 5.	1642879941.0	saa46j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saa46j/aita_m30_for_getting_mad_at_my_mom60_for_inviting/	AITA (M30) for getting mad at my mom(60) for inviting extended family on my BD when I just wanted something quite with only both my parents?
iwvleehx	Today me (22) and my bf(28) were supposed to hangout with some friends of his (maybe around 10 people) at one of the friends place. I agreed to go about a week ago. I really wanted to, although I wasnt really feeling it I wouldve gone for my bf. The people are nice enough and he is new in the friendgroup, which is why it was important for him to go. While getting ready however, I was starting to feel very anxious. I have had some mild social anxiety for as long as I can remember and it has gotten way worse since the pandemic and lockdown. While I love spending time with people I know well it  sometimes gets hard for me to hang with new people and especially people I just dont click with that well. I had to ask him to go without me. He was/is pretty disappointed and seems mad, especially bc I said my reason for feeling anxious was that while I dont mind his friends, theyre not people I necessarily like and enjoy being around. I feel super bad for cancelling last minute, but I just couldnt push through and force myself to go this time.

9o7roh4v	I (26f) and my mother (74f) don’t see eye to eye on a lot of things. She despises my fiancé ever since we started dating (I’m her only child and she is VERY protective of me as she is a single mother who survived severe abuse as a child). We don’t like the same shows or food, and she constantly brings up my weight gain (she’s a former beauty queen). I spend every Thursday at my childhood home for mother daughter nights, along with all major holidays outside of Christmas Day. For Christmas she got us tickets to see a play together, it’s one of my all time favorites, Fiddler on the Roof.  Not going to lie, I’m thrilled. We share a love of musicals, even seeing Guys and Dolls, Hamilton, Oklahoma, and more multiple times. It’s the one thing other than the family cat we really bond over.  Thing is, I see my fiancé only 4 times a month as I work nearly 2 hours away from his home, and I live in an apartment on site. But he lives about 30 minutes away from where the musical is.   She wants me to drive to her house, then get in her car, drive an hour and a half (we have never had a car ride where we do not get in a fight) to the city, then drive back to her home and drive the two hours to see my fiancé. She wants to run errands together, which I’m fine with, but I don’t want to be stuck in cars for 6 hours of my day.  I have things I need to do too in the city, oil change, order new brakes, buy new work pants, etc (which is SO MUCH cheaper in the city vs the middle of the woods and I don’t go in the city often because of my severe anxiety and mobility issues). But when I mentioned getting that done then parking my car elsewhere so we can get all of her errands done, enjoy the show, and finish her errands she flipped out. She started screaming over the phone about how she bought these tickets so we’d enjoy the day together and that I was being selfish for expecting her to drive home alone (which she does all the time, she’s got no mobility or health issues outside of wearing glasses like me). I hung up because I have serious trauma regarding being yelled at (she knows this, she helped me leave the abusive relationship that caused it), and can’t risk shutting down and having a panic attack at work.  I told her I love her a lot, but I wouldn’t put up with being yelled at and to talk to me when she feels ready. I’m 100% willing to compromise, even offering to park halfway there at a parking lot off the highway, but she won’t even read my texts now.

gvvcdm6b	I'm quite sick with a sinus infection and I'm blowing my nose a lot, including at 4:30 this morning in the bathroom when my fiance was sleeping on the other side of the door.  I'm congested so it's not the most quiet thing when I blow my nose, but it's something I have to do.  I was in the bathroom using the toilet when my nose started dripping, so I blew it.   The noise woke him up, and he has a hard time sleeping and getting back to sleep.    This has caused a huge issue between us.  He says I should have the courtesy to come downstairs to blow my nose away from where he's sleeping because I know it's noisy and I know he's a light sleeper.  I say he should have some compassion and understand that this isn't something I do all the time or on purpose and I should be able to blow my nose when I need to for these couple days when I'm sick.

iw4j5hhj	I (17m) am pretty skinny and don't eat much. I've always been like this and I don't know why, I've always had a small stomach and got full pretty quickly. There's this girl (16f) that kinda invited her-self to the friend group but no one's really said anything. She is quite large but I never cared because it isn't my problem. What I did care about though is the fact that anytime I'm eating and ask somebody if they want some since I'm full or if I ask somebody if they wanna take some of my food since I can't finish it she will always say something like "Omg your so skinny you should eat more". "That's all you can eat?. That's barely anything". I always say something along the lines of, "just eat your own food", "I have a smaller stomach", "you just have a bigger stomach", etc.   My final straw was on Friday when I was inputting height and weight information into a card thing that I had to submit for a wrestling tournament. She saw it and was like "YOUR THAT LIGHT, YOU SHOULD BE EATING SO MUCH MORE." I was just mad at this point and said "Look at you, you look like an oversized land whale you should be in no position to be talking about MY weight." She yelled numerous insults at me then stormed away. I immediately felt awful for how far I took it but she was already of and I started to think that she kinda deserved it because she wouldn't stop talking about my weight despite me telling her to stop, but my friends are all telling me I took it to far and that I should have just clearly told her to stop and I am starting to think they are right and that I took it to far.

atrzp3go	So, for some context I F19 have a little brother M17 who moved to the US A few months ago from our pretty poor home country located in West Asia. My mom helped him get into the country and I'll spare you the details but it was a really hard journey trying to get him approved for the US due to his criminal records and his burglary charges but we managed after 2 years of trying and just wishing. Now, I have 7 younger siblings at my moms house and from a young age I was told to stay home and basically be their second mom due to my culture etc. But I refused and I moved in dad who isn't my younger Brothers biological father. My brother father insisted on him staying in the Middle East so when he came to me and my fathers house I welcomed him with open arms. We has a great time cooking cultural foods etc until I was getting my 2nd dose of the covid 19 vaccine and I noticed a small tattoo on his hand. Specifically a small swastika symbol, and I really hoped I was misunderstanding something so due to the language barrier between me and my brother I pulled out my phone and asked him a question in Arabic. I don't remember what it was exactly but it was something along the lines of "Why do you have that symbol tattooed on you?" And I'm able to understand Arabic. I have just not summed up the courage to speak because of my broken accent and pronounciation etc. But he told me that he loves Hitler and "We should all look up to him as a role model because who even likes homosexuals and Jewish people?" For some context, I'm lesbian and he is aware of this. I have a girlfriend of 3 years who he has met and I truly believed he liked her and I'm not anti-semetic by any means so this heavily upset him. In private with my dad I vaguely brought up the fact that he shouldn't be allowed to stay at my dads place because he doesn't work? He isn't in school and it's not even my dads child so why should he have to take care of my brother? My dad asked me why I was telling him this since I supposedly got along well with my little brother and when I explained this to my father he shrugged and told me that we're in America. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions and express them freely so if he hasn't said anything outright insulting to me then I should be so bothered by it. This made me furious and I have since then not spoken to either of them. My dad has contacted my mother and begged her to do something about my behaviour because it's "causing negative tension in the household" and my mom told me to stop being a bitch over the phone after I explained my reasoning to her.

6aczbfge	So a bit of background, I have a friend that we'll call Sarah. Sarah and I have been friends ever since we were in 4th grade and she had a really rough time in elementary school. She was used and bullied for awhile and I've been trying to stick by her now that we're in high school. So, on Wednesday we were in the same class and I asked her (since we sit next to each other) what's her birthday? Because I knew it was coming up. She told me the date (which was Friday of that week) and I wrote it down in my planner. (I have bad organization and I wanna lose weight this year, so I decided to buy a nice one to help me) On Thursday I just was in a really bad mood because I had a psychiatrist appointment. And since I hadn't seen him (thru zoom btw) he asked if my mom could take my blood pressure. But when he took it, my heart rate was also really high, along with the blood pressure. I have a very difficult relationship with my mom and she started interrogating me when we were done with the Zoom meeting. She knows I've been trying to lose weight so she was thinking that I was calorie restricting and such, so my dad took me out on a walk. After that, the next morning I just couldn't do it... I wasn't feeling well in the morning and I was too tired to do my homework on Thursday night. So I stayed home for a mental health day. Because of that, I didn't touch anything in my backpack so I didn't take my planner out. She had texted me a few times throughout the day and I just wasn't feeling so well so I would respond awhile after. Around 8 pm, she texted me saying "You forgot my birthday." I panicked and I went on my Discord chat with my friends, but I forgot that her S/O (we'll call them Alex) was in that group chat. I said "\*\*\*\* me... i forgot a friend's birthday today. today was just a bad day and it slipped my mind. jesus I feel horrible." Her S/O just said "mhm". I freak out because... I felt like i screwed up. Then some other friends are telling me "It's fine, it happens all the time, it's okay" but I still feel guilty. So I go ask my mom for some advice, I told her what happened and she told me "the best thing you can do is just to apologize" so I decide to go and say sorry... But then I see that she texted me saying "If you can tell people on Discord you can talk to me." I start crying and then I just respond with "I'm so sorry, it just totally slipped my mind, I hope you'll let me make it up to you." I told my mom what happened and she thinks that my friend is overreacting. I didn't mean to hurt her in anyway... I was planning to make her something but I just don't know what to do now. Another friend says that they're overreacting but I still feel guilty. So...

ho0o0unf	Hello, This is my first time posting on reddit. I, 23f moved in with my roommate Julia 21f(fake name) in September. We were friends before and had known eachother for almost a entire year before moving in together due to high rent where we live.  We were good friends and hung out about 2-3 times a week. She had her partner come and stay with us about 3 days out of the week, which I was cool with. I was friends with her partner. Near the beginning of October they broke up and my roommate did a full 180 in personality. She started being rude to me and when I tried talking to her about it she would flat out ignore me and walk away but then claim later that she was listening and didn't understand why I was upset.  She also got a new partner within 2 week of her break up, this person gave me the creeps, and it wasn't just me. She had multiple people tell her that her partner was creepy and there was something wrong. Well I asked for her not to bring her new partner around because I didn't feel safe around her partner. I said I don't mind if they pick her up from outside the building but to please, not to let them know what apartment number we were. Within a hour of me asking her to please not bring her partner around, there was a rant on Instagram over 4 paragraphs long over the fact I felt uncomfortable about her partner.    When confronted not only by me, but by another mutual friend who knew her longer and was also mentioned in the post she took it down. Here's the thing I usually don't care if she has a partner. She actually had another partner who I actually adored who was sweet and a lovely person. Her partner in the aforementioned paragraph was the type to help me clean the apartment.  When they were no longer partners and they no longer came around I started to notice how little my roommate actually cleans. I did a few tests just to make sure I wasn't imagining it, but she would leave her unclean dishes in the sinks for week, not take the trash out for over 2 week, doesn't sweep, and I've only seen her do laundry once since moving here. Well I started getting upset. When i confronted her about all that's she's been doing and she blew it off and would clean her stuff for about 2 days before just going back and playing on her phone in her room. She then started doing stuff like talking bad about me on speakerphone in common areas like the kitchen and living room. Saying I was a terrible person and flat put lying about events that happened. I had tried talking to her multiple times at this point and finally snapped. Keep in mind I have tried talking about these things that were bothering me and making me feel unsafe and upset. I've had other friends and family tell me I'm in the right but I just don't know. So please reddit ask questions and please let me know if AITA?

i351l4j7	So first of all, I know that sounds bad right away, but let me explain my situation first:  My girlfriend (20 f) and I(20 m) have been together for about 2,5 years. I recently started studying at university and moved to a different city. I now live in a shared flat with 2 other people and have about €350 after rent, which I still need for food and other everyday expenses. It's enough for me and I roughly have about €30-€50 to spare at the end of every month. So I have enough, but I can't really afford to frequently spend money on big things.  My girlfriend recently suggested that we could go on a vacation  (which would of course be awesome). We looked for some trips, but they were minimum about €500. I  told her that if I would want to afford that, I would have to spend all the money I saved in the last year. My Girlfriend has enough money saved to not have any financial problems with paying for such a trip, but for me, it means that I would only be able to treat myself with little to no things I originally intended spending the money on.  We had a little argument and she said that I just wouldn't care enough about our relationship and that I'm selfish.  So...

iwx1xlth	Throwaway account.  Some information for the beginning: I am a student (m20) and my mom is 46.   My grandmother comes from a Russian city (Kazan) , but when she married my grandfather they settled down in Ukraine because my grandfather is a marine so it would be convenient for him to stay close to the Black Sea. After my grandparents migrated they would visit Kazan from time to time because the rest of the family stayed mostly there. The family is large (my grandmother had six siblings), so there are a lot of distant relatives. My mom used to visit the rest of the family as well, but only with her parents so she hasn't been there for about 25 years now, but she still has memories of the place and the people. My mom married my dad who comes from Moscow and we settled down in Switzerland (yep, pretty international). Now to the problem.  As I said in the title, my mom's aunt/the older sister of my grandmother died recently. My mom had a strong emotional bond with her so she took the news rather emotionally. My grandparents will attend the funeral and they also asked my mom whether we would join. My mom for some reason has suggested that we should go there, attend the funeral and visit the family for the first time in a while. My dad seems to be fine with that, but not me.  See, the problem is this: I have my university exams in 2 weeks. We would be certainly already back by that time, but I don't want to mess with my preparation at all. I told my mom about this to which she replied that I would be able to prepare there as well. I am not happy with that at all, I like to work in my own environment, in silence and concentration and there is no guarantee that I will get these things there. In fact, the opposite is more likely: I will be forced to attend all meetings and get barely any alone time. The second reason why I am against this is the fact that I don't know ANYONE there. I'll be real here: I have no emotional attachment AT ALL to these people. I never met them at an age that I would consider significant in order to remember them or have any bonds (only few of them have seen me when I was about 2 years old, they visited us when we were still living in Moscow). They would be like those distant relatives that you see on a family gathering and they tell you how much you have grown and how they used to wipe your ass when you were a baby, while you stand there and pretend that you know who they are. But I don't remember any of them at all. Some my say "that's your family and you should care" but I don't consider this to be a good enough reason at all. Family isn't defined by blood relations but by the bonds and time spent together. While this seems like a total wreck of my plans. I told my mom that I would be ok with them going there and me being left alone so that I could work by myself yet she insists that I should go and basically calls me heartless for not wanting to.

3jr2sfzf	Hello ya’ll!  About a year ago, my pup (about 6 ish years old) and I (21f) moved back in with dad and stepmom. I had no where else to go and didn’t have the funds for my own place because I’m paying my way through university.   I was told moving in that I could stay till graduation. Cool. Great.   Not cool. My stepmom hates me and has set out to make my life miserable. This isn’t my interpretation, this is fact. Our family therapist, who saw all of us, blatantly told me to my face several times that my stepmother hated me and that everything I did set her off.   My dad generally doesn’t allow her to out right say terrible things to me, at least when he’s in ear shot (out of ear shot however she’s called me a whore for not saving my first kiss until marriage and other things). So she takes all her hate out on him. He’s taken to asking me to cave into all her demands so that he “doesn’t have to deal with the fight”.   For my dog. My stepmom hates, HATES, animals. As in cusses out my dads dogs he got from my grandma after her passing on the regular.   Recently she (through my dad to me) has taken issue with me leaving my dog in the house when I’m gone. It’s a weird catch 22, because she wants me to work 40+ hours a week while being in school and wants me to not be home so she doesn’t have to deal with me, but if I leave for any other reason besides school, work, or church even if I have all my responsibilities and chores done she throws a hissy fit.   My dad ( really my stepmom) recently bitched me out for being ‘presumptuous’ that they would take care of my dog while I was gone, and how every time I leave ask me well why can’t you take your dog.   For context my dog is 6. She’s a little older and just sleeps while I’m gone. I fill her food and water before I leave (big bowls) and I clean up the backyard and vacuum her shed every week. So frankly, they aren’t taking care of her. They lock themselves in their room watching daytime soap operas while she sleeps in her dog bed or gets pets from my siblings.   The day in question I went to class in the morning, spent a few hours with my friend after, then went to work. I was bitched out for going to school and then my friends right after, but not for going to work because the more money I have the sooner I leave	1642882129.0	saawov	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saawov/aita_for_expecting_my_family_to_watch_my_dog/	AITA for expecting my family to watch my dog?
7esniag4	Just alittle context I'm a (17)M who balances school, sports, and working in the wonderful field of fast food. I live in a fairly rural town and since covid and the winter months are a thing I'm barely getting 15 hours a week.  Now onto the juicy stuff. I like buying things for people, especially family. It makes me feel good. So it's not rare for me to take my siblings to get food or a drink. But recently my mom has been berating me for refusing to pay for things when my siblings ask; for example: yesterday night my siblings asked if I could take them to the skating rink (no biggie) I took this as they had money to pay to get in. They didnt, I texted my mother about it and was called selfish and was given a "talking to". This isnt the only time its happened mind you, a few times in the last couple of weeks my brother or sister has asked me to take them to get something and when its time to pay they say they dont have money, when I bring this up to my mom it's always be a "good brother" and "you have to watch out for family". I've tried explaining that it's not rude of me to refuse purchasing stuff all the time especially when I have to pay a phone and car payment every month and barely have enough left over for trivial stuff. I don't feel it's fair to me at all.	1642882413.0	sab0gf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab0gf/aita_for_not_wanting_to_buy_my_siblings_things/	AITA for not wanting to buy my siblings things?
iwufvea7	 I (15f) have 3 siblings (17m) (16f) & (13f) w/ single mom (42). to put it simply i'm distgusted w/ my family & I feel terrible about it but I truly can't help it. My family is extremely unhygienic & irresponsible. There are times they go weeks w/o showering , the house is absolutely filthy we have 3 dogs & they let them poop all over the house, the list goes on. Like them not flushing the toilet & letting it pile & clog, piles of dishes.  i realized that I deserved better & couldn't live like this. I was tired of going to school w/ stains & smelling badly. I was tired of having rashes from god knows what & having no friends. So over quarantine I decided to change that I saved up money from jobs around town & I sold some stuff I worked really hard & I redid my room, I bought me a new wardrobe & hygiene products. taught myself new habits, it was very hard My mother never really taught us how to do things like hygiene,cleaning &nutrition or anything so it was super overwhelming teaching myself everything w/ YT videos. It felt like discovering an entirely new world.  I've been keeping up the apperance & hygiene of myself & my room very well almost obessively, I had to get a lock for my door & a mini fridge cuz my family was using & destroying the stuff I bought for myself. I have friends & ever since I started High school I always get compliments on how I smell, look etc. I actually cried,i was so happy. But i've isolating myself from my family, I don't speak to them unless I have to.  Tensions have been rising ever since my new lifestyle change my siblings &mom have been making fun of me nothing malicious or sinister but very annoying. TBH i fine w/ that. But lately my mom has been whining & crying over me ignoring her or not spending time w/ the family. My mom isn't a bad person but she has very low emotional intelligence & is manipulative &can be really mean when upset.I spent holidays w/ my friend's family, when I got back from their X-mas my family was having a party w/ friends & other family they were really drunk & As soon as I stepped in the door I tried to head to my room but my siblings spotted me & they called my mom over & she started screaming & berating me over not spending the holidays w/ them & isolating myself & "hating them" my siblings,rest of my family & their friends started yelling @ me &my older siblings got into a really heated argument where they called me "C\*nt" & a "Stuck up B\*itch"& I lost it & said " I rather be that than f@t wh\*te-trash, y'all r literally f\*cking distgusting, it takes all the lord's strength to keep me from gagging being near y'all"... it went really silent before EVERYONE started down my neck calling me disrespecful & more I just ran to my room & locked the door.  In the A.M when i went to go brush my teeth my sis brushed past me calling me a b\*tch & I saw my other two siblings bagging something up & they matter-of-a-factly telling me that my mom told them to throw away my presents. I just went back to my room.	1642882852.0	sab5te	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab5te/aita_for_acting_better_than_my_family/	AITA for acting better than my family?
ejziw549	My boyfriend (28m) and I (24f) have been together for over a year, we are having our first baby but ever since I've been pregnant he's been telling his family how he can't wait for the baby to come out bc of how 'lazy' I am and how I don't do any housework etc. To which his mom replied 'she's pregnant, not crippled' But I do all the washing, dishes, vacuuming and tidying up all the rooms while he's at work. He literally does nothing except take out the trash when I ask him to. A few months ago I even found on his phone messages from him trying chat girls up on Instagram (he told me he deleted it at the start of last year but obviously didnt). He proceeded to then go to his mom and tell her that I've been accusing him of cheating for no reason, that I always check his phone(I dont) and just all these other lies about me to make himself look like he has to 'put up with alot' and that I'm such a bad person. His family hate me, they're 2faced af, and always making snarky comments about me.. especially his 17 year old sister, and he NEVER stands up for me if his family start talking shit.

66l4bto2	This is kinda gonna sound like a very unprofessional shit post. But anyways,  Yesterday my mom took us out to eat Tim Hortons. We had all our food, and then we were just sitting down chilling for awhile. We then see a worker who is asking all the customers for an ID and POV (proof of vaccination). My mom sees this and starts getting out POV before he comes to our table. He then makes our way to our table, and she's still getting it out.  As he's at our table, she's still getting it out and asks for POV, and my mom unnecessarily gets mad as this as she says "That's what I'm doing!". This annoyed me, as she could of just said, "Ok sure", or "One sec", or some shit like that. There was nothing for her to be mad about. Anyways she brings out her POV and he's like trying to scan the barcode or whatever and as he's doing that, my mom is literally glaring at him. The Tim Hortons worker has done literally nothing to offend her, so idk what she's so mad about. He also asks for my POV, and I gladly show it to him.  After asking for POV, he asks for ID. Now personally, I don't really like showing off my ID, I feel like it's unnecessary, but I know that the worker isn't just randomly going around the restaurant asking people for POV and ID, he's doing so because he's told to do it. So when he asks for ID, again, my mom unnecessarily gets mad at him, which is so fucking annoying and stupid. She then starts saying that she saw him go to other peoples tables (which is true), and he didnt ask for ID, which isn't true. because how could she know that? we both saw him going to other peoples table, but we were still too far away to actually hear what he was saying. so for my mom to go ahead and lie, and accuse him of not asking others for id is absurd to me and it pissed me the fuck off. anyways we show him id, and there my mom is being mad for absolutely no reason.  so then I start an argument with her. I didnt make a scene or anything like that, but I argued with her and started saying that what she did was wrong and so fucking unnecessary. I explained that guy was just doing his job. I explained that the worker was literally just trying to minimize the spread of covid, and trying to keep the restaurant safe. I explained that guy was literally TOLD to go ask for POV and id because its his fucking job. she started saying he only asked us for id because were black, and this only got me more mad, because its not true. we literally couldn't hear what he was saying to the other people at the other tables, and my mom has this mindset thats its the 1800s, and there are racist people everywhere we turn. that's just not how thinks work anymore. and this isn't the first time my mom has assumed random people she knows NOTHING about are racist.  I asked my mom if he didnt hear him asking for id, what was he asking the other customers for, and she couldn't formulate an answer.	1642883080.0	sab8qe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab8qe/aita_for_arguing_with_my_mom_for_unnecessarily/	AITA for arguing with my mom for unnecessarily being rude to Tim Hortons worker
46nge13n	I (28M) am lactose intolerant. My partner (31f) knows this and is somewhat herself. We don't often have ice cream at home but recently I decided to get some dairy free Trumpets (New Zealand version of cornetto) because it's been awfully hot. There is only 4 in a pack and I got for myself my favorite flavour, biysenberry ripple. I also bought my gf a box of fruit juice iceblocks which have 10 in a pack.   Recently, her friend came over to visit on a hot day. Neither my gf or I have issues sharing food. However, I did somewhat get upset when during the visit my gf offered one of my trumpets. I only had 2 left in the pack.  I didn't want to offer my trumpet to the friend because she is not lactose intolerant herself and would have been better off having the fruit juice one. My gf didn't see the problem with it when I said I didn't really want to offer one to her friend (whom she invited over) becuase of the lack of intolerance. My gf thought I was being childish and said why should she offer her a fruit juice ice block when the friend could try something new. We discussed this out of earshot when I went to grab the ice cream in seperate room.   Thankfully the friend declined the trumpet because it contained coconut milk, but I'm wondering was I the AH for not wanting to offer an invited guest one of my dairy free ice creams?	1642883167.0	sab9x6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab9x6/aita_for_not_wanting_to_share_my_trumpets/	AITA for not wanting to share my trumpets?
7z4b7k9u	I call my younger brother to ask if he could step in last-minute and babysit while my husband and I have a night out. He says yes, the next night he comes over and we give him care instructions. He then asks: “What time will you guys be back?” I said, “We don’t know yet, but we’ll keep you posted.” He then says, “Ok, just don’t be out too late.”   We leave at 6:30, get to our event, at 9:15 my brother texts me saying, “Hey when are you guys getting back?” I realized I forgot to give him an ETA and reply with, “We’re wrapping up now, be back at 10.”   We arrive on time, walk in the door, say hi — and he doesn’t even look at us. We ask how everything went, he grumbles and doesn’t answer. We pay him, then he angrily stomps out the door slamming it behind him. My husband and I look at each other like “What was that about?”  The next day I decide to call him out on it.  I start by saying, “Hey I really appreciate you stepping in on such short notice, but I’m wondering why you gave us the cold shoulder when we got home.”  He asked why I was even bringing it up, he had “already moved on” from it and that I should do the same. I said I just needed an explanation. He then said we were “disrespectful of his time” by arriving “too late” and making him miss his bedtime. He said he changed his plans that night to “come in clutch” for us and we were being totally ungrateful. He also (weirdly?) kept insisting that I said we’d only be out for two hours, even though I never said that (for several reasons).   I told him there must’ve been a misunderstanding, that we tried our best to honor his request to come back at a reasonable time, but if he wanted us back at a specific time he should’ve just said so. I then asked if any of that still justified the way he treated us. He got super mad saying I was being an “asshole”, and “failing to own up to shit” that I did, was “breaking his communication boundaries”, and being “hurtful”.   Now super confused, I’m like, “What shit do you want me to own up to? What boundaries do you want me to respect? If I did something hurtful you need to let me know. I can’t do any of these things if you won’t tell me what they are. Look, I’m sorry I didn’t give you an ETA sooner, if that’s what this is about, but I’m honestly hurt you’re calling me an asshole when all I’m trying to do is understand wtf happened last night!”  He said he couldn’t talk anymore, that he shouldn’t have responded so harshly, but was insistent that I owed him an apology for everything I did, again, without telling me what exactly I did wrong. We haven’t talked about it since.   So reddit, given that I was actually called an “asshole”, what’s your verdict on the situation? Am I the asshole he says I am, or what?	1642882876.0	sab63y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sab63y/aita_for_wanting_an_explanation_for_my_brothers/	AITA for wanting an explanation for my brother’s behavior?
bzieod7v	My friends were keep bugging me in the group chat about meeting on Friday and I kept telling them that I have my finals and needed to study. Since they were refusing to accept no as an answer, I just stopped replying to the messages and muted the notifications. I just didn't understand why they were so pushy and got a little bit frustrated about them being so selfish to insist on meeting at a time that I am so busy. And yesterday morning , two of them texted me to make sure that I am coming and I replied with a smiling and crying face at the same time emoji. OK, this is where I am at fault, but I just didn't wanted to write no the hundredth time. But honestly, who would take that emoji as a yes? Anyways, at around 7pm they start to calling me and I don't answer (I was at library and didn't wanted to interrupt session plus I hate phone calls.).  After a while, I give a break to get some coffee and I look at my WhatsApp. It was all over the place and basically long paragraphs, photo of the cake bought for me and messages about how they just wanted to wish me a happy birthday but I wasn't worth it if I couldn't leave my ass from the desk for a few hours to see them. I wrote them that I completely forgot about it, was so sorry and on my way to my friend's house(call her x) .  OK the real problem starts here. They don't belive that I actually forgot about it. They know that I am not in good terms with my family. We haven't spoken for 7 months and ofcourse they didn't bothered to wish me a happy birthday. I don't have a boyfriend neither and this group is literally the only people that could know about my birthday. So I am not reminded that it was my birthday till that happened.  When I went there they were already gone and x started to give me a speech. When I asked her  why is it impossible for me to forget it she said those exact words:" Yeah, you know what, this is what is normal for you. You are such a looser who has no one to celebrate it. Even your family and now we understand why."  I told her that she is crossing the line and she must be heartless to say that to me.  Yeah, I bawled my eyes that night. Now, I am left with tons of harsh messages that I need to reply. Honestly, all I wanna do is crash my phone into the wall but that would be such a cool thing to do for a loser like me.	1642884045.0	sabl4g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sabl4g/aita_for_forgetting_it_was_my_birthday_yesterday/	AITA for forgetting it was my birthday yesterday and ruining a surprise celebration?
iwy8lajk	My husband has always been very health conscious. He exercises religiously and is careful about the things he eats. When we first got married (5 years ago) and moved in together it was hard for me to adjust to his lifestyle but I slowly adopted his habits so it was fine.  However, I’m currently 5 months pregnant and all I want to do is eat junk. We already have a toddler and if I eat something, our toddler wants it too. My husband wants our toddler to eat only healthy foods, which was never realistic in my opinion as when he’s around other children he will naturally want to try some of the not so healthy food they’re eating.  So, if I’m having a snack and my son asks for some I usually give it to him. My husband was already upset I was eating junk food myself, he would make remarks about how what I was eating wasn’t good for me or the baby, but he absolutely freaked out when he saw our son eating it.  He took all of the food I bought that he deemed “bad for me” and got rid of it and won’t let me buy replacements. Pregnancy cravings aren’t fun so not being able to eat what I’m craving has put me in an awful mood and we keep arguing now, which we never did before.

i8ycoe4o	This sounds awful. I know it does. But please hear me out.  My (17F) friend "Casey"(18M) is kind, whip-smart, and an incredibly talented artist. He also happens to have Asperger's. He has absolutely encyclopedic knowledge of his special interests, but also has some difficulty navigating social situations, as well as regulating his volume and emotions (particularly anger).  A bit of background: Casey and myself are part of a friend group of 6, where the other 4 are dating each other (2 couples). Nobody makes a big deal of Casey's Asperger's. He's our friend, and we try very hard to make sure he never feels excluded in any way.   Lately Casey has been expressing how badly he wants a girlfriend. He showed me a chart he made of all the girls he currently has crushes on, as well as how he knows them and who they are already in a relationship with. One of the girls listed was me. I tried to express that I did not feel the same way as gently as I could, but I will admit I was at a loss for how to respond and may have fled a little too quickly. Casey has continued to act romantically interested around me since, but that's not what this post is about.  Around the time of the incident described above, Casey started to get very touchy-feely with myself and the other girls in the goup. It's not uncommon for the couples in our group to hold hands, cuddle, kiss, etc. when we're hanging out, and we also give goodbye hugs all around at the end of hangouts. I think he took that as a sign that touching is okay. He's been putting his hands on us girls without warning, coming up behind us and hugging us, etc. He's not a small guy and tends to get a bit loud and aggressive when annoyed, so none of us girls have really been comfortable saying anything. Mostly we just try to ignore it or laugh it off, but it's gotten out of hand.  Recently we were at an event at our high school. Casey came up behind one of the other girls, wrapped his arms around her shoulders, and just kind of stayed there until her boyfriend practically threw him off. That was kind of the last straw for me, so I asked Casey if I could talk to him for a minute. We went and sat on the bleachers, away from other people so we wouldn't be overheard, and I tried to explain as gently as I could that it makes us girls really uncomfortable when he does that kind of thing, and that he can come off as rather intimidating. He seemed very upset at that (almost crying), so I didn't press the issue. I asked if I could give him a hug before we went back, and he said something like "Are you sure I'm not too *intimidating*?". I told him this was different since we were both agreeing to the hug.  Ever since, he's been very withdrawn, and saying he feels like we don't want him around. I feel awful for making him feel that way, since I know we're his only friends, but it seemed necessary.

iwujxle9	MIL is getting married in a few weeks. She is difficult under the best of circumstances. She is a bridezilla and perpetual victim under the worst. She isn't even having a big wedding. I have no idea how simple and intimate is causing this much stress.   MIL is licensed to do Botox and sometimes brings some home with her. We had a family dinner the other day and she was giving it to her mom and decided her fiancé needed some. He said no. She tried to bribe him. He said he isn't a woman so who cares. MIL said he was ruining her perfect wedding pictures and she wants him to be "pretty" She then tricked him into looking at something and gave him Botox after he'd said no twice.  The family thought it was hilarious. Honestly he seemed a little impressed and he did laugh. People made some kind of sexists jokes about he should just have done what she wanted to begin with and happy wife happy life. MIL did apologize but she was laughing and he just said payback is going to be a bitch but he did let her kiss him and I was clearly the only person who didn't find it funny.   MIL told me that I look so scandalized and it's ok because half of their relationship is her putting creams on him while he tells her to stop. I clearly value boundaries a lot more than she does and this whole thing really skeeved me out. Also not exactly what I want my son to grow up watching.   I said she shouldn't have a medical license or a relationship if she thinks that is ok. MIL got upset and wouldn't talk to me. Then when we were leaving she got all emotional and said I'm awful and I want her to die alone and that is an awful thing to wish on someone. Her fiancé said I'm rude and maybe i like my relationship to be "boring and static" but he likes some who is a challenge and it's fine because he pushed her out of a plane once and I'm the boring one.  My husband is on my side but everyone else is acting like what I said was really out of line.

amodt6a4	  People involved. Me 34f, husband 34m and sons 7 & 3.  I have been sick with sinus crud for 11 days. Three negative COVID tests so I know it isn't that. I woke up this morning with a high fever. We didn't have any definitive plans today other than I was supposed to go back to work because I was finally starting to feel better. I did not return to work.   I informed my husband that whatever my body is fighting is winning at this point and that he was on his own so I could catch up on rest. He proceeded to go outside to work on his work equipment and left the kids with me. I was frustrated but what he was doing needed to be done so I kept my opinion to myself. He came back in about 2 hours later and took over the kids again.   My youngest is very compassionate and kept coming to check on me and while I appreciate his sweetness it was interrupting my sleep. Then one of the kids kept "drumming" on the couch and floor and I lost it.   I sent my husband a text message asking him to be considerate of me trying to sleep and to keep the kids away from me for a few hours and keep them relatively quiet. I know kids can be loud in general so I wasn't asking for silence but maybe no unnecessary noise. Which is where I feel like I might be the ass hole.   After the message the kids have stayed quiet-ish and I was able to get some sleep   Also wanted to add that I am in my bedroom and not in a shared space.

ibff4gk4	I, 24 yo F, lost my dad December of 2020 unexpectedly. It was unexpected so it crushed my siblings and I. My parents are divorced so my dad lived in a different state, but he did everything in his power to make sure we still had a relationship with him.  Four months before his death, he called me & asked to talk about his Will since he was redoing it since he just got remarried. He told me everything that was in it & he asked me to promise him one thing if something happened to him: not to let our family get separated like his did years back, which resulted in his siblings hating each other. I promised I wouldn’t let that happen.   When we found out he passed, we drove down to his city & found out that his Will was not notarized & his new wife got everything. We were devastated. We were not on great terms with her, so my little brother (21yo M) & I decided to let our older brother (31 yo M) kiss her ass & try to get everything we could of our dads.  Over the course of the last year, it’s been an awful game of waiting. We were hoping to get our grandpas house (that was originally going to us), his car, and his belongings. We were all so stressed out & emotional that we did clash heads a few times.   Towards the end of 2020, we got almost everything (house, car, belongings) & it finally felt like we were settling down. Because Christmas last year was so awful, we were determined to have a good Christmas this year. So we all get together but my little brother, C, had different plans. He has been bullying me a few months prior, calling me lazy, pathetic, & a drama queen with my dads death & told me to get over it. With my older brother R, he accused him of wrecking my dads car & insisted that he get bought out of my grandpas house for the money since R was moving into it. He said he wanted nothing to do with this family & that we were all careless & selfish. He made my mom cry by not going bowling with us, which is the only thing she wanted for Christmas. He left to go back home early Christmas morning, ruining the Christmas we tried to make special. Due to this outburst & many other things, I’ve decided to no longer have a relationship with C because he has been nothing but greedy, selfish, & a bully. He doesn’t believe his is wrong & will never admit it. So I’m done, but my mom thinks I should just forgive him.  So WIBTA for letting us break this family up & going against my dads wishes?	1642885692.0	sac6os	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sac6os/aita_for_going_against_my_dads_final_wishes/	AITA for going against my Dad’s final wishes?
drlwrjug	Hi, so me and my brother are both 15 (twins heh) and our parents get our auntie to come "look after" us because of my mental health condition I can't be left alone (she only needs to make sure I eat which I do bc she tells me how much of a disappointment I am If I don't...anyway). I'm a very reserved person, I have selective mutism and am more than happy staying in my room, my brother hardly leaves his room either. When she comes round its usually very unexpected and sudden, leaving me with 0 time to prepare to be social (if that makes sense lol) like I would if I was going to her's. Every time she comes she always nags us to come downstairs and talk to her, she will even barge into my room and start poking around at my things when I told her not to, I know I sound like the average grumpy teenager but It really does annoy me. She doesn't seem to understand that we didn't ask her to be here therefore we don't HAVE to talk to her (yikes I feel like that sounds really mean but that's how i feel lol). She will then get angry that we never talked and tell my parents I've been a 'terrible' niece which obviously doesn't make me want to talk to her anymore. I'm not sure if its just my personality/mental illness (?) that makes me not want to talk to her but I'm starting to think there might be some things from the past  that I haven't forgiven her about, she's been pretty mean to me and made me feel insecure therefore she will always be that insulting person in my mind (I can't tell if that's who she really is or not idk but she's still pretty mean now).  Also, we see her pretty much every week if not more, I understand people like communicating with family but I'm not sure if she gets that I'm different.. I really don't want to upset her lol idk what to do.. it also important to mention I have no clue how to start/ carry conversations that aren't planned so it wouldn't go well anyways lol.   &#x200B;  Also a weird side note: She's had an odd obsession of trying to be our 'favourite aunt' for as long as I can remember lol she always asks if she's our favourite and I think she tries to out-do my other aunts with presents and stuff... idk I'm probs reading too much into it.	1642885151.0	sabz6q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sabz6q/aita_my_aunt_gets_angry_when_me_and_my_brother/	AITA?

iwzrc55v	MIL and FIL have been divorced for 12 years and they despise each other. They both cheated, marriage was a mess, and they both kind of suck.  FIL talks about her a lot. MIL never talks about him. We are having a party for our son's upcoming birthday and I knew FIL would have some feelings because he doesn't like being around MIL and her new husband.  We had dinner with him recently and he said how unfair it is that when you have kids you are expected to be around your ex. My husband pretty much told him to grow up and he said MIL is evil and mentally abused him. He then cited that she wouldn't have sex with him on their wedding night because they eloped and she said it wasn't a real wedding. She then climbed out a window and took off. He said that was mental abuse.   I said that was not mental abuse. He said she hurt his self esteem. I pointed out that she didn't want to marry him but had been gaslit into thinking that if she didn't marry him her siblings would all die from poverty and it would be her fault.   FIL responded that I am only defending her because I'm a woman and she did other mentally abusive things such as leaving the country multiple times without telling him, buying herself a condo and moving out without telling anyone, and being flirty with her now husband in front of him. FIL said he has self esteem issues from this and "that bitch stole half the money"  I looked him in the eyes and said he wasn't abused, newsflash she wasn't that into him, and told him t grow up.  His wife was furious and my husband says I overstepped, but I just feel it needed to be said.	1642886317.0	sacej0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sacej0/aita_for_telling_fil_that_his_abusive_marriage/	AITA for telling FIL that his abusive marriage wasn't that abusive and he needs to grow up?
iwyswr3q	At the end of the night, my (29F) boyfriend (30M) often starts falling asleep on the floor in the living room. I don't mind him taking a nap out there, I sometimes take a nap in the recliner.   My issue is that he will sit in the middle of the room (he likes to sit on the floor with his back leaning up against the couch) and so he's just... in the way. We live in a small apartment and he's huge, 6'4" (193 cm.)   He'll be starting to fall asleep by the end of something on netflix or a youtube video, and then he'll insist upon watching one more thing, usually a 20 minute long political something or other and have his head nodding 5 minutes into it. He often snores or makes other grumbling noises, and rarely but occasionally he'll start falling over onto my legs (I'll be sitting on the actual couch.)  It's annoying. And inconsiderate. I'll ask him to please go to bed because I'd like to watch something or play some videogames before it gets too late. This isn't about wanting go to bed at the same time, I really don't care about that. We have separate beds.   He likes to watch something on his phone in bed before he goes to sleep anyway so I don't understand why he won't just go lay down. It'll be past midnight, sometimes nearly 2:00 in the morning, and I think him saying that I should have to wait for him to sleep through 15-20 minutes of a video is ridiculous when it's already so late. Sometimes it'll even be the last 35 minutes out of of a 45 minute episode of something.   He always gets aggressive and demands that he should be able to finish his program, and says that I'm mistreating him by pestering him and not just letting him sleep a little in front of the tv when he works full time and pays bills.  If he wanted to sleep for a bit in the recliner out of the way, I really wouldn't mind. But it's a common area and I can't use it because he's refusing to stop falling asleep on the floor and doing that thing that dads do where they say that they were "watching that."   Honestly the way he reacts is pretty explosive and uncool either way but in this post I really want to focus on the question of whether he's being a jerk for taking up the whole living room, or he's right to say that he should be allowed to doze off and that I'm being a pest.    TL;DR - past midnight, my boyfriend often starts falling asleep on the floor in the living room and gets angry when I tell him that he needs to go sleep in his bed, but he's in the middle of the room and is in the way of everything, and won't let me change the tv until his show is over (usually about 15-20 minutes.)   He thinks I need to just let him doze in front of the tv for a bit because it's "not that hard to just wait until the end of [his] video," I think he's being really inconsiderate and that asking me to deal with this almost every night is ridiculous.	1642886905.0	saclth	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saclth/aita_for_insisting_that_my_boyfriend_needs_to_go/	AITA for insisting that my boyfriend needs to go to bed instead of falling asleep on the floor?
304kju03	I (32f) have been playing chess since 5th grade and was a jr grand champion at one point, I am good at the game. My bf (28m) wanted me to teach him when he found my chess board so I did. The problem is that he is a beginner and therefore I have won every game we have played. I let him take back moves and also tell him what I plan on moving or if I plan to take his pieces because honestly it isn't that big of a deal and I don't want to use tournament rules. Well now he is upset (not mad or angry by down) because he hasn't won. I tried to play a game without me taking any of his pieces (thinking it would make a challenging game for me and a more fun game for him) but he felt that I was "letting him win" which I wasn't, I still planned on winning. We have put the game up on my request because I don't want us fighting over chess. AITA for winning every game? Should I let him win? I feel like letting him win would be worse than beating him but idk and I don't want him to start hating chess.or to hold a grudge against me.

iver2hzb	 So for context, I'm a big reader and I own quite a lot of books, but all the books that I do own are very special to me and I have always treated them with care. My sister isn't big on reading and tends to do things like fold over pages to mark her place, spill food and drink over books and end up bending them from treating them roughly. A while ago I had just read this series which I particularly loved and she asked to borrow the books. I immediately agreed as I was happy to have someone to share them with and chat with about, however I did ask that she wouldn't fold the pages and just generally treat them well.  When she returned them to me they were completely wrecked. Keep in mind also that I had recently bought these with my own money and they were practically in perfect condition when I was finished with them, and now the covers were bent, the pages dog-eared and food and drink spilt all over them. Although I obviously want my books to be in decent condition I don't mind them looking well-loved as many of mine do, but it is the more careless and deliberate disrespect that gets on my nerves. So I was quite annoyed at her but mostly upset because one of my favourite book series was completely trashed, and I did have a conversation with her about it. At this point she apologised but didn't seem to think it was a big deal and thought I was overreacting.  Less than a month later she asked to borrow another of my books. I was wary but agreed, however it ended up in the exact same state. I won't go into detail about each book she damaged but it's safe to say that she continued to damage more of my books after this (I'm kind of a pushover and never refused when she asked to borrow them) in the same way. One time in particular though she spilt a food that I'm allergic to all over a book and so now I can never reread it or even really open it without buying another copy.  Getting to the point of all of this, she now wants to borrow my books again and I don't want to lend them to her. I pay for these books with my own money and while I'm happy to lend them to people that have respect for them, I don't want people using them as an expensive napkin. The way I see it if she really wants the books she should buy them herself and then not have to worry about treating them badly. She is understandably annoyed about this and says that its selfish of me and that it's "just a book" but to me they are so much more than that.  Not sure if this makes me TA because a part of me feels really bad for not sharing them. I'm not usually a selfish person, and I lend my sister clothes, jewellery, stationery and anything else I have without a thought, and I hate the idea of not sharing something that she could enjoy. I think I might be clouded by the love of my books and therefore acting selfishly, and so I just want an objective opinion to help me out.	1642888116.0	sad1ap	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sad1ap/aita_for_refusing_to_lend_my_sister_my_books/	AITA for refusing to lend my sister my books
868byno7	I (F29) will be turning 30 soon so I was getting nostalgic and thinking back to my high school years. I remember a situation I got Involved with in my senior year. Recently a guy had died from a car accident. One day some students were holding a memorial at his parking spot. Out of respect, all of the students parked near the spot moved their cars to a different area, except for one girl. We'll call her S. She refused to move her car because she wasn't close to the guy. Many people got mad about this.  The next day when I was in yearbook class, a group of girls were scheming to take revenge on S by throwing bologna all over her car. S was a vegetarian. I was conflicted because I didn't think that was right and although S could be disrespectful,  these girls were also rude and snotty. They talked about me behind my back about gaining weight. They also assumed another girl was a lesbian because her friends were lesbians. I decided to tell the guidance counselor about the plan. She seemed conflicted as well but said she would put a stop to it. The next day the girls were mad and talked sh*t about whoever ratted on them. So, wita for stopping the bologna incident?	1642888465.0	sad5uf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sad5uf/aita_for_preventing_vandalism_with_bologna_on_a/	AITA for preventing vandalism with bologna on a car
97y6y	My fiance and I(M 27/F 23)have lived with my friend(M 34)of 15 years for the past 3 years. He used to rent the basement apartment at my parents house while I was a teenager, him being about 8 years older than me. All 3 of us moved in together to a rented townhouse in late 2019, and split most costs evenly 3 ways. In September 2020, we purchased a single family home and he moved with us into the finished basement. Little background on the house: the basement has 2 bedrooms, full bath and laundry, and a living space. We charge him $600/month in a area where the average rental cost would be upwards of $850-950. We charge him so little because we’re aware that it’s a shared kitchen.  In the beginning, there was an unspoken understanding of shared responsibilities and tidiness, i.e dishes, wiping down countertops, and leaving common areas free of personal items. Over the past year he’s created more mess than he cleans. For example: leaving dishes in the sink next to an empty dishwasher, leaving a messy stove area after cooking, and leaving his (frankly very smelly shoes and cigarette scented clothing) personal items in the Den.  The Den is something of a source of conflict. I invested a lot of money into the den with a large couch, a coffee table and tv console that I made myself, and very expensive 86 inch tv + video game systems. This area is not a part of the basement, nor is it a space I consider a common area. With that being said, while my fiance and I aren't using it, I have no problem letting him watch TV and play video games. As mentioned, he has a living room space in the basement with a couch, tv, and xbox that we don’t use (the area is his, and we respect his space). It’s come to my attention that he uses the Den on a daily basis, even sleeping overnight on the couch about 3 nights a week. He exclusively eats off of the handmade coffee table in the den (despite having two tables and a kitchen island at his disposal) and while he previously tidied up after himself, in recent months he’s taken to leaving dishes, beer cans, and food debris not just on the table, but in the couch. He makes so much of a mess that the carpet under the spot he sits at is discolored, and the wall next to it has obvious smudges from his hands. He has never once vacuumed anywhere. He has friends and a girlfriend that come over, order takeout, and eat in the den, on the coffee table that clearly means a lot to me. I also eat in that room on occasion, but take care to clean up after and wipe down the surface. It’s worth mentioning that we have 2 large dogs, and we’re very mindful of their impact on the house. We vacuum almost daily, and keep a clean space. One of the dogs is fairly young, so we try to keep things out of his reach. My roommate frequently leaves his cigarette cartons and lighters on the coffee table within their reach, which upsets my fiance who has talked to him about it before.  The final issue that prompted me to post here was not being able to find a cup for coffee this morning. I looked in the cabinets and noticed that there were significantly less glasses, Yetis, and mugs. While we rarely go into the basement (storage, 2nd bedroom is used as guest room, breaker box and internet are down there) and are very conscious of his space, I knew he had glasses down there. I’m not going to tiptoe around this, and I know it will be unpopular, but I opened his door and immediately saw loads of cups. I collected them from his bedside table and windowsill, and my arms were completely full. In total, I found 17 cups with various liquids and molds in them. It should be noted, 3 of these cups were actually his own that he brought with him when we moved in.  A few things to note: my fiance and I really enjoy the extra money towards the mortgage, and love seeing him on a regular basis because he’s such a fun guy. We don’t want to have strict, outlined rules in the house and prefer to operate on a common sense basis. I also recognise that a lot of these issues could possibly be resolved by just talking to him about them, but it’s important to clarify that he doesn’t handle these conversations well at all, and gets EXTREMELY defensive. I never wanted to be a landlord to him, preferring a casual roommate friendship that I thought could thrive because he has so much of his own space.	1642888840.0	sadapq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sadapq/aita_for_confronting_my_roommate_about_bad_house/	AITA for confronting my roommate about bad house habits and a lack of boundaries?
iwznfxc3	MIL is Filipino and was adopted by a white couple who had one bio daughter. They also adopted a male child from Syria. Her adopted parents suck a lot. They used the phrase "beautiful oriental daughter". They refer to their adopted kids as adopted kids. They claimed the middle eastern one didn't need sunscreen and once took MILs sandwich away because she gave him some of hers, then let her stay in the sun for hours without eating until she passed out. MIL and the brother shared a room while the bio daughter had her own (even as teens) They wanted MIL to fake being bipolar so they could get meds for their bio daughter without admitting she had issues. MIL got kicked out of the house for having sex. Someone could write a book about why they suck. All three of their kids are very close and all three are no contact with them.  Those people suck and obviously adopted for the wrong reasons, but I still think adoption is a beautiful thing. My BFF "Zoe" recently adopted a beautiful little girl who is African American (Zoe and her husband are white) Zoe is a kickass mom and didn't have a preference when she began the adoption process. MIL hates Zoe and has previously slandered her and FIL destroyed her purse during some wedding drama and that was before the adoption.  When MIL met Zoe's daughter during SILs bridal shower at my house I could tell she had an issue. She asked Zoe some questions in an accusatory manner. Zoe answered to the best of her ability. MIL then said very condescendingly that Zoe needs to learn to do her daughter's hair and that Zoe should try to put her in a diverse school. those aren't bad suggestions but it is none of MIL's business.  I pulled MIL aside and asked if she had a problem. She said she doesn't think people should adopt children of a different race and it isn't fair to the children. they would be with someone who understands them better and I was shocked. I called her a bigot. MIL said I'm an idiot and she just gets nervous that people see their adopted kids as Instagram props or something. I said i understand but by bringing race into it she is a bigot and needs to get over her issues and not let it effect how she treats people or she can leave.	1642889113.0	sadech	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sadech/aita_for_calling_my_mil_a_bigot_because_of_what/	AITA for calling my MIL a bigot because of what she said about my best friend adopting?
xpqv8	So some context, I live in a place where it’s a known practice where people deliberately get hit by cars to demand money. It’s messed up, but keep that in mind.  I was driving through my nightly route when I heard a thud against my car mirror. As there were no other vehicles around, I stopped tand saw a person to the side holding their arm. The road wasn’t the widest, but for them to have been hit, they had to be closer to the road. (This was around 9pm.)  I made sure my car wouldn’t be in the way of any other drivers and got out to check on them. The first thing they immediately said was “You drive fast.”  I called out in response. “I’m sorry, I didn’t see you! Are you okay?” I held up my hands together apologetically out of habit. But no response. They just stood there.   By now I was a few steps away from my door, and the lack of response was making me uneasy because there are also local stories of people here forcing drivers to pull over before holding them up. The area wasn’t lit too well either, so it’d be a prime location for that.  After a moment of silence, I got back into my vehicle. This seemed to anger them, so they took a photo as I drove off.  I was concerned for my safety, but I’m sure I could have done things better if it wasn’t in the middle of the night with no one else around on a dark side road.   I’ve been passing this road daily for two years, and the only other time someone got hit by my mirror, they admit it was their fault for being too close to the road while smoking. Aside from that there was never any issue, even when I’d pass by the particular street while more populated in the afternoon.

e45gbk1q	Wednesday I had minor surgery on my hand and in all honest the worse part was having he IV start.   While I was sedated they did a nerve block on my hand which made the whole thing pretty useless until the next day.  The whole thing from pre op to post op took about two hours.  So when I say minor that's what it was.    The next day I was feeling find and pretty much going on back with my daily life and went to work.  I stated out of the kitchen and off the floor and was mostly in the office because it wasn't until later the next day I finally had full feeling in my hand.   During the day I had a meeting with one of my who is changing jobs soon and brought his replacement by for introductions. My hand was of course still bandaged.  I apologized and explained everything that had been going on.  I never offered to shake the new reps hand.  Mostly because My right hand was useless and if he would have squeezed just right he could have maybe caused some damage.  The meeting ended and they left.   A couple of hours later I got an email from the new rep saying that he was deeply offended by the lack of a handshake and that it shows a persons character by failing to do so and that he wasn't sure if he would be interested in working with me.  I responded back apologizing and saying that I was sorry he felt that way.  But I still didn't have much use of my hand and fingers and that shaking hands was a bad idea until I had that feeling and use.  Also I didn't want to risk popping any stitches or anything.  I then told him that he was actually the only rep in my area and that I was a pretty big account.  His response back was while he "understood" my situation I still should have found a way to shake his hand as an introduction and it shows bad business and communication skills.  I told him that I'm sorry he felt this way but if he felt so strongly about this I would be in contact with his boss and make further arrangements on how to handle my account. I have not heard back from him.   So AITA for not shaking his hand?	1642889067.0	saddsq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saddsq/aita_for_not_shaking_hands/	AITA for not shaking hands.

epgxsix7	A few weeks ago (Before Christmas), Jessica (26F) told me she was not going to our usual dinner, because she didn't want to be around it. This was also shortly after having my 2 children and Jessica's 2 children + our baby at my parents house. During this visit with all of the children my mother and father showed very obvious favouritism towards my (first) 2 children to the point where, after we got home, Jessica's children asked us why this had happened.    Jessica wanted me to speak to my parents about what had happened, and asked for it to not continue. "Tackle the issue" before it became a "problem". Due to Jessica not liking being around confrontation, and my fathers temper she asked me to do this alone, to which I had no issue with doing.  During this "Solo Dinner" I explained the issue to my parents and even pointed out that we had been telling them of our Boundary for Over 6 months.    My mother agreed that it was wrong, however, my father straight up said "They are not your kids, they are not my grand-children, and I will not treat them the same".  There was a big argument. I told my parents there would be no more weekly dinners. Shortly after, was Christmas . We were supposed to attend a {family tradition} Christmas breakfast at their house with Jessica's children + our baby. We would not see my children until the afternoon.    I informed my parents that none of us would be attending. I also informed them that they were BOTH welcome to come to our house after lunch, when we would have all 5 children. My mother came, my father did not.  A few weeks later, was our oldest child's 10th Birthday. I invited BOTH of my parents around to celebrate having the birthday cake with her (about 1.5-2 hours). My other showed, my father did not.    Later the next day, after dropping my children back to Emily, Emily messaged me to let me know that Sophie was 'distraught' that my father did not see her for her 10th birthday. This caused some major issues between me and my parents, as it was now effecting the children.  I messaged my mother to ask her to organise a time for BOTH of my parents to come and talk about the issues we were all having, I expressed that if they did not come to see us, they were making their choice to not be (Physically) part of our children's lives any longer.  Last week, was the day this was supposed to happen. My mother showed up, and told us that my father was refusing to come, because he believes that he has done nothing wrong.  I explained to my mother that because she made the effort to come see and talk to us, and fully understand what we are asking that she will be invited to things, however, because my father refused he would not.    She said she understands, and she wants to be a part of the children's lives, with or without my father  AITA for removing him (Physically) from the children's lives because he refuses to treat all 5 children as equals?

p9ly8	So recently me and my boyfriend decided to split. He’s keeping the apartment and I would move back home to my parents. We own 2 cats, one was a gift from my sister to me and the other I received from a coworker who could no longer take care of her. I received them both while we were living together. My ex did helped take care of them by cleaning the litter box, helped giving them baths when they needed one and occasionally buying food and litter. I on the other hand plan their vet appointments and pay for them, I’m the one who buys  and gives them their flea treatments and also buys food and litter.

ezxxnhfc	So basically, I've been having a lot of skin irritation and rashes all over my body recently thus,  my girlfriend told me that she wants us to go to a medical clinic and get checked up but her reasoning behind it was that her "doctor" friend told her that I might have been getting those rashes because I have HIV, which is just stupid, because I dont have any other symptoms whatsoever and she's the only person I have slept with in so long plus I don't partake in any other activities that might lead me to getting it . But she has been paranoid about ever since. and she has been mad at me, and ignoring me because 'I don't respect her concerns and don't care about her feeling' even though I said I would rather go to a dermatologist than to get tested for hiv. so, am I the asshole here?	1642890493.0	sadwty	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sadwty/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_go_to_a_health_checkup/	AITA for not agreeing to go to a health checkup?
3sv9rh6w	Okay so I (F25) have known M25 since high school, we're good friends. We both enrolled in college studying in a very creative field, but there are also some courses which are theoretic and require some serious studying and/or research papers.   I have been attending classes pretty regularly, keeping in touch with professors and trying to get a hold of necessary materials for the upcoming exams. My friend... Well, he's more of a go-with-the-flow type. He does come to classes, but he doesn't really write anything down and he doesn't pay much attention. He is devoted to the more practical, creative classes and only does work if it's fun.  So, the upcoming exam is really difficult and he asked me if I have some materials to share with him. I haven't replied yet. Now, I have an entire notebook which I created from scratch, with all the lessons very carefully written and organised - info collected from lectures, books and Internet.  Now, here is where I might be an asshole. I really don't want to share this with him because I feel like I worked really hard, putting days (even weeks) in writing all of this, and I feel like he shouldn't get it without any effort. On the other hand, he's a really nice person and I don't want him to fail because he'll be held back an entire year. I actually want to help him but I kinda feel angry that he didn't do any work although I warned him he should start studying.

bcsr42vb	My dad works 2 jobs, and he works hard. He's our only income, I get it, it can be stressful.  But sometimes, I refuse to believe what he does is reasonable.  To sum it up, he's quite narcissistic. Every time he enters a room he puts the family down, saying comments such as 'You never do anything. Your sat on your ass again?' 'Your not ill. I'm the one who's ill' 'You have no right to be tired, I'm the only one who works around here' 'shut you miserable git, you havent got a reason to be depressed. I've given you everything you've ever wanted'  'Where did my little princess go? Why do you hate me?'  This is constant, all day everyday. These past few years I've started to argue with him, because I'm tired of him making my mum depressed and lashing out at my younger brothers (who are autistic and often don't understand what they've done wrong)  He also never praises me, only critizes. I'm never good enough, he's always better then me. So I've started to retaliate.

5j54gq43	Okay, first time posting and so this may not look how I want!  I (29f) am expecting my first child. Completely unplanned and to be honest I have no idea about any of the process. I’m just trying to get through each day staying awake and not throwing up!  I’m 15 weeks so past the ‘danger zone’ I’m told but I have no plans to do a social media post or anything like. It’s not that I have anything against these, it’s just that I think only people that care about me are going to care about my pregnancy and so it doesn’t warrant a big announcement from me. Plus I hate fuss and being the centre of attention.  Here’s where I may be TA. MIL and FIL are desperate to do a social media post but I told husband that I really rather they didn’t. Like they are welcome to tell their friends that they are going to be grandparents but I really feel uncomfortable about the whole public announcement thing.  Anyway husband told in-laws to calm it on the big announcement and refrain from putting it all over the internet and they’ve been a bit frosty ever since, asking when they will finally be able to talk about it and not be silent.  Husband says he will back me 100% but has said (only to me not in front of in laws) that maybe we just let them do it.   AITA for saying no?	1642891521.0	saeacm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saeacm/aita_for_not_announcing_my_pregnancy_and_only/	AITA for not ‘announcing’ my pregnancy and only telling people in conversation?
8k2sgzzs	We love each other and I would say we are good couple in most aspects. We had issues in the past but we were able to overcome them. We decided it is time to move in together. Recently, I feel like I am putting all the work, in looking for a place, doing a budget and just getting ready for that. Today we were going to look for an apartment and I told her. Let’s both have our laptops open so we can see twice more places. She told me no because she is tired. I got upset and told her this was important. She refused to and said she was okay with me doing it while she watches with me, basically me doing all the work. I got upset and told how I am angry that it feels I am putting much effort and I told her how in life you cannot stop doing something important just because you are tired. Then I proceeded to act like an asshole and I guess being mean. Anyways, I m not asking if that is the asshole behaviour. I m asking if me getting upset at her for not wanting to help was an asshole thing. I m worry that if we stay together, it will be like that and I will be taking care of stuff cause she is tired. I am really tired too. I study and work and I don’t complain about my tiredness.	1642891434.0	sae99k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sae99k/aita_for_calling_my_gf_lazy/	AITA for calling my gf lazy?
glpgjlbw	My friend sent me a gift basket from a foreign country through his coworker (let’s name him Bob) because he was traveling and had a layover in my city. I was unable to meet him during his layover because I had a prior engagement. So, he said that he could ship the package when he gets home. When he shipped the package, I paid him back for the shipping. After a couple days, I checked the tracking and it said the package was “undeliverable and sent back to sender.” I called USPS and they told me the apartment number was missing. I tried to correct the information but the post master said it was too late. When Bob received the returned package, he sent it back. Now he is asking me to pay for the second shipping cost.  AITA for telling him that because the error was not my fault that I shouldn’t pay for the second shipping?

6ntirlc1	I (19F) live abroad in the UK and have most of my family, apart from my parents and my brother live in Portugal.  Due to covid, I haven't been able to see the rest of my family for over 2 years now. As our last trip was cancelled, I decided to look into going back home some time in February before leaving my job. As I'm trying to plan things out, my parents tell me that my "uncle and godfather" who I will call A is living with my grandparents again. He's 47 and doesn't own a house, meaning, he didn't have anywhere to stay. Problem is, he is notorious in the family for taking advantage of defenceless people - including his own parents - for money. He has a stable job and a part time job, not making any sense of this. He has put down my grandparents as downpayment for a loan, when they denied and he managed to get them over 10,000 in "borrowed" money. He has also continuously asked for money and not given it back, in between many other things.  Plus, he has been accusing the mother of my cousin (14M) for not letting him see him, when in fact, he is not up to seeing him in the first place and doesn't pay any child support.   I am very undecided if I should stay with my grandparents - as we usually stay with both my grandparents and my grandma when we go there for holiday as our flat is currently rented out to my aunt - which would cause some drama bc I don't speak to A and haven't spoken/seen him in almost 4 years, and I don't want to speak to him, due to his continuous fuck ups.  However, I really do miss being with my grandparents and staying with them would feel like old times.   I feel like I would be the asshole as that could hurt my grandparents as they are only trying to support their child, even thought I completly disagree with this.	1642891911.0	saefa5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saefa5/wibta_for_not_staying_with_my_grandparents/	WIBTA For Not Staying With My Grandparents?
2yfc1yms	I’ve been on Reddit for a few years now but this is my very first post so I’m sorry if it’s all over the place and very long. I (22f) recently got engaged to my high school sweetheart (25m), and we began light wedding planning for our ceremony which will be in 2023.   Well a few days ago I had cooked for his family and after eating and good conversation I was in the kitchen washing dishes. My MIL whom I adore was making conversation about the future wedding and how she’s happy about her son getting married and was talking about how she’s happy to see my BIL on the bridal court for his brother and maybe see his gf on my bridal court. I laughed lightly and kind of dismissed the comment and said I was very excited as well.   In terms of interaction with my BIL’s gf there has been some turmoil with my in-laws and her in the past due to her character and the negative effect she’s had on my BIL. They are both adults btw, he is 21 and she is 20. My in-laws aren’t as close to her and there is an air of tension when we’re all together but my in-laws do make a really big effort.   I’ve met and interacted with her on a few occasions because she doesn’t like to come around to the house and all those times I feel like she purposely goes out of her way not to interact with them. I’ll try to make small talk with her or ask her questions to get to know her better to see if maybe we have something in common but she either slyly brushes me off or answers shortly and directs her attention elsewhere. My MIL and SIL have both noticed this and even brought it up that it doesn’t seem like she likes me and that it’s weird.   I brought this up to my fiancé and expressed how I felt and how I wouldn’t feel comfortable having someone on my bridal court who probably doesn’t like me seeing as how she’ll have to be involved in everything ranging from bridal shower, planning and all that. He agreed and is 100% on board with me.   I did bring up how on the other hand how it would be bad if she wasn’t on my bridal court and  his brother was to be paired with one of my friends on my court and her jealousy(BIL has told my fiancé on a separate occasion that she’s very jealous and controlling) causes her to make a scene for him to not do it. He also acknowledged this and saw how that could be a problem as well. Our wedding is about us and the last thing I want is for someone to be in a foul mood or for us to be walking on eggshells for one person.   My fiancé said that I should talk to his mom about that and express why I wouldn’t want her on my court. He also suggested his brother not be in his court but I said that’s not an option because that’s his brother and he should be on his court regardless. So now I’m wondering if I should just compromise and have her be on my court to keep the peace? I don’t want to make anyone unhappy.   So Reddit, WIBTA If I didn’t make my BIL’s gf part of my bridal court?	1642892572.0	saeo47	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saeo47/wibta_if_i_didnt_make_my_bils_gf_part_of_my/	WIBTA If I didn’t make my BIL’s gf part of my bridal court?
ix1fviqo	I have a co-worker (Stacy) whose job requires her and another co-worker (Alan) to be in the office. Stacy was allowed to WFH until they found out she was literally doing nothing so they recalled her. They figured if she wasn't getting work done at home then let her be in the office.  I do WFH and come to the office when I need to. Otherwise I can WFH full-time. Ironically the items that requires my being in the office are favors I do for my boss.  Anyways, Alan took off last week. Stacy asked me to come to the office to help out.   I refused. That's not my job to cover the office I don't have time and she's lazy. She's done nothing for me and I live 30 minutes away from the office. Quite frankly, she's a fucking bully.   Then she asked if I could come to the office to cover her lunch break. Her "concern" was someone needed to answer her line and she gets tons of calls. I refused unless I happen to be in the office.   She literally called HR Monday morning on me about not wanting to cover her lunch hour. They said I didn't need to come in but I had to pick up her phone line. She literally got 2 phone calls all week while at lunch. And one was a robocall.  On Thursday she asked me to come in the office because UPS or FedEx packages may or may not come in.   Again I refused. She asked me what my issue was and I said I'm not driving 30 minutes to the office and 30 minutes back home so she can take her lunch break.   This isn't even about her lunch break. It's about her getting a body into the office and finding some excuse why she can't finish the day and bouncing. Plus she has a fucked up attitude and I have no choice but to stay firm. She called HR up again and they never got back to her.	1642893281.0	saexk2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saexk2/aita_for_refusing_to_spend_an_hour_in_traffic_to/	AITA for refusing to spend an hour in traffic to cover a co-worker's lunch?
ix49a3x2	My (29M) gf (32F) have been dating for about 6 months.  We live about an hour apart so we see each other twice a week.  She comes and stays the night Friday, and I go and see her Sunday afternoon.  Earlier this week, she asked if we could go to a certain Mexican restaurant in my town.  She says that she's been wanting one of their margaritas.  I said of course, but yesterday morning I decided I wasn't in the mood for Mexican food, and asked if we could go to Texas Roadhouse instead because I knew she could still get margaritas there and I wanted a steak.  She reluctantly agreed, but said that we were going to the Mexican restaurant next week, and it wouldn't matter if I was in the mood for it or not.  I said that was fine.  Well, Saturdays are usually my day to spend with the guys and we always go to dinner after we hang out.  Turns out, we ended up at that same Mexican restaurant.  This is how my text conversation with my gf:  Her: "Where y'all going?"  Me: (sent a picture of the margaritas on the table)  Her: "Lol oh so you're fine going there with the nerds but not me! Thought you weren't in the mood for Mexican food..."  Me: "I got my steak....  We went to bdubs but it was an hour wait"  Her: "mmhmm...we're still going on Friday"  Me: "Lol that's fine"  Her: "mmhmm" (with a neutral emoji)  Me: "Oh get over it hahaha you like your fried steak".  She hasn't responded to me yet.

7nhrqsqr	 Long story short this woman and my husband had previous sexual relations and we all tried being friends but she tried to start drama so we ended up cutting her off.   We had a lot in common so I really wanted to try to be friends again so I let her back into our life on the terms that she not try to private message him.   Well, of course she did, then I called her out for it online  because she posted a pointed and vague post I assumed was about me, and in order to defend herself she said “Facts, we were friends before they met so there’s no reason we shouldn’t be able to remain friends”.  And someone came to her comment and defended her and I replied that they weren’t friends that they were *Passionate Hugging* Buddies and that her husband chose my husband for her to swing with.  This was on TikTok so I didn’t know that second commenter was her 15 year old daughter.   Well now her, her husband, and a mutual friend are all mad at me for exposing that to the daughter.   I immediately took the post down when I was told that was her daughter.  I could care less that the woman and her husband are mad but I’m really broken up about losing the mutual friend.	1642893961.0	saf6e6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saf6e6/aita_for_disclosing_someones_private_sex_life_to/	AITA for disclosing someone’s private sex life to their daughter?
tv571	Hey all, I'll try to make this short.  Engine threw a rod (read: violently stopped working) back in September of 2020. Spent a while deciding what to do with the car, and settled on getting it fixed. July 2021 rolls around and I find this machinist who will rebuild the engine for about $3.8k, so I call him up and he's happy to do it. Ask him about doing it for $3.4k and he agrees. Gives me an estimate of a few weeks. A month and a half later (September-ish), I call him up and ask what's up. He lets me know he was real busy and say "it's okay man, take your time. We're not moving until January." He says his thanks and we part ways.  I stop by his shop a few times throughout the months, noting the car hadn't even been worked on. Every time I let someone know I was there. Call him in early December and ask what's up, then he says he can get it done by late December. I say cool, reminding him that we're moving, and hang up. I call on January 12, and he seems a little shocked to hear that I was moving in about ten days. I was a little shocked to realize he hadn't even really started on the engine.  I let him know rhe urgency and ask him for an honest time estimate. He's wishy washy with the answer but swears it'll be done before we leave (the 22nd.) I call this past Monday to make sure, and again he says it will be done before the 22nd along with reassuring that he'll check in with me on Thursday. I call on Thursday, says he'll give me a ring on Friday (the 21st) afternoon. The day comes and Friday morning I give them another morning call because I'm worried he won't call, and he says he'll get it done "this weekend," then that he'll call later om the same afternoon. I call around 5pm after hearing nothing and one of the other guys picks up who knows little about the car, but tells me he'll check and get back to me. Never called me back, and they closed for a mild snow day today, the 22nd.  I wrote a long, honest and politely aggressive message to the shop's facebook page today, but nothing has been said back.  I needed that car to move, and my job is now jeapordized because I'm 2000 miles away from where I was supposed to be heading.  I am worried though that I wrongly pissed him off. I don't want to anger the guy who's rebuilding my car's engine, because if he cuts corners I'm gonna end up at a huge loss. He said the engine has something like a 100 or 300 mile soft warranty in case the engine were to break, but if it breaks after that I don't want to be because I rushed him or frustrated him.  Did I call too much? Did I have naive or unrealistic expectations?

ix4i826q	Okay. So, basically.  I (14F) was always told that I was adopted. This makes sense. I've never questioned it. I have two dads (who I call Abba/Papa and Dad/Daddy) who I love SO SO SO SO SO SO much. Like, so much. I know i might come of as resentful in this post but I'm just really hurt rn.  Whenever I've brought up my biological parents in the past my parents just completely shut down. My Abba will kind of just go quiet and pretend like he didn't hear me, and my Dad always just changes the topic or tell me we'll talk about it when I'm older.   Recently I started poking around to figure out some stuff about my bio parents (I didn't inform either of my dads. I didn't want to hurt their feelings or make them upset or make them think I'm ungrateful) and long story short, I found my birth certificate. As you can probably tell from the title of this post, surprise surprise! I'm not fully adopted. My Abba's name was on the certificate.  I did more digging and found a marriage record between him and the woman's name on the certificate, who is my birth mother. It was dated a few years before my dads got married.  I was just so hurt. And confused? Do they think I'm super shallow or something, and would resent my dad cause we're not related? And why wouldn't they tell me about my mom? (whose alive and well, btw. I found her on social media. Married. Two kids.)  I guess I started getting really quiet and keeping to myself because I didn't know what to do with this, and I was keeping it all inside, and then I was having this argument with my abba and I kinda just snapped something about him not telling me about my birth mom and stuff. I didn't mean to reveal what I knew but I did. And now they're both upset and this is just a giant mess and I feel like such an asshole. But I also think I'm kinda justified? IDK.

6new4thd	I, a 17y/o (M) wanted to talk to my 40ish y/o uncle about a punishment that was given to me for not doing my homework. For context, our uncle took us(my siblings and I) in when we were new to the country and for 3 years he has been helping us financially and to adapt to the new environment. He was our legal guardian. So recently my uncle received an email from a teacher telling him I hadn't submitted some assignments that were due a week earlier. So my uncle asked me about it and I told him that I was already planning on finishing it that afternoon and it wasn't that much. My sibling and i speak to him on Sunday and he said that i would to be punished for not submitting my homework. The punishment would be to clean the bathroom for a month, not get an allowance for a month, and to not use my phone or laptop for a month. I thought this was ridiculous and wanted to talk to him about it but wanted to gather my thoughts on a notebook first. Fastforward to today, Saturday and i emailed him that i was to speak to him about the punishment and other house things. We get on a call and i began to explain to him about how the punish was too harsh and maybe it could be reduced or maybe he could understand that a warning is okay for a first time offence like this or something. He got offended and said "it was like a slap on his face" and that i should tell my social worker that i don't want him involved in my matters anymore. He told me that i was being disrespectful mentioning our age gap. I was and still am confused about this.

9vgtrri7	I(19F) have been dating my bf(20M) for 2 1/2 years. The whole time we've been dating he's been obsessed with Magic: The Gathering.   Background:  He taught me how to play and I had fun for about a year and 1/2. Eventually it started to wear me down. It involves so much brainpower and strategizing that the games were starting to stress me out. I have a pretty bad fear of failure and that often translates to board/card games. It would lead to me wanting to be alone for a while, sometimes crying, and overall being unhappy but never mean or angry. I've gotten so much better about losing but it's difficult when my bf and his friends list off every wrong play and every missed trigger that caused me to lose. When they do that it feels like I not only failed the game but I also failed my bf. Afterwards my bf goes over what I should have done instead. I want to emphasize he's always been nice about that. He's trying to teach me how to get better and is always supportive about it.   After a while I stopped playing and would say no when he asked. I still watch him play, support him at tournaments, listen and engage with him when he talks about cards, invite friends over to play w/ him, help w/ sorting/sleeving, and let him use my car to go to tournaments/Magic store when I can't. He would ask me to play a game every day and got cranky when I didn't.   2 weeks ago we had a fight and he said I'm not "supporting him in his passions" just because I won't play anymore. I explained that I support him in other ways with it and if he would stop asking me to play multiple times every day, maybe I could get back into it one day, but for now it's just too stressful and frankly, I'm sick of being asked to play every single day. Eventually we agreed that he would stop asking me to play and after a month we'd talk again and see if I was ready. If I wasn't, rinse and repeat.   Today:  My bf was about to play a game of Magic w/ his roommate and the following conversation occurred (paraphrased as best I can remember)  bf: It would be awesome if you could play w/ me and roommate. Ya know I've missed playing w/ you.   me: I'm ok. Y'all have fun  bf: Are you ready to start playing again? I'd love it if you could.   me: Not yet  bf: \*frown, eyeroll, and loud groan\*  Now I can hear him talking w/ his roommate in the next room about cards from my old deck that I used when "I used to be fun and wanted to play". AITA for stopping playing? I still support him in most other aspects of the game other than actually playing, but he thinks it's not good enough. I've enjoyed the balance we've had the past 2 weeks with us talking about all things Magic just with him not asking me to play. Am I overreacting about a card game?	1642895126.0	safl38	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safl38/aita_for_asking_for_a_break_from_my_bfs_favorite/	AITA for asking for a break from my bf's favorite card game?
5hi3vl5o	I’m 20 years old, ostensibly-a-girl, and I live with my parents. I’ve used this beefy Mac desktop that I’ve been running Windows on, that we’ve been updating occasionally to make it run well despite it’s age. For a while, my dad would occasionally use it when I was younger, around 13-14, so I didn’t have sole access to it, and my sister would use it a lot as well. However, as we got older, my sister moved out, and my dad got newer machines that he used for work. Everyone else in my family stopped using it entirely, until I was the only person left.  Despite this, my parents have always refused to let me keep it in my bedroom. This is so frustrating, and always has been, since I have to stop voice calls and pause everything I’m doing when I come home, because they either keep it in the living room, where the loud television is, or the kitchen, where my father often makes a lot of noise cooking.   It’s just kind of saddening. The region I live in is often grey and overcast, especially around the wintertime, and whenever my parents aren’t home (which is often due to work) I just usually work in this space that doesn’t belong to me and doesn’t feel comfortable to be in, which is sad, because I put a lot of work into decorating my room and making it feel mine— so it’s extra disappointing that I’m forced to spend most of my time outside of it.  Their reasoning for me not having it in my room are that I won’t get enough sunlight (mentioned above) in my room, and I don’t help out enough. It’s not like they just came up with them out of thin air, but it might help to see if I can get other’s input to see if there’s some kind of solution. There are other reasons they have, but I feel like I’m confident enough in my arguments to dispute them.  I have a lot of, uh, issues, so it’s been difficult for me to land a job (I do freelance art online), and I’m forgetful and I have low energy. Basically, I’m kind of lazy if you took a glance at me. I can’t deny I have this problem, and I haven’t graduated yet due to these issues. I personally think I would be able to function better if everything was centralized in my room— I’d make more of an effort to clean up the area if I knew I had to keep it clean for work purposes.   I really hope it’s not coming off entitled, I just don’t know how else to word this. I’m an adult. I’m not good at it, but I still am. My sense of independence and privacy feels minimized by the fact that I still have to use it like a “family computer”— it feels infantilizing.  Sorry if this seems too minor, it’s just something that’s been a point of contention between me and my parents for the longest time and it would help to see if other people think this is also a ridiculous decision on my parent’s part, or if it’s completely reasonable given my irresponsible behaviour. My friends agree that it’s ridiculous, but my parents think they’re all just yes-men, so a group of total strangers on Reddit might change their mind!

g906bqll	hi everyone. here's a little backstory: i have lived in the same apartment building since i was born. also my neighbors were always the same, last one moved in 12 years ago and since then nothing changed.  we have always been a very understanding and friendly neighbors to each other. there were parties in the building, no one complained. there were dogs and other animals, babies crying, yet nothing. it was in all a really friendly environment to live in.   i'm a dancer. i have trainings only two days a week because of covid, so i mostly practice at home, to prepare myself for the next training as i'm trying not to lose form until then. i always try to do it as quietly as possible. i only play the music on my headphones and i only practice at a time when i'm not disturbing house rules. the problem is that, while I'm dancing, I'm banging a little on the floor with my legs so it's still possible to hear a little noice that way.  i was practicing today when a neighbor(30something M) rang my doorbell. i did not break the rules and I practiced at a time when noise was allowed. he started yelling at my mom, threatening to call the police and saying that the noise is unbearable. my mom calmly reminded him of his parties that he hosted often until recently and how we never complained, but said that we will try to keep the noice down even though we weren't loud in her opinion. she later said to me that it's okay if i need to practice at home, but i need to keep it quiet because she doesn't want the police on her back, and she knows the man is an asshole. my dad, however, asked me stop practicing at home at all until he talks with the neighbor eye to eye about this and calms him down. now, their convo is not likely to happen soon, i could be waiting a month or even more, and i have a very important competition on friday.  this particular neighbor is an asshole and honestly, he is ready to call the police for every little thing. i don't want to impose inconveniences on my parents or worse, legal problems on myself, but if i don't exercise at home i will lose my form, and I will not be able to participate in competitions that are very important to me. two times a week of training is not enough for keeping up the good shape and prepare for this type of competitions.  wibta if i continue practicing, which i really need to do?	1642895469.0	safpca	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safpca/wibta_if_i_continued_practicing/	WIBTA if I continued practicing?
7lf9cf84	Mom (59F) and I (22F) got a new puppy recently and seeing him grow has been so much fun but we’ve been clashing on how to train him.   Today Ma put out a carpet to our balcony that the puppy *loves* and keeps scratching at so she took it as an opportunity to train him to “leave it.” We’ve been trying to figure out the best method to get his attention away from the object he is fixed on so I joined in.   For context, my mom has the habit of repeating the command she is using several times in one go and I’ve told her that the dog trainers I’ve seen enforce saying the command only once, accompanied by a hand signal, and keeping that hand signal til the dog follows your command. She hasn’t listened to me with this and I can see that it hinders her communication with the puppy. That said, I’ve noticed he doesn’t register what she’s saying most of the time too.   Ofc training is a process that takes time but today she did the same thing with “leave it,” the dog wasn’t listening, and I went to get the treat she put on the ground to see if he could register what we were getting at. My mom got mad and told me not to interrupt her when she is the one communicating with him, which I understand. But I got frustrated and left to my room, which for me felt like a gesture to give her space to be with the dog, and me space since I was getting angry myself.   This all said, she got mad that I left and said it was immature of me to leave the training session just because I was frustrated. I felt like it was a proper way to manage the emotion considering the situation.   So, AITA for leaving her to train the dog on her own? Ik this is small but I’m trying to understand if it is actually immature of me to have left when I got frustrated, it felt better than staying there while my anger got more intense.	1642895007.0	safjnn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safjnn/aita_for_leaving_the_situation_when_i_got/	AITA for leaving the situation when I got frustrated
ave48rhq	So this has been a huge discussion involving the entire family for over two years. My SIL has a young child (4F) that is *very obviously* developmentally delayed. She is still in diapers, unable to speak or recognize speech, has missed developmental milestones, does not smile/make eye contact etc. She basically can walk, and that's it.   Apparently, 2 years ago, my SIL's pediatrician told her that the child NEEDS to be screened for autism/developmental disorders (which I agree with, as a person with autism). But, instead, she completely ignores the issue. She says that she's afraid of what they'll tell her is wrong. She won't take her to the doctor, despite everyone in the family pleading with her. Anytime my MIL brings it up, SIL shuts down and won't answer texts for a week at a time, or gets angry. My fiancee (SIL's sister) brought it up, and was ignored. Everyone in the family has brought it up multiple times. We don't know what else to do to protect this kid. It's horrifying.   It's clear that SIL loved her daughter. I wouldn't ever doubt that. But she's in complete denial and we all have no idea how else to wake her up to the reality. I don't want this child to end up in the system, because I know it would probably be just as bad or worse. Maybe MIL would file for custody, but I'm not sure. I feel like it'd be a big AH move for me to get this kid potentially taken from her mother, when I'm not even blood related to them. Maybe it's not my place or the best move. I'm talking with SIL and she agrees that this is neglect.

6l9wfg0x	repost bc i made a mistake in my last post, sorry if you’re seeing this twice  Im black and 17F and i work at a preschool/daycare.  My kids that i teach are 0-5yrs old. I usually have my natural hair out, but recently ive been wearing knotless braids, soft locs, or any kind of extension hair. My babies love playing with my hair. Whether is my real hair or my braids. It usually helps me with my job as well. for example if im changing diapers and the baby is crying over getting changed, i show them my hair and they start playing and giggling. I find it adorable. My hair is always pulled back though.  Recently i got extensions called soft locs. They go down to my lower back. When i came into work my babies were all like “your hair grew! Your hair is at your booty! Let me play with it” and they were all flabbergasted at how long my hair was until i told them its fake hair, they were disappointed but still wanted to play with it.   My boss took me out of the classroom and took me somewhere else to talk. She said that my hair is distracting and i need to get rid of it. I explained that i can’t do it immediately, and i asked her how it was distracting. she said “You had pink braids before and the kids always wanted to play with it, and now  you have long locs and the kids want to play with it. You need to have hair that isn’t dramatic” I told her that the kids only play with my hair when its appropriate. Never during snacktime or nap time. They play with it mostly during carpet time. i also said that her calling my hair dramatic was rude.   She got mad at me and told me to leave and forget about it. I asked the other bosses if my hair was distracting and they both said no and that they love seeing the kids play with it. I feel like im TA because i didn’t understand my other boss’s POV.	1642896252.0	safzf6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/safzf6/aita_for_having_long_extensions_and_telling_my/	AITA for having long extensions and telling my boss she said something rude?
4uzmbl1q	I had a small party (it was me, my bf, my parents and my bf mom and bf grandma) to celebrate my birthday yesterday. shortly after we finished the cake my boyfriends mom suddenly got up because she wanted to take a walk outside ("just down the street") - my bf and his grandma followed her. it's quite cold outside so me and my parents had absolutely no intention to tag along. also we were happy to chat a little because we don't see each other often (same applies for bf family). btw my birthday party is the only time of the year where my family meets his family.   I'm super mad that my boyfriend didn't stop his side of the family to leave for around an hour of "walking down the street". they clearly went to the shopping center, which is 5min away from where we live. (I know this because they bought something in one of the stores - he told me himself). He doesn't understand what the problem is ... I shouldn't pressure people to stay/do what I want ...

l9q9e	So we moved in November to a new place, and we left our old car parked at the old place to store it until we had time and energy to sell it.  Today my(35 f) husband(42 m), swung by our old place to clean out the old car. He gets there and immediately tells me "They towed it". I freaked out because I don't know when the apartment complex would have towed it, it could have been November which would mean we'd owe months of towing and storage fees. I'm losing my mind, calling everybody but nobody towed it. So my husband tells me it must have been stolen. So I file a police report..  My husband gets home and informs me he didn't really look for the car, He actually just drove into the apartment complex and never even got out of the car to look to see if maybe it was parked in the corner or something (I told him exactly where I parked it in November when we left but my husband doesn't really listen). I'm literally shocked because I have no idea how my husband could have put me through that, left me wrangling with towing companies and calling the police to deal with a police report (the last time I had to file a police report it was when I was being stalked so not a great memory to trigger) WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN REALLY CHECK. Sure enough the cars there, not stolen. I lost it, screamed at him about how inconsiderate and selfish that was of him to put me through that and he had a bunch of excuses about how tired he is, how overwhelmed he is and how hungry he was etc. He hasn't apologized. In fact he somehow found a way to make himself seem like the victim in this situation telling me that he's mentally checked out because he's just so overwhelmed with everything in life right now (rebuilding our savings account from a recent move to try and get enough money for a down payment to purchase a house... That's what's making him so overwhelmed) meanwhile I literally had to take anxiety meds because I was shaking/disassociating from the amount of stress I felt having to go through this process over a car that wasn't even missing. I've asked him for space and I'm not talking to him, he's making me feel really bad about that. Also making me feel bad because he believes this shouldn't even have been his responsibility, he sees his job in life as literally just to work and be the primary breadwinner. I'm supposed to be the one who does every other errand.   TL;DR husband let me think our car was stolen because he didn't properly look. He's now trying to make me feel bad for him because of how overwhelmed he is, and making excuses for why he didn't check. This whole situation stressed me out and I'm a mess, and he doesn't care, no apology or comfort. I screamed at him and am currently icing him out. Am I overreacting, am I the asshole?	1642896538.0	sag2zj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sag2zj/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_husband_for_making_me/	AITA for being mad at my husband for making me think my car was towed / stolen
agwbgmt2	I (29f) moved into my first rental about 5 months ago . I live alone in a duplex . My neighbours across the street have about ten people living in their massive house and also run a security business from that house which means 5-10 vans come to and from the house every day . I work from home and there constant parties at that house, people block my driveway park so I can’t get in my parking spot and i never complain I am just one person and I know my house was empty a long time before I moved in so I figured it was habit .    Since the day I moved in the every Sunday I got out to take my rubbish to the bins (bin day is Monday morning ) and my bins are stacked to the brim so I have to push trash down to get my rubbish in or once or twice save boxes I was gonna recycle for the next week because they’ve filled mine . How do I know it’s them ? Because I’ve seen it once , because if they have a party the next day my bin is filled with meat and paper plates and because people have told me .   I told my dad this morning how it upsets me because red bin isn’t for meat, food of any type and you can get fined for putting food in the wrong bin and they have thrown their bbq waste in my red bin and also filled in so I couldn’t get my trash in . Im also vegan so the smell makes me sick and it feels disrespectful it’s only me they do it to .   I have anxiety to the stage im on meds and in therapy so my dad has offered to have a word to them which I’ve now accepted but im worried I’ll be labelled an asshole for not letting them use my bins and honestly im a little worried they’ll escalate as I’ve heard they are an aggressive bunch .

4kvmtpv8	I have two very close friends, Jenny and Gracie, that are getting married this fall and both of them have asked me to be in their wedding party. Gracie has asked me to be her Maid of Honor and to say I was thrilled would be an understatement. Two weeks ago Gracie, myself, and the three other bridesmaids all got tested and then booked a small group to do some bridesmaid dress shopping. I have quite a few tattoos including a full sleeve, and understood that being MOH I would likely be in a lot of photos and moments in the wedding video. I approached Gracie and let her know that if she wanted me to get a long sleeve bridesmaid dress to cover my tattoos I would have no problem with it as her fiancés family is a bit more traditional. She laughed and told me that was ridiculous and that she would never insist I get a long sleeve dress to cover up, but appreciated me asking and reassuring her that I would if she asked.   Today, Jenny, her group of bridesmaids and I went and got fitted for dresses as well. After we all tried on a couple of sleeveless options, Jenny just was not loving some of them. I pulled her aside and told her the same thing, if she wanted me to cover up my tattoos or opt for a long sleeve dress to just say the word. A look of relief washed over her face and she thanked me. She didn’t want to feel like a bridezilla and tell me to cover up, and she had really liked one of the long sleeve options. I tried it on and she loved it, and she brought up the idea to her sister who also had a few visible tattoos. Her sister blew up and told her that she was being controlling and shouldn’t care about her tattoos. The other bridesmaids tried to calm her down and said they also also liked the long sleeve option after seeing me in it and decided to get it as well, so if she got it we would all match. Her sister flipped out and said she couldn’t have long sleeves cause she’ll be too warm, and I told her it was a late October wedding and it would likely be chilly out. I told her to grow up and it wasn’t even her wedding, it was Jenny’s, and she had already made a decision. Her sister said that if she had to wear long sleeves she would not be a bridesmaid, so Jenny had to choose. Jenny was clearly hurt and upset, but said that she would prefer the long sleeves and the other two girls agreed.   Before she left, her sister told me it was my fault because wasn’t an issue until I brought it up, and I should feel like shit for making Jenny choose. She also said I should have stepped down as a bridesmaid so that everyone else wouldn’t have to “cover up as well” to accommodate my poor choice of tattoo placement (despite her also having tattoos on her arms?). I feel bad and know it hurt Jenny to make that decision on what was supposed to be a happy day, but I also feel that I was just trying to be helpful in the situation and didn’t mean for it to escalate.

It happened again recently. She asked for an M&M flurry, and they brought her a vanilla ice cream cone. She said it was the wrong order and was immediately frustrated because they refused to believe her and said this is what she ordered, when it wasn’t. The guy was arguing intensely with her.

Now he is mad at me because I told him I had to decline going hiking but would meet up with them for dinner, he wants me to cancel and reschedule with my friend, but that defeats the purpose she wants her nails done to go out of town. So am I the ass because I won’t cancel the plans I made first. He told me so your friends nails are more important then my mom’s birthday.

im3sbgsf	I got my first dog before Christmas this year. He was NOT  a Christmas puppy, I paid for him with my own money after weeks of breed research and having always wanted a dog since I was a boy.  At the time, I lived with my dad (paying rent) and his 3 dogs, they're little yorkshire terriers, my dog was an Akita/Cane Corso cross.  When I asked my dad about getting Dozey (my dog) he said, exactly 'if it gets on with my three, it can stay.' And that was that. I went to get Dozey, brought him home and all was well.  Here's the problem, my dad also looks after 2 dogs for my sister's abusive ex (that's a whole other story) he doesn't get paid for this, and does it exclusively because he says he wants to. These two dogs are a pug/beagle cross, and a terrier (mutt, he's about the size of a small collie) the terrier's name is Winnie. Winnie has never been socialised. His owner believes that so long as he pays for food and vet bills, he's fulfilling the dog's needs. This created a problem because obviously Dozey is quite a bit bigger than Winnie. So when they met in my house at 7am after being dropped inside without a word from their owner (who knew we had a new dog and needed a careful meeting) Winnie immediately turned aggressive. For the next week my dad insisted that I keep Dozey shut away in my bedroom whenever Winnie was there (which is 4/5 days a week) except for walks. This continued for three weeks, being accompanied by my dad bringing Winnie for 5 minute walks with me and Dozey and this led to no improvement.   So I spoke to my mum, who is always a font of wisdom (I live with her now) and she saw the situation, tried introducing Winnie to Dozey with my help and after a couple days of trying told me very simply that the level of Winnie's aggression coupled with his owner and my dad's unwillingness to stop Winnie being at the house almost constantly meant I couldn't keep him. I agreed, and so I arranged to rehome him with a good friend and did.  It's important to note that in all this Dozey was never aggressive, he got on well with every dog except Winnie and even with Winnie he only tried to defend himself and never went for him. My dad has since been iffy with me and did directly say to me that I made a stupie decision and 'gave up on him' by rehoming him without getting my dad's advice. He started saying this to me the night Dozey was rehomed.   I think I made the right choice, my dad made it clear that if I kept Dozey he would be forced to live in one room for the majority of the time (7am till 8:30pm 4/5 days a week) except for walks, and I refused to abuse my dog like that. But I can't shake that if my dad is this strong felt about it, maybe I did make the wrong choice?	1642897036.0	sag984	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sag984/aita_for_rehoming_my_dog/	AITA for rehoming my dog?

Yesterday she found out I had tried cocaine at a party, right after our long distance began. A friend of mine told her.  The reason for me to hide it from her was to avoid the whole "don't do drugs" speech, and for her to get mad at me. When I told her this, she says she's more mad now, then she would have if I had told her.  She says the fact that I have hidden it from her breaks the whole foundation of our relationship, built on trust.

yctfg	Me: 50ish, my friend: 60ish. We became acquainted at work many years ago and still keep contact after we left.  She is a nice person to talk to and somewhat relatable and we hang out and do friends stuff like watching a moving, chatting on the phone, going to the movies, no big deal.  She has encountered some rough issues that appear to be what a young adult on their own would go through as I've been realizing for the last few years.   Furthermore, she has been in a difficult spot for some months  living with a roommate (not DV related, thank goodness) , but other stuff that should not have been on her radar,  she voluntarily left over an argument and is now homeless.   She told me yesterday that she filed an apartment application with a 10+ month waiting list. while she was completing it she put down the last address of where she lived  where she voluntarily left, and then added my phone number.   (Months prior, I offered her off the bat to stay for at least 2 weeks maximum at my apartment due to my lease, she refused).  She asked me if I could do her a favor by telling them that she lived with me for a duration if and when they call.  I  was shocked by her request and replied that she would have to go back to the apartment complex and submit a new application with the correct information, adding that I  1) allowed her to stay overnight and 2) I not charge her rent.  She did sound disappointed about it and I told her straight out the gate that the favors I do for friends must be based on 100% honesty.  She sent me a text early this morning stating that she vouched for me when I asked her to be a personal references for jobs.  I thanked her for doing that for me, adding that that was all based on facts for employment and I never asked her to lie for me. I reiterated her request and asked her if she values our friendship like I value my integrity, the responsibility is still on her.   I've had similar difficulties , but I was able to think outside the box and land on my feet without having to lie or manipulate others to get what I need.   In the text, I get the feeling that she's trying to guilt me into helping her.   I never had to lie for anyone in my whole life and I'm too old to start with the seemingly small things now.  That's how compromises start, things get bigger and bigger, more complicated and create more entanglement.   I love my integrity and good karma and want to keep it.	1642896437.0	sag1ra	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sag1ra/aita_for_not_helping_my_older_friend_get_an/	AITA for not helping my older friend get an apartment?
zpf7v	I wanted a quick drink and a chips and cheese so I went through the Taco Bell drive thru, thinking it would be a simple and easy trip. Upon entering the drive thru line, I found myself behind a car that seemed to be taking longer than usual to order, but who cares. I was jamming to some Led Zeppelin and not really paying attention. After a few minutes, the car moves forward and I order. After I complete my order, I pull up behind the original car mentioned. OKAY… now the story begins. I watch the driver in front of me pay with a $100 bill, along with some $1’s and some change. I begin to realize the situation: giant order. After several minutes of watching the driver and employee banter back and forth, I begin to get upset that this is taking so long. I (not thinking anyone can hear me) yell out “What the F**K!?” The driver in front of me hears me me and starts yelling out her window that I am an impatient asshole and needs to shut the f*ck up. I yell out my window that she should be more considerate and NOT order $100 worth of Taco Bell in a drive thru. After 15 minutes of waiting in line, she finally got her order and as she pulled away, continued to berate me. Her order: 4 twelve packs of tacos, 3 other bags of who knows what and 4 slushies.

ix67gzly	I, (24 F) and my boyfriend, (24 M) have been dating for 2 years and about 6 months ago he bought a ring. He told me about this as he doesn't feel like it should be a secret. We are both an old fashioned couple and we both agreed he should ask for my dad's blessing upon his proposal and eventual marriage. We have made our relationship work long distance (3 hours away) for 2 years. I have  accepted a position and will be moving closer to him within the next month. We came upon the agreement that I need the commitment of a ring before I pack up my life and stability to be closer to him. However, he hasn't proposed yet because, he hasn't asked for my dad's blessing. I have tried to get them to spend more time with each other so he feels more comfortable asking. However this is extremely difficult as my dad works 3 jobs, has 4 kids, a newborn grandson and also has proposed to his girlfriend. I've become rather frusterated because my boyfriend keeps procrastinating on asking for my father's blessing although the opportunity has been knocking for 6 months. I have explained my frustrations to my boyfriend more than once and all he can say to me is "it will happen, when it will happen, don't rush it." This conversation has angered me many times and it usually causes a fight. Am I the asshole for pressuring my boyfriend to ask my father?	1642898041.0	saglmb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saglmb/aita_for_pressuring_my_boyfriend_to_ask_for_my/	AITA for pressuring my boyfriend to ask for my father's blessing?
ix2asfxq	My roommate (22f) and her boyfriend (28m) recently moved into our small two bedroom apartment. The boyfriend was never supposed to move in, but he followed her after college and decided to move across the country with her when she came to live with me. He said it would be very temporary until he found another place to live. That was over six months ago. In November of 2021 I (19f) snapped. He didn’t help around the house, he did things that I repeatedly asked him not to do, and he wasn’t even actively apartment hunting. I pulled my roommate aside and told her that I was done, that the apartment was too small for 3 people and he wasn’t paying his full part. We came to an agreement that he had to be out by the start of the new year. This gave him two months to find a place to live - after the 6 months he already had been given. She told him the news and he became so childlike about the situation, saying that it was bullshit and storming out of the apartment. The weeks following he REFUSED to talk about the situation of him moving out. So, January 1st rolls around and he checked into a hotel because he had neglected to even look for a place to live. Now he complains about how he’s spending all his money on the hotel and can’t afford the down payment on a lease. I am personally really fed up with the whole situation and the tension it causes while he’s around. He makes me feel like I’m the villain, and my roommate is indifferent about it all, neither against me nor with me.   So, am I the asshole for making him move out and into a hotel after giving him months to figure something out?	1642898886.0	sagw44	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sagw44/aita_for_kicking_out_my_roommates_boyfriend/	AITA for kicking out my roommate’s boyfriend??
906i4vp9	I (f18) am in college. I live in a suite. Lately I’ve been having issues sleeping (I’ve tried all the solutions and nothing is helping) and I sleep on average three hours a night. Because of this, I try to sleep during the day if I can. I just lay in bed until I feel tired enough and drift off. My roommates know this and respect it by not throwing absolute rangers when I am sleeping (they never do anyway lol, but they’re conscious to make sure they’re not abnormally loud). This weekend one of my roommates has her boyfriend visiting. He’s never been nice to me or the other roommate so when he visits me and the other roommates try to stay out of his way and just do our own thing until he leaves. Last night I slept 4 hours, but around 6pm tonight I started to drift off. I heard the boyfriend ask my roommate where I am, and after checking my location she said I was home and then explained how I was probably asleep or trying to. About thirty seconds later, he comes pounding on my door. Right after, very loud music starts playing. I opened the door and asked him to stop. He explained that he wanted to listen to music and I asked if he could do it in the living room and maybe turn it down. He kept saying no, saying it was my roommates room too and as her guest he can do whatever. I finally stormed out to my boyfriend’s dorm, who also knows I can’t sleep and he gave me his bed to sleep while he does some homework but then my roommate texted saying I made her boyfriend feel unwelcome and now I’m so upset I can’t sleep.

7v11qwzv	My mom (35F) and I (17TransM) have never gotten along, especially because I've always disagreed with her choice of men. Every guy she's dated has hurt her kids in some way. I got a job last year and ever since then she's been pushy and borrowing money from me every chance she gets. I asked if I can move out over the summer a few nights ago and she called me irresponsible along with some other names I'd rather not say. One of her main points was that she isn't her sister, my aunt, who let my cousin (17F) move out this month. I'm financially independent to the point of buying my own food and she still refuses to let me leave. I called her a horrible mother compared to my aunt and she called me even more names.

it7cefmo	I (25 F) have been with my (now) husband (28 M) since I was 19. I come from a very strict and abusive household and moved out to go to college as soon as I was able. My step-father (36 M), called lee for this story, has had a weird obsession with me my entire life. Inspecting my underwear for appropriateness, calling me a whore and the r word “as a joke”, etc. My mom, (43 F), Nancy, was abused herself and just turned a blind eye. My bio-dad (46 m) Paul was a raging addict and narcassist (actually diagnosed). Anyway, none of them have ever wanted to be a part of our relationship. They even at one point stated rumors that he abused me so they could say “I wasn’t any better than them after all”. Fast forward to us getting engaged, I never get any offer of help from them just remarks on how I’m not doing things right.  I have diagnosed anxiety, depression, and PTSD from this dynamic, and begin hating the one day that had been something I wanted everyone to get along for so I tell everyone I would not have my bio or step-dad there because they are very ugly. My mom then tells me she won’t attend anymore and will also withhold my nephew (she has custody because my sister is a DA) from attending too. With this in mind I tell my spouse “let’s just get married at my college graduation party. My mindset is this is an important day (just as important as a wedding) so why not celebrate both. I invited everyone that we would have to the wedding four months in advance and periodically remind them. Fast forward to the day and my mom (who was invited and was supposed to bring nephew) says nephew has a stomach bug and leaves after she gets her Facebook photos. I get married with 20 people there (we invited 300) and everyone is ok except my mom who says “I set her up” and she wanted to walk me down the isle and make my bouquet. I reminded her of all of the reminders and accommodations I made for her and she started crying and saying that she knows she is a horrible mother and stops texting me. Fast forward to dinner with my tia (her sil) and we find out she went to party and my nephew wasn’t even sick. We find this out after my mom cried to my husband about wanting things to be better and then being upset when he didn’t tell her about the wedding saying he also set her up.I have since cut her off completely as this is the last straw and I want this dealt with before we have kids in the picture (I had already done the same for bio/step-dads) but my grandparents (their parents) are all saying I am too harsh Thor cutting them off altogether.

141w9y	I have a friend that I've known for more than 30 years, although I haven't seen her much in person during most of that time. She's somewhat flaky, and has had a rough life, although a lot of it has been through her own decisions. In the last couple of years she's ended up jobless, homeless and living in her older car with her dog. There's a lot more to why she's homeless, but it's irrelevant to this. She got back in online school and is living off of student loans. Last summer, with my husband's encouragement, I invited her to come and stay in our spare room for a year while she finishes school. She's several states away. I told her she would just have to get any extras she wanted, but wouldn't need to chip in on bills or food. The big problem was getting down here with her old car. She immediately started talking about growing pot in our garden to make extra cash, I told her that she couldn't do that, and that pot is illegal here, so she couldn't have it at our house. That, and not letting her dog harass our elderly cats, were the only things I asked. She decided to stay where she was, for the time being. She was planning to use part of her next student loan check to get a weekly rate room to stay in. Instead, she put a downpayment on an SUV at a sketchy car lot. She then drove here with no warning on Thanksgiving, not to move, but to visit for 4 days and to leave some of her belongings here for storage. While here she sat in her car for hours, smoking huge amounts of pot, so much so that even though she never smoked in the house, it reeked of pot for weeks after she left. She also wouldn't keep her dog under control, and said it was natural instinct for a dog to chase cats. My cats stayed in hiding for days. She didn't like any of the food we served, the room she was in or our internet speed, because it slowed her online gaming. She insisted on buying steaks to cook, even though I argued with her that she should save the money. She was insulting to me and my husband in a "just kidding" kind of way several times. It was a remarkably stressful few days. She got back to her camping area, and within a few weeks the SUV got repossessed, and the lady whose yard it was asked her to leave. So she was back in her old car, apparently couch surfing with people she knew. She hasn't mentioned coming back here until a couple of days ago when she asked if she should try to get back down here. I told her no. Now she's posting pictures of snow around her car on Facebook, and talking about how she's going to die from the cold. I feel terrible about her situation and I'm worried about her, but if her car actually manages to get this far, I know it's for long term, and she obviously isn't going to go along with the two things I asked of her to stay here, as well as being the most stressful guest I've ever had.

8wrrmv2v	I [21F] was friends with this girl [21F] for 8 years. We both met by being locker buddies in middle school and she befriended me, resulting in us being super duper close friends. Within the past 2 years, she has stopped talking to me for what I believed were “petty” reasons. She once stopped talking to me because I started talking to her cousin and hanging out with her a lot, while still maintaining our friendship. Sometimes all three of us would hangout together, or we would hangout without one of us being there. Then she was like “Oh yeah she’s super toxic, I don’t wanna be friends if you’re friends with her.” Yes, she was toxic (which I found out later on), but then she came back and apologized a few weeks later. Fast forward to 7-8 months later, she stopped talking to me AGAIN because I wanted to party every weekend. I was a sophomore in college, so yeah partied every weekend? I had the friends and free time to do so, and she would be there with us partying sometimes. 6 months later, she runs back and apologizes. We were good for another year and a half, after her saying the “I love you, I couldn’t imagine life without you…” BS. We go to a club during Halloweekend and both meet a pair of best guy friends. One guy liked her, and one liked me. They had a thing for about a week, and she realized she didn’t want to date the guy anymore. Meanwhile, I’m still talking to the guy who I met in the club. She got mad at me because we ran into her ex-guy at the gas station, and his friend (my guy from the club) told him that he could come to the bar with the two of us. Which he did, and then he told me when my best friend and him went on dates, she would talk shit about me. She texted me later that night and asked why I was in that town, and I mean NAGGED the hell out of me about it. I told her the situation, and that I heard she was talking shit. She denied that and said, “Why would you trust a guy you’ve barely known over your best friend of 8 years???” Ok well, he also told me information I never told either of those guys, only info that only she knew, so, yeah I’m going to believe that. After hearing what happened and stalking my located, she then blocked me on everything. Should I apologize, or was she in the wrong? I’ve been blocked for 3 months now.	1642901641.0	saht1n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saht1n/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_exbest_friend/	AITA for not apologizing to my ex-best friend?
2zgsqxtk	Over the summer me and my partner bought a house. The house had a security system installed but we had no interest in paying for/renewing that system. Our house is in a suburb, and we have generally been loving it. Recently, security has become a topic of conversation.  One of the things I have been somewhat insistent on is "no smart devices like Alexa". This is because I really don't like constant surveillance things, I don't like things constantly connecting to WiFi and creating a potential security vulnerability. We do have a few things - an old Roomba, a plug that my partner got as a Christmas present that they put lights on. They also got an Alexa for themselves in their room - a present from our realtor. I wasn't happy about that but I more or less just accepted it as long as it's not in my room.  So yeah I've bent on this a bunch. But the one I felt strongest about is Ring. Ring hacks have made the news a few times, and I feel make the house less safe by putting our business on the internet. I also really don't like the idea of the footage from Ring being handed over to the police. We're both politically very left and agree on this point - neither of us like this. We hadn't gotten one or made plans to get one.  My opinions on this come a lot from my dad who is an IT guy. He is very strongly anti-smart home stuff, because he's spent 30-some years seeing how companies are lazy and digital hacking happens all the time. Counter-intuitively, he's not the kind of person who cares about physical locks. The house my parents raised me in is never locked at all, and wasn't when I was growing up. We never had any issues.   My partner has said that maybe I don't see the urgency for security because I grew up like that. And perhaps they're right about that? We do have physical locks and do use them. But we aren't always there. On days where we both work there's about 6 hours where the house sits with just our pets inside (1 dog, 2 cats).   Recently my partner got a smoke detector to replace one of ours, and it came with smart capabilities. But apparently this detector only works with Ring. So of course, the discussion came back up about installing a Ring on our front door. I am of course opposed.  They see it differently. They feel they would be more secure, and they point out that we get a lot of packages and this might deter package theft. We've never had a package stolen, but obviously there are always stories of that.   Am I being a stubborn jerk here? I figured I might reach out here because perhaps I'm too biased towards my dad's viewpoint.   (Also for reference, they are aware that I'm posting this here, we're both kind of curious as to what the response will be)	1642900412.0	saheqb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saheqb/aita_for_not_wanting_a_security_cam/	AITA for not wanting a security cam?

Emily was put on academic probation, and I moved to a new room (my new roommate could not care less, and is clean, so it’s a win). Over Christmas break, I came out to my brother and SIL (supportive!) and cut contact with Emily. My brother and SIL agreed to do the same. She yelled at me, but I was too done with her to care, and besides a few stares, she hasn’t said a word.  I’ve learned a lot about myself in these past few months. I found out that the friends I’ve had for a few months already are more supportive than she was. Eva and I even told them about our relationship, and they were actually happy, which surprised me (I’m not sure why). Honestly, I feel like I stepped out of a fog. I didn’t know I could be happy, or feel okay. I didn’t realize how much it hurt to try and live my life to not get preached at.  Thank you to all the people who left sweet words and sent messages. I probably would have just let everything go back to normal otherwise, and nobody wants that!	1642901569.0	sahs5l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahs5l/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_friend_who_flushed/	UPDATE: AITA for yelling at my friend who flushed my anxiety medication
2p03dkqz	First of all, I apologize if I commit some grammar errors, English isn't my first language. Me (Female, 20 years old) and my Brother (14 years old) are very close, we like to play some videogames and that stuff. One day, My mom told us to go buy some things, when we went to the store, my brother reached out to take what my mom asked us to bring, and I saw that he was using my underwear. We were outside, I didn't tell him anything until we arrived to our house and I told him that I saw he was using my underwear, he panicked and told me I was crazy, but no, I know what my clothes look like and this make me feel sick. I left our room and I told my mom what I saw and she talked to my brother, But he got mad, he yelled at my mom that I was crazy. But then he started crying and I didn't listen anymore until he came out of my mom's room and she was crying. He told her he has bisexual, and he didn't know why he did that, but he liked it. I was angry, that's not an excuse, I thought, I ran to him and told him that if he had any clothes of mine to return them, and that he was gross for using my clothes. He screamed at me and told me that he hated me, we don't talk like we used to and I feel bad... Guys, I'm the asshole for telling my brother he is gross for using my clothes?	1642901571.0	sahs6m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sahs6m/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_is_gross_for_using/	AITA for telling my brother he is gross for using my clothes?
2nu7z480	So my(23) Significant Other(25) of nearly 2 years is pissed at me because I said I'm having to back out of trip plans we were still making together.  (We hadn't purchased anything yet).  I had to cancel as I just got my first job out of school a few months ago, and now my boss is leaving the company in 2 weeks~ saddling me with a huge project to do by myself (as opposed to the two person team) until we can backfill her role.    Given that I'm fresh to this job I love, I don't think it's a good idea for me to take time off when we are short staffed, as it will look bad AND holding the fort down will give me leverage to move up.  More importantly though, I think it will look really bad to try to leave a ship completely unmanned, and possibly get me fired.   My S/O feels I'm "deciding to hurt [them]".   I feel I would understand their position if I cancelled to travel with someone else or do something else, but I'm disappointed too.  I understand it's important to keep my word, and I always make my best effort.  I just feel life can get in the way and we need to understand that.     Personally I am hurt because I feel under pressure to make the decision that can hurt me just to please them.

9ny5lz5j	My husband and I bought a new leather sectional couch a couple of years ago. It was our first "nice" couch, and while it wasn't insanely expensive, it was certainly a big purchase for us and something I hoped to get several years of usage from.  A couple of months ago we adopted a kitten. We love him. He's gregarious, playful, and very sweet. Except, he's also a wild little guy who loves to jump all over the furniture. He treats the couch like a jungle gym, which has resulted in several (10+) scratches. Many of the scratches are quite large, and while my husband says they aren't that bad, they are very noticeable to me. For that reason, I currently have four blankets draped over and tucked around the couch to protect it as well as possible. When we have guests over, I take the blankets off, and my husband will move them sometimes when he uses the couch. But otherwise, I insist on keeping it covered.  My husband hates this. He thinks it's pointless to have the couch at all if we cannot see it and "enjoy" it. I feel like we won't be able to enjoy the couch if the cat scratches it to oblivion. My hope is that the cat will chill out in the next year or two, and the blankets won't be as necessary, but I want to keep it covered in the meantime. My husband and I have embarrassingly gotten into a somewhat serious argument over this, where we both raised our voices and were pretty peeved.

i81k92bs	This is going to sound stupid but I'm hoping showing her this will get her off my back. (either by proving she is right or proving she is wrong)  I occasionally experience sleep paralysis. I am aware that I don't get it as bad as others, but it can still put me all out of sorts. My friend has never believed me about it because apparently her Dad suffers from sleep paralysis and he describes it differently, therefore I must be lying.   She is also obsessed with Among Us, which is another source of conflict. You see, she likes it when I join her group for her Sunday games. She has 5 others who are part of their permanent 'core' group, with about a dozen others who rotate in and out, including me. I don't play often because I don't like her main group and I only play when no one else wants to.  Today is the usual day they have their games. I had a sleep paralysis episode this morning and made sure I let them know I was unavailable. It was pretty bad compared to other times and honestly all I wanted to do was hide under my blankets and cry once it was over.  At about 10am I got a message that said they were one short. I pointed out I had already posted saying I was unavailable due to my episode, but she told me to suck it up because everyone else had 'real' reasons. (sleeping in was one of the reasons)  One of the casual players, a guy my friend has a crush on, pointed out that they could play with 9 people, but she told everyone that I was lying to get out of playing. She hopped onto a voice channel and start berating me about how selfish I was and how I was lying, but I just closed the tab.  Fast forward a few hours and I get a voice message berating me for ruining her day because no one wanted to play with her after I left. She also accused me of turning her crush against her and that he had said he wouldn't play with her until she apologized. She is also spamming me with messages because I am ignoring her.  He messaged me to apologize even though he did nothing wrong. Three of the core members also messaged to apologize with one telling me that my friend had been banned from future games, along with two of the other core members because the other casual players who had been present weren't going to play with them anymore if something didn't change. (apparently I was not the only person who had issues with the core group)   TL:DR: I got my friend banned from her Among Us group because she lost it after I refused to play due to Sleep Paralysis.	1642904139.0	saimh3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saimh3/aita_for_refusing_to_hang_out_with_my_friend/	AITA for refusing to hang out with my friend
69s6oryh	A little context, two years ago I have managed with the help of my family to build my own home in an area near a green field and a river which I love, and by the vegetation that surrounds the place could easily be a good tourist destination for any lover of tranquility, the thing is that my sister decided to spend her vacation in my home which I gladly accepted, she is 17 years old and is a pretty studious girl, but has never been the cleanest person, among the things she did during the time she stayed for free in my house are: Leaving dirty dishes on the table and since I work almost all afternoon these stay there attracting flies, leaving snack packs and crumbs all over the house along with her things thrown away, i dirty clothes that piled up in a corner of the living room; not to mention what she did to the room I gave her that went from snacks all over the place along with unwashed cups that she didn't even have the decency to carry, etc. But, the straw that broke the camel's back was when I went into the bathroom of his room and holy cow... The place gave off one of the most putrid smells my poor nose could endure, there was everything from toilet paper piled up in the toilet bowl to hair from the shower, etc. I automatically went down to her and told her that her bathroom was a mess and that it smelled terrible, she only replied: "It's a bathroom, what did you expect it to smell like flowers and sweets? I told her that I was not willing to continue putting up with her turning my house into a pigsty and that it is better for her to leave, she told me to try to understand her because she has spent the whole year studying to be able to graduate and continue at the University, that is why what she wants is to have some time to forget about all responsibility, that first is true, I have always been aware that she has been very applied in her studies and she works too hard, I told her that I would think things over and I left the room.	1642904514.0	saiqr5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saiqr5/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_my_sister_out_of_my/	AITA for wanting to kick my sister out of my house during her vacation?
dqeyrttv	So my friend, let’s call her B has always been kind of toxic in my opinion. She gets really frustrated when people don’t want to do things her way. I’ve wanted to cut her off for a while but can’t find a way to do it because we have so many classes together and our family’s are friends. We were playing video games earlier and she asked if I wanted to do some homework with her. I said, “Yeah maybe later” (I procrastinate a lot and have a hard time focusing). B then went on a rant about how I never do work and she doesn’t get why I “don’t just do it.” I got kind of annoyed and tried to explain to her how I have a really hard time focusing and it’s very difficult to stay on task or even start the work for that matter. She then said, “It’s not that hard, you just open up your laptop and do it. You don’t even try.” I got really hurt by this because I’ve been struggling with this issue for a while. I quickly said I was going to go and then hung up, and haven’t talked to her since. Am I overreacting?  TLDR:  I procrastinate a lot and struggle with it.

7d3feyqh	This is my first post here I hope I can do a good job. Ok so Quick introduction, I'm a college student (18 yo, M) who recently finished a semester of my second year In 2021, well so today my Dad called as he usually does and he mentioned that I didn't share him my grades at the moment, which is true, but I honestly don't feel good when I share them with my parents since I don't consider that my grades are spectacular, they don't like to see low grades and is understandable, but the problem is how they react when they see my grades. Both my parents are really different, while my dad trys to take it in a constructive way, his negative reactions are impossible to ignore, he also told my brother about my grades the last time which I didn't appreciate at all, in the other hand my mom is just a case that worries me, she gets really mad and complains a lot, her reaction is just repellent but is not I can walk away while she rage at me.  But what happened this time? Well while I was in the phone I told my dad "I don't share my grades" and he went mad and saying that he got offended, I obviously felt bad and I guess it was because he understood that I don't trust him or something, he said something about that he doesn't know who is putting those ideas in my head, well nobody I don't have any close friend at all so is not like close people put that idea in me, is just a decision I took for my privacy and put some barriers.   I honestly didn't do as good as I wanted specially because I entered college during Covid and almost all my classes where online until this new semester I'm starting well now I only have two online Classes. I'm kinda upset of seeing my parents saying that my grades could be better when I literally get Only As and Bs during Highschool and that didn't change when I did my first semester of College, now imagine with lower grades.  In few words, I don't really want to share my grades with my parents because I don't trust them in having a good or constructive reaction about my grades, I had this little meditation and I just thought about it and I said "is there any good consequence for sharing my grades?" My parents don't get mi gifts and I don't feel way more appreciated when I get good grades, so why should If I do it? I'm I going to let them shout me in a discussion that they will start?   I don't really know if I did wrong at telling that to my dad, I would have like to explain myself better to him but fue to his reaction I just told him that we should talk later peacefully.

76s5jcc5	 Really need your help here Reddit because this situation has me feeling like such an AH. 3 months ago My fiance and I bought a house together. We feel really settled in our town and felt like it was the right time. I'm also in the VERY fortunate position to have had relatives who earned a lot of money and a dad who also did so college was paid for and I have more than enough for a house downpayment and to put away for future kids and retirement. I've always felt self-conscious about coming from wealth because my mother always accused us of being spoiled which has made me really try to not take my money for granted or hold it over someone's head. On to the issue at hand.  Our house is great but there were some cosmetic issues that we were wanting to amend and a fence that just needed filling in a small bit on two sides. I was looking around for a contractor and my realtor suggested a few but said we should go with one as he would probably get back the quickest. Well, another guy we'll call Dave popped up and the one our realtor suggested ended up not doing anything we wanted to be done so we went with Dave. Dave seemed very confident and he gave low quotes and just for labor so he seemed like a good choice. (If you're cringing or confused here just know I had no idea the hell that contractors can be.)  I'll skip over too many details but he got the fence "done." Should have fired him right here but I try to see the best in people and I didn't see all the problems. He set up a wooden section to cover the first section and built a "gate" which was shit and didn't open, he said he wasn't happy and that he would fix it. He also seemed to complete the chainlink section though he secured a small gap with an extra plank of wood. Whatever he was accessible and promised to fix everything. Plus it seemed secure for our dog so it was fine.  Then we feel secure. He seems trustworthy, we continue. He gives a quote for our bathroom and kitchen counter, does the bathroom floor. Another red flag he doesn't level it like he said he would. Says it just can't be level, we don't know any better, okay whatever. Where it gets sticky is when we ask if he has any painters he knows. Says he does. They quote us for painting a bunch of rooms. The catch, is they want upfront pay. I'm nervous, don't want to give it. But I trust him, we've talked, it seems okay and he reassures me that they won't skip out (lol.) Long story short the paint job was half done and I end up a whole EXTRA $1000 out of pocket. He keeps reassuring that they will show up to finish only for nothing to happen. It seems like he's frustrated too so I think okay he got screwed too. He says he will finish it.  I start getting even more nervous as through it all he's asked for more and more money for supplies and I'm now out around $7000. He shows up once and gets halfway through one of the unfinished rooms and then he goes quiet. I ask if we can talk about the plan. The NEXT DAY he texts me that he's been in a car accident, sends a video of a sideways car which I don't know whether it's his or not. I tell him no worries that sucks take his time. Then... my dog busts through the flimsy wooden piece of fence and almost escapes. We inspect that part more thoroughly and find that it is completely unsecured and they had started and NEVER FINISHED that other part of the fence. I'm pissed now because we live on a busy street and she has no fear of cars. Luckily my fiance was with her and caught her just in time.  I text him that I need this fixed and I need details. I impress upon him that I need details because it's now been almost 3 months and nothing has happened (he says shipping delays but I don't really believe him on anything he says anymore.) Get me a new contract with the timeline, the plan, and any and ALL COSTS. He tells me his sister died and he's sorry about the miscommunication he will get that done. I feel terrible and try to be patient. Long story short again, he actually DOES finish the fence but now for an EXTRA $500 more. And he sends me the contract for just the FENCE which is a joke and doesn't include any timeline or plan. So finally we're here. The only grace I could muster was demanding only $4500 from him. I sent him a request for it despite him just pretending I hadn't already asked for a refund and giving all sorts of excuses about when he would get me the timeline after I pointed out his BS. I have now officially threatened legal action today and do intend to follow through.  I don't want to be a spoiled rich kid who doesn't have empathy for other people suffering. And if the stories he's told are true he's in a bad spot. But on the other hand, I didn't plan on just gifting a stranger that much money. And he has not come through on his promises. I wish things were different and tbh I do think I'm justified but I also come from a privileged place and maybe I should have given him more time.

ib8nk1oz	Me (f18) and my ex(ftm19) have known each other for five years, we dated for three of those. We broke up about a year and a half ago due to him cheating on me. Over the spam of the lockdown, my ex decided to contact me in hopes of rekindling some sort of friendship with me. I am not the type to hold grudges and I have done a lot of healing over the year we didn't speak and I was at the place where I could hold a civil conversation. Now, we are what you could call friends. I have set very strong boundaries and I don't let them falter. My ex comes from a very toxic household who don't accept him for being trans. I was recently given the opportunity to move out and I asked him if he would like to be roommates so he could leave the abusive household and do his own healing. No one deserves to suffer in a household like his. The conditions are he'd have to get a job to help with rent and I'd lend a hand with giving him rides since I'm the only one with a car. We are still so young and fresh out of high school, and he's talking about getting top surgery. Of course, I'm all for it, and I offered to help with aftercare while he is healing. Especially if we are going to be roommates. However, my ex is quite ambious, throwing names of top surgeons and talking about the move non-stop. Everything is still in the planning phase and nothing is concrete. All the surgeons he wants to go to are all seven+ hours away. I said I would drive him so that's on me. But he also expects me to pay for the trip in total. The gas, hotel rooms, food, all of it. I know I said I would help him, but where is the line between me helping him and him taking advantage of me? Not to mention again, we are still teenagers. I have to think about college, my job, and my own welfare. I also have a cat and hedgehog to think about, I can't leave them alone for an extended period of time, and getting a sitter isn't an option for me. He isn't actively looking for a job (like I had asked him to do if he is going to move in with me). I don't want to be a dick and tell him I won't help him, but I can only do so much with what I have available to me. Minimum wage can't cover half the stuff he wants from me. I can't take time off work to take a trip just to get his surgery. He keeps telling me "oh my insurance will cover it". It won't cover the costs of me taking him at all. He gets mad at me every time I ask him the details, how are you getting there, who's paying for it etc etc. He told me "I know I'm disposable to you" in reference to me telling him I have no problem dropping him if I think he's being toxic/manipulative again. I was a shitty person when we were dating and I think I'm trying to amend for what I did by sticking my neck out for him, but I also cant shake the feeling he's using me again. I want to believe the best, that he's a better person and I don't mind helping him get the surgeries but I feel like he's asking too much and not considering how I fit into the equation.	1642905505.0	saj24h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj24h/aita_for_refusing_my_ex_his_top_surgery/	AITA for refusing my ex his top surgery?
61abt7n	I'm in the process of becoming a correctional officer and also working doordash to pay rent while still living at home. She told me about 2 weeks ago she'd be flying down for her birthday to come see me and I told her multiple times to not get her hopes up in case I can't hang out because of how busy I am with the process (which I'm a month into and at the stage of signing everything, meeting everybody, getting processed) and also work. She was okay with this.  She flew down here anyway instead of just rescheduling to when I knew I'd be free and is now upset because I keep telling her I can't hang out as I'm way too busy. She went off on me and I laid down exactly how I felt and this is what I said   "Look, I'm sorry you think I keep blowing you off and "cancelling" even though I made it clear I couldn't make definitive plans with you this week. It's either I choose this job which gives me the step into a career in law enforcement, which is something I've wanted since a kid, or I choose you for the week and potentially lose all chances of getting this job until next year when I can reapply again. Stop making me look like a dickhead and being passive-aggressive. It's not fair of you to ask me to drop whatever I'm doing because you didn't listen to me when I said I couldn't hang out."  After this, she started leaving me on opened and eventually unadded me, ending 6 years of friendship because I "chose a stupid job over her"  Am I the asshole??	1642905424.0	saj1a4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj1a4/aita_friend_flew_down_for_her_birthday_from_north/	AITA Friend flew down for her birthday from North Dakota to come see me against me telling her I might not be able to hang out.
5zo40wr	So about 5 months ago my girlfriend and I started subletting a room in a house with one other person. Everything seemed great before we moved in, but the day we arrived she started laying down ground rules that were not previously established. The main thing that's causing issues is that she has "allergenic eczema" (not diagnosed, this is specifically what she told us it was), which means that she apparently cannot use detergent with any scent. Unfortunately, she is paranoid and has stated that we are only to use the detergent she specifically bought (tide free and gentle) because if we use any detergent that's scented the residue will stay in the washer and she'll get a rash. Coupled with our old washer, the detergent barely is even able to wash the smell of b.o. out of the clothes. At first it didn't seem like a big deal, but we noticed after a while that our clothes were progressively smelling worse and worse as the old detergent began to wear off. We're now at the point where we are considering going to a laundromat and paying to do our laundry simply so that we don't smell like crap when we go out with friends/ to work. At this point I have to either spend time and money at a laundromat, or tell her that we will no longer be adhering to the rules about our detergent usage. So I just wanna know, WIBTAH if I were to put my foot down and start using my detergent, considering I didn't know prior to moving in that it wasn't allowed?   And If anyone has a any knowledge as to whether detergent will remain in the wash or not, please let me know.	1642905603.0	saj38z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj38z/wibta_if_i_started_using_scented_detergent/	WIBTA If I started using scented detergent
2rd3oqsa	So, before I get called the Butthole, I’ll elaborate.   My mom was given a dvd of her old family movies. My sister tried using her PS4, but it doesn’t want to work. So, they asked me if I can use my laptop (that I use for work).   “No. The screen has a crack and I don’t want people using it”. I didn’t think I’d have to go further. “What’s the password”  You’re not using it.   Why?  Because I use that for work (I’m a behavioral technician/therapist. I visit clients and make daily reports on the computer. If they go in, they can view these reports, and well, that would be a potential HIPAA violation).   “We aren’t going to go snooping around, though. Come on.”  I. Said. No.   “You don’t need to be an asshole”   Well, now I gotta ask, AITA? I’m thinking I’m definitely not.	1642905750.0	saj4y4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj4y4/aita_because_i_wont_let_my_family_use_my_laptop/	AITA because I won’t let my family use my laptop to watch a DVD?
7vh3vnhz	My friend and I (both 18F) are super close and always keep each other up to date with who we're seeing. We also live together. She has had a crush on her coworker(31F) for about a year now. They became friends outside of work but honestly their relationship seemed pretty innocent so I didn't think too much of it.   A couple weeks ago, my friend tells me she's heading over to her coworkers house for "girls night." At this point I think its a little strange that an 18 year old is going over to 31 year old's house alone, but I didn't try to stop her. I told her to text me when she got there and that I would check in on her later that night. I suppose it was a little naïve to think nothing would happen.   The next morning my roommate comes home all excited. In a nutshell, she tells me her coworker had given her alcohol and edibles and that they had sex. I understand that at 18 you're old enough to give consent, but its hard to ignore the power dynamic. And providing someone so much younger than you with drugs and alcohol before you have sex with them is wrong. At the same time, I don't know really know how to address this. I said something along the lines of "Oh wow! That is exciting!" As my friend continues to tell me details about her night, I feel more and more freaked out.   She obviously notices I'm not super into what's being said, so she asks me what's wrong. I say "I know its not my place to tell you who to date, but honestly this situation makes me a little uneasy." She looks a little disappointed I'm not as excited about this as her, so she just says "ok" before walking out of the room.   Fast forward to tonight, my friend and the coworker have hung out a couple times. My friend keeps bringing up the new relationship and how she wants us all to hang out and be friends etc etc. Every time I tell her I'm not comfortable about hanging out with her.   Earlier today my friend and I are just relaxing when she shows me her phone. Its just text messages between her and the coworker. "So how should I respond?" She asks. I tell her I don't know and she rolls her eyes at me and says "Just help me text her back its not that hard." So I say, "I don't want to be a part of this."   About an hour ago she comes into my room and yells at me for "not being supportive of her new relationship." I tell her that I love her and that I'm just worried about her. She told me she thinks I'm being a bitch and overreacting about the age gap.   So am I being TA? Should I just hang out with her and her new partner?	1642905793.0	saj5fz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saj5fz/aita_for_not_supporting_my_friends_new/	AITA for not supporting my friends new relationship?

3uwou2v9	So back in the summer by cousin asked me to be part of her wedding party, and she was planning to get married in January/February in the DR. At the time, I thought covid was calming down and that travelling wouldn't be an issue. However, I'm a student. When I asked my school for accommodations, I was denied because a wedding isn't considered to be a reason for essential travel. So, I reached out to my professors and was informed by 3 of them that they would not accommodate tests, assignments or any other portion of my grade for going away, and this would apply to quarantine time if I got stuck in the DR and was unable to come back to Canada. For context, I've applied for grad schools and this is supposed to be my last term of my undergrad. Because of all this, I thought the risk of travelling, testing positive and getting stuck there was too much risk for me to take in terms of schooling (2-3 weeks gone=25% of my term overall, with tests and assignments due in that time period. When I raised these concerns with her, she told me I was being selfish and if I thought I couldn't go I shouldn't have agreed to be part of the wedding party in the first place. She also told me my profs have to accommodate me because I pay for school and thus they should do whatever I ask. She also said I shouldn't be brining any school work there because this is her day and me taking time away from activities would be spoiling her day. She discounted all of my concerns, so I told her its too much risk and I cant afford to mess up all my plans for a wedding. She freaked out and accused me of ruining her day and leaving it so last minute that she can't get another wedding party member to fill in.

9leefp7o	Let me give a back story, my roommates and I previously lived together 2 years ago. We went through a traumatizing experience with other roommates. During that time she bought a puppy and she believes in the pee pad system in the house. Because of how horrible our former roommates were at the end of that lease we move into a new apartment. She keeps the dog confined too her room, but when he’s out he pretty much Pees on everything. And I am constantly having to carpet clean (that I bought) and we recently just renewed our lease. So fast forwards I recently asked to hide something in her room away from my partner. Well when I walked in it was horrid. I cannot describe the smell/odor that came from this. I immediately got sick. She was gone for a week and I carpet cleaned her room because I noticed the pee all over her room. His  pee pad was completely soiled like beyond.  Her room isn’t messy but just extremely unsanitary. I paid for the deposit and she paid for the pet deposit. I’m with her for another year and I truly value our friendship. But every time she opens her door I get sick and have to leave the house or go to another room because it’s so terrible. So, AITAH if I confront her about the smell.	1642906658.0	sajf2q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajf2q/wibta_if_i_confronted_my_roomate_about_the_odor/	WIBTA If I confronted my roomate about the odor of her room
hx365a1	So my girlfriend(21F) and i(20M) have been dating for about a year and a half. Her dad(45M) definitely has a lot of control issues and anger issues. He divorced their mother recently and has been more toxic than usual, trying to get his kids to side with him on how shes just a generally terrible person over the past few months, with seemingly little regard for how its still their mother.  Anyway, we drink sometimes together so we went tonignt just to drink and hangout and have a good time. My girlfriends brother is 14 and was playing games with us while we were drinking. When her dad and I went out to have a cigarette he was telling me about some drama thats been going on with whether or not he should have to pay her phone bill, this led to him saying how she is really selfish.  Once we got back inside he told me how his other kid (18M) had said hes also selfish, which he then asked me if i think he is. I said everyone can be selfish at times. He wanted more specifics, and i told him i think yes he can be generally selfish without thinking about how what hes saying is going to affect people.  I told him then that i think he has some anger issues as well as control issues. He immediately took this as a personal attack and started asking for examples. On this last christmas he had at the top of his lungs screamed at her 14 yo brother for moving his chair that he was going to sit on, i used this as an example for both. He started saying how "its his chair" and how he doesnt care what we think if hes "being mean". I again said thats a testiment to how he has anger issues and hes just trying to deny everything.  After some back and forth and repeating of the same things he started yelling at me so i started yelling back, which after about 5 minutes of that my girlfriend started crying begging us to stop, i immediately stopped seeing that this was obviously affecting her terribly. Her dad just kept yelling and arguing and i took this as our cue to leave, took my keys and we both left.

erjm1uwn	I (17 M) am preparing for college. My family recently moved back to my home state in the middle of nowhere, 45-60 minutes from any big town, much less college. The states university system requires all lower class-men who do not live in commuter distance (30 min) to live in dorms on campus. As usual, animals are not allowed in dorms because of cleanliness and health issues. I have a chinchilla who mainly lives in my room that I’ve had for about a year. I love him dearly and he was a main reason I got help with my mental health when I was struggling a year ago. I feed him, clean his cage, buy all his supplies with my own money, and overall pay for everything for him with my own money. I even payed the adoption fee and payed for all of his supplies when I first got him. I asked awhile ago if my parents could watch my chinchilla while I stayed in the dorms for a year or so until I had saved the money for an apartment and/or found a job where I could easily pay rent when I get into college. My dad outright refused and my stepmom agreed. My dad had to care for him once already and does not like my chinchilla.  My stepmom thinks he should be my responsibility and if I cannot live with him I should sell him. I pointed out the fact that again it would only be for a year or two while I figured out a living situation and also, he was very dear for me and I love him. He was my main motivation to get help.  My parents think I’m trying to dump my responsibilities onto them so I suggested I would send money when they need for his supplies. This didn’t sway their opinion.

8lnnog9w	Some background: two kids, two cats, a a small dog in two bedroom house. I (35f) and my husband (36m) agree the house is too small. He lost his job two years ago and is going to school full time instead. It’s very tight on just my salary, but we have managed not to have to cut back too much on our lifestyle.  He wants a bigger dog, but we agreed to wait on a bigger house and a bigger yard.  A few months ago, he found a pit bull wandering the neighborhood. He of course wanted to keep it but I did not. Our neighbors ended up taking it in. Never saw it again until tonight.  My husband noticed an ambulance and animal control out in front of the neighbors house. He went over to find out what was going on. He came back and told me their two pit bulls got into a fight, a little girl got bit by one and the girls mother bit by the other. They both got taken to the hospital.   Animal control was there to take the dogs. Husband was upset because the dogs would be put down. So he volunteered to take one. I said no, we can’t afford or handle a high energy dog in a tiny house. And if we could, this dog just hurt it’s owners.   I have a young kid that does not respect boundaries and our tiny dog is very patient but has nipped him to establish her boundaries. No blood drawn, but he is never alone with her now.  He brought the dog over anyway. I told him to take it back, but he told me the animal control officer already left.  I told him I’d take the dog to the no kill shelter and he refused to let me near the dog.   Here is where I may be the asshole. I packed his suitcase and put it down in front of him and told him it was me or the dog. I’ve never felt so disrespected and I would not be living with this dog and neither would my kids. Then I walked away.   He came up and threw the suitcase on the floor, called me soul less and heartless because now the dog will die. How dare I make a threat about divorce over a dog and in front of the kids. Why would I even be with him if our marriage was worth less than a dog.  I told him it wasn’t the dog. It was him making someone else’s problem our problem, the dog just bit someone and now he brought it into our home with no vetting. It didn’t have to be this way if he had just listened when I told him I don’t want the dog when he first came back.   Now animal control has picked up the dog and we aren’t talking. He insists I’m in the wrong and I’m heartless for letting a dog die for making a mistake.  I feel terrible about the dogs being put down, but I’m not willing to gamble my kids with an unknown dog.  Am I the asshole for putting my foot down and threatening to leave him if he wanted the dog more?	1642907892.0	sajswg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajswg/aita_for_making_it_me_or_the_dog/	AITA for making it me or the dog?
bdkyghw0	So I(15f/nb) have been listening to my friend(16m) rant about his ex(15f) for a while now. For privacy reasons I'll refer to him as Chad, and his ex as Emily. Most of the time he rants he does it out of the blue, at random hours of the day. Chad and Emily broke up in September 2021 after dating for 2-3 months. They broke up due to Emily's mom being unsupportive of their relationship.   Emily got with Jason(15m) a couple of weeks after she broke up with Chad. Emily's mom was really supportive of Jason and Emily and around a similar time, me and my partner got together. Jason and Emily broke up 3ish weeks ago after, Jason had kissed Emily and then told her he liked her two friends. He has been ghosting Emily since the breakup and has been flipping her off and being kinda a mean person. Similar things had been happening while they were dating and he actually became distanced from her after she did something he asked for.   Well, Chad never really got over Emily. He has repeatedly told me he is over their breakup but still loves her a lot, though most nights he dms me at random hours ranting about something Emily did or smth Emily said about Jason. Emily is very much not over Jason. She makes remarks about things that remind her of him and how she could change and be nicer to him so he might stop ghosting her and they can get back together. This really pissed Chad off and last night he ranted about her and how she shouldn't change for someone who doesn't love her anymore and someone mean to her. He said sine worse as well. He complained about how it took Emily a couple of weeks to get with Jason and now she's taking a while to get over him. He also called her a bitch.  This really pissed off me and my friend so my friend told Emily and her mom found out so now Emily and Chad aren't talking due to her mom and probably her own decisions not to. I ended up lashing out at Chad after he shit talked my friend as well as play innocent and say he never meant any of what he said and that he never talks about Emily(80% of our dms is him talking about her). He says that it's out of love.   When I lashed out at him I called him obsessive and that he shouldn't place expectations on Emily in terms of how long it takes to get over Jason (He told me he wants Emily to be over Jason by February, and have her and him getting ready to date at the start of it) and that he is being toxic and shouldn't be trying to force his love onto her or that he shouldn't expect them to date after shes over Jason.   I called him toxic for more reasons besides what he said about Emily and what he said about my friend. He has shit talked my partner and other friends as well. He also has told me false information about my partner that has caused major fights. He has also tried manipulating me into doing things I'm not comfortable doing. Theres more but it's kinda bad   He got pissed at me and we fought a bit. He won't change his stance on anything.

ixavy7lv	I (37f) finally moved out of my future in-laws home after nearly FIVE years of waiting. My fiancé (30m) and I have been like entirely new people since getting out of his parents home. But, we’re having an issue with moving the remainder of our things.  His mother, let’s call her V, has this bad habit of giving away our things, or throwing out our things without asking. She will SWEAR that we said we didn’t want it, cry and apologize. It’s a very irritating cycle that I can’t wait to be entirely free of.  Last week we went to clear out our storage unit, and I was very sad to find that my armchair had molded. We cleared out everything else and we decided we would come back later to take the chair to the dump. Yesterday, V contacts me via text saying she wants to come by and pick up our storage key. I was like, “you aren’t going to be able to open the padlock on your own, you should let your son do it.” She argued with me that she was planning to use a hammer (wtf?!) and she would have her friend with her. Then she mentions her friend is going to clean the chair. All kinds of red flags are being raised, and I just knew she had a plan already in motion without consulting me. I texted her back, “what exactly are you planning with my armchair?” Radio silence. She didn’t respond to me until 11 o’clock, NINE hours later. And in that time I got in contact with someone else about getting this chair taken care of. V started texting me with excuses as to why she was quiet all day, and just says, “Well I was going to have my friend give it away to some low income disabled seniors. That doesn’t care what shape it’s in. They said they will clean it up, they smoke and have dogs but not much to sit on.” I was SO PISSED. She didn’t ASK, she just claimed my property as hers to give away! Not to mention she wants to give it to a disabled senior?!? This chair is thoroughly covered in mold!!!!  I called her. I told her I was a little upset, to which she immediately started shouting, “what did I do wrong now?!?” (no clue what that response is about) I told her she cannot just give my things away, that it needs to be dumped because it’s moldy and could potentially make someone sick. V’s response? “I KNOW THAT!” (And she still wants to give it away!!!) even though I was shaking with anger, I kept calm, asked HER to lower her tone, and let her know we found someone else to help us dump it. She shouted “FINE!” At me and hung up.  I’m still feeling pissed off, and honestly, my feelings are hurt. She has never spoken to me like that before. While I feel like I have every right to be angry, at the same time I feel guilty. Was there any other way I should have handled this? Am I an asshole?	1642908029.0	sajucm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajucm/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_future_mil_give_away/	AITA for refusing to let my future MIL give away my armchair when I plan to dump it?
ixc78r1g	My mother often watches a bunch of movies on her laptop as a pass-time. Recently, she ran into one where the audio was particularly bad. That is, it was too quiet and she could barely hear anything when using the speakers built into her laptop. She was looking into alternatives, like pairing up the Bluetooth one we have at home... which did not work since the laptop does not support Bluetooth.  Then she remembered the speakers that are plugged into my computer. I was not listening to anything at the time, so she asked me to give them to her for the length of that movie. I said no to that. Not only it is a bit of work to unplug them in the first place (the cables under my desk are a bit tangled up and those speakers also need to be plugged into an electrical socket), but there's also a chance I might've wanted to listen to something while she was watching. After she was done, I'd also have to plug them back into my computer which would take me even more time.  Was I an AH for refusing to give them to her? She got really upset at me about it and called me selfish.	1642908036.0	sajuex	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajuex/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_mother_borrow_my_pc/	AITA for refusing to let my mother borrow my PC speakers?
1244mr	As the title states, my wife agreed to having her parents travel with us without consulting me at all (which is a *really* annoying characteristic of hers). This is a 17-18 hour cross country journey, with our two dogs, in a hatchback already filled with equipment, that only I can drive between all of us (manual vehicle) so I'll be dead tired by the end of it. She offhand mentioned it to me today, out of the blue like I should be happy about this development less than two weeks before our trip.  We simply do not have the space for them in the car, and would have to throw out personal items I do not wish to discard. I won't entertain that idea, and so she claims I am not trying to make it work.  Fair enough, but I tried to compromise with her and offer that they fly in at a later date once we are unpacked and settled in (1 week from end of our trip) and she didn't like that idea.  I definitely do feel like an asshole to deny her and her parents some good bonding time, but at the same time I feel wholly disrespected by her not talking with me before making a decision and then offering her compromise while dismissing mine. To add to it all, besides the logistic aspect of this, I just don't feel great about the idea of entertaining her parents for 17 hours then doing it for 1 week further after arriving at our new home dead tired- which I have yet to unpack, organize, or really even start to enjoy with our little family.  Thanks everyone for your input.	1642907686.0	sajqqb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajqqb/aita_for_not_wanting_my_wifes_parents_to_travel/	AITA for not wanting my wife's parents to travel with us?
63cmwg5f	Hey everyone,  I have a house that I’ve owned personally for years and my parents are great and have helped me do maintenance on said house. My fiancé and I are trying to carry on the renovations on the inside (parents are doing exterior) and she is keen to be apart of the house’s future.   So everything’s been great until my father has  needed to get some scaffolding on wheels so he can do parts that a ladder or trestles can’t get to. Now the scaffolding is like $250 NZD and my parents have decided that can be our wedding present. They see it as that it last a really long time, we would keep it here (we don’t really have the space for it) and it would be great in the future to do any necessary maintenance up high etc. We’ll probably be selling it once it’s renovated. It’s just had the roof replaced and he’s painting the outside so to be quite honest, we don’t see the point in it as a wedding present.   They’re are really nice people and I’m sure it comes from a nice place but not to sound ungrateful or anything like that we would so much rather them contribute to the cake, accommodation for the night of the wedding or just funds to help pay for things. They’re not well off but their not under financial strain either. In contrast my fiancés parents are contributing $7,000 NZD in paying different thing towards the wedding some in straight money too.   Am I the Asshole?   TL;DR parents are getting a wedding gift that we don’t want or really need long term and haven’t contributed anything else to the wedding	1642908583.0	sak0d1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sak0d1/aita_for_not_wanting_what_my_parents_are_wedding/	AITA?

59yatjzf	It's midterm week, and after coming home after a long and stressful day, I'm low on patience. I worked on a personal project a bit (It's midterm week, so no homework), ate dinner, and after, my mother tells me to go load the dishwasher. So, I load it, and when I'm starting it up, the buttons start acting up, and I get frustrated. When I get it to work, close the dishwasher with a little extra force. I, in no means, slammed it. My mother, however, gets angry, and starts yelling about how I'm 'lazy' and 'ungrateful'. She then decides give me extra chores for two weeks. We argue for a minute, then fed up I say: 'and you wonder why (older brother) hates you.' Looking back, I know this was uncalled for, but it felt good at the time. She then sends me to my room for the rest of the night.   Tldr; I close a dishwasher and get punished for it.	1642908542.0	sajzwf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sajzwf/aita_for_having_a_bad_day/	AITA for having a bad day?
ixcsogwn	I might be the asshole for this but honestly I didn't know she'd react the way she did. So I have a friend named Ally and along with her I met her siblings who also became my friends. We're all pretty close in age so it worked; Ally and I (21), her brother Cameron (19), & her sister Liza (23).   Liza had a party for her birthday and I was invited. It was pretty fun as it was just Liza's and our shared friends. Cameron and I are pretty close and we both do quite a bit of play flirting that both Ally and Liza have seen and just laughed at. So when one of our favorite songs came on and everyone was dancing with someone including Ally and her bf, I grabbed Cameron to dance with me. I admit, our dancing did get quite intimate. If you know what whining is, it was basically like that. Well after the second song ended, Ally grabbed me by the arm and dragged me away from the party.   She basically started scolding me for dancing with her brother and called me an asshole for it. I guess Liza saw Ally pulling me away from the party because she followed us and started telling Ally to calm down and it wasn't like I was a stranger. They were arguing back and forth until Cameron found us and got mad at Ally for making it such a big deal. Ally has been ignoring me since...aita for dancing with Cameron?	1642909261.0	sak82b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sak82b/aita_for_dancing_with_my_friends_brother/	AITA for dancing with my friend's brother?
ixcszl6z	My boyfriend and I were supposed to celebrate my birthday at my parent's home. I left early because I wanted to hangout with a few friends before the dinner. My boyfriend never showed up and he didn't even pick up his phone. I was very worried about him and I was panicking, I decided to go home.   My boyfriend had a break down because he found something that belonged to his sister. She passed away about a year ago. I think it brought back a lot of memories and overwhelmed him. He was very upset about missing my birthday and ruining it. He has apologized a lot, I have told him it is fine.  I did talk about went down with my best friend and she texted him and called him a loser and shithead who needs to get his act together and be a good boyfriend. My boyfriend was very upset when showed me the texts and he kept on apologizing. I feel really lose because I think this is not the first time she had pulled something like this, She did say awful things to my ex girlfriend and I didn't believe her.  I was really mad at her and I called her and yelled at her and told her that she need to stop being heartless and try to be such an asshole and she needs to stop hurting people I love and get a fucking life of her own. She was crying by the end of the call and we are not talking to each other right now.   I feel guilty because she is my best friend, she has always been there for me, no questions asked and I wouldn't be here without her. I was so cruel to her and I took all my anger out on her.	1642910154.0	sakhvo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakhvo/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_to_get_a_life_of/	AITA for telling my best friend to get a life of her own?
iw1lh8fw	okay, I know the title sounds really bad but please listen to me. my (15 years) mother (49 years) and I have had some ups and downs when it comes to our relationship. I'm pretty sure that most of it was due to the toxic exposure I had growing up living on and off with my other family (they were physically and emotionally awful to my mom and i). all of their arguments, along with the toxicity from my mom and problems at school, it lodged me into a dark place and it caused me to have low self esteem. my mom and i moved out and we currently have a place of our own, however all of the problems haven't subsided. my mom heavily criticizes me over various things, and that's a huge reason that i don't open up to her, however shes always trying to use me as her outlet and it's unfair that I, a teenager, have never had any form of emotional support from my family my whole life. as usual, she was going on a rant about how bad her job is. don't get me wrong, I'm always willing to listen and i told her to tell me about her day. she was telling me about everything. due to the exhaustion working, school, and the fact that i hadnt taken my supplements to help with my deficiency, i was doing my best to stay awake but accidentally fell asleep. i woke up less than a minute later and my mom was leaving my room. i hadn't realized that i had totally collapsed and i went back to her room to apologize, give her a hug and find those supplements. she bursts into tears and tells me to leave her alone and that she didn't wanna talk about it anymore. i feel like the biggest asshole but I'll let you guys judge.

ixbmiyie	My wife and I weren't planning on eloping originally, we wanted to have a small wedding with our immediate family and close friends. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters. My wife has 2 sisters and 5 brothers. If we stuck to immediate family to invite (grandparents, parents, siblings/spouses and their children) our guest list would be 44 people. We were aiming to have immediate family and some friends so around 60 people total. The problems started because our families wanted more. Both our families wanted to add extended family; such as aunts/uncle's and cousins and great aunts/uncles. Plus "family friends" Additionally I'm Italian and Mexican by decent [3 Italian grandparents and 1 Mexican grandparent]. My wife is Indian by decent. Our cultures are known for big and expensive weddings but we didn't want that. I'm not kidding when I say the guest list would be 700 or more people if we invited everyone. I get shaky at the thought. Our parents and grandparents were wanting to help us pay but it's not about money, we didn't want a spectacle.  Also there were issues about what traditions to incorporate, food, the ceremony and the venue. It was stressed out both of us out and made us want to avoid our families. Finally we decided to elope. Last weekend we took a long weekend road trip, got married on the beach just us and spent 3 days in a lovely AirBnB with no phones or technology. It was the best decision for us. Unfortunately both our families are furious. My mom cried and my dad and a couple of my siblings chewed me out. My grandparents were disappointed. My wife's parents were so angry she ended up crying and her siblings and grandparents were mad too. Our families feel insulted and the extended families are mad about not being invited. I can't even talk to my family because they are so mad, my parents won't stop bringing it up. My wife and can't even enjoy ourselves because we feel so demoralized. Are we assholes for insulting our families by not wanting to have a 700 person wedding just because that's what our families wanted? know we should have just stood up to them and planned for the wedding we wanted but it was so much pressure it was like hitting a wall. I feel like this is madness but both our families are against our descision.	1642910547.0	sakmbf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sakmbf/aita_for_eloping_and_not_telling_my_family_until/	AITA for eloping and not telling my family until afterwards?
ikj9tqd1	I [19] am home for a semester of college. (I’m still full time it’s just cheaper to do my Gen Ed’s online instead of at a dorm) Tonight I went to my friend (19)’s house to hang out with some friends. No drugs or alcohol, just DND and board games like always. My dad knows this friend well and said friend has even made my dad cookies for his birthday (so it’s not like my dad dislikes them or is unfamiliar with them) and their house is only 5-7 minutes by car from ours. At around 9:30 my dad texts me to be home soon which is weird since I usually leave their house at 11-12. I asked him why and he said “Please don’t argue about it now”. I leave and call to tell him I’m on the way home and he starts dodging the question again. I ask my sister if he she knows why and she says she doesn’t know. I ask my mom and she says he never told her he wanted me home early and didn’t care what time I went home. She then says something confused about snow? When I get home I ask my dad myself and he tells me “Don’t fucking argue that’s why” and when I said I wasn’t arguing I didn’t mind coming home Early, I was just confused he cursed at me again and said not to question him. I looked it up and it’s not supposed to snow for 8 hours after when he said to come home and then yelled at me for calling my mom.

enz00aea	Hey guys! I (18 female), got into an argument with my father (54 male), about how i’m not planning on giving my mom a ticket to my graduation.   For some background, my mother was an abusive alcoholic/drug addict manipulator for essentially, my entire life. Because of her i now struggle with ptsd, borderline personality disorder, and am in dbt therapy. I have yet to even scratch the service of my recovery, due to the minuscule 5 years i’ve no longer been in her custody, due to her being arrested for attempting to beat my father while she was intoxicated. Despite the hatred both my father and i share for my mother, he’s forced me to communicate with her even though she has no custody, and it’s only negatively affected me. I had to be involuntarily put in a psych ward about this time last year because i couldn’t handle the verbal abuse i was still receiving because he made me talk to her.   Flash forward to this past week, me and my therapist established very early on that i am allowed to set a boundary if i don’t want my mom at one of my events whether it be performances or anything else. After attempts to invite herself to my tattoo/piercing appointments, birthday parties, and senior awards i’m genuinely fed up with her. I expressed to my father that i don’t know how many tickets i get to graduation and that i only need x amount of tickets and listed everyone i wanted there, to which he asked me about my mom. I told him i didn’t want her there and he told me i was cruel and that she still gave birth and deserves to be there. I know it will hurt her, and she’ll be pissed, but despite every hint i’ve given she isn’t getting that she won’t be in my life as soon as i have autonomy. But that doesn’t mean i owe her anything right? Her birthing me doesn’t change the overwhelming negative impact she’s had on me and my life. Am i the asshole for refusing to let her come and ruin my special day for me?	1642911216.0	saktsy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saktsy/aita_for_not_wanting_my_mom_at_my_graduation/	AITA for not wanting my mom at my graduation?
8gepbcmv	On phone, sorry for any mistakes.  At the start of 2021, I made new friends. They were great and made me feel welcome, until they started commenting on my weight.  I am 5'7" nearly 5'8" and I weigh roughly only 39kg (85 pounds) I am severely underweight and I'm aware of this.   They were great until they started doing things, like picking up sticks and saying things like "ok, look, Zara. It's your sibling/cousin/aunt/uncle" whatever. They also did that trees were my parents. The first few times I laughed it off and thought they wouldn't do it again, but I was wrong. They did it repeatedly, until I asked them to stop and they did.  Until, one of them decided to do it again. She constantly says things like "stop bragging about your weight" whenever someone ELSE calls me light. And she always says "you need to stop acting like you're so skinny." The other don't say anything and they just agree with her and say similar things.  Now, the most recent one was in December, since my HS always goes to a local water park, since it's Summer here. I was wearing a bikini with a rashy over the top, but I had it unzipped at first, so I didn't get too hot.  As I was putting stuff in my bag, she said "OMG, Zara, stop sucking in!" And I had enough so I just ignored her. But I've been dwelling on it recently, since I go back to school at the end of Jan.

ixd4tdd2	I (14m) live at both my dad and mum’s houses, bc they’re split. I spend the majority of my time at my mum‘s, for a lot of reasons. I will mention that my dad used to be a pretty bad parent, he yelled at me and my siblings a lot and I’m pretty damn sure it’s why I have anxiety, which is going to negatively affect me probably for decades.  My eldest sibling (16) moved to my mum’s house permanently because of my dad and his partner (Who we justifiably hate). I’d prefer to stay at my mum’s house fully, but  I’d be the second of two siblings to pull that trigger, which is a no go.  I can have some fun at my dad’s, although I don’t prefer that house.  The biggest problem is that my dad refuses to talk about the past, despite changing (for the most part) back in 2018. Actually, he doesn’t acknowledge most of his big past mistakes.   All this considered, I‘m really not a fan of my dad, I can’t be until he admits his mistakes. Should emphasise that the present isn’t really the problem, it’s the past.  I still feel like shit every time I cancel on him or don’t want to do something with him, I know it’s really affecting him. so Reddit, AITA?

Today he'd finished the new story to a game called warframe and started discussing it with a friend we were in a voice chat with, he mentions a character death and I hadn't started said story yet. I mention I didn't want spoilers and they both make the excuse the death happened at the beginning so it didn't matter and the friend mentions hed just finished the story so i should have known they would discuss spoilers.

dnmm7	Key characters: me (38M), my mom (65F) and her siblings Hank* (61M), Anne* (57F) and Irene* (55F)  After my parents divorced about a decade ago, I decided to stay with my mom to help her stay on her feet. What was supposed to be one year turned into seven, as we took turns helping each other through financial crises. (She's disabled and can't work; I had periods where I couldn't find any. I'm now employed and, though still underwater, the path is trending upwards and I can see the surface.)  About two years ago, we went our separate ways; I'm now in a house with roommates, while she's in a studio apartment. We're still close, and though we've talked some about finances, we don't typically get into details.  Earlier this week, I got a text from my aunt Anne saying we were having a family meeting at Hank's house on Sunday, "called in the name of love and concern over her finances and living situation." (The "called in the name of love" bit rings right with Anne, a devout Christian. Most of the family is at least nominally believers; I'm currently...undecided.) Mom isn't invited, and we aren't supposed to tell her about it.  She added that I should call her if I had any questions. I sent a text letting her know that I couldn't make it (it's my only day off), and that I'd call her afterwards. Now she's offering to reschedule.  My concern is twofold: one, that I don't want to participate in gossip about my mom's situation (whatever it is) without hearing the story directly from her; two, that I worry the family will try to pressure me into moving back in with her. (I don't make enough to support the both of us, and also...as a single male in my late 30s, I just CAN'T.)  My current plan is to reply something along the lines of "don't worry about me, have the meeting; I'd prefer to discuss this with Mom myself, at the appropriate time."

axltnwo3	My (24F) boyfriend (25M) whom I live with just got a new job after getting fired about three weeks ago. We both work overnight and our hours used to line up where I could bring him to work and then myself as we only have my car between the two of us. His new job requires a vehicle for patrolling (security guard) and I agreed to Uber to my job one night a week so that he could take my car for the three nights established during his interview. His other two days are on my days off, so no problem there.    Note at this point- in the past he has not reliably held down a job or been great with saving money. There have been a couple months were I had to pay the rent and utilities in full as he did not have any money at the time. He is trying to turn that around and start getting serious about saving up, which I do appreciate and am trying to support.   He just told me they are now asking him to work four days a week on days where I also have to work. I told him there was no way I was going to Uber to my job every night of the week at midnight and that this new job just doesn't seem like it is going to work out if they don't keep him on the three days we decided on. He then suggested that I just quit my job, since it "means nothing to me". I have never said this, only complained about the every-day banal aspects that come with any job. He is heavily implying that if I do not let him use my car every night that I will just have to keep being financially responsible for both of us since he would have to quit and waste more time trying to find a different job. He offered to pay for the Ubers but I still think it is ridiculous he expects me to work around his three day old schedule.

4xl4fg97	My sister (12, F) and I (14, M) are on the same wireless service account (2 phone numbers, but only one bill is issued for both of us). Usually my Dad takes care of the bill, so it wasn't much of a worry for us. But my Dad's financial situation has gotten really difficult over the last few weeks and he cannot afford to pay our phone bill right now. Our phone services are temporarily suspended until the past due is paid.   I am planning to pay for my half of the bill with the income I make from my part-time job after school, but my sister does not have any income. I work for this money so I said that she also should pay her half out of her savings account, or, I will call customer service to only have my service restored and not hers. AITA?   My work is physical labour outdoors, if that helps with your judgement in any way. As you guys already know, high school students cannot make that much and I cannot pay the entire amount with one paycheck (meaning I will have to wait another 2 weeks if I want to pay the full due amount.)

8lelin70	So...About 2 years ago my parents divorced,which was fine because it was somewhat mutual,around that time we (my father and I) discovered my mother had been suffering from a very toxic mental illness,she was/is the black widow of any relationship,gaslighting,manipulation,narcissistic tendencies,the whole shabang,at the beginning I tried to put my trust into her and invited her back into my life,until I realized that she began to do the same things (manipulation etc) again,pointing the finger at my father for being the "evil parent",fast forward a few years to where I am now an adult in my own right,she wishes to again try and come back into my life,she says she feels hurt that I refuse to have her in my life and blames my father for demonizing her to me,she has now reached out over the recent Thanksgiving and Christmas to offer me seasonal greetings and is actively trying to set up some sort of lunch date so we can meet up and talk to one another,I refuse to have anything to do with her,which includes texting or calling,which she becomes "more disappointed that I either cannot or will not trust" her,she is now pestering me with calls and texts daily about trying to meet or talk with me. So I now ask you guys,AITA or am I just overreacting?	1642912857.0	salbpp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salbpp/aita_for_refusing_to_see_my_own_mother/	AITA For refusing to see my own mother?
giymjneh	Disclaimer: when I say “sleep with” I do not mean so in a sexual manner, and I mean literally sleep with. This story is completely SFW.  So a few weeks ago, my (18M) mom (46F) decided that we would travel out of state for me to look at a college as I’m currently a senior in high school and have applied to my schools. Due to the long drive, it was decided that we would stay in a hotel. I wasn’t really happy about this, but I didn’t really have a choice. My friend (16F) also came along as she’s a junior and will soon begin to look at schools, and also just because we are great friends.  The day went by not great. It’s less than 12° outside with snow on the ground, and the college tour got canceled so we did a “self guided tour” that lasted all of 20 minutes. Afterwards we went around the area and I’m not a big fan of shopping, dining, etc. so I was generally just bored and not in a good mood.  Getting to the hotel there were two beds, which was expected but disappointing. I immediately offered to sleep on the floor as I have enough blankets and pillows, plus I find hotel beds gross, but was immediately told no. This discussion continued until now (currently writing this at around 11:30PM) and I was told that if I didn’t sleep in a bed that my mother would take away money from my bank account. Pretty sure this was an exaggeration, but I don’t wanna find out. I chose the bed with my friend as I find it less awkward, but I am still uncomfortable. I like having my own personal space and I also move around a decent amount in my sleep. If it means anything, I am also neurodivergent (likely autistic but we don’t care for an official diagnosis as it’s not a pressing matter). And before anyone asks, we definitely i not have feelings for each other as we are both gay in the wrong directions.  So, AITA for this? I’m worried that I’m being annoying and over-dramatic, but I also think that I am entitled to my own comfort if wanted.	1642912834.0	salbgb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salbgb/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sleep_with_my_friend/	AITA for not wanting to sleep with my friend?
iugd0xo0	My son and his boyfriend (+dog) have been staying with me over the holidays because the dorms are closed and are going back to uni in 2 weeks (it’s not even 15 minutes away) His boyfriend has just announced his parents are going to take the family cat to the pound if he does not come get him.  He is NC with his parents (threw him out for being transgender), but his dad reached out saying the cat won’t stop pooping in the house thus resulting in this ultimatum. My son’s bf says the cat does this because he’s large (probably half Maine Coon or Norwegian Forest) and can’t fit in the hooded litterboxes at home. No, his parents will not buy new litterboxes.  I do not want to take care of another cat in the house, especially one that might poop everywhere. His dog stays upstairs in the bedroom because she too was peeing everywhere (which has since stopped. They say I “stressed the dog out” but I think she just wanted to be with her owner) and he insists so will the cat (as in the cat will remain with the two of them) and that they will provide an open-pan litterbox. And will clean up any messes the cat makes even if it means coming home from the dorms after class to do that.  I want to mention I did not pay for the house myself, though. My son funded the house when he was still a minor and I signed it (he did child acting and was in a couple small but notable musicals/movies. It gave us comfortable money) and so the house is legally mine. Morally I guess it’s his.

3qfa2gf9	My boyfriend was watching a football game, I was laying next to him puttering around on Instagram because I don’t care about football. The game was between a team from his home state and a team from mine. Sometimes he would tell me things about what was happening because he likes to explain things, which is fine but I didn’t really have much to contribute. In the end, it looked like his team was going to lose and he was saying something about it so I jokingly responded “go [my home state]!” really just to have something to say. He got really pissed about this, told me off for my “shitty comment”, and is now refusing to watch a movie with me or speak at all. I also think it should be fair to mention that he has always said he doesn’t really care about football and only watches because its tradition. That being said, his team lost, so maybe it was too mean to rub it in even jokingly.	1642913091.0	saleeh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saleeh/aita_boyfriend_giving_me_the_silent_treatment/	AITA boyfriend giving me the silent treatment because of flippant comment about football
i7rn6a58	I have a fairly new friend group who sits with me at lunch. It was recently one of my new friend's birthdays (I'll call them Alex).   I hung out with Alex on their birthday for a few hours, we went to Chuck E. Cheese (haha funny big-kids go to little-kid place haha), drove around, got slurpees, had a fun time. We had a group of 7 (mostly the other people at the lunch table), the party lasted around 5 or 6 hours, starting at noon. This was my first time hanging out with a friend group in a while, and my first time ever hanging out with Alex or anybody else in the group.  My girlfriend of a few months (I'll call her Bri) doesn't like Alex. She doesn't have any specific beef with them, she just doesn't like them because she thinks they are annoying. I know that she doesn't like Alex, but I didn't think it would be a big deal if I went to their birthday party, seeing as I had nothing else to do today, it seemed like something fun to do on a free weekend, and I thought it would be rude not to go. I posted something on my Snapchat story saying "Happy Birthday!" with a picture of Alex. A few mins after Bri saw the post, she tweeted about how she isn't controlling but she doesn't like them and that I shouldn't hang out with them. No tag or anything, so it was just a subtweet that was obviously about me hanging with Alex.   I had texted her a little bit throughout the day (at the party and after I got home), but every text after the tweet was left on read, or at least, presumably left on read because we mainly talk through Discord and she had been online multiple times after I sent the texts. I texted a few times after the party, just a couple "hi"'s (that's how we start every convo). We usually call every night to talk about our days, and when we don't call, we text about our days. I haven't received a text back from her in about 9 hours, which is very out-of-the-norm, leading me to believe that she is still mad at me.   Bri and I had just hung out the day before and we didn't have plans to hang out today. She even had plans of her own and hung out with her own friends today, so I don't think I was impeding on quality time, especially since I tried to reach out to her multiple times, before and after the tweet.  Am I the asshole for hanging out with Alex on their birthday, knowing that Bri doesn't like them?	1642913425.0	salhyu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salhyu/aita_for_hanging_out_with_someone_my_girlfriend/	AITA for hanging out with someone my girlfriend doesn't like?
bdu62e7d	I (14 NB) am having issues with my nose. This sounds stupid, I know, but I’ve been having nosebleeds more than normal. I’m talking average of 5 a day lasting longer than normal and are always coming from the same spot.   These nosebleeds aren’t normal ones, either. I will literally gush blood and will have blood dripping down my arm by the time I change out tissues. I know they’re coming from the same spot because when they die down the blood is always on the same side of the napkin.   Like this: (| = blood, /\ = napkin border)       _     /|| \    /|||  \    ——  I’ve honestly gotten light headed during these nosebleeds and they’ve become emotionally draining. It’s sounds dumb but spending around an hour a day in the bathroom consistently bleeding is frustrating and tiring. I’ve woken up to blood running down my face because a nosebleed started while I was asleep.   She said she would call the ENT (ear, nose, and throat doctor.) She said this weeks ago. Somewhere in the very beginning of december or late november. She still hasn’t called them despite me regularly asking her to. She always says she’ll get around to it but never does.   I know she’s busy because she’s a teacher and is working a lot. She also does evaluations for kids who can’t afford to be taken to a specialist as apart of this program. Instead she’s trained and with past experiences of diagnosing and teaching special needs she’s considered qualified. It’s hard to explain but she had to do a lot of training and school a year or two ago.   I got really frustrated with her after my most recent nosebleed and it ended up in a fight between us. Dialogue:  “mom, seriously i’ve been asking you to call them for weeks!” -me  “When you’re an adult and have a job you can talk to me. I’m trying my best but I guess thats never good enough for [deadnames] perfect life!”  (what she means by “i’ll never be good enough” is that i’m constantly late to stuff because of her and it’s caused me a lot of stress. especially because i have social anxiety.)  Am I the asshole for not just sucking it up? Or am I justified for being frustrated with her?	1642913864.0	salmjl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salmjl/aita_for_being_mad_and_yelling_at_my_mom/	AITA for being mad and yelling at my mom?
hxog648l	Throwaway account for privacy.   I(21f) am an international student living off campus. My bff(f23) of 3 yrs lived on campus but due to money issues is unable to afford boarding. So when she needed somewhere to stay I offered my space as I know she would do the same for me.I work full time to pay for uni/rent/bills and to send money home to my family. Knowing her situation I told her she didnt have to pay rent until she found a job but asked if she was ok splitting food/sharing the chores which she agreed to.FF 6 months she still hasn’t applied for jobs. I told my boss and he was willing to hire her but she declined saying she didn’t like the job( I work in a care facility the shifts are often over night, the pay is ok and the staff and patients are very nice, but there have been a few times where I came home and complained about how tired I was so I understand how I could have given a negative perception of the work environment). In December she stopped paying for food/doing chores and was spending a lot of time in bed.As someone with depression I know how hard it can be to motivate urself so I didn’t push her, made sure to buy extra food/clean more. The past few weeks I have been working OT saving for a ticket home because my father is ill. Because of this she asked if we could talk and told me how unfair it was to no longer be buying enough food for the house/cleaning less because I chose to work OT. I apologized for not considering how my schedule was affecting her. this week I mentioned her looking for a part time job and she completely lost it, she called me selfish and said I should neva hve offered my space if it meant she had to follow all these rules. That brings us to this morning after a 12hr shift I walked into an almost empty apartment nearly all my personal belongings were gone along with all of hers. When I tried to call her it didn’t go through and shes blocked me on all social media. My co worker wants me to report her because there is video of her leaving with my belongings. I posted online asking if anyone had heard from her as she has some of my belongings that I urgently need like my laptop. I now have msgs from ppl calling me a bad friend for “putting her on blast”.I’ve lost over $6000 in items and a piggy bank from my grandmother that I’ve been putting money in since she passed in 2010. My heart is broken I don’t know what to do. Maybe I jumped the gun and should delete the posts. I don’t think she’s a bad person I think she’s just desperate.	1642913854.0	salmg5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/salmg5/aita_for_putting_my_best_friends_on_blast/	AITA for putting my best friends “on blast” ?
bvr06oji	My wife has a habit of falling asleep on the couch. She is a very heavy sleeper. When we sit down to watch TV she always tells me to wake her up to go to bed so she can take her medicine.  Well, 90% of the time when I try to wake her up she just tells me "5 more minutes" several times for a couple of hours. Sometimes it even gets passed midnight before I can get her up. I am exhausted from the day and want to sleep too. So the last time this happened I tried to get her up for about an hour 1/2. She just got annoyed when I tried. So when 11:30 rolled around I just went to bed. The next morning she was furious. Genuinely curious if I am making a dick move.

3w1ia4p3	Hey, so I work in a mall, and I’m a manager of a store kinda like newbury comics. We get a lot of young children and so we have a strict no running policy. If some kid is running around the store and falls and breaks his nose, that’s my fault with the company.  So today two really young kids (probably about 8 and 6) were in my store with no parent or guardian. They were booking it around my store so I went “no running in the store, if you run again I’ll have to kick you out”  They didn’t run anymore, bought their stuff and left. Then like 20 minutes later a woman came in saying I was a bitch and saying I had no right to speak to her child like that. I told her that all I said was they couldn’t run and if they did they would have to leave and she called me a liar. She then said “you must be really fucking sad to yell at kids” I told her it was a safety concern and she left calling me an Asshole on the way out. I was really mad but I’m not sure if I was in the wrong, if she had been there with the kids I would have told her instead of telling the kids directly but idk.	1642914346.0	sals2q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sals2q/aita_for_disciplining_someone_elses_kid/	AITA for disciplining someone else’s kid
1ilwhwk2	I have had a lot of health issues over the years, resulting in my hair falling out and being in pretty poor shape. It’s better now but I still have pretty thin hair. I have been trying to grow my hair out because I don’t like the reminder of being sick but it’s been a very slow process (like 5 years to reach just below my shoulders).   My mother decided to treat me for my birthday and booked me an appointment at the salon she goes to. I went in and met the stylist, who immediately kept saying she wanted to cut my hair and highlight it blond. I stressed I did not want it cut, just a bit of a trim. She said she had it under control, spun the chair around from the mirror, and next thing I know I feel the scissors near my ear. She chopped a good 6-7 inches off my hair. I kept telling myself maybe it wasn’t going to be that bad, but after she blew it out, making it even shorter, I couldn’t help it. I started to cry looking at myself. I flashed back to my sick self with the short hair and just lost it. She snapped at me it looked better this way and I’d thank her in a few days.   As I was paying (still with tears in my eyes) the salon owner asked what the problem was, and when I said the stylist had cut way too much off, she told me I was being silly, it was hair and would grow back.  In the parking lot, a woman who must have seen the interaction said she’d never seen such a production and I owed the staff an apology.

9tkm1fzi	So my dad is a bit of an asshole, rude to retail workers, rude to my mother, but he's specially weird with money. He refuses to save for my college tuition, won't buy my sister the computer she needs for online classes, and he won't give my mom any money at all, which makes her want a divorce him but he wont cooperate so the legal process is being very long. And the thing is, he got money, he sold our old house, bought a new one, bought an apartment because of the divorce thingy, his job pays good, he writes off a bunch of taxes, but we don't get to see any of that.  I go to a private school where they have an international program, and I have convinced him to pay for it, and the trip I want to go to is a trip to japan, 1 month, cultural activities, excursions, and intensive japanese classes. It costs 6000 dollars.    He said he doesn't have the money, then he said he might have it, then he says he has enough for the trip but not enough for the food, and says he is afraid to go in debt. Despite this I have kept on insisting, even resorting to emotional blackmail of sorts. Since I was 10 I asked him to save for my "15 años" trip and he gave me nothing, I told him he also promised me this trip a few years ago and he has given me nothing, and the worst part about this is that its kinda working and I'm starting to feel bad, what If he really doesn't have the money?, what if it's not worth it? I feel entitled to this cause he promised it but at the same time maybe I'm pushing my luck.

So that given day I wore shorts that had strings in the front of the waist, they were pretty short due to me being a teenager and still growing. So once I got to her house Nana comes out to the front of the garage to greet us. While doing so she looks me up and down and grabs the strings on my shorts and starts to tug on them saying "You are getting chubby aren't you." I was shocked. I was dead on the inside.

ixfx1jlb	In the past 4 years, I've put on over 60 pounds. A lot of it was stress eating/drinking, mixed with the college lifestyle. It's not something I celebrate, but, I also don't feel like I should be lambasted for it either and thats exactly whats happened since I've been at home with my parents & 3 older brothers. Everyone feels because I'm the youngest, the only girl, and I put on weight that now it's just open season. I can be sitting there on my phone and someone will start up talking about weight increasing the chance of heart problems.  What I hate is that, its not just that these supposedly heartfelt, serious talks come out of nowhere, its that my brothers in particular just have this array of fat jokes they aim at me or feel like telling me to get my fat ass up is ok.  A few nights ago, we were having snacks, my brother out of nowhere, turns to me and says I've become big. Nobody says anything. I turn to my parents, ask them if they heard anything. No response.  I yelled at my parents that because of some weird new feelings towards me, they've enabled this new mean-spirited attitude towards me from my brothers. I feel that they are very much responsible for allowing this to happen. My parents feel like if I'm unhappy with comments being made, that it should be on me to get them to stop.

dobnmi2r	My college roommate just overall sucks. We are in suite style living, so I luckily have my own single room, but that doesn’t stop him from being a menace. We have a shared kitchen with a dishwasher, oven, microwave, etc. Every time he cooks, he just leaves all his dirty stuff everywhere in the kitchen including his used plates and utensils. He refuses to clean them up, and waits for me to be so sick of it that I do it myself. I take out our shared garbage once every few days, I clean basically everything, and do all the chores. No matter how many times I ask him to do shit, he always says he’ll do it later. And it’s no secret he never ends up doing it. It doesn’t stop here, though. He wakes up at 6am every morning to do yoga in the common area while blasting his music. I asked him to put in headphones, he refuses. The RA’s a useless.  Well I finally had enough. I asked him to take out the trash, deciding not to take it out myself and let it keep piling up till he has no choice. Well 2 weeks go by and the garbage isn’t cleaned, his dishes are everywhere, and he is still being a jerk. I took the garbage and laid it out all over his bed. He wasn’t obviously wasn’t too happy and told me I needed to clean it up. I smiled, told him *I’ll do it later*, and haven’t spoken to him since.

831nqc6e	I (F23) live with two roommates (names changed), Stanley (M22) and Peter (M23). Background: in October of last year, my roommates and I all agreed to adopt a cat. I was really set on a female cat because all the males I have owned have had urinary issues, and I was worried about that happening to my cat/financial responsibilities associated with those surgeries. While at the shelter, I didn’t find a kitty I “clicked” with right away, but the two boys fell in love with a large cat, and essentially put me in a position where I would be an asshole if I said no to adopting him. I paid for adoption fees, assumed virtually ALL responsibilities for him, and after a ROUGH battle with COVID and COVID pneumonia, this beautiful chunky cat is my best friend for life. He helps me through my health battles, both physical and mental anxiety), and we have a bond that is so special. The boys obviously care and pet him too, but all financial responsibilities are mine and the cat prefers my company.   Last night, Stanley told me that the shelter where we adopted our cat from was having an open house for cats, and he was chatting with Peter. Peter then said that since I basically adopted our cat as my cat and he was clearly mine, that when we go separate separate ways, he wanted a cat he could take with him. I told Stanley that first, it’s cruel to the cat we have now as he is only 3 months into being in our apartment, and a new cat would be too much for him. Secondly, I said that I will end up taking on all the responsibilities like I did with the first cat. Thirdly, I told him, I really don’t want to have another cat in the apartment, especially male this quickly because the cats could be territorial and start peeing everywhere. Stanley has jokingly said that 2/3 majority rules and I said absolutely not, and he shrugged it off. Peter seemed super stoked on the idea of another cat that’s all his, but I really don’t think that’s how it would all play out.

6zun4ryw	My dad is very religious Christian but I am not. I have never told him this for I am scared the repercussions. Anyway, enough introductions, time for this trial.  I don't remember how the whole thing started but my dad believes that your life is determined from God and you'll end up in Heaven or Hell and you have no control over which one. I said simply isn't that cruel on God's behalf. NOOO see God has written your book and where you'll end up but there are little choices in your life where you can make choices whether to be good or not. If that's so, what is the point in doing good deeds if God has already said that you're Hell bound?  I said this to him and honestly to save you the bullshit I won't even try to explain. Eventually I said to him,  "Bla bla bla it's already been determined." And he just yelled at me. Calling me rebellious and thick headed and whatever else a 60 year old man with a power boner can call a "dumb" 18 year old kid. Yes maybe I did give him some snark but he was raising his voice at me! I was trying to have a civil conversation on God but I get smacked in the face with illogic that he refuses to resolve. Im sick of the Dogma cause he really is a great dad; he has busted his ass time and time again to provide and would get me the moon if I asked for it. I could write a book on how wonderful of a dad and great example he is but then this Dogma contradicts him at times.   Am I the Asshole? Honestly it doesn't matter cause it's been determined. I don't feel like an asshole but maybe my teenage snark did it in for me. Maybe I'm looking for validation and not wanting my father's disappointment.

90h2phhb	My boyfriend and I were on a phone call and my cousin showed me a hilarious video of tucker Carlson going on a rant about how m&m made their brown m&m less sexy and how they won’t stop until we’re all turned off by cartoons (very funny video, I recommend looking it up). My cousin and I were making jokes about it and cracking up. After my cousin left, my boyfriend wanted to know what we were laughing about. I told him he wouldn’t think it was funny, but he still wanted me to send the video.  He told me “you don’t actually think he’s jacking off to the brown m&m though, right?” I was still laughing and told him that tucker literally said they’re trying to turn us all off with the m&m wearing sneakers which implies he was turned on by her in the high heels.  My boyfriend was annoyed and asked me if I really thought tucker was into the brown m&m. I told him of course I don’t actually think tucker is jacking off to an m&m I was just making jokes about it because he implied he was. I don’t actually think tucker believes a word he ever says I’m just making fun of him. My boyfriend said “then why did you say that he literally said he was turned on by the m&m??” I told him that I was making fun of tucker Carlson and I should be able to make jokes without him taking them so seriously and that’s why I was laughing with my cousin, we were making fun of him. He said the video wasn’t funny and our jokes didn’t make sense because tucker’s not actually turned on by the m&m, just upset they’re making things less sexy.  Here’s where I may have been an asshole, I told him I was sorry he doesn’t have a sense of humor. He left the call, saying I was mean and hurt his feelings and not to call him until tomorrow.  Looking back, maybe he is sensitive about this because he knows he actually doesn’t have a sense of humor? I didn’t mean to make him feel self conscious but I was having a fun time laughing with my cousin and him getting annoyed at me for it was really frustrating.	1642916412.0	samcpv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samcpv/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_has_no_sense_of/	AITA for telling my boyfriend he has no sense of humor and I don’t want to explain every joke?
iv6lcp5l	Now for the first part or this story I'm aware I'm the AH my son who for anonymity ill call Jake left his phone unlocked on the couch when he went to the kitchen to cook dinner (I am not a good cook and he enjoys doing it I don't force him) now as he was cooking I noticed his phone was unlocked and I wish I didnt but wasn't able to resist checking it I was only gonna check snapchat because my ex is a cop and says that's how most kids do it I checked snapchat and went to the posts I couldn't find anything pointing to weed I went to clear snapchat and as I did it popped up his most recent app It was the notes app now I was about to put the phone away but I was able to catch a glimpse of what some of it said and when I did it was very shocking I clicked on the app to see what it was exactly and it was a story about a show he watches called Riverdale I read some of the story and it was alot of sex I clicked off to see his other notes and there were about 10 different stories now not all of them had sex but the majority did and one was of a show I watch and it was a story about the main character and his daughter I was very shocked to discover this and quickly put it back I just sat there silently until dinner was done i tried to act normal but he could tell something was off as well as my oldest son I just told them that my friend in the hospital took a turn for the worse which wasn't true but I didn't wanna bring anything up in front of his brothers instead I waited until  everyone was done and after me and him were done cleaning up I told him I needed to talk to him I could tell he was worried but he wasn't expecting what I was about to say which was "we need to discuss the stories on your phone" he immediately lost it asking what I was doing looking through his phone I told him I was just gonna check snapchat and I had just accidentally discovered them he told me that wasn't better and I had violated his privacy when I was able to finally talk I demanded to know why he was writing stories like that especially about family members he was flustered and just kept going on about I had betrayed him and his trust he wouldn't let me get another word in so I yelled at him and said if he wasn't gonna talk to me about this he was grounded and to go to his room he went to his room and slammed his door my oldest came out and was about to go to his brother's room before I stopped him he asked what had happened I just told him he had been ditching class and I didn't wanna bring it up at dinner he could tell I was lying but didn't press I've been up all night trying to think of what to do I feel like I can't ask anyone for help cause I don't wanna tell anyone part of me feels like I overreacted and maybe it was just for fun and I've just ruined me and his very good relationship while the other part felt like this was a huge problem and maybe an overreaction is what he needs to see that it's wrong so AITA?	1642916548.0	same6b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/same6b/aita_for_grounding_my_son_after_finding_his/	AITA for grounding my son after finding his fanfiction?
ixfpucl9	My husband (35m) has ADHD and I (36f) am autistic. We have a son (9m) who has ADHD and autism and a daughter (7f) who is also autistic. One thing we all have in common is sensory processing disorder as a result, (SPD is basically our 7 senses that we learned in school, they are just received differently and can cause problems if we get too much or too little). Quite a few senses are easy, I'm adverse to sounds so I wear headphones when I'm around people, my son only likes some textures of clothing, etc. Vestibular input is something all four of us are seekers of, always wanting more. We live somewhere that gets very cold in the winter and honestly we used to spend our days in our home bouncing around as going outside was a no go.  At the start of 2019 we decided we were done with a 'normal' house. We now have a trampoline in our entry way (tallest ceilings) an indoor jungle gym in our dining room (not a formal family anyway), and a few doorway swings in the house, sensory swings in the living room, a fairly large foam pit in the basement, essentially we have been told our house is an indoor play area for children, but all four of us have been thriving ever since getting these (plus they are fun on occasion).  My son had some friends over and they were playing with everything, no biggie, it is what it is for. One of the boys was swinging in a door frame (think swing at a playground just in a door frame) another boy walked past him and got kicked and knocked to the ground. When I was dropping all of the boys off at their homes I informed his dad (answered the door) that he had gotten kicked in the chest by another boy while playing on the swings, got knocked to the ground, but he seemed fine. Dad told him he knows better than walking in front of the swings, but his mom heard and got mad at me for letting her son play outside when it is so cold. I told her that we had some inside equipment one of which was a doorframe swing. She made a group chat with all the other moms in it, and soon I was added to it and asked if they could see the equipment we had, I had them all over and showed them everything, what it does, and my daughter even demonstrated a bunch of it.   Most of the moms found it cool but 3 thought it was very irresponsible of me to have it in my house as these are outside things, so I am curious what others think.  Am I the asshole for having a bunch of outdoor equipment inside?	1642917245.0	saml3s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saml3s/aita_for_having_my_house_set_up_like_a_playground/	AITA for having my house set up like a playground?
ixgsx2u4	Hello Reddit! I just joined today because i was talking to a friend about this subject and they suggested this so.. Anyways onto the story.  So, my dads extremely temperamental and can get really loud at times, he yells at me a lot. And I mean a l o t. And he has since I can remember, its to the point to where I'm now terrified of loud noises, thunderstorms are like hell. Because of this I recently confronted him about this, I told him "please find a different form of speaking to me when you're mad, its at least slightly traumatizing me.." he didnt flip out, he more so just got aggravated. He told me I had no trauma and he was raised like this and he turned out fine so I'm not being traumatized, then sent me to my room I'm kinda shaken up about it and just have to know...AITA?

38cyr5gb	My (40f) cousin (41m) Joe and I were raised together by my parents.  We were more like brother : sister/best friends (same friends, same interests…etc.   However there is still a part of him that always irritated me and that’s that he is a hound.  Joe is always flirting and trying to pick up women everywhere we go.  He would try to pick up on my friends, my employees, my superiors, my customers… basically any woman in any place we would be at the same time, even while in a relationship.   About a year ago, he started dating a very sweet, very successful woman who is a saint. However he still has not changed his ways.  Around Christmas he told me he was going to propose to his girlfriend. He swore to me that he loved her and would be faithful.  I was happy for him.  Then my closest friend (m45) called me and told me that he just discovered that his girlfriend was having an affair with Joe.  I called Joe but he ignored my calls and texts.   That night he posted on Facebook that he was engaged.    A week goes by and my cousin Joe still doesn’t call or text me back.   Then I get a Facebook message request from some strange woman asking how I know Joe since his public FB showed me tagged in tons of photos.  Apparently Joe has been sending her unsolicited messages as recently as the evening he proposed and she thought i might be his wife or something.  Nasty, horrible things I can’t unsee.   Joe finally calls me and says I’m being a petty asshole for not being the first to congratulate him and his fiancé.  I told him why and now I’m apparently the asshole for not putting family before my friend (that he cuckolded) and the internet stranger.   So AITA?

hnfs186u	Me (19F) and my boyfriend (21M) have been together for a couple years and had begun to discuss our future together. We had ended up moving in together with his mother for the time being. (There’s another post I made about his mother a while ago, but I wanted to also write this)  I had grown up in a small town with 3 younger siblings, and during high school my parents began fostering a baby girl, J, (for privacy reasons I’m using the first letter in her name). I know for a fact that my parents are wonderful and living towards her, especially my dad.   Truth is, I’m not biologically related to my father. My mom had ended up getting pregnant with her now ex and when he found out, had told her to get an abortion and that he “didn’t want to be with a woman who has a kid before they got married”. Long story short my mother was devastated, but she knew she didn’t want to get rid of me. She had ended up staying with her parents and gave birth to me while living under their roof.   Eventually she earned enough money to both take care of me as well as have enough to support a rented apartment. Her life was coming back together, and one of her best friends ended up have her meet a man, which, you guessed it, became my father. They fell in love and ended up getting married by the time I was 2 years old. My dad always told me the story about how he asked me permission to ask my mother to marry him.  My parents never hid the fact that I wasn’t biologically related to my dad, and I didn’t care. Throughout my entire life he was my dad and to this day, he still is. There were even times where one of us would even forget that I wasn’t biologically related and would laugh when it got pointed out that we had forgotten. I love him as a father and I always will.  Fast forward to today. I am a grown adult and I would like to begin my journey into the “real world”. I started to become curious about who my biologically father was, so I reached out to my mom and asked her if she had any contact information I could go off of to even try to talk to him.  She told me that I was “ungrateful for the family that I have” and that I “wouldn’t need to contact him because he wouldn’t want to talk”. I’m used to my mom coming to conclusions very quickly until it is explained to her, however this time she didn’t want to listen to me. I told her that I was a grown adult, and I just wanted to know who he was, but she ended up hanging up and telling me that I was once again being ungrateful for my family.

14hswj	Yes, the title is a bit insane, but let me preface–I recently moved to another state to live with my father, due to my failing health (kidney issues). I had to essentially pack just the clothing on my back and other essentials due to my lack of funds and resources to move all of my items. I have (well, had) an extensive book collection that I was very proud of, a collection that I spent a lot of time and money accumulating. I couldn’t bring them all with me, so I had them boxed with t he intent of placing them into storage. I put them in a specific bin, and informed my mother that these books were to go into storage.   On my second day of arriving in the new state, I have a medical emergency and I end up hospitalized. I’m here a week and Mom finds out and drives to come see me after finding out. She’s worried and fussing over me, usual mom things. I’m genuinely happy to see her. She starts updating me on what’s been going on back in my home state, and then she goes:  “I nearly broke my back taking all of those books to the library!”  Me, confused, immediately asks her what she means. She continues by saying “That bin of books you left behind! You said you wanted to donate them! I don’t know why, you had such a huge collection, but I took them to the library.”  Now, I’m already not in the best state of mind. I’m hospitalized and currently hooked up to a dialysis machine so I can’t freak out, but I am immediately in tears. I entrusted her with thousands of dollars worth of hardcover novels and as soon as they’re out of my sight? They’re given away. I was willing to just sit and cry, but the next thing she said got a rise out of me.   “They’re just books! Get over yourself, I lost things in a fire years ago. You should’ve marked them as ‘do not donate’ or something.”  The utter lack of remorse for mishandling something so important to me just..made me snap at her. I demanded she leave my hospital room and not come to see me at all for the duration of my stay. She called me many things from ungrateful to selfish, but I just can’t bear to look at her right now.

dwc3yx81	My partner (28m) and I (28f) always take a vacation to a snowier area in January with my parents (60ish) and have for the past 10 years. After my sister (26f) got married, my parents have had a permanent and open invitation for my sister's in-laws to join us.   I have been with my partner for 5 years now, and his family has never been invited to join. When I ask why, my mom always uses an excuse like "there's a language barrier" or "they don't like the games we play" (my partner's parents are Chinese immigrants so English is not their first language). I don't understand this because his parents have come to many big holiday events over the years with us and had a great time.  This year I said I'd had enough of them being excluded, we both made enough now to afford it this time, and wanted to bring our dog, so we booked separate accomodations for ourselves so as not to burden my parents with more guests that their reservation didn't fit well while still staying near their resort, and all was well despite my mom's skepticism.  The weather in our snowy destination had record snowfall (4ft in 24 hours) and every mountain pass to get there closed 3 days before we would need to leave. This led to our reservation being cancelled by the site automatically. Because it was too late to board our dog, this meant my partner's parents would be the only option to watch him if my partner and I still tried to go as usual and share my mom's reservation.  When I told my mom we wouldn't be coming, she blew a gasket saying I was being too sensitive. I tried explaining that it seemed rude to me to inform my partner's parents that not only could they not come, but would be needed to watch our dog while my partner and I went without them. She has held her ground saying that I'm rocking the boat with all this change and should have just gone with them regardless because of the tradition.

7dtua2vj	My bf thinks because I came home and showered right after work that I was up to funny business because he saw my clothes were on the floor of our bedroom and not in the bathroom with me. No need for back story but I do nothing with my life, my life is home here with him all day everyday aside from work. I work twenty minutes away and that’s my commute to and from work so I am on a routine schedule. We also have ring cameras which he happened to unsubscribe to which he mentioned when he accused me of such act so I didn’t even know they were not recording anymore until I tried to tell him to check the ring app to see when I got home. Not only that but to see how distraught and awful I looked as I hadn’t showered that morning like I wanted to because I overslept and when I look like a mess it really shows. I have been nothing but angry and sad and he spent the past 48 hours accusing me of something completely made up. I don’t want to hear couple counseling . Am I the freaking asshole here? I understand communicating your doubts is inevitable but he took it a little far where I went through every call log and history on my work laptop to show time stamps of my work and when I was calling people on my work cell like engineers or customers. He checked my panties while I was in the shower and told me and also told me he told his friends because he was talking to them about it all day while at work, while not talking to me. He said they were wet and they were sweaty and I was so embarrassed by everything and freaking out I stripped naked to show him I always sweats specially because I have anxiety and like probably a sweat problem dude idfk. I was humiliated. Before he came home from work, before this blowout where I stripped down , I went food shopping and ran errands for us to get out of the house and get shit done because he was barely speaking to me and I wasn’t going to keep talking to him. Fuck that I didn’t do anything. I actually been doing nothing but shit for us. When I came home from errands the ambulances were outside our house. My heart sank I thought it was for one of our animals, because he had to have gotten home no more than an hour before so my first thought was something happened to a neighbor and then what if it’s my dog. He had such a panic attack about this situation he made up he got lightheaded and threw up and didn’t call or text me just called for an ambulance. AITA? This is the craziest most out of the blue situation like this is because I showered after work. I also work full time and I’m fucking exhausted. This is not how I wanted to spend my free time. I’m sick to my stomach and it all ended with him saying come here (hug) I believe you.

h7iu4j25	I (17F) purchased tickets for The Trinity of Terror for my Coworker(23F) and I. My coworker was the one who discovered the concert was coming to town and insisted that we should go. So I said sure and said I could buy the tickets if she paid me back. She agreed and agreed on the set price for paying me back (no interest, just flat pay back even if she paid me closer to the time of the concert December > March) She has been assuring me for the last month that she will soon pay me back, I had complete faith that she would, she has been nothing but nice to me and seemed trustworthy. Two days ago she asked for me to send her the ticket in which I replied “Hey sorry I would but I’m not comfortable sending it without having gotten any money for it” and from then on she told me she found cheaper tickets and would rather get them cheaper even though I had already paid for them a month ago. I told her that if she wants to do that it’s fine but that I would  no longer like to go to the concert with her and that I felt like she betrayed my trust in our friendship. She insists that I can just sell it but of course I’ll get no resale value. And I explained all this to her (in a nice calm way, having asked a friend if I sounded mean at all before I sent any texts, because I don’t like to cause fights). I explained myself and she again replied saying basically everything the exact same way a second time, twisting my words saying I never told her the amount of the tickets, saying I bought the tickets without asking her and basically saying I shouldn’t be mad. Also I have to work with her my entire shift tomorrow at work lol so this might be a bit awkward  AITA for disinviting her from going to the concert with me (she doesn’t drive, so I would have had to) and is it my right to be annoyed about her having broken my trust in our friendship?   TLDR: bought ticket for friend, she said she would pay me back and reassured me multiple times over the last month. Finally yesterday she asked for the ticket, didn’t send it because she didn’t give me my money and she said she’ll find a cheaper ticket, that she never knew the price, and I bought the ticket without telling her, which is completely untrue	1642917835.0	samr3d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/samr3d/aita_for_buying_a_concert_ticket_for_my_friend/	AITA for buying a concert ticket for my “friend” and her not paying me back?
ixcr2we6	My (22m) father (50s) was a piece of shit to me growing up. He was always angry, snappy and annoyed, and nothing was ever good enough for him, and I don't care to share certain things he did. He did love my sister (18f) quite a bit though. Me, my sister and my mom (48) are quite close but I haven't spoken to my dad since I was 18.  I was in my (shared) apartment today when I get a call from my sister. I couldn't even ask what she needed before she started breaking down saying dad's colon cancer had deteriorated to the point he would be dying soon. I said that I felt bad for her and asked her how long "soon" was. She said a few months. I said do you want to talk it out. She said dad wants to talk it out. I asked her if she was implying I come see dad. She said yes he wants to see you, and mom wants to see you together. I said I love you but that is something I will never do. She asked again, I said no I am really sorry but you know I would never want to see him. She hung up on me and didn't answer any of my calls.   My room mate (23f) over heard and said I should go or it will bother me for the rest of my life. I said no it won't I don't need to be the one to see the bastard of to hell, I'm just happy knowing he's going there. She said your happy hes dying???? I said yes, he deserves to die. She told me to stop being emotional and think about what I was really saying, and I am starting to think that I should go and visit for the sake of my mother and sister, so that they can be happy.

ixhqxz04	Prefacing this post by acknowledging that it probably sounds a little weird, but that's sort of the crux of this issue.  Last week I (20F) and my boyfriend (22M) were spending the night in the airport before a flight. We were there for a considerable amount of time (9hrs) so we both obviously used the bathroom a few times each. I had already been into the women's bathrooms twice and didn't notice anything at all out of place in there when my boyfriend went to use the bathroom for the first time around 2am. When he came back, he told me, "They're selling vibrating c\*ck rings in there!" I laughed because I thought he was joking, he has a good sense of humor and makes jokes a lot. He then said, "No, seriously, there's a vending machine that's selling vibrating c\*ck rings in the bathroom." I was pretty skeptical because, seriously, there's a s\*x toy vending machine in the airport bathrooms that you just discovered at 2am? I thought he was playing a prank to make our wait more fun. I replied that sure there was and laughed a little more because I did find the story funny in its absurdity. There weren't any vending machines in the women's bathroom apart from the permanent metal ones on the wall that dispense tampons, which you find in almost every bathroom. He got indignant and said that he would take a picture of it the next time he went to the bathroom. I said okay and we went back to watching a video and I mostly forgot about it. In maybe an hour or two he went to the bathroom again and this time he took a picture of the machine. My jaw dropped because I really honestly thought he had been pulling a joke on me with how outlandish it had sounded. I said oh my god, you were serious, there really is that sort of thing in there, I'm so sorry for doubting you. We laughed about it some more and then it got totally forgotten while watching videos and preparing for the flight.  Fast forward to now, tonight he said he is still upset with me for not believing him when he said he was serious. He brought up the point that he is my boyfriend and it was upsetting that I didn't trust what he said. Now I'm feeling a little torn. I feel justified in thinking it was a prank, but at the same time I can see where he's coming from. I would be hurt too if I told him about something I saw and he laughed and didn't take me seriously.

c00fh2u5	My boyfriend and I have been together for several years. Last year, we went skiing together maybe 7 or 8 times total (we lived near a ski mountain). This year, we have been 3 times, and are hoping to go probably at least 6 more times. I am also skiing with my family for a week at a ski mountain for vacation.   Last year, me and him went to buy ski boots together. Mine ended up being absolutely horrible and so ill fitting that I had to stop wearing them. They cost 800 dollars. Since that bad experience, I have just continued renting my boots and skis.  Lately, he’s been making passive aggressive comments every time we go to the mountain, about how he’s tired of waiting on me. This place is really fast and getting rentals takes 15 minutes, and it’s 5 min or less to return them. Tonight, while we were just sitting around, he started saying “you need to get boots and skis soon” and I said I would soon, when I was ready to go and get boots fitted and all that.   He started raising his voice, saying that I spent so much money on rentals that I could DEFINITELY buy boots and skis (over 1000 dollars for both), and that it didn’t make any sense, and I needed to do it because he’s tired of waiting on me. I started getting defensive and told him that he’s not allowed to get angry at me for not immediately agreeing to drop over 1000 dollars, since it’s my money and it’s really not a big deal for him to wait 15 min. He said fine, I’ll just go off and ski for those 15 minutes then. I said that was fine but it was a bit ridiculous to not wait for me for that short amount of time. I said he’s not allowed to just tell me what to do with my money and get mad when I don’t comply. He replied saying that I’m actually controlling HIM by limiting his time by not buying boots and skis. I was so frustrated at this point that I said I was done and it was a ridiculous conversation.

ixhbqyve	Throwaway. There was this guy(22M) who I(20F) have gone on a few dates with in the past couple of months. He's nice and so far we've only progressed to going on public dates, but about a week ago we finally decided to have a nice date at my place. Since it was going to be at my place I let him know before that I was on my period because I wasn't sure what expectations he had or where his boundaries were yet, and we agreed to just have a nice takeout dinner and watch a movie.  He comes over and we eat then sit down on the couch to pick a movie when he says that it sucked that I was on my period Then he said how he thought it was so strange that women give birth through the vagina but have periods from their butts. I asked him what he meant by that and he said again exactly what he had said before. I kind of smiled, assuming he was very much just joking, and said "oh yeah, so weird" thinking that he was going to start laughing soon to end the joke. He didn't, and instead started to talk about his first and only girlfriend he'd had in high school and how she used to complain about bad "period poops" all the time. At this point I ask him if he is being serious and he looks a little confused and says he is.  I ask him to explain how he came to that conclusion and he explained that his first experience being around periods was the hs gf and before then he had never received or seen much information. He understood it was something that happened inside the body and that blood came out "somewhere" but assumed it came out of the vagina until he heard her complaining and realized it actually came out of the butt. It was very unexpected coming from a 22 year old man. I somehow managed to keep my composure when I told him that periods do in fact come out of the vagina and not butts.  He looked confused and then a little frustrated and started insisting to me that was wrong and then kept saying "are you sure?" after I continued to insist. I explained to him the anatomy a bit and how it worked but he was very adamant. Eventually he conceded that most women must have periods like that, but some, hence his ex-gf, have their periods form their butts. He just could not understand no matter how many times I tried to explain it to him that he had just simply come to the wrong conclusion and misinterpreted his gf's words. The whole situation became so much that I started to laugh. I was doubled over, clutching my stomach, crying laughing over this whole debacle, and he sat there red-faced, continuing to try and argue with me. Eventually he said he was ready to leave and did before we could watch a movie. I felt bad for laughing after he left because I could tell that had been when he decided to leave and he also texted me later that night to say he had done a little bit of research "on his own" and that he was no longer interested in pursuing any sort of relationship because he couldn't stand to be with someone who laughed at someone for "not understanding".

bfq9gby5	  Some backround info, I'm a 15yo female, who doesn't usually wear traditional female clothes. My mother is very uptight about thise kinds of things, and is always telling me what to wear.       So today, we were about to go to my brother's basketball game, and I put on my favorite beanie, which I wear often, especially because it's cold where I live. My mom HATES this beanie, but hasn't really gotten super mad over it, just annoyed. But this time, she comes over to me, and starts demanding that I shouldn't wear my beanie, without giving a specific reason.       When I ask why, she just starts giving me a lecture on how I am hiding behind the beanie, and I need to show my "true" self. I then tell her that it's only a hat that I like,    and that it's cold out, she then takes away my phone, and said that she wouldn't give it back until I show my " true self"      This keeps going back and forth, until it's turned into a loud argument.         The after about ten minutes, she saids that I won, and that I would never be my true self without her help, then gives my phone back and calls me an asshole.          Right then, I snap, and tell her that her logic is flawed, and that I should be allowed to wear what I want, and that I'm tired of her nagging. Ever since I said that, we haven't been talking and I wore the beanie to the game.

ixi3wccs	I (17m) have had the worst past 2 years of my life, got dumped, lost my job, got arrested, lost my license,lost my grandparents and great grandparents, lost 3 of my closest friends, I got held up, I took it all with no complaint while helping my best friend (19m) through all of his problems, I help him with his taxes, I helped him get away from his ex (who was crazy, his words not mine) got him into a new friend group, have spent days alone in the rain fixing his cars that he said he was gonna fix, I've given him well over $2,000 aswell as all of my Christmas money, work 2, 16 hour days back to back to come over and help him instead of going to bed then went to work on no sleep again when he doesn't even do that for me, I have even violated my probation terms twice for him, well I found out him and my cousin had been seeing each other about 3 months ago (they had been together 8months at this point in secret, during these 8 months which he stopped talking to me unless he needed something), and I was upset, but ok with it even though I had found out on accident and they hadn't told me, more recently the past month she has been pushing me out of his life entirely and has gotten him into 3k dollars in debt, I got him financial aid, and advice got him down to 2k, here's the problem, I found out he got her pregnant, and he has come to me to ask for help and I told him he's on his own, I told him I will not give any advice or any cash, and that I will not watch after the child as I have to iron out my own life right now, she then asked me to be the godfather which I declined aswell. She then proceeded to try to talk me into giving them some of my cash, and basically told me if I wanted to be apart of "their" life that I had to help with the kid (which my friend did not agree with but she forced him into agreeing) to which I looked at them and told them they can fk right off if they think I'm gonna do either and walked out of the house after telling them both to figure their shit out cuz I can't, after chasing me outside she then said I was being arrogant, narcissistic and a complete asshole to which I replied if she didn't fk everyone maybe she wouldn't be pregnant and stuck in this situation and maybe if he had been a bit smarter he wouldn't have gotten with you and stormed off..  EDIT: I forgot to mention that she and him had also said that I don't do enough to help them/fix their situation shortly before they had mentioned that I had to help out to stay apart of their life*	1642920299.0	sanf3g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanf3g/aita_for_telling_my_friend_hes_on_his_own_and/	AITA for telling my friend he's on his own and talking to them in this manner?
emz8y1o7	I am seeing someone from the past 6 months. The past month or so has been exceptionally hard on him with the loss of a family member, his health getting bad and his another family member having gone through a minor accident. He is also noticeably stressed at work because of the amount he works and the amount of work he has.  From the start of this month he has been complaining about random palpitations and chest pain while I know palpitations are mostly due to anxiety, I was still worried and asked him to get himself checked.  Yesterday night just before we were supposed to get on a call he tells me he is feeling uneasy and having palpitations again. I told him he's just anxious and to distract himself by watching something. He replies with "I should be fine" and that's the last thing he sends.   I don't think of it for a while as I get busy on call with my bestfriend. It's really late at night and I text him asking if he's okay. I realise I haven't heard back from him at all. I have very bad anxiety and now my anxiety is at an all time high.  I wouldn't have been so anxious had his palpitation been a one off thing but he's been complaining about uneasiness and fatigue almost all this month. That coupled with all the stress he has been through sent my already anxious brain into a overdrive. I kept calling him hoping he was just asleep and would cut my call and I would know he was okay.  But no such thing happened. I try to get some sleep but it was like my brain was keeping me awake because I would have involuntary jerks keeping me awake. I try to reach to him and did call him a lot of times which is why I could be an asshole.  He finally cuts my call at around 6am and let's me know he's okay. I called him today afternoon and he told me I was selfish to keep calling him. I understand where I could have been the asshole but I have bad anxiety and I just couldn't think rationally.

6m26sr4g	Both me and my sister are visiting my parents for a few weeks. Earlier today, my sister wanted to borrow my SUV. She was going shopping and needed room for everything she was going to buy. Her smaller car couldn't fit everything so I said she could borrow my car. She then insisted that I take her car keys in case I needed to go somewhere while she was borrowing my car.   Later on in the evening, I was watching UFC 270 (Mixed Martial Arts with a very important main even matchup that fans have been anticipating for half a year at this point). I paid 75 dollars to watch these fights. After the third out of five fights, I ran down to the kitchen in between breaks to get something to drink. My sister asked for her car keys so she could get something from her car. I told her I am in the middle of watching some important fights and as soon as the fights are over, I would leave her keys outside her bedroom. She agreed.   Ultimately I go back to my room, and in the middle of the main event (fifth and final fight), my sister starts banging on my door as loud as humanely possible. I told her I will give you the keys after the fight. She however kept insisting that I give them to her now. She kept knocking and I told her 5-6 times that I will give you the keys in the next 10-15 minutes once the fight is wrapped up. At this point, I am thoroughly distracted and not ever focusing on the fight. Once the fight is over, I grab her keys from my pants in the closet, go to her room and underhand toss the keys on the bed. Then I went off on her and called her a "F\*\*\*ing B\*tch" maybe a half dozen times while pointing at her and leave. She then texts me like 10 times saying I ruined her trip and its all my fault and I have no right to be abusive like that and I will regret talking to her that way.   As siblings we always used to fight. Nothing more malicious than your average sibling fights. We are in our late 20s now and probably haven't fought in half a decade. Am I the asshole for talking/treating her that way? If I am at fault, I will own up to it. I just think it was messed up that I told her I was watching some important fights and she began knocking very loudly and rudely on my door in the middle of the fight.	1642922137.0	sanwjh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sanwjh/aita_for_cussing_out_my_sister/	AITA for cussing out my sister
ixhnxbqy	I am a single dad with 2 kids. I have Kylie (12) and Kaydence (8). Kylie's mom is not in the picture at all and has never been.   Kaydence goes to her mom's house from Monday afternoon to Wednesday morning every week. The rest of the time she is with me.   I have a routine with my girls. Every day, right after school I make healthy snacks and we sit down together to do homework. I help them if they have any questions and they help each other, as well.   There are 3 reasons why we work on it right after school. Firstly, they are working on it while school is still fresh in their minds. Secondly, it's so much easier to get done if there is a pattern and routine. Third, getting it done earlier gets it out of the way so they can relax and don't have to stress about homework later.  I was checking my daughters' grades and noticed that Kaydence's math grade had been slipping. It had gone from an A to a B to a C. I'm not the type of dad who is super strict about grades. I'm not going to be upset with my kid as long as they are trying. The grades dropping just concerned because it was unlike Kaydence who has always been really good at math. If she is struggling with something I should know what it is so I had help her.  I called her teacher to see if there was something she was struggling with. She explained that Kaydence hasn't been turning in Monday night's homework or Tuesday night's homework.   I asked Kaydence why she hadn't been doing her homework at her mom's house. She said that her mom doesn't care if she gets her homework done or not so she doesn't do it. I asked her to please do her homework. Even though her mom doesn't care its still important that it gets done.  Last Monday I called my ex and asked her if Kaydence had done her homework. She said that in her house Kaydence has the choice of whether or not she wants to do homework. She also said that she doesn't believe in homework because all school work should be done in school. I told her that I agreed but if Kaydence keeps skipping homework her grade is going to continue to get worse. She told me not to comment on her parenting choices and that I have no say on anything concerning our child on her days.  Tuesday night , I called my ex again and asked to speak to my daughter. I just gave Kaydence a reminder to get her homework done. Like five minutes later my ex calls me back screaming at me. She said "you have no right trying to parent her while she is at my house. You are majorly overstepping your boundaries even after I told you how I felt"  I understand that it's her day but I am concerned about my child.	1642922855.0	sao2wl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sao2wl/aita_for_calling_my_ex_to_make_sure_our_kid_is/	AITA for calling my ex to make sure our kid is doing homework?
9gt9mpe1	So here’s the idea. Me (20 m) and my best friend (18 f) have been friends since we were in the 7th and 8th grade, so almost 8 years now. We’ve always done things together and anytime either of us have needed something we knew the other would be there. When my friend’s grandpa passed away I was there through all of it. I’m usually the friend people go to to either 1.) talk about things or 2.) just let them forget about hard stuff for awhile and plan something goofy and fun to get their mind off of it. Ever since she met her bf (17 m) things have been a little different though. She met him when she was in high school (we all went to the same high school) and I knew him well. I helped him on his journey to coming out and being comfortable as a trans man. I even helped him express himself TO my friend, and talked to her about if she had feelings it didn’t mean she had to label anything about it. Anyway, they’ve been together for awhile now, and recently for my 20th birthday party I was planning to have her over to my house to celebrate with me and my family (I’m not a big partier, just small groups of friends when I do). She texted me the day before and asked if she could bring her bf out to eat with us. I said I wasn’t comfortable with that because my parents were paying and we aren’t exactly well-off, and I liked her bf but I didn’t know him super well. I kinda wanted it to just be her and me and my family like things usually were. There have also been other situations with our group of friends where we’ve been trying to hang out and she brings her bf along, even when it’s supposed to be just our group and we agree not to bring partners. Ever since I said no she’s been blowing off calls, texts, leaving me on read. I had thought maybe I did something so I texted her and said I appreciated her and loved her and I’m sorry if I did something wrong. She replied by saying she didn’t know how to respond to that. I then talked to my parents about this whole thing, and they were like “Yeah, it sounds like you don’t want to hang out with her boyfriend and her.” And I said I don’t. I don’t like being a third wheel— and I’ve never invited her or anyone else to be a third wheel when I’m with my boyfriend. I either have plans with him, plans with my friends or occasionally the whole group will get together and have a party with partners included. I tried texted her bf too— to see what’s up and if we could talk, and he left me on read too. This is her first boyfriend and I get wanting to be with them, but I think it’s unhealthy to not have a good partner/friend balance. But everyone in my life says I should just get used to him being there and being the third wheel because that’s how relationships are.

80tbw4c2	Hello all,  My dad was hit by a car while walking on a break at work on December 1st. He didn't do anything wrong, was using the crosswalk, trying to be healthy as he has done daily since becoming a grandpa, to have "longevity with his grandkids" as he told me. The driver was at fault. My dad was a sweet, innocent victim. My dad now has a traumatic brain injury, and has never left the hospital since. For the first month, he was sedated and intubated. We couldn't even communicate with him. Now he whispers, but a lot of it is nonsensical. My dad is my best friend and I have always spent three out of seven days per week with him, even adulthood. I love him immensely and he is the best, most kind person I know. I have routinely posted updates on social media, and my family is aware of his condition.  I have an in law who is a former addict that relapsed during all of this. The partner of this in-law, who is a self proclaimed "motivational speaker," just posted on Instagram the following quote:   "Sometimes you get slammed by the traffic in life. Every fear, every thought, get to the median. This is where the peace is."  The action I took is that I messaged this in law and told them that this post was tone deaf, ignorant, in poor taste, and very hurtful to my family members who could see it. I further criticized their ability to be a "motivational speaker" if they don't know how to speak about their trauma and need to compare it to being hit by a car to make people comprehend what they were saying. This person defended what they said, and told me the comparison was helpful to them with what they are going through as the supporting spouse of an addict, and that they were going to stand by it, despite my pain and being close to me.  The addict theirself messaged me and told me I am selfish for calling out their partner's post, and that I need to worry about myself before calling out their partner.  I have been trained in my profession to never compare traumas, that each trauma is different, and to never tell people that "I understand." Because you can't compare being the spouse of an addict, although very traumatic, to someone who has been intubated, sedated, and on a feeding tube. I wouldn't want to be in this person's position either, and my heart breaks for them.  I feel for this person, I really do, but AITA for trying to tell them that it was wrong to publicly compare their trauma to something very real, auto vs. peds, that kills 40k people in the U.S. every single year? Am I selfish for calling this person out on the very irrelevant comparison?	1642923787.0	saobdb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saobdb/aita_my_dad_just_got_hit_by_a_car_and_is_still/	AITA: My dad just got hit by a car and is still hospitalized.

ihwjbn8j	My (17x) dad (43m) has dated his awful girlfriend (48f) on-and-off for about a decade. I'll call her Georgia. She also has a horribly entitled son (13m) who I will call Leroy. My dad has broken up with Georgia a few times, but always gets back together.  A few months ago, I had a therapy session with my dad, my older sister (19f), and Georgia. Leroy wasn't there, but he was still relevant to the conversation. My dad required that my older sister and I each type a document detailing the abuse we've endured from Georgia and Leroy over the years. I had repressed a lot of memories, so I had to purposefully trigger myself to regain those memories so I could type them up. Even with my best efforts, I couldn't remember everything, but I don't think I would have been able to handle remembering much more anyway. It was extremely mentally and emotionally draining. I was beyond distressed.  The time came for us to have the therapy session, and at one point I had to leave the room to cry, which they are aware of. I was shaking excessively throughout the therapy session and felt somewhat nauseous. I was noticeably fidgety. My sister and I made it clear that at this point our dad was making a choice: Georgia or us.  At the end of the therapy session, my dad decided we were more important than Georgia. Georgia begged my dad to stay so he could financially support her (not surprising) but he refused. My sister and I were finally hopeful. I thought it was finally over. The therapist told my dad that we're counting on him, and that he can't keep breaking up with her only to return to her afterwards. It's not fair to us.  I guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up, because I recently discovered that he's dating her again. I wish I could say I'm surprised, but I'm really not. I feel hurt and betrayed. My dad knows of some of the things that Georgia and Leroy have done to me, yet still chose them. I did not relive years of trauma and panic and cry just so he could say "she's changed" for the millionth time.  My dad has been coming to my mom's house on the weekends to visit my sister and I for the past few months. I just can't face him. I don't have the words to describe how upset I am. I want a good relationship with my dad, but I just can't do it. I'm just so done with him.  My mom says that she understands that I feel betrayed by him, but I shouldn't just ignore him. He's my dad, and as long as Georgia isn't present, I should be willing to spend time with him. Even my paternal grandparents, who were never supportive of his relationship with Georgia, think they should be given another chance because they're going to church now (I'm not religious, so this doesn't matter to me). My sister also feels betrayed by him, but even she thinks it's excessive and immature to ignore dad over this.

d6a9dpfp	I (female, 20) recently moved out of a house that I rented with some housemates from school(all 20 year olds). I moved out due to financial issues and because one of my housemates(let’s call her D) was being controlling af. When we first moved in D asked if she could leave her dog there while she goes to school for a few hours. We agreed even though it is strictly against the rules in the contract because she had told us that the dog had previously been abused by the people who were supposed to take care of her. We agreed to let the dog stay for a few hours. However, eventually D started leaving the dog from 7am to 10 pm everyday, including weekends. Then another housemate who we’ll call S got a dog unexpectedly. I woke up one morning to a text asking if I could take care of the dog for her(which her bf got without consulting her first or without thinking of the fact that there was another dog already in the house). I agreed but when he arrived I was shocked because the dog is a husky. During the next months the dogs messed up a lot of stuff in the house. They were constantly eating my food, and also tore apart our couches and constantly made a mess. The color of the carpet in the living room changed from light gray to a weird tan-ish green color. The husky also completely tore the screen door of the backyard, and constantly makes a mess out of the bathroom by scattering the bathroom trash all over the floor .The house reeked of dog and the housemates constantly woke me up (sometimes at like 3 or 4 am )because they were yelling at their dogs. When I was planning to move out, We had agreed on me paying half of the next month of rent since I would only have my things there for 2 weeks, they agreed to cover the rest. Two days later,  I am already in my hometown (3 hours away) for the holidays with my parents, they message me and tell me that I need to come and move everything out by the end of December.. Basically they had a group chat without me in it, and Decided amongst themselves to kick me out sooner. They waited until I was with my parents 3 hours away to tell me about this. We drove down to the house on Christmas and  I took the majority of my things but I left some stuff because it did not all fit in my parent’s car. During the next few weeks the housemates kept threatening me to come get the rest of the stuff or they would throw it all out. They want to take away my part of the deposit for a few push pin holes that I left in my old room. They told me to fix it and I refused because the landlord and the contract states that it’s completely ok as long as it’s not large size holes. I also refused because my parents do not have time to wait while I fix the tiny holes. It’s not fair to them. Immediately housemate  D and housemate I got super aggressive  and told me not to say anything because they want their deposit back.It makes want to tell the landlords even more.	1642926922.0	sap49i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sap49i/aita_i_want_to_tell_the_landlord_about_my/	AITA: I want to tell the landlord about my housemate’s dogs even tho ik they’ll probably get kicked out.
3ys79dqn	My roommate and I have been living together for 2 years. She has two cats, I have one, but we've always just treated them all like they're both of our cats, except when it comes to big decisions and medical bills, for which we cover our own cats.  I'm in the process of moving out, but she's 5hrs away visiting a friend right now so I'm back every night feeding the cats (I haven't moved my cat to the new place yet cause I knew I'd be doing this and figured it'd be easier if they're all in the one place), and today I came back to find that one of her cats is a bit "off". He's usually a massive pig and hugely food motivated, but tonight he wasn't even phased when I arrived, even though it was after their usual dinner time, and when I put the food out he didn't even come into the room. I tried to offer him some dry food - nothing, then brought him into his room and showed him the dry food - he sniffed it and left, then I offered him treats and he actually gagged. He's not acting hugely different otherwise, but he's moving a little slowly and he keeps licking his lips and he's thrown up bile (there was vomit on the floor when I got home so I guess he's all empty now). I even dug through the vomit and fingered through the bile to make sure there was any blood or foreign items in it (all clear). He's fine to be picked up and kind of rag dolls when held (somewhat normal, but I'd still consider it a symptom).  Obviously my first instinct is to go straight to the vet, but my roommate isn't answering the phone so I can't get his vet file off her, and I also don't want to pay a consultation fee only for her to tell me she won't pay it back cause she didn't agree to take him (we're both dead broke right now so money has actually caused tension recently and I can see this happening), and I also don't want to take tomorrow off work to keep monitoring him because she isn't answering her phone to come home and take care of him. Don't get me wrong, I'd take a year off work to care for this little boy if it came to it, and if she responds and asks me to I'll do it, but I don't want to be forced to do it because she's decided not to use her phone on her trip.  My main question is, would I be the asshole for taking him to the vet and sticking her with the bill even if it turns out to be nothing?  TLDR: Roommate's cat is sick but she won't respond to texts or calls so I don't know whether to take him to the vet or just monitor him until she replies	1642928786.0	sapkhg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sapkhg/wibta_for_taking_my_roommates_cat_to_the_vet/	WIBTA for taking my roommate's cat to the vet
ixkqzkot	My mom (very very) recently decided to start own business. She signed the lease on the 8th of January and is expecting opening day to be February 1st. She wants a COMPLETE remodel, everything from a fresh coat of paint and new furniture to having to rewire the electricity. All in less than a month.  Don’t get me wrong, she is very good at what she does but she in an immigrant so her english is not amazing and she just doesn’t understand how things in America work sometimes. Obviously, she is my mom so I love to help her and see her become successful after coming to America with nothing but everyone in my family can agree she makes things 100 times more stressful than they need to be.  She has been putting all of the stress on me (18f) and my brother (19m) expecting us to do all the legal paperwork, a lot of the renovations, and general prep. Again, we LOVE to help our parents but expecting us to basically open this business alone in less than a month while we have our own worries like college, work, and a ton of persons stuff is not fair in my opinion.   After a ton of stress and arguments I booked a flight across the country to visit some family and friends without really thinking about it, Im leaving in a couple days so I wont be there for opening day. My mom won't even look at me and told me im selfish, lazy, and ungrateful. The more I think about it the more I regret booking the flight but I was so stressed out I couldnt sleep for two days straight and booked it without thinking how she would feel. She has a ton of people helping her and at this point I dont think my help is necessary.

gn86uu3e	 My (25f) partner (32m) recently invited one of his friends J to move in with us while J was having a rough time.   I have social anxiety so I’m pretty used to being left out of plans but it really does sting every time I hear my friends or family talk about all the stuff they didn’t even bother inviting me to.   So when J and his latest tinder date suggested a double date I wasn’t 100% comfortable but my partner accepted on our behalf. Then they tell me they want to go to this hipster pop-up place where you can’t book and sometimes queues can be longer than an hour.   I said I didn’t want to go somewhere so crowded, so my partner nodded and said ok. (I thought this meant we might go somewhere else.)  He tells me that evening that he’s sorry I won’t come but he’s going to go out with them and he’s bought me a microwave meal. I was too upset to go anywhere after that.   Later when he came back, he explained that he’s tired of always accommodating me and he didn’t think I would mind so much since I didn’t want to go anyway.   I tried explaining how embarrassing it was having the three of them come in laughing when I’ve been sitting alone and how it’s hurtful that I get left out when there are options I would have been more comfortable with.   The problem with crippling self-esteem issues is I can never tell the difference between being assertive and being an Ahole. Is it really too much to ask? Was I actually too demanding?

He isn't in a fraternity or anything, but he trusts that I would never leave him over some guy in a fraternity. (No hate to fraternities, majority of the guys I know are just gross so it's a personal distaste, some are super down to earth and cool!). This bugs him, which bugs me. I don't want him to worry about me doing something disloyal when I go out. No matter how intoxicated I am, I know my limits and I know my boundaries. I know part of this has to do with his insecurities because his ex was...not the best person to be in a relationship with. He told me he's working on his insecurities, but he still gets upset whenever I go out. Should I stop? I'm trying to put myself in his shoes but it's hard because I trust myself 100% that I would NEVER hurt him. I just wanted to know AITA for not understanding why my boyfriend gets upset that I go out?	1642933400.0	saqonj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqonj/aita_for_going_out_when_it_worries_my_so/	AITA For Going Out, When It Worries My SO?
e4h8fdqv	Throwaway and all that…  My family takes occasional trips together.   When we do older sister (40) tends to pay for the place that we stay.  She has a belief that as the oldest she should pay and refuses to split cost with me (33f). It’s generous of her. However the downside is she always books it so that I share a room with my mom who snores really loudly, and is really difficult to share a room with because she will make a lot of noise and stay up until midnight or one am with the lights on without much consideration for me trying to sleep.  I also have a kind of complex relationship with my mom where she tests boundaries and is hurt if I ask her not to do something so I find it best to keep a bit of space.  I also just feel like I’m in my mid-30s and don’t really want  to share a room with anyone.   After our last group trip 3-4 years ago where I was sleep deprived and miserable I decided I wouldn’t do it anymore and would get my own place nearby.  We have an upcoming trip for a family function (I know, not a great time to be traveling but it’s for a memorial and unavoidable).   My sister booked the place and I told her I was going to get a place nearby as I couldn’t share with mom anymore.  She was really understanding and offered to switch rooms around and have her BF sleep on couch so we could share or have her stay with mom but I don’t want to do that to them.  She said she understood but I think she was a bit offended and my mom definitely was.

lvdvii9	Hey everyone! I am almost done with my driver's lessons. I am currently waiting for my instructor to tell me a date when I will hold my practical exam. Since this will be probably in one or two weeks, I have recently started looking for car models. I chose a few models which are cheap, small and look good. You can understand that I don't know much about cars so I spoke about this with my parents and my uncle as he is knowledgeable about cars. We finally concluded with a certain model of car.  The issue started today. While we were having breakfast at home, my mom brought up the car topic and asked me if I was certain that I want my own car. I told her that I am 100% sure. She told me that now all the financial resources go to my prom (I am finishing high school this year and in my country, we have the tradition to celebrate prom at school and a family prom outside of school) and it would be hard for them to afford a car for me. I told her to stay reassured because I wanted to pay for my car. I have participated in many competitions at school so I had a decent amount of money. I explained that I chose the car model based on the money I had. She then suggested that I could drive my dad's car for a while until they have the financial opportunity to buy me one. I told her that this is unnecessary because first, I am scared to drive my dad's car since it is an SUV and I find small cars more suitable for myself and second, I already have enough money dedicated for this so why wouldn't I just pay and the issue would be solved.   Dad is our family's driver so he agreed with me. He said that if I didn't feel comfortable with driving a "big car" then I should have my own car in which I would be comfortable. My mom suddenly attacked my dad. She accused him of not giving me the car because he is selfish or whatsoever. I was like "mom, chill, it's not a big deal!" Then she started yelling at me because I was acting like a brat and if I bought the car myself, they would look like bad parents who can't provide for their child. Then I told her that it was no one's business who bought whose car. She then started yelling that we are trying to make her look like the bad parent and she was the only one who cared about our family. She said that she was the only one that made something for this family and she was the only one that worried about the state of our family.  I don't know why but she got upset and just stormed off to my grandparents' house. My dad and I were staying there stunned and genuinely didn't know what to say or do. I started feeling a bit guilty that I wanted a car. My dad stays at my side and even now tells me that it's completely okay for me to drive something that makes me comfortable. On the other hand, I really think I might be a brat and maybe try to understand my mom more since she is the one who engages with our family's finances.

fm84zer6	So, first of all i would like to apologize if i make any mistakes, english is not my first language and this is my first reddit contribution..  I'm a 20 year old male who is still studying and i still live with my mum. Last year around the same time i finaly got an awasome and loving girlfriend, after 5 years of me trying so much dating sites and one realy bad experience with one of my schoolmates sister i was realy thinking that i won't find anyone who would love me. I was deeply depresed and angry at myself, but I didnt show any of these feelings to anyone becouse im very shy and introverted. Then like a miracle i stumbled upon my now girlfriend, we chated for a couple of days and we decidet to meet. It was the best day of my life.  We walked randomly across town and just chated about anything that came to mind. Thats how i got to know that she is also introverted, and that she has anxiety and sometimes she can get panic atacks. But I realy didn't care i was just too happy and i still dont care, im just glad that i can be there for her to calm her down, which most of the time works. But now to the story you are all waiting for. My mom doesn't realy like her... Idk why, my girlfriend is trying her best to get my mum to like her, but she just wouldnt budge. So we were at my house when my girlfriend had such a big panick atack that even my presence (which is most of the time enough for her to calm down) and her medication combined didn't help her so i had to call an ambulence. It was midnight betwen sunday and monday so i had to go to school the next day but i said that I will go woth her to the hospital and wait there with her so I could take her home when they let her go(she lives about 50 km away from me and her parents couldnt take her, and I wouldnt make her go alone after that night)..... But my mum had a diffirent idea, she practicaly gave me an ultimatum that I would either stay home and go to school or I could look for a full time job becouse she would kick me out. So, I stayed. But it didnt end there, right after the ambulance left my mum gave me another ultimatum.... That my gf won't come to our house anymore, she didnt even explain why. So the rest of the night I just sat on my bed stresed out becouse this was the first time I had to call my gf ambulance (I was trying not to panic infront of her so it piled up) and I couldn't think off a way to spend more then a couple hours a week with my gf, becouse she lives with her whole family of 2 brothers and her parents in a realy small apartment. So I stayed awake thinking it all trough but I couldn't think about anything else then to just move out, which would mean that I quit school and start working some mundane job. Its been a week and I had multiple fights with my mum and grandmother about this and they even had the nerve to try to make me brake up with my gf at which point I just left and slept at my friends house, and now my whole family is mad at me for being disrespectful and rude. So am I the asshole ?	1642933912.0	saqt69	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saqt69/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_mum_for_trying_to/	AITA for being mad at my mum for trying to sabotage my relationship?
c6xi69i2	So I(17 NB) am the oldest of my mom's kids.For my entire life my mom has been struggling with substance abuse my entire life and for most of it I've always ignored it and defended my mom from anyone who spoke negative about her since I love my mom.From what I know she's relapsed 3 times and each time it messed me up,the second time it happened I caught her doing it but she acted like I didn't catch her(I was 14) and later that year I guess she passed out from heat stroke and my siblings and I had to move in with her mom so she could get help.Now the third time was after she had 88% recovered from the time I stated above,but this time I have no clue what happened to her,she just went down hill after hurting her back and I guess she kinda just gave up(I was 15/16) it broke my heart since i wanted to believe she finally was going to get it together and we could all be a happy family but I knew in a small place in my heart I knew this would happen again and it hurts thinking about it.Fast forwards to now,I haven't seen my mom since August 2022 and I had recently seen her on January 13th I believe after she came to see me .When she hugged me she noticed that I was now taller then she was and I could tell it hurt her feelings,I told her I loved her and she shortly left then after a few days I get a call from her mom that my mom checked into detox and was getting help. I got excited that she was getting help but I still can't shake the feeling she isn't gonna stay clean this time.

5ai56lfv	I live in a 3 bed, 1 bath house with two other people my age (24ish) and we're all college students. My parents own the house and my roommates pay rent & utilities to me, which I then send to my parents. This puts me in a semi-landlord position, my parents have final say but they're very hands-off.   &#x200B;  My roommate (24F) met this guy about a month ago and he's started coming over literally every day. He lives in some kind of frat-equivalent, so I think he lives with a lot of other people and not much space. She asked me if I was okay with him crashing here sometimes and I said sure, assuming that she meant 1-3x/week. But he's here every day. And that would be fine if he didn't shower and do his laundry here, and if she wasn't so inconvenient to live with. There's one bathroom in this house, and it's plenty crowded with the three of us using it. But with one more person it seems like I'm always having to wait around an hour to use the bathroom, and it's even harder to find a time when the laundry isn't being used.     She and the boy also like to cook, and they leave their leftovers out on the stove un-put-away for hours. I can't use the kitchen or cook anything during this time, and neither can the other roommate. She also uses my nice-quality nonstick pans and doesn't take care of them. I've reminded her at least 3 separate times to not put my pans in the dishwasher and to not use metal utensils on them, but she does it anyway. She has her own pans, so I'm not sure why she always uses mine, besides not having to treat them as nice because they're not hers. She then leaves the mountain of dishes they used to cook whatever fancy thing in the sink for days after.   &#x200B;  I also just don't like having this random guy over all the time. The house is pretty small, with a living/dining room, one bathroom, and our three bedrooms. There isn't really a place I can be in the house when he's here besides my bedroom. Idk, this might be the most unreasonable part, but I feel like if he's not paying rent to live here, he shouldn't get to be here 24/7.   &#x200B;  Idk, I don't think I'm being unreasonable with most of this. A lot of this just seems like common sense stuff not to do when you have roommates (try to not make your roommate's lives more inconvenient) but I guess she's lacking there. Would I be an asshole if I told her I don't want her boyfriend here all the time and told her to not use my pans anymore?	1642935158.0	sar4g2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar4g2/wibta_if_i_told_my_roommate_that_i_dont_want_her/	WIBTA If I told my roommate that I don't want her boyfriend over every day?
78megrik	We have a 16 month old who goes to sleep early during the week because daycare wears her out.  This couple in their 60’s, my husband considers like family, keep trying to come over on a week night.  First they tried when our daughter was waking up every 2 hours in the night and I just couldn’t mentally and physically deal with visitors of any kind. I was simply an empty egg shell, surviving the day. So I pretty much said sorry, I’m dead by the afternoon and it’s just a sh!t show in the evenings because tantrums. Guests and baby tantrums, no thanks.  Months later ie Today, she sleeps through the night. But during the week, she tends to sleep from 5pm because she’s so tired from daycare. I just never arrange things during the week because noise travels in our house even with the white noise machine.  My husband mentioned they want to come over on a week night after they finish work, ie 430pm/5ish so I voiced to him that’s frustrating because they can come anytime on a weekend. But he said they are busy on the weekends. And I’m just like not even 30 mins on a weekend?! They want to come during the week around that time and that’s that. So I never said no, I just thought and said out loud that is so frustrating and listed my reasons why.  My husband was offended- ie why can’t I just say yeah that’s fine if it means that much to him.  I honestly didn’t see a problem in me just sharing my thoughts but clearly I upset him.  AITA?  I feel bad for offending him. I know these people mean a lot to him. But I also wouldn’t impose my schedule on someone who has a baby or toddler, I’d work around what works best for them.	1642934897.0	sar1v4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sar1v4/aita_for_not_wanting_guests_over_on_a_week_night/	AITA for not wanting guests over on a week night?
8rgwipoz	My (24M) wife (24F) and I were talking earlier tonight and she brought up again an argument that we had about a year ago. It was a really silly argument, especially when I think of typing it out.   I have a pair of shorts that I have always thought were navy blue, 100%. She asked me where my brown shorts were, and I said I don’t have any brown shorts. She said yes, you know those dark brown shorts, and we went back and forth until eventually I got my shorts and she said “those ones!” And I laughed and said “Are you blind? These are blue!” Jokingly, I thought. And also they 100% did not look brown at all to me haha. Turns out me saying that in that way hurt her feelings. We ended up taking the shorts into different lighting, and eventually I sort of saw how she could think they were brownish. I apologized for saying “are you blind”; though I felt it was said as a joke,I could tell it hurt her feelings, so I meant my apology. End of story, or so I thought.   Over the last year she has brought up this argument at least 5 times, and it seems like every time she brings it up she gets more agitated about the memory.  Tonight, we were talking and that time comes up again, and I start getting quiet, hoping to change the subject. We move on, but I can tell it’s bothering her, so I ask what she’s thinking. She tells me that she’s thinking about the way I said “Are you blind?” Like I was so sure I was right. It makes her upset. I tell her, again, honestly, that I didn’t mean it in a mean way, and that I’m sorry it hurt her feelings. Our conversation ended shortly after, and I felt bad, but also frustrated because I’m really thinking this year old silly argument isn’t going away. Am I the asshole for being upset that her feelings are still hurt? Was what I said that day really mean? Is it like a red flag for a bad partner?	1642936046.0	sarcsz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sarcsz/aita_for_being_annoyed_that_an_old_argument_is/	AITA for being annoyed that an old argument is brought up repeatedly?
ixoqrrhu	I caught up with a good friend I’ve known since I was 12 who lives in another state and was visiting my city. I hadn’t seen her for years, so I was super excited to see her and meet her friends and new partner.  We were all having a great time and I admit that I was very very drunk (along with everyone else). My friend was just as drunk as I was but also had a whole lot of ketamine.  We were talking together one on one and out of nowhere she told me she thinks I might be ‘autistic’ and that there is something really off about me socially. I was really confronted by this as I do have social anxiety (which I hide quite well as I come off as quite outgoing) and for someone to tell me that I am ‘socially off’ is really difficult to hear. I was also unsure how I gave this impression as I was being outgoing and getting along with everyone around me really well.  I’ll note that I don’t think there is anything at all wrong with being autistic as I have met many wonderful people on the spectrum. I do have ADHD and have been assessed for autism and am confident I don’t have it. It was her telling me I am socially ‘off’ and her armchair diagnosing me that I didn’t appreciate. She also had no knowledge of my mental health difficulties and I never disclosed my issues with social anxiety/adhd with her.  I started tearing up after she told me this and I told her that I will be leaving. When I got all my things together and was about to walk out she tried to talk to me and resolve it. I was keen to hear her out and give her an opportunity to retract what she said  but she was just being very argumentative and belligerent. She then became pretty verbally aggressive with me, telling me to get fucked and that she wants me out of her life. I got verbally aggressive back and we were both screaming at each other, with me screaming in her face. At that point I left pretty distraught.   I feel a lot of shame for raging how i did and do wish I handled it better without getting aggressive. Her and I haven’t spoken since and my close friends think I need to cut her off as they didn’t think her behaviour was at all appropriate.  I am wondering if maybe I was the asshole here and am seeking some insights in case my friends are just being protective and biased.	1642935984.0	sarc9x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sarc9x/aita_for_raging_at_my_friend_when_she_said_some/	AITA for raging at my friend when she said some hurtful things to me while we were both drunk?
i1dfgals	I (20m) have kept a few of my old phones (just a couple of old iPhones with batteries that barely last a day) just as a back up and as a keepsake because I like keeping them. Now a few of weeks ago my mum tells me about her workmate's children who apparently have nothing and would love these phones of mine and she asks me if I would be willing to let them have them, I say no for the reasons said above.  Over the next few weeks she keeps on badgering me about it, and I keep refusing. What happened the other day though, is that she had already promised them that they could have them, and gone into my drawers (she had done this once before so she could use one) and then told me to reset them and she'll give them away on Monday and both my parents order me to get it done.  Now today they said that if I don't get it done she's just going to give them away (Idk what the hell they're going to do, they're password protected) at which point I tell them that I still don't want to let them take it and that my mother shouldn't have promised her workmate they could have the phones.   My parents explode saying how selfish I am and how I only care about myself and how it's just a phone. Now I feel awful about the whole thing now. I will admit, yes I had several phones I wasn't using but like I say, I still wasn't wanting to let them go.

i43qa19w	  Basically he (52M) put me (19M) and my sister (21F) in a situation night before last that was just annoying (it's not important what it was really just annoying), and yesterday on the way to work I brought up again how annoyed I was for what he did, and he just exploded getting mad and calling me disrespectful and all the stuff like that. Basically the convo ending him saying he's not picking me up from work, which he usually does.        Anyway work ends and I take an uber home, and when I get home my parents are gone and when I walk in my door is just gone. He's done it in the past and it always pisses me off because I always keep it closed especially while asleep because light or noise wakes me up easily sometimes. So when they get home awhile big fight erupts, during which I break a giant whole through their bedroom door saying now he can get off his lazy ass and replace it like he promised my mom months ago (he already bought a door and frame). This all made it worse, eventually I found my door and while I was bringing it in to hang he had taken the top hinge and my computer charger, so of course it all started up further to the point him about to call the cops cuz I was taking an unused hinge off a doorway because its destruction of property, so that keeps going on, eventually my sister needs to be picked up so he leaves to do it.        As soon as he does I go back to my room and discover my charger missing and that really pisses me off so a fight happens between me and mom and it goes on until my dad and sister get home. And of course fights continue, now with my sister in the mix, and this whole time everyone is blaming me saying I should respect him cuz he's the dad and that I can't talk to him the way I do. By this point I have my broken off door in my room and can hang ot on the bottom hinge and wedge it closed, but I'm still annoyed so I grab the unused hinge and put it on close my door (btw it doesn't have pins so its really just wedged on), and I begin doing something just to calm down . Mom comes in saying I'm not allowed to have my door closed until I go to sleep. So another fight starts and dad comes back sees I have the hinge is trying to call cops again cuz destruction of property and it ends up getting taken off, and I end up going back to what I was doing.         I'm getting tired at this point since it's almost midnight so I just say I'm going to bed and to leave me alone, I fall asleep wake up 40 minutes later to my door gone again and him saying I'm not allowed to have my door, another large fight ensues because I dod a shit job repairing the hole in their door and just even more bullshit fights going on, like calling me selfish for starting a fight and getting everyone wound up then going to sleep to my mom practically dragging me out of my bed telling me to get dressed so she can dump me on the side of the road pretty much. And this goes on for a while and then just stops and I can sleep for a bit finally.	1642937342.0	saromo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saromo/aita_for_starting_a_fight_cuz_my_bedroom_door_was/	AITA For starting a fight cuz my bedroom door was taken
bb5vkp5j	I know the title sounds bad but stay with me here. I (17) and my mum recently had an argument over washing my clothes. Some of you may think "you're 17 you should know how to do the washing by now" and yes i agree but you know, life goes on. Now, when I bring down my washing as i do every Sunday to be washed my mum stops me this time and forces me to go through it and pull out anything she deems clean, which by her new standards is "anything that has a visable stain on" the first thing she pulled out was a jumper I've worn to school for about 9 hours + at home for 4 days this week. She folds it and hands it back to me saying "it doesn't look dirty, it doesn't smell bad. Put it back" now i argue the fact I've worn it multiple times this week and it is in fact dirty. She insists it isn't and I don't need to wash it and it just "gives me more to do" we continue to argue until she just sends me to my room. This is when my dad comes in and says my reaction (getting annoyed that my mum wouldn't wash my obviously dirty clothes) was unjustified and i n e e d to apologise. I try to ecplain myself but as usual, my dad doesn't let me speak and send me down to apologise otherwise they take my phone away (like that has anything to do with this but i digress) i go down and say sorry but my mum shouts at me that she deserves respect and that I'm being ungrateful and should "get off my high horse" now here's the thing I d o say thank you when the washing is done, but she doesn't think it's enough. I ask if she can show me how to wash my clothes then since she clearly has an issue with doing it but she comes back with "no. Because you'll use it (the washer) whenever you please just so you can prove a point" of course i get annoyed at this and bring up the point she has no problem with my brothers bringing their washing from Uni for her to wash but apparently that "isn't the point" I get sent to my room with the threat that I'll have my phone taken away and won't be allowed to do the things i want to do.

ivn2iu5g	Long time lurker, first time poster.  Here's a bit of context before I start my story. For the past 10 years, my family (siblings and parents) and I have lived a 25+ drive (or a 4 hour flight) away from each other. My family and I are close despite the distance. My husband likes my family and they like him. My husband strongly dislikes his birthday.  My husband M38 and I F35 have been together for 17 years and married for 5, so he's known my family for nearly two decades now.   Where I live, because of the pandemic, visits were really not possible for very close to 2 full years. Restrictions finally lessened recently and so one at a time, my family has been coming to visit us and our new baby.  My youngest brother (M31) flew to town to visit for just over a week. He stayed in a hotel the entire visit except during the day when he came to spend time with us. He helped with cleaning, groceries, entertaining his nice, etc. This visit happened to fall the same week as my husband's birthday.   At the beginning of the visit, the three of us sat around the table talking about what I would be making for the birthday dinner and how the dinner would have to fall on the weekend because of my husband's work. Naturally, I assumed this meant my brother was invited to dinner.   The day before the dinner, I purchased all of the food. I was explaining to my husband that I bought less meat than normal because I knew my brother probably wouldn't finish an entire plate. My husband lost it. He said it was his birthday and his birthday dinner and why would I assume he wanted him there or assume he would be invited at all.  I was completely taken aback by this reaction. My brother is never here for any special occasions but is in town for this one so why would he not be included.  I reminded my about the food conversation from earlier in the week and how my brother was present. My husband said that just because he was there for that conversation didn't mean assume he was invited. It's his (husband's) birthday and dinner, so I should have asked if he wanted someone else around.

i86mjcrk	  On a Saturday my cousin came to my house to stay for a few nights.   Just a note. I DO NOT like my cousin. And of course, he didn’t like me back.  That night before we went to bed, he stubbed his toe (I think) pretty badly and the noise scared me while I was scrolling around my phone. This was around how the argument went.  Me: You trying to obliterate the house?  Cousin: Stfu you tried doing that so many times every time I came! I would bet all my money your neighbours filled at least ten noise complaints!  Me: What do you mean?  Cousin: You walk up the stairs so loudly, it sounded like you got a pet elephant! You smash you keyboard so hard that you’re not [mature content] You-  My mom came out of her room to stop the argument. She asked what happened so I did so until I was interrupted.  Cousin: OP asked if I tried obliterating the house when he made more noise than ever!  Then he explained what happened.  Mom: Ok. Both are wrong.

a9etfxmw	My sister (43f) and I (36f) have a strained relationship. She’s taken advantage in the past regarding money and babysitting.  She’s always promised to pay back the money, but it never came. As far as babysitting her kids, she would always ask for an hour or two, but be unavailable for 4-6 hours. I stopped doing these favors for her about 12 years ago. I told her I couldn’t handle always being taken advantage of.  She then started to ask my mom for everything and mother never said no or set boundaries until 4-5 years ago when she helped her buy a car.    I’ve watched my sister lie and manipulate her friends for years.  Im sure to them all I’m a massive witch that wont help her out. She’s borrowed money from her friends or exes, and disappeared from their lives. I’ve ran into these people, and of course they want their money. She hates that I’ve given her number to “friends” looking for her.  Sister and I don’t have a close relationship. I tend to hold her at a distance because I feel she’s only/always looking for money.  Now I’ve been sending my niece, her daughter ( 18f) money. She’s in college and struggling with work and school.  I don’t expect my niece to pay me back, I just want her to be safe and finish school. My sister doesn’t know I’ve been doing this.  However, my niece says she can’t trust her mom to make responsible decisions with money, so I’m helping my niece out.   My sister came over for Christmas and I gifted her kids, her boyfriend and her some presents.  For the third year in a row, she says “I didn’t know we were doing gifts today, I’ll bring yours soon.”  I usually dont hear from her til March.  These gift have never come.  I don’t actually care about a gift for myself, but I would like my kids to receive something from their aunt.  To at least feel thought of.   After the new year my sister sent a text asking how I was.  I was surprised to hear from her.  She then proceeded to show me pictures of her and her boyfriend having gone on a weekend trip to New York for his birthday. They did some awesome stuff, and ate some awesome food.  Sounded great.  The very next day, she messaged me that she’s strapped for cash and that she needs a place to stay for a week as well as a babysitter for her son (10m).  Mostly her son would be here, while shes at work everyday.  I instantly say no because of covid ( my husband is immune compromised and she’s a nurse) and she gets so upset, she went off that I never help her and now she’s got to figure something else out.   I do feel bad for my nephew, but my sister can’t be trusted to keep her word. I also don’t feel like making my family uncomfortable for a week, when she just came back from a weekend trip with her bf and didn’t even remember us for Christmas?  Maybe I should have let my nephew stay, AITA for not helping her out anymore?	1642942378.0	sat11q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sat11q/aita_for_not_letting_my_sister_crash_on_my_couch/	AITA for not letting my sister crash on my couch after she just got back from a trip?
ixq69tze	Throwaway as I don't want to compromise my main account.  A bit of background: it was my mums (53f) birthday a few days ago. My dad (64m) decided to treat her to a dinner in her favourite restaurant. It's worth mentioning that my dad does not speak English, and my mum is not a native speaker either, but she is pretty fluent in it. My mum also looks significantly younger than she is due to working out, diet, and different beauty "therapies," while my dad looks his age. So, one of the waitresses pulled my mum aside and asked if she had been groomed by my dad. My mother thought that being groomed means being taken care of and treated, so she replied positively. After she couldn't understand why the waitress urged her to leave and hide and thought it's a surprise. Long story short police got called and nearly arrested my dad until Mum cleared the air, showed her passport, and said they were married for over 25 years. No hard feelings; they left a decent tip for the restaurant for doing something and laughed at the situation (more like miscommunication).  Now, on Friday, I was telling this story to my work friend, and we both agreed that it was funny. One of our work colleagues, Nancy, intervened and said if she was the police officer she would still take my dad into custody as due to their age difference its clear to her that my mother was groomed by him. Just hearing that wanted me to vomit, since my parents met each other when both of them had successful careers and my dad was working as a member of the police force himself for years and adopted me and raised me as his own daughter.  I snapped and asked Nancy to mind her own business and stop making assumptions, but she carried on. I had no choice but to get the manager involved, and both of us got dismissed until Monday to wait for HR to look into the issue. Since then, Nancy posted a rant on social media and called me an asshole for "supporting grooming of women by older rich man," and some other people agreed with her.  This entire situation makes me angry, but AITA for reporting her to the management?	1642942483.0	sat1z8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sat1z8/aita_for_asking_a_colleague_to_mind_her_own/	AITA for asking a colleague to mind her own business after my dad "groomed" my mum and reporting her to my manager for this?
8oppt1k3	So my fiancé (30M) and I (F27) are going to marry soon.  My fiancé’s parents are quite religious (Christian) even though they usually keep that to themselves and don’t push their belief on others too much, which I appreciate since I am an atheist.  My partner is mildly religious because of his upbringing, but not a lot tbh.  He doesn’t go to church or pray or anything, but he’s not an atheist either - which is fine with me, we accept eachother.   Now here is the issue: I’m very outspoken about not being religious (in a respectful way ofc) and also always stated I wanted no religious decorative symbols or anything on display, which is fine with both of us.   Also we decided to not involve religion in our wedding, since this is supposed to celebrate the bond between us as partners and no dedication to god or whatsoever.  My partner is fine with that.   Recently we’ve mentioned this to his mom and she was OUTRAGED we wouldn’t have a priest asking us to marry in the eyes of god.   I respectfully and calmly told her this was between us and that I as an atheist don’t want to pledge some oath to a god I don’t believe in - especially not on a day that’s supposed to be of significance for our relationship.   She told us to leave her house and said she won’t come to this unholy ceremony. My partner tried to calm her down but no chance.   Now he was loudly thinking of maybe reaching a compromise to make his mom happy but I want to stand my ground on this one.  It would be different if it was something my partner really wanted, but this isn’t about him and his wishes - it’s his mom.

ixr8ozin	My mom was an alcoholic and cheater, My dad divorced her when I was 8, I was not his child biologically but he still got custody. He hired a nanny and I didn't really see him a lot as he was always working. He remarried when I was 10. I have a step sister who is a year younger than me.   My dad is a really engaged parent with my step sister. My dad pretty much told me when I was 13 that the only reason he had fought for custody was because he knew mom used to drive drunk. I feel like a guest in his house. He doesn't talk to me a lot.   I have never been excluded from anything but it always is a pity invite out of obligation. I do look a lot like mom and I think that is why he doesn't like me. I know that I an obligation and I should be grateful that I am not in a foster home right now. I go to a good school, I will never have to worry about college debt. I don't belong here. I know that he will probably not want anything to do with me once I am done with college  It was my step sister's 16th birthday and they made a huge deal out of it. My dad took time of from work. My step mom baked a cake and they got her things based on her favorite movies and books. It was a small party with just her uncle and aunt invited.   I don't know why but It hit me like a ton of bricks, for my birthday I got cheap store bought cake that I cut alone with step mom late at night because dad was busy and my sister couldn't be bothered to stop gaming to come down.   I was really close to crying and I was so fucking jealous and hurt. I know that I am an awful baggage that really shouldn't be here and I just didn't want to pretend anymore. They wanted to take a family photo and my step mom asked me to join them. I told her that I didn't want to, They were okay with it but my step sister asked again but I was really not in a mental space to take a photo with them.  They took the photo without me and my sister is very mad at me because I didn't want to take pictures with her. My step mom is also slightly annoyed and is frosty with me. I feel guilty, I should have sucked it up and just took the photo. I was just drawing attention to myself and I shouldn't have done that. I feel like a petulant child.	1642943998.0	sathoj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sathoj/aita_for_refusing_to_take_pictures_with_my_step/	AITA for refusing to take pictures with my step sister on her birthday?
2d5fg4js	I'm an MYP (Pre-IB) student and since last week I've been insanely swamped with work. At the beginning of last week I promised myself that I'd forget about all school on Friday and go back to work the next day. Anyways, it was Saturday and then my dad (who lives separately from us but very close, it's complicated) announced to me that we were all going to go out to celebrate his release from quarantine, as he had been quarantined for 10 days. I asked if I could stay home to study, but he insisted I come and said that we could do it Monday after-school instead, which I knew wasn't suitable for me. I asked him if we could do it next Saturday, which I knew was very far from today but I really did not want to give up 3 hours of study time, as he wanted to go to a restaurant a little far away.   To give a little more context, my school ends at 3, and I immediately head to the gym and come back around 5, and after showering and dinner and all that, its 6, which means I have 2-3 hours of time to work on school stuff and another hour for coding stuff. If you know what the IB is, you'll know that this is an okay amount of time to get stuff done, but its not optimal, especially if you are at those weeks where 4 different projects are due.  My dad told me that I should make my schedule a little more flexible, and if I have time to go to the gym and go out on Fridays, that I should make time on Monday to go out with the family. I have nothing against going out and celebrating, I actually want to, but this is just not one of those weeks, as we're nearing the end of the semester.  So, AITA?	1642944402.0	satm6n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/satm6n/aita_for_wanting_to_study_instead_of_go_out_and/	AITA for wanting to study instead of go out and celebrate my dads return from quarantine?
c5bqnyvg	My (14F) mom (46F) values money a lot. She saves and usually thinks quite a while before doing any purchase, which isn't an issue. She's been very adamant about her money rules after her divorce with my dad, since he mostly handled the money in their relationship and now she wants to show that she could take the lead.  For my birthday (early december), I was given about ₱12,000 (around $250) and I was incredibly adamant about spending zero money if not totally necessary (No money spent on coffee, clothes, basically anything I usually buy as a teenager). My mom and sister joked about it in the beginning saying it's in my blood to spend money.   I already spent some money on my birthday (Bought some lego sets as a gift to myself) and on christmas (bought these purple earrings for my sister) which had gotten me more jokes, but I said I wouldn't spend anymore after the holidays.  Fast forward to today when I asked my mom to bring me to the local grocery store to buy some snacks and stuff she forgot to buy on the normal grocery trip. It took some convincing but eventually I was in the aisles buying my stuff while my mom waited in the car. My mom told me to just use the money I had for the stuff and she'd pay me later in the car. I agreed since I had already bought my wallet cause this has happened before.  I get my stuff and pay ₱1,000 (around $20) and head to the car. I don't ask my mom immediately for the money cause I'd just seem greedy, but eventually I ask her when we reach home and she tells me to stop acting like that (This exact situation has happened before) since she'll give the money later.  A few hours later I ask again for the money and she gets mad saying that I need to stop acting like she was some type of thief. I tell her that I just like knowing that no one owes me anything and she says that I'm treating her like a bad mother. The conversation ends there and I feel like shit right now. I understand my mom is good with money, and I had no real reasoning for wanting the money so soon. My mom borrows from my sister all the time and they've never had an argument about this.  My sister told me that I should stop upsetting her about money and that I need to stop acting so stingy.  TL;DR I used my money to pay for things my mom was supposed to pay for, and I had been pushy about asking for the money back. AITA?  (Sorry if something was weird about this post.I've never used reddit before and a lot of the normal phrases people use here are new to me. I also tried to include everything so it's super wordy, sorry about that.

ixryu21o	Ill keep this shortish:  My boyfriend and I were discussing how two of our friends recently broke up, it was a nasty break and all the mutual friends sided with her instead of him. We still keep in contact with both.   He tells me he feels its not fair our friend is now fully on his own without any support. I say no real answer to agree or disagree but positively say "he's got this, he'll pull through, life will get better for him, etc.". He reiterates everyone is ignoring the ex and i continue to say "he needs new friends,  he needs better friends." I am listening, but im not matching his energy. My boyfriend seems a little upset that im not feeling the same way he is and continues on to tell me that he feels if the roles were reversed I would be outraged to see my friend who was a lady on her own in the big city. I don't think he's fully wrong but I still only give a shrug and a "maybe" for an answer and try to change the subject. I know that he feels strongly about this and I feel like I'm respecting his opinion by not arguing about it or taking a harsh stance/trying to defend a point. In the end, its none of my business but I also don't want to just agree to please.   He then goes immediately to bed (it was super late so this part isnt shocking lol) and rolls over breifly to tell me im awful to talk to. He hasn't spoken to me more than 3 words since and is ignoring me. AITA? Should I apologize to him for not being fully engaged in our conversation and presenting my opinion on the matter?	1642945429.0	saty6t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saty6t/aita_for_not_responding_or_giving_my_opinion_to/	AITA for not responding or giving my opinion to my boyfriend?
ixt54ytd	  I M32 have a brother M30 (Kevin) who is a single dad to a 3yo, Kevin lives in the same city as me we don't have any family of relatives here just a few friends.    Kevin has a habit of dumping his kid on me at random times to watch while he goes out on dates with women. So far he's gone out for 4 dates while expecting me to watch my nephew. It bothered me because I have work committments (I'm a nurse) and my schedule can unpredictable, and so he caused me issues at work for dropping his kid off at my house without telling me first.    Last week he did it again, He came over at 6pm and entered my house with my nephew (he had a spare key) while I was showering and left the house immediately. I got out of the shower and was shocked to see my nephew standing there alone. I asked where his dad was and he said he just left. I knew he wanted me to watch my nephew, I called him several times on the phone and he did not pick up. I was so mad and almost freaking out because I was getting late for my shift. I sent him a text telling him to come pick his son up right now or I'd call cops on him for child abandment. He texted back begging that I suck it up just this time because he had an important date and he couldn't leave. I told him that I was serious and I'd do it and gave him 10 minutes to get home.   He got home looking pissed and started yelling at me for ruining his date and making him leave in the middle of it just because I couldn't bother skip one damn shift to watch my nephew. I told him I never agreed to watch his son and he made me do it. He said thar it an emergency which made me laugh because calling a date night "emergency" is just absurd. Long story short he left with my nephew but hasn't stopped blaming me for spoiling his date and probably causing damage to the relationship between him and his "potential" girlfriend.  It's been a week and he's still salty about it demanding I make it to him and call his date and lie to her and tell her some sob story about why he had to leave like that but I said I won't do that.

diqsrf5g	I 36f have a small business. Our business both requires a lot of thought and diligence and deals with safeguarding children so quality of work is very important. I have 3 employees- Tisha 37f, Jane 35f and Eloise 26f.   Originally just Tisha and Jane worked for me. Then Tisha got very sick and we found out she had cancer. She wanted to keep working and we accommodated her as best we could. She missed several months in a row and I paid her in full for all of it. All of this was fine until the pandemic hit and less money was coming in. I asked her to look into disability and she got very upset.   I felt bad she got upset and kept paying her for a couple more months, but she did not return to work in those two months in between. I finally called her and said I would pay her the maximum she could make and still apply for disability (about half her salary) after paying her for one more month at her full rate and then she needed to apply for disability.   She didn’t work for 6 more months after that (drawing half salary per our agreement the whole time). We hired Eloise in the meantime because we were drowning and I needed help. I kept checking in with Tisha who never mentioned wanting to come back to work in that time. When I hired Eloise she asked to come back a couple times a week. We welcomed her back. She made the same amount (well commenting behind my back that she didn’t want to ‘work for nothing) until she got passed a certain amount and then I started paying her hourly for what she worked above that. After all of that she ended up getting a raise.   The problem is since she’s been back she’s been very rude to all of us most days, particularly Eloise. She makes comments behind my back about how I’m Scrooge McDuck and she’s trying. If something goes wrong she won’t accept any blame. If we have a problem with something and I say we need to change the system she takes it personally. In the last 2 months her work has gotten poor and she only wants to do a couple of tasks (then complains she doesn’t get to do more interesting things). She can’t handle the work anymore and her toxic attitude is making work a nightmare.   WIBTA if I let her go? I know it’s not her fault, but I’ve tried confronting her and it just gets ugly. I know she has cancer, but I’m tired of bending over backwards for someone who’s so hateful toward me.	1642946351.0	sau8jb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sau8jb/wibta_if_i_fired_someone_with_cancer/	WIBTA If I fired someone with cancer?
ixrnz1nw	Essentially I and a group of friends were sitting around waiting for our trains and talking about nothing or other. We got onto the topic of kids - I have a son, and most of the others have kids too.  One of the girls stated that she was all for these new parenting gigs, but breastfeeding past six months is just weird. A friend asked why, girl said it seemed like it was for the parent rather than the baby, because formula does the same thing. So, obviously, more parents should choose formula.  It devolved into a minor argument, which I for the most part wasnt apart of. I was pissed off and I dont do well when I am. My train was only a few minutes out when someon else spoke up and stated that extended breastfeeding gave them the ick.  I said, "Oh, you'd never want to meet my family, then." After a few looks I said, "The longer they're on the boob the better. I breastfed past seven, its usuallyat least four years."  My train arrived, myself and my friend that was getting it with me made our escape. It was perfectly timed and I'm rather proud of it.  She found the situation hilarious - we had our sons a day apart, and are very much raising them with the same ideals (extended nursing being one). She's more like my sister, honestly.  Anyway, we got off, picked the boys up, went on with our day. I got a private message from someone in the group, calling my a cunt for making the conversation weird. I replied that they had already made it weird by thinking they got to have an opinion on how others fed their kids.  Spent the rest of the day with my son, the usual.   When I unlocked my phone again, I'd recieved an array of messages. A couple apologies, which I accepted. But mostly people calling my an awful person.  I laughed it off at first - if you feel the need to share your opinion, be prepared to hear opposing ones.  But, after a while, I realised I had only said it for the shock factor, to make them pissed off too, I guess? Which, to me, is an asshole move. I could of easily just left it.  My friend is insisting I did nothing wrong and they deserved the shock, but I'm still unsure. I have apologised to those who apologised to me, but I havent to the rest, yet.  So, AITA?

ixtn90tq	 Title sounds kind of....ehh but hear me out.   My wife and I have been married for 6 years, like any married couple, we share everything EVERYTHING. however, me being naturally a private person I just don't like it when someone invades my private space..the bathroom for instance.   Let me just say that I take my time when answering nature's call. I just go in with my phone and do my thing. Recently, my wife started barging in randomly for no good reason. It freaks me out and also makes me feels stressed amd anxious because my private space is constantly invaded. I don't get why she does.she'd barge in whenever I'm in there, tajes a look around for a whole minute then slowly walks out. I told her how I felt about this and she brushed me off saying "you have nothing to hide, why are you so worried about me walking in randomly?".   I've had enough amd decided I needed a way to kerp her out since she has taken off the lock. One thing my wife hates about me is my farting, she absolutely hates the smell and says it's disgusting so what I started doing is that everytime I'm in the bathroom and she barges in, I fart...like really loudly and produce a really (according to her) nasty smell. It worked because once she hears the sound she runs out. I thought this was the solution but she picked up on what I was doing and discovered that I was doing it on purpose to keep her out. She started arguing with me about it almost saying I'm banned from farting in the bathroom which is ridiculooous.  I kept doing it which kept pissing her off, now she isn't even talking to me saying I'm being a child and an asshole for this behabior.

ixsav6nk	My wife (28) and I (29) have a friend. We'll call him Kevin (35). My wife met Kevin though her work, where they are both restaurant managers in nearby branches of a local chain. They saw each other for meetings and such, and bonded over a mutual love of bowling.  We've been bowling together several times, and Kevin has brought along his daughter Olivia (10).  However, it didn't take long before Kevin started getting a little too friendly. He made it VERY CLEAR that he was single to her, and started bringing her Starbucks (which was out of his way) even if she didn't ask for it. There was even a time when the company went out for drinks and he couldn't keep his hands off my wife. My wife definitely doesn't want this attention, and I trust her completely.  On top of that, Kevin's daughter Olivia seems to be in an awful situation. We've gotten to know her a bit through the bowling excursions, and its pretty clear that her parents aren't treating her well. She's struggling in school, and even outright asked to see a therapist.   My wife feels awful about Olivia. She was in a similar situation as a kid, and had to go through a lot of therapy herself. We've tried to engage with Olivia as much as possible, we occasionally help her with her homework.   Kevin won't let us visit with Olivia unless we are all together. We've tried inviting her along to other group things that just she would enjoy, and he has declined.  The problem is, Kevin makes me feel awful. He's constantly bragging about himself, trying to take credit for Olivias accomplishments, or talking about all the money he's spent on expensive status symbols. He also hovers around both Olivia and my wife. He makes us both uncomfortable.  I told my wife how terrible Kevin makes me feel, and she still has us go bowling with him and Olivia sometimes to check in with the kid. The problem is that Kevin knows this and will guilt my wife into another outing by using his child. For example: this time he picked a date to go (that we didn't agree to) saying "I told Olivia, and she's so excited to see you guys!".   Last weekend we were supposed to go bowling, but I put my foot down and said we weren't going anymore.  It's obvious that Kevin is just using Olivia to get to my wife, and I'm not sure we're doing much for the kid either way.  TLDR: told my wife we can't go bowling with her manipulative creepy "friend" anymore just so we can check in on his possibly neglected daughter  AITA?	1642947436.0	saulqn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saulqn/aita_for_telling_my_wife_we_cant_go_bowling_with/	AITA for telling my wife we can't go bowling with my wife's friend?
4u0i9s0h	Just for background, my son (17 years old) has always been a pretty natural all-around athlete, with football and swimming being his two main competitive sports. With the latest football season coming up, all of the usual preseason conditioning has been ramping up, but with one new twist:  He was asked last year by his coach to put on weight for the next season, and not just any weight: 40 freakin' pounds, so that he would start the season at an even 200 lbs.  Being the team player (and bottomless pit for food) that he is, he didn't question his coach's request and immediately got to "work." I didn't  know any of this was happening at the time, but his coach expressly encouraged him to put on the weight as quickly as possible, and also gave him a set of tips and rules to follow to help make it happen.  The "rules" apparently included calorie quotas and suggested ways to achieve them (drinking more soda, recommended fast food orders, supplements to order—which explains why one called Boost started showing up at my doorstep by the box full, and on and on). As if that weren't already a recipe for gaining the wrong kind of weight, yet another bogus rule was to limit his cardio workouts, including swimming.  Again, I didn't know this was happening until later, but looking back on the last couple of months, it makes a lot of sense. I do think I noticed the drop off in his interest in running and swimming this summer, and I also definitely saw a decided shift in the sorts of drinks and food he was bringing home, but I feel terrible because I didn't really think much of it until I saw the effects quite literally building up on the guy.  After the first couple of months I could have sworn he already looked a little bigger, but these days there's no getting around the fact that he's put on a significant amount of weight (35 lbs so far it turns out). I'm talking a "gut" that's starting to resemble his father's, and this is on a 17-year-old kid who's never had a weight problem in his life. (Of course, life after high school is a constant battle to keep weight off, so I worried he might be getting an unneeded head start in that department.)  Obviously I became concerned about his mental health or potential eating disorders, so I eventually asked what was going on, and to his credit he explained everything. Since then, I've felt a mix of anger at his coach, and guilt for being so hands-off until things seem to have gotten out of hand.  My son thinks I'm overreacting, and my husband has taken his side (and it turns out he was  even enabling it). They say I don't understand the sport's culture, and I'm only this upset because I prefer swimming  (which I do). I still feel tempted to address this with his coach, but I know it will mortify  my son, so I feel kind of stuck here.

ixrz9q3j	When I began dating my husband MIL and FIL were married but it was a train wreck. He was cheating with multiple women. She was miserable and tried taking it out on me. They had a family friend "Brad" who was always around. FIL claimed that MIL and Brad hated each other (because they used to fight a lot in their 20s) but it was super clear they did not hate each other at the moment.   My BFF "Emily" met Brad through me and he had been looking for a new assistant and she'd been looking for a job. He hired her and Emily loved it. She made some mistakes and ended up not finishing college, so this job paid a lot better than most of the jobs that were available to her and she met a lot of cool, and interesting people through him and always joked that she was husband hunting.  At one point everyone (my husband and Brad's kids) began getting suspicious that they were dating. It bothered my husband that MIL wouldn't tell him anything about her life. they went from being best friends to her hardly talking to him all because he set some boundaries about how she treated me.   Emily confirmed to me that Brad had a picture of MIL as his phone background and that Emily had been tasked with sending her flowers and a gift on her birthday. Brad's kids confronted him and he denied it. He said he had a picture of her because she's the only person who makes him happy (great thing to say to your kids) and he sent her the flowers because he knew birthdays were hard with her marriage falling apart. Note MIL and FIL were in the process of divorcing and cheating could have probably cost her some money.  MIL threw a fit and said Emily was spying and demanded he fire her. Brad berated her to tears and then fired her and Emily was devastated. I don't even have words she cried for days.  Well that was about 5 years ago. I'm married with a toddler and another on the way. MIL and Brad are married. MIL and her son aren't close at all. She will do a token appearance on birthdays or big events, but their relationship is pretty messed up. Emily has been struggling a bit with depression and told me that seeing Brad and MIL is very triggering and she feels that MIL is always smirking at her. She recently called off her wedding and is in a bad place and Brad made a joke about how if she still worked for him she might have married rich already, called her a gold digger, and Brad's daughter screamed at him to get the fuck out, so him and MIL left and Emily cried.  I decided that Brad is banned unless he gives a sincere apology and asks Emily to forgive him for firing her for telling the truth and for what he said, and MIL cannot smirk anymore. He said no so he is banned and MIL won't come without him. This means my husband will pretty much never see her again because she never invites us to her house. I would rather have my BFF who is like a sister at my kids birthdays, etc.	1642947648.0	sauo33	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauo33/aita_for_banning_mils_husband_from_my_housefamily/	AITA for banning MIL's husband from my house/family events unless he apologizes to my friend?
ixs6itrx	Okay, so I (24f) have two coworkers who I'll be calling John and Emma to make this post easier to read.  They've been friends since they were in college and are pretty much always together.  For the past few months, Emma's been insisting that John has some form of depression. She always tries to get him to talk about it with her or asks him to go see a therapist/psychologist, but John just brushes it off, says he's too busy and doesn't have the time to, promises he'll try it later but never does and so on. This pisses Emma off and leads to them bickering about it all the time while they're at work. I usually just mind my own business and try to stay out of it.  A few days ago, me and John were talking on our lunch break and he asked me if I'd ever been to therapy or if I knew anyone who had. I told him that yeah, I did go to therapy for a while a few years ago, though not for depression but for some other personal issues. He then asked me to tell him what it was like, what my therapist said and did, whether it helped me or not and so on.   And I described it in as much detail as I could remember, but I was also completely honest with him and told him that it didn't help me at all. And it's true, I genuinely didn't feel like anything good came of it - it was honestly one of the most boring things I've ever done in my life. I even told him that maybe it'll be different for him, but that for me it felt like nothing more than a waste of money. And that was pretty much the end of our conversation.  However, today I got an angry phone call from Emma, who was pissed off at me because she thought I discouraged John from trying therapy by telling him about my negative past experience with it. Said she was so close to convincing him to make an appointment, but now they're back to square one because he suddenly doesn't want to go anymore. She eventually hung up on me and now won't answer any of my calls or texts.  Was I an asshole, Reddit? It's not like I straight up told John to never try therapy. He himself asked to know about my previous experience with it and I tried to be as honest as possible. Was I supposed to lie and tell him it helped me when it really didn't?	1642947980.0	saurxq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saurxq/aita_for_telling_my_depressed_coworker_about_my/	AITA for telling my depressed coworker about my negative experience with therapy?
cuixflhn	My mom's husband and most of his brothers and friends went to the same University. The University's team had a football game during the reception on Friday and there was a tv in the reception hall. It wasn't planned for it to be used, it just happened to be in the reception hall that we rented.   After the first dance between the bride and groom, one of the groom's 5 brothers, friends, or possibly nephews turned on the TV. The next thing I knew, the groomsmen and seemingly all of the men in my now stepfather's family were glued to the TV. The bulk of the crowd were probably the groom's nephews or boyfriends of his neices. I tried to relax and enjoy the party, chatted with my relatives who live out-of-state for a bit, but then they started hooting and hollering to the point that that's what the focus of the party clearly was. Just a bunch of men in tuxes, along with a few women, standing in front of a television cheering. At one point a "Team name! Team name!" chant even started before one of the groomsmen pulled the plug on that. They kept watching though.  I got pretty mad and asked my mom if she wanted me to turn off the TV. She pretended to be nonchalant and said, no, no, it's fine. I know her well though. She gets nervous in front of people, especially if she feels like she's in charge of entertaining people, and would always lie and say she doesn't care. I went back to my car fuming and went home. My mom asked where I was about an hour later and I said I was back at the house because I was tired. Now it's two days later and she says that I made her sad by leaving. I brought up those guys and she said, guys are just like that. She was raised in the 1950s and has zero expectations from men.	1642948560.0	sauz18	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauz18/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_mothers_wedding/	AITA for walking out of my mother's wedding reception when all the men related to her husband were hollering at the tv?
d0nns4k	Just to clarify, I believe I'm in the right about the verbal abuse issue, but what I want to know is if the way I expressed myself was not okay. I want your opinion on the way I talked to my half-sisters, if I was rude or disrespectful in anyway.  A bit of context: My(24M) father(74M) went to the US ten years ago to work while my mother(47F) and I stayed in our home country in Asia. My two half-sisters, S1(roughly 45) and S2(roughly 43) are also there but they don't live together with our father. And yes, my mother is almost the same age as my older half-sister.  My father recently went back to our home country and he's been here for two months now. He is a toxic person in general but I'll just talk about the verbal abuse. He verbally abuses my mother every 3 days or so. He shouts at her with things like (rough translation) "you stupid fuck" and "you fucking whore" when he gets angry even at petty things. My mother just stays silent the whole time. My father has always been the breadwinner and my mother has always been a stay-at-home wife, so she is financially dependent on him. Also, divorce is not legal here.  A while back, my half-sisters asked how our father is doing and I told them the situation. We aren't really close and we haven't talked much before. They told me to tell my mother to just be patient with our father because he is old, and I said (verbatim), "But that's so unfair to my mother. She is already being patient and she doesn't even say anything back. It's not even a fight, he's just verbally abusing her."  We talked a bit more but it did not really go anywhere. They kept saying I was rude and disrespectful when we were talking, and all my relatives are now treating my mother and I like we're assholes because my half-sisters told them. Reminder that I live in Asia and family is a big, and I mean big, thing here. Anyway, that's why I decided to post here, so I can find out if I was really in the wrong. I wanted to just link a screenshot of the conversation but I don't think it's allowed here. Here's how the conversation via chat went, verbatim, but I fixed the other parties' spelling and punctuation.  Me: Honestly, I think they should just get separated. Like if he'll just shout at her for something petty like that after 25 years of marriage, 15 of which they were physically together, then it's just not good. They basically had 15 years to work their issues out but the situation is still like this so I think separation is the best course of action. And honestly, she's too good for him. Imagine just accepting all that verbal abuse. The only thing I don't like about my mom is that she married too early so she isn't financially independent from him  S2: Is that how your mom feels? She wants a separation?  Me: Idk but it's how I feel. And he's been here one month and my depression is already back (I currently live at home due to the pandemic)  S2: I'm so sorry to hear about your frustration he's only been home for 2 months. And that's what he said, he doesn't feel welcome at home  Me: I'll talk to him. I just need time to organize my thoughts.  S2: Let me just ask, do you guys even have plans of taking care of him? I'd say that's out of the window right? This is the guy that lived here alone and went to work even below zero degrees weather so he can support you both.  Me: I know. But just as he had to make sacrifices there, we also had our fair share of sacrifices here so please don't make me feel bad about his experience there.  S2: Ok, let me know your sacrifices there while he's working here. Please make me understand. I'm not trying to make you feel bad, I want facts!  Me: I mean... I think that's irrelevant. Are we trying to count our sacrifices to see who sacrificed more for whom? And if e did sacrifice more, does that somehow justify all the verbal abuse? Seems like you just want to prove that he suffered a lot there. I know he did and I am thankful for that, but we can't just look at that and disregard all the negatives.  S2: Sweetheart you have so much growing up to do! Like what I said I want facts, I'm trying to understand both sides. I'm not trying to prove anything to you! Coz if I'm trying to prove anything to you, you won't like what I have to say!  Me: See, now that's just passive-aggressive. If you're gonna talk to me from a pedestal just because I'm younger and I have "a lot of growing up to do" then we can't have a decent conversation with mutual respect for each other as equals. Anyway, I think we should save this conversation for another time since we seem to be a bit riled up.  S2: Respect? U don't seem to have any to whomever you are talking to!  Me: Please show me which message in particular made you feel disrespected. I was explaining properly and you felt disrespected. Now please take that feeling, and imagine if I shouted at you stuff like "you fucking whore (rough translation)" over and over again. Every 3 days. That's how my mother felt. I apologize if you felt disrespected but I hope you do "see both sides" since you claimed you are trying to.  S2: This is exactly why you have a lot of growing up to do, I'm sorry to waste your time.  Me: See, I proposed to delay this conversation because you are obviously riled up but you come at me saying "you have no respect." How about we both calm down, get our heads straight, and not talk when we're agitated, yes?  S2: We are so sorry about your situation at home. We are so sorry that our father is a burden to all of you. We are so sorry that he wasn't a father to you. I wish you nothing but the best in life.  She stopped replying after that and my other (older) half-sister messaged me.  S1: You need to be reminded who you are talking to. You need to put your feet down. Is this how you talk to your mother? Cause your mother and I are the same age. Be mindful of the age difference. You're too smart not to know that.  Me: Listen, I apologize if you guys felt disrespected. But I really just don't get why you guys feel disrespected. I tried to talk to you guys about our troubles, as your brother. No profanity, nothing. S2 was clearly talking to me as if I can't say anything right just because I'm younger. Like I should just accept everything just because you guys are older. And when I called her out on it, she got offended. I believe my foot is down and at the right place. I just wanted you to talk to me as an equal, not someone of lower standing just because you happened to be born earlier. I tried to tell her to postpone our conversation because obviously we're both riled up, but all I got were passive-aggressive replies. If anything, I'm the one who should have felt disrespected with all the passive-aggressive comments. I do have a lot of growing up to do, and I'm aware of that. I understand you are coming from a different place, that age is a huge factor for respect. Just try to understand that younger people are not wrong all the time, and they can make valid points.  S1: Telling her that you can't have a decent conversation with her because of that age difference is totally wrong. I don't think your feet is on the ground at all. This ain't flying with me at all.  Me: That's not what I said, I told her to please talk to me as an equal so we can have a decent conversation. I know people with a huge age difference can talk properly. Which is exactly why I tried to get her to calm down first before continuing our discussion, because maybe it would be more fruitful that way. If you keep thinking that the other person is immature just because he's younger, that means you're no longer open to his arguments even if his points are valid. Which is what I wanted to avoid.  S1: You always feel superior based on your statements. You mirror the man you are getting mad at.  Me: I just corrected what you thought I said and you felt disrespected again. Alright, just to summarize, I just want you to treat me as an equal. All I am asking is for you not to look down on me. Why would you think I feel superior just because I am treated as an equal. That is not my intention. If I apologize because you thought I felt superior, would you please tell me (and I am not trying to feel superior here), genuinely, please tell me how I can ask you to treat me as an equal without offending you. See, I never told her that we can't have a decent conversation because of our age difference. I talked to you guys in the first place because I thought we could. If you guys feel disrespected because I asked you to please treat me as an equal so we can have a proper conversation, then that just proves my point.  S2: We're not looking down on you. I think it's the other way around. Maybe you need to talk in a less harsh way. We weren't born yesterday and I get what you're trying to say. Maybe you need to try a different approach. If you still don't get it then there's no sense in talking to you. Cause you never back down. We'll just keep going around in circles.  Me: I mean neither do you so maybe that runs in the family. I know what you mean. But it feels like you're really so against the thought of treating someone younger as an equal, that you think everything I say is disrespectful and that I feel superior. There was no ounce of superiority from my previous message, nor was it my intention to come off as superior. I was just trying to explain. Perhaps you just feel disrespected because I keep talking back even though I'm younger. I get what you mean about my way of speaking, but it's just direct and not harsh. It's logical and concise, arguments are valid without logical fallacies. Maybe it's just a difference in culture and perspective. I do apologize if you feel disrespected and if you felt that I was too harsh, but we can't have a discussion if everything I say offends you. And if that is indeed the case, I hope we can be understanding of the, err, I guess "perspective barrier," if you will. In any case, rest assured that we'll try to work it out. I hope everything goes well. Thanks, I appreciate the concern.  After that, my half-sisters messaged my mom saying stuff like I have no respect and no regard for "debt of gratitude." Apparently, they helped us out financially when I was a kid because our father had no job.  Sorry if that was long. Anyway, AITA for the way I talked to my half-sisters?	1642948528.0	sauyp7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauyp7/aita_for_the_way_i_talked_to_my_halfsisters_about/	AITA for the way I talked to my half-sisters about our father who regularly verbally abuses my mother?
69h6eqtm	So (17m) I went to a event where my friend (16f) was in a dancing competition. She had a Solo and a Group dance. In the Group dance she managed to get a silver medal was super happy for her and all but earlier she had a Solo dance and unfortunately didn't manage to get any placement. She blames me for her slipping and is quite unhappy with me. Now, weeks prior she decided to tell me that she can get me a ticket if I wanted to, so I thought I was invited I decided to get the tickets myself to surprise her and like a week later she tells me you know what, maybe it would be better if I didn't go. At this point i had bought a train ticket to a place 400km from home and the ticket to get to enter the event itself. I  also asked a bunch of buddies and they told me that It would be a good idea to go.

ilj2o796	I (F33) wants my X (M35) to have a conversation for a minimum of 10 minutes before he can leave with our daughter 'G' (F10) The back story. I was 20 when I met him and I was naive. Insanely naive. From before I met him he was addict and not sober, I had no idea. When I left it was due to the breakdown of everything as he was stealing from me and couldn't pay bills and wouldn't stop buying his addiction choice. His sister is now the supervised parent of out visits 10 years later. She picks her up and they all live at their dads house, her and her husband and kid and my X. So she watches her and feeds her and works to get her brother sober for years now, he wenr from his initial choice of addictive substance to harder cheaper ones. He started therapy and his sister is proud to say he is sober for awhile after 10+ years (he was not sober before we got together) We have discussed him starting to do the driving with her supervision at first with her in the car to continue to supervise and possibly a few months down the road he would drive himself.  Here is where I may be the asshole, I have No faith he will stay off his choice of addiction, I 100% expect a relapse and I want him to prove he is sober every other weekend. I told his sister that I think he should have to spend 10 minutes talking to me so I can gage his sobriety.  (Since being 20 I have seen the differences of sober him and not sober him)  Here is the thing, he hates me, with a passion. He dumped me but I chose not to keep trying after couples counseling (no point if couldnt get sober). I am now married and have another baby and a house and cars and I am doing AMAZING. And he has never dated since me and is miserable still living with his dad and working under the table for his uncle since he now has a record due to his drug use.  So he cannot be civil with me, even for one sentence. So a 10 minute conversation with me is hell of earth for him. But I'm not trying to be a buddy, I need to trust he won't end up in a fatal accident with our child because he is messed up. I feel after 10+ years of insobriety he would understand the distrust and get why he needs to make me feel he is safe to drive our child around.  (Also there is a court order for his sister to supervise and that her and I can agree when we feel he is ready and sober to start have unsupervised time and the driving is where we are in our agreement. We don't plan to change the court order because when he relapses we wish that to stay in place, so our agreement is 100% between her and I now. But we both agree this is a good idea since you can best tell his sobriety via a conversation. And he has been in minor accidents with her in the car and she still brings up him driving on sidewalks when she was younger)  So am I the asshole for insisting he prove his sobriety even if it will cause him to have to be ridiculously uncomfortable for 10 minutes 2x a month?	1642948519.0	sauyli	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sauyli/aita_for_making_my_x_reassure_me_every_time_he/	AITA for making my X reassure me every time he picks our daughter up?
5r6m8pqo	So my girlfriend (21) our baby and I (26) are moving finally after months of searching. Today I was hoping to basically get everything loaded in 1 trip and moved in 1 day instead of doing multiple carloads of small loads. My dad has a truck and trailer he said I could use. He went on a snowmobiling trip this weekend and dropped of the trailer at one of the places I work, except the plug for the trailer lights got broken. So I had to re wire the lights to use the trailer. I opted to do it today insted of grabbing the trailer last night without lights. I went this morning at 7:30, started it and basically finished just a few minutes ago. (Drive was 30 minutes plus couldn't find trailer keys for about 20) my gf called me being upset because I left her at her parents (where we been living since last april) and she was upset because I chose to repair the trailer insted of renting out a uhaul truck. I know it looks like its only $20 to rent a truck, but I know they charge by the mileage and probably some other stuff. I dont have much for money and I'm trying to save where I can right now with this move, yes it might be $50 for the day, but that's pointless if I can do the same for free, and my dads truck is more fuel efficient than the box truck is anyways even with a trailer.   She has an issue with the bathrooms at her parents house, her brother pees on the seat and she ocd with it so she dosent want to use any of the bathrooms in the house (4 total) she called me upset that I wasnt back yet and that I was leaving her with the baby for an extra couple hours while I fixed the trailer to use for the day.  She was upset that I left her there knowing she wouldnt use the bathrooms and that it was neglectful on my part to do so all to save money and the hassle of renting a uhaul.  So AITA for choosing to use a free truck and trailer at the expense of my gf comfort resulting in me being neglectful to her?	1642948986.0	sav49a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sav49a/aita_for_choosing_to_use_a_free_truck_vs_a_paid/	AITA for choosing to use a free truck vs a paid one
ikh1riqh	I (23 F) and my husband (23 M) have been together since high school. My relationship with his family has been very weird to say the least.  When we announced I was pregnant, the reactions were not what we were expecting but my husband tried to remain positive thinking it would resolve a lot of past issues. However, throughout my pregnancy his family were not very supportive. They encouraged a lot of stress and would start problems about petty things.  I am an avid traveler and enjoy trips and adventures. For my husbands sisters birthday we wanted to take her on a trip. But because I refused to take all his siblings as well, my MIL forbid us from going. When I was close to my delivery date I decided to take a trip with my friends as a graduation gift. My in laws had much to say regarding traveling even though my doctor and husband was fine with it.  MY SIL was very upset I did not take her on the trip and planned without telling her. While I was on my trip my MIL sent me hateful messages and called me repeatedly stating I need to come back home and I upset her daughter for “purposely going without her”. I got into a heated argument with them and chose to keep a distance from that moment on.  When I gave birth everyone was happy and helpful with the baby so we ignored the incident and moved past it. As time went on, more issues kept arising and my tipping point was reached. I noticed they would only want to see my daughter if it was at their house, if she cried they would tell me it’s time to leave, and even though I explicitly asked they do not post her, they would secretly take photos and post on accounts that had me blocked.  One night they invited me and my husband over and I chose to leave my daughter with my sister rather then bring her. My SIL (not talking to me) said to everyone how she never sees my daughter and my husband tried to stop her. I encouraged her to come over more often as my daughter is still a newborn and unfamiliar with the world. My MIL then stated she would not let her family come to my house as they do not like me and I upset my SIL with my last trip. I told them if they do not like me they will never love my daughter and no longer are allowed to see her. I cut off all communications and do not allow anyone to share photos or videos with them.   It has been a year since the incident and my daughter has only seen them on one rare occasion.  My husband understands and respects my decision but believes and hopes I will one day change my mind as it adds too much stress to his life. My family and friends are constantly telling me I was irrational and I am ruining my daughters life. They say my husband has a right to do as he pleases with his daughter and I am breaking his family apart. Every birthday, holiday and occasion I have to deal with an argument and judgment because of my decision.	1642950249.0	savjyo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savjyo/aita_for_forbidding_my_husbands_family_from/	AITA for forbidding my husbands family from seeing our child?
ixu064h4	My husband and I have a ten month old son. In a bit of a switch of roles, my husband has been fortunate enough to be at home with my son and I returned to work full-time, however, he is due to return to work on Monday, so this was the last day off he will have with him.      We decided to go out for lunch, taking our baby and our dog. We had a really nice time and had plans to go to a local park afterwards, to take the dog for a walk and also play with our baby on the park for the first time together. My husband has suggested taking him to a park numerous times, but I have always been of the opinion that he's too young for it. He managed to take him on some swings while off with him the other day, so assured me it was okay.  &#x200B;  The park was around a six minute walk from where we were parked, and it was a bit of a pain to get there. When we finally arrived, there was a note saying dogs weren't allowed on the playground (fairly common, I suppose). My husband went to get the baby out of the pram, and I asked him what he expected me to do with the dog. He suggested I watched them on the swings (the park was open plan, I could see the swings from where I was stood with the dog). I got annoyed and said I would look really odd just standing outside a park watching kids play and he then suggested if I didn't want to wait, I could walk the dog for a while. There wasn't anywhere obvious to walk him as we were new to the area. I then told him I would take our son on the park and he said he wanted to do it first.  &#x200B;  I didn't want to wait around and I told him I was going back to the car. He asked if I could wait and watch, as it wouldn't take long.  I wasn't in the mood for waiting around, it was cold and I said I'd see him back at the car. I walked back to the car alone and waited for him. He called me twice on the way back, I assume to ask me to go back, but I didn't have my phone out of my pocket so missed the calls.   &#x200B;  When he got back to the car, he was really angry. The trail back from the park was quite difficult with a pram and he was annoyed he had to do it without my help. He also said that this was our first trip to the park together and it wouldn't have looked "weird" for me to stand next to the park and watch. He felt like the disagreement had soured his last day off with the baby.  &#x200B;  Am I the arsehole for walking back to the car and leaving my husband with the baby in the park?	1642950166.0	saviw4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saviw4/aita_for_leaving_my_husband_with_our_baby_at_a/	AITA for leaving my husband with our baby, at a park?
xlw54	I (32m) have purchased a snowboarding lift ticket as well as bolster needle appointment a month ahead of time at the same Friday. I figured that at least I can use the weekend to recover from the snowboarding pain and side effects. I told my mom ahead of time as well about the appointment.   The Thursday before, my older brother (33m) and my mom (55f) suddenly told me that my cousin is coming over on Friday to spend time with us for the weekend. I informed them again that I won't be home on Friday and on the weekend I'm probably bedridden. Well, that is 100% the case. Also, on the same day, my mom came to my room, and told me that my cousin could sleep in my room temporarily.   Here's the current setting of our home. We have 1 small, 1 medium, and 1 master bedroom. My mom & grandma sleeps in the master bedroom. I sleep in the medium bedroom. OB sleeps in the sofa since my mom has her friend stays over for 3 months during her vacation from outside of USA. Because of this, my mom thinks we can fit my cousin to sleep in my room because it's the only room in the house that has a little bit extra space. I organized a little bit and gave my cousin the comfier mattress.   My cousin came Friday morning, I greeted her, and then left. When I'm home, I already felt feverish, chill, and fatigue. However, no one is home, so I just quickly wash up, then slept. The next day, I woke up in the afternoon and couldn't get out of bed at all. My whole body aches and my head was throbbing. I had to force myself to get up to eat and drink while holding the pain. Again, cousin & OB wasn't home. I just grabbed a quick bite and then went to my room again and that's my whole routine on Saturday.   Saturday midnight, OB & cousin came to my room, and asked if they can bring the mattress down to the living room when I was already sleeping. I told them to just take it themselves since I had no energy at all and they did.   This morning (Sunday) my cousin left without saying goodbye to me. She left the mattress, pillow, and blanket next to my room. When I asked mom & OB if cousin left, they all gave me a dirty look, telling me that my cousin is upset at me for not spending time with her. I retaliated, telling them that I already informed them ahead of time about my schedule, and how it's not my fault they planned things last minute.   Here's where I might be the butthole. I called them out on their poor planning skills, even dig out in the past where I couldn't go with them because they kept scheduling family vacations last minute (this is true). They got angry, telling me that I prefer friends over family anyway, and bet that if they scheduled things last minute, I'm still going with them. I told them that I wouldn't know because my friends never book vacations last minute (also true).   AITA? Did I went too far with my family?	1642950729.0	savq0a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savq0a/aita_for_not_spending_time_with_my_cousin/	AITA for not spending time with my cousin?
3hazwcvm	Lately I (M16)  have been struggling with being 'disrespectful' to my dad. Part of this stems from the fact that I am atheist, and my dad a conservative christian.  Apologies for formating, I'm on my phone.  Just now I had to go cook some rice for dinner. I went to the kitchen, but after looking where it was supposed to be, and places it's not, I went back to the living room and said "I can't find the rice." My dad said "It's in the cupboard in the corner." I replied saying "I already looked there." My dad then said "Just look better." He says these sort of things quite often, which annoys me, so I responded sarcastically "Ah thanks, I hadn't thought of that. I'll give it a shot" cue a big argument about being rude, etc. I told my parents that maybe I was disrespectful, but if I had told my dad to 'look better' that would also have been rude, so why should I be respectful if my dad can't respect me? That did not go down well. Anyways, am i the asshole for being rude?	1642951080.0	savubj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/savubj/aita_for_being_rude_to_my_dad/	AITA for being rude to my dad?
ixfsxxjj	Ok I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.  Here's a little background information, for about four years this girl in my class would always have an on and off relationship with me. A lot of drama would occur around our friendship. She would block me all the time, ignore me at school, and just be rude if she would speak to me. Keep in mind I attend a private school where there are only about twenty five kids per class and it's the same kids until you graduate. So untimely blocking her wasn't an option. This girl was always wanting to work with me on assignments. When I say always work with me, I mean literally every single assignment and project and sit next to me on tests. It was fairly obvious by the end of middle school that she was using me for grades and cheating off of me.  So back to the story, the girl, who at the time was (14F) and I was around the same age, she once again asked me to work on the English summative assignment with her. For further information, the English summative was to write a book. The time given to complete and bound your own book was about three months including December which has a two week vacation for (Winter Break). So when she asked me I said yes again. So for about six weeks we worked on the book together. When I say together I mean I did all the work as she played on her phone, snap chatting other people, texting her other friends, listening to music and making tiktoks. At this point in the story it was Winter Break. So during break I happened to catch a cold. However even when tested, my school is very strict and wouldn't let me go to school until I had absolutely no symptoms. So it took three weeks in addition to the two week winter break we already had before I could go back to school. So I did that. During that time is where the drama happened.   So we were working on google docs and this girl was never on our doc and never did anything. So one day my mom came up to check on me to see how I was doing and I was telling her about how I always have to do all the work whenever we would work on a project together. My mom advised me to take her off of the google doc and tell the teacher what's been going on and that you would like to work alone on the book. So I did just that. During my next zoom call I told my teacher what I had been experiencing while working with her and he totally backed me up and allowed me to go solo on the project. So I took her off the doc and I was really proud that I had stood up for myself.   It was a big deal when I returned. At school she'd literally ignored me. Keep in mind we sat next to each other by assigned seating in three different classes. The second day I went back to school and I noticed she grabbed her desk and moved behind me. I tried to move on but things only got worse till the teachers got involved. There was yelling but it got resolved, however I hope she still knows I will never work with her again.   So AITA for making her do the work herself a month before the due date?	1642951745.0	saw2mj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saw2mj/aita_for_telling_a_girl_in_my_class_that_i_will/	AITA for telling a girl in my class that I will no longer be working on the big English summative with her a month before the project was due?
8oodsfnc	Christmas of 2020 my brother gave me a note *as a gift* that said "IOU half of $ for you to get a new bed"  Backstory - I have lower back spasm issues and while working from home my back has been severely worse and it's gotten so bad that when I get up in the morning I was having trouble standing up straight right away. I had to do it slowly.   I purchased a sit to stand desk and maintain my gym schedule but for some reason my back still was in a lot of pain.   My bed is over 30 years old, it's a full size bed and you can feel the lumps of the springs when you're laying on it.   I found a sleep number bed (the cheapest they had) for $1300 - I wanted that one because you can adjust the firmness yourself to find what works best for you and I thought that would be perfect instead of trying out a ton of beds to see what would make my back feel better in the morning.   My brother laughed and said he wasn't expecting me to choose a bed that's so expensive and that he wants me to go to a store downtown (like a mom and pop place) to pick out a mattress there instead and he'd pay half, where they're like 100-300 a mattress.   I'm not someone who buys expensive things. I work really hard and have just enough to pay my bills.   My brother still lives at home and makes a lot more than I do.   I don't want to get some random mattress and not know if the firmness or softness will help my back or make it worse, that's why I really wanted to get the sleep number.   I got mad and told him I'll just buy it myself and put it on a credit card if he's going to add new rules to his crappy IOU gift he gave me as a Christmas gift and he's saying I'm being ridiculous.

gn4sz7td	My girlfriend (22F) and I (22M) have been dating for a pretty long time, the last entire year has been long distance because of our jobs, but I finally got a new job that allowed me to e in the same location as her. We have been talking about the move and our next steps in our relationship, and eventually I was finally able to move the 2000 miles across the country, and in with eachother. A couple months ago before I moved, her life long best friend (also 22F) graduated from college and decided to move to this city as well, and my girlfriend agreed to let her move in as well, since there would be an extra bedroom that she could stay in. It’s been about 2 weeks now that we’ve all been living together, and I hate it now.  For starters, her friend pretty much does nothing all day except smoke weed, FaceTime her friends, and blast music. She works a part time, minimum wage job and otherwise just sits here being obnoxious. She’ll walk in and lay down in the bed that my girlfriend and I are laying in, and just start talking about her many, many problems, or ask if anyone has weed she can smoke. The only good thing she contributes around here is doing dishes occasionally, but that’s it. My girlfriend didn’t think it was really annoying, but I’m really starting to regret moving in with her now, only because of her friend. I’ve told her I’m debating moving out, just to get away from her friend, and now she’s finally coming around to seeing why I’m upset. I’m mostly worried that this is going to have negative effects on our relationship - we don’t really get alone time as a couple, anytime we go out it’s not just us going out - it’s all three of us.  My girlfriend tried to tell me it was helpful having her here to share the rent cost, and her friend has a storage unit that we all split the cost of together for our extra stuff (mind you if she wasn’t living here we would have an extra bedroom to put all of our stuff in, so we wouldn’t need the storage unit). Now, the lease here is almost up, so we’re looking for a new place just for a short term, while we look to purchase a house. The only problem we’re running into now is we need a bigger place with more bedrooms and bathrooms since we have her friend with us, and the friend doesn’t want to pay the amount that it’ll cost us because her parents think it’s too much (they’re the ones that pay her rent).   Bottle all of this together and I’m really struggling to find a reason to want to stay here with them two, I’ve talked to my girlfriend about it and she’s understanding now, but she doesn’t know what to do because she doesn’t want to throw her best friend out of our place, but I really couldn’t care less about what happens to her, since it’s not like she moved here for any real reason.

9dgpj	 My  wife and I have been separated since the end of November.  We  have been fairly amicable in regards to the separation.  I would like  to work on our problems and get back together.  She does not.  The kids  (5 year old girl and 8 year old buy with ASD) have birthdays in February  and typically we would have a joint birthday party in the middle of the  month for both kids.  This would typically fall on a Sunday.  Sunday is one of my custody days.  I tried contacting her via messenger requesting to talk.  Here is what they looked like:  "Let  me know when you are available to talk.  If you want to come over for  dinner we're doing birria tacos or tomorrow I think we'll be doing ham."  This was ignored.  We  go into therapy and for the first time I bring this up.  I let her and  the therapist know that I have a laundry list of things with the kids  that need to be discussed and at the top of it is the kid's birthday  parties.  I haven't heard anything from my wife so I've had to start  looking at venues and setting the whole thing up on my own.  In therapy  she finally agrees to sit down with me and go over these things.  We  do so.  It's 99% decided that we'll be booking the local bowling alley  for the party.  I visit the place, everything looks good and I book the venue.  I contact my  wife and set up the facebook event and start the process of doing  invitations so the kids can have them ready for Monday.  I  ask her to look everything over and add whoever she likes to the event  to make sure I get it to her liking.  I hear nothing for 3 days and then  I get this:  "I’m  just going to  lay it out, the way you have taken over this birthday  really blindsided  me and is making me upset. I’m trying to be thankful  for having it  taken care of but the kids birthday parties has always  been something I  have planned and taken care of with minimal help or  input from you.  You were never interested in it and a couple times  missed most of the  party despite knowing when it was scheduled and  having ample ability to  keep yourself free. You taking complete control  of this down to going  ahead and inviting people (and random people who  are not family or one  of the kids friends) feels like a stab at me and  an attempt to have  control."

ix58m256	So I’m a cashier at a grocery store and this elderly woman comes in trying to buy a bottle of whine. Now, where I work, the register will not let me proceed with an alcoholic purchase unless I type in a month, date and year of birth. So I asked the woman for her date of birth and she coldly refuses to give it to me. Before I can reply she asks if it’s for rewards then gives me the day and month. I tell her I just need the year, again she rudely refuses to give it to me. So I cancel the transaction and proudly tell her that I won’t be selling the alcohol to her. She finally gives me her full date of birth to which I say: “Jeez, you act like I’m pulling teeth.” She says: “Excuse me?! It’s very unusual to ask someone for their birthday!” I tell her there’s no reason be so secretive about her birthday and if she’s going to be so secretive about it, she needs to stop being an alcoholic. She finally stopped arguing but after her purchase, she stood by the door and glared at me for the longest time.

93emnkeg	I am a disabled (f25) person who works at home on mon, wed, thu and fri, and moves to the agency on tue. I am living with a cleaning maniac who definitely has no time to do all chores at home and gets depressed over it. Due to my disability I am often unable to do stuff or move properly, but this time around I tried very hard to do most of the stuff that was to do at home that he never tells me to do because I could just faint during it. He often breaks down because of this untold stuff that doesn't get done, and I usually get afraid of trying to do it because it could end badly. This time, I decided to learn on the internet and do them anyway so that they could rest on their no work days. I failed to do it up to their liking, the laundry was correctly washed but badly put on the clothesline, some of the dishes weren't correctly sorted, clothes folding was incorrect, and there were spots I didn't vacuum properly. They ended up crying and ignoring me the entire afternoon and telling me that "if you can't do it good, don't do it." I was trying to not get him angry at me,for being weak and unable to do untold stuff, and avoid a mania crisis. I am now concerned if it was a good idea to try helping him on these chores while I didn't exactly know how he did it, or if I had to just not do anything and still get aggro'd.

ixv6vl9h	So I (19, non-binary - they/them), work at McDonalds. I love w/ my grandma, who is 60yo. She has to use oxygen, and she hurt her shoulder recently. I was on the phone with my dad, who got upset with me for wanting to call off of work to help her this Thursday with chores. She can only do so much on her own, we have a big dog and that dog has an appointment to get groomed. She can't get the dog in and out of the car on her own, so I told her I would try to call out of work to help her. Dad said that it is irresponsible to put family and chores over my job and that they'll see less of me and that chores and helping family isn't a reason to call off of work - but with my grandma's health declining and her shoulder hurting, I think it is. I told him that I'm going to try, because she needs all of the help that she can get. Dad thinks I'm ta, I disagree. AITA?  TLDR; Dad thinks me calling off of work to help my 60yo grandma is irresponsible and thinks I'm an ass for wanting to do so.	1642953527.0	sawp94	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawp94/aita_for_wanting_to_call_off_work_to_help_my/	AITA for wanting to call off work to help my grandmother
7qlg7efu	hello reddit users,This morning something happened that has me very angry,I was going to see my aunt to be able to reserve a game at a mall that is coming out soon, normal, my grandmother said that she would call my mother to see if she would let me use some money that I had saved for my own things that an uncle gave me grandfather and my father, and they both told me that I would like the money in whatever I wanted, and well I wanted to pre-purchase a game, the point is that my mother and grandmother are angry with me because that money could be spent on notebooks, uniforms and paying a preparation for the state test this year, the ICFES in the case of Colombia, the point is that my father and my grandfather, as I already said, told me to spend the money on whatever I wanted, and in the case of my father I He said that I manage my own money and that I should not let my mother spend my money, that I should spend it myself on whatever I wanted.  The question is that first of all we don't have money problems and by law they would in theory have to subsidize uniforms, notebooks and all that, it makes me angry that my mother has a good salary and it seems to me that she is being very stingy, according to my grandmother. She is still paying for some things but I ask her to explain which ones and she says nothing, and according to her if I spend that money she will not buy me uniforms, notebooks and the preparation for the state test, but I want to spend my money on my own things , I am 16 years old and it should not be my obligation to pay for these things, if we had serious money problems I would understand, but my mother has a super salary as I already mentioned and in fact she did not claim me for those things about me paying for notebooks, uniforms, etc. before my great uncle and my father gave me that money, then, am I THE AITA for getting angry that my mother does not let me use my own money for my own things?	1642953846.0	sawtx6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sawtx6/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mother_for_not_letting/	AITA for getting mad at my mother for not letting me use my own money?
bp1b7b0b	I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. I (27F) live with my partner(28M). I love him and his family and very much. My partner’s family is Chinese, my family is as white as wonder bread. My mother planned a party for my younger sister and I (her bday is close to mine) without any input from me. I’ve had many conversations with my mom about not considering my schedule, not asking for input, the lack of notice (less than 24 hours notice) and has what I feel is an unrealistic expectation for me to rearrange my schedule and miss my partner’s family events in favor of her last minute planning. We got into an argument in November(I refused to go to an event because of it). She got input from my younger sister as always for this birthday celebration just not mine. My partner’s family is celebrating Chinese New Year on the same day that my mother informed me I’m expected to celebrate birthdays. I told her this was planned weeks ago and she didn’t check with me on dates, times or even what I wanted. My partner and I have always done our best to be fair to both our families splitting time between both for holidays, trying to be flexible and make it work, etc. So I again tried to figure how to split it. My mother was angry and went on a rant about how I’m “missed at family events” and that she finds me prioritizing  “a New Year” to be ridiculous. I corrected her and stressed the cultural significance and even sent her a video as she demanded “well explain it to me then”. I’m inclined to say no and not go at all. Here’s where I may be the asshole, I missed 1 family event in the past due to her last minute planning and she did put in effort to plan a bday party for me. I see it as this could have been avoided had she been better about communicating. I try to be accommodating but I feel I need to set firm boundaries. Plus I find her trivialization of Chinese new year to be racist and this isn’t the first time she has made insensitive comments. I brought up how she wouldn’t expect my sister to miss Jewish holidays with her in-laws so why would it be acceptable to expect me to miss Chinese New Year. I told her no due to her behavior and she sent a text stating to think about it and let her know in two days if I’m coming.

pc9az	I'm allergic to mangoes. It's the only food allergy I have, I ate it once and was sent to the hospital where I passed out. It seems I only have a reaction if I actually eat it, being around them doesn't seem to have a reaction, but it's not like I've done extensive testing to see at what point I have a reaction. I prefer to just not be around them, especially considering we live in the US where a hospital bill is at least $1000.  I've been living with my boyfriend for few months now, he loves mangoes. He mentioned buying some for the house. I asked him to please not bring mangoes in the house. I don't care if he eats them, he has a fridge at work where he can enjoy any amount of mangoes he wants. I just don't want them in the house. He called me irrational. He does this a lot when we don't agree, he says I'm either overreacting or being irrational. I used to think I was a perfectly reasonable person, but I don't know anymore.  I think I might be the asshole because it might be controlling of me to tell him what he can and can't have in the house. He thinks everything should be fine as long as I don't eat them.

i6bpq5ip	Backstory: I(f) have been with my bf for almost 4 years. We hit a rough patch due to me being flirty with a couple of guys over the internet recently(a couple months ago) It was only flirting but I will say that, yes, flirting is still a major fuck up. I still feel terrible for what I did and have vowed to never hurt my BF in any way form or fashion, intentionally. Now a few weeks ago, a few of my coworkers had invited me to go spend the day with them, six flags, golf, dinner and then home. I didn’t see it as a major thing personally. Now, I’m still actively trying to repair my relationship that I’ve messed up at this point. I inform my boyfriend that I want to go with them cause it’s just for the day because it sounds fun. All I do is go to work, go home. I don’t get to do many fun things outside of that. My boyfriend gets upsets and brings up my past flirting and basically tells me that because of that, if I go with them, he’s going to dump me. I don’t want to test it but at the same time I would really like to spend some time with them and hang out outside of work. I don’t want him to dump me, and I’m not trying to say that my friends are more important than my relationship. I just think dumping me over something like that is way too excessive.

a37fdqak	So, I had some bad food last night and got sick.  My wife has repeatedly requested that when I hurl, to do so in the toilet.  There are a few reasons why this is tough and I refuse.   For one, I might have just been there (which was in fact the case last night).  2, It's a tough position to get in if you are about to throw up, and 3, clean up is actually tougher.  I always just throw up in the sink, and I did so last night.. I also cleaned it spotless afterwards with lysol, It looks better than before and is way cleaner than before.  Her problem is that now she thinks it's gross for her to use that sink.  I say that it's equally gross for me to try to position myself in our small bathroom to hurl in the toilet that I was just sitting on.

(i found out after this fight that she has defended a well known racist as well, but i also know that this isnt the reason he hates her because i know him pretty well.)  i asked him if he followed her on another account just to mess with her, and he said yes, and that he hoped she was paranoid for days. i tried to gently tell him that this wasnt healthy for him to be doing, and he got mad and wouldnt talk to me for like an hour when i ended up apologizing again, and then things didnt go back to normal until the next day.

ek7irbuh	I (19f) graduated high school back in December of last year (2020) and wanted to take a gap year and work full time before I was supposed to start college in the spring of 2022. I told my parents about my plan and was ok with it.          Well a lot happened in a year I got a boyfriend and ended up getting pregnant. I still wanted to go to college but not the one I was planning on going on in the first place since it was far away. Lucky we live just 30 minutes from a community college and I was planning to go there instead but my mom refused saying they already spend the college funds they saved for me on my grandpa.        My grandpa moved here from another country due to some “health reason” and my mom wanted to take care of him. I never had a great relationship with my grandpa(I hate him)and that was very well known in my family especially to my mom. She told me since I got pregnant the assumed that I was not going to college but I discussed with her when I found out that I still wanted to go to college. My dad never knew what my mom did with my college funds and is now also very angry with her. My mom made the excuse saying that grandpa is very Ill and doesn’t have long left but he doesn’t have any health issues and is perfectly fine.        When I ask her what exactly she did with the money she told me she used it for renewing his visa and his medical bills from before he moved here.I…was…angry so I lashed out at her saying how I worked so hard in school for some scholarships and in my job so that I could help pay for some of my college expenses just for you to say that you wasted all of it on someone I hate. I went on a full on rant and she did the same it didn’t stop until my older brother and my dad had to stop us. My older brother took me out of the house and we got milkshakes to help me calm down. (thank you bro I owe you one) He said he’s agrees with me about what mom did was wrong but also to think about the baby. I don’t want the baby to stop me from going to college but since I can’t afford college and a baby I’m left with working full time until the baby is born. I feel bad about lashing out at my mom because she is still my mom at the end of the day and maybe one day I’ll get over my hatred for my grandpa but probably not any time soon. Am I the asshole?	1642954467.0	sax2bj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sax2bj/aita_for_lashing_out_to_my_mom_about_my_college/	AITA for lashing out to my mom about my college funds?
7ekzhfnk	This is a small tiff between me (32f) and my SO (38m) but it is very typical of our relationship so I could really use some opinions. Walking to the barn to milk the cows at 8pm. Its dark, I forgot my flashlight. The ground is solid ice, I have ice boots, its warm but the wind is very strong. I ask "Please can you wait for me?" He replies "You have fucking ice boots and I can still fucking walk faster than you." I stop. Gently set down my milk pail. Try not to cry. He says, "Okay, fine fuck I'll milk the fucking cows you walk home." And walks off, leaving me in the dark. I take a few deep breaths and decide that I'd really rather not walk home (20 min walk) and I slowly make my way to the barn. When I get there I keep my head down and don't make eye contact. He yells "What are you gonna pout? You are acting like a child!" I say nothing, just breathe and don't cry and milk the cow. After I'm done milking I ask him to apologize, and he does, kind of. Later when he tells me he loves me I say "Even though I walk slow?" in the most sincere of ways and he gets it and says yes. It's the next day and my feelings still hurt, but I don't let that show. So AITA?  TLDR: I walk slow and cry easy, bf walks fast and swears lots.

6ijjp588	My bf and I have been dating for a few years and have been somewhat open about our negative experiences in past relationships. I recently asked him if he was comfortable going into more detail about what exactly happened so that we can avoid the same mistakes as we’ve been talking more and more about marriage. He’s always said that he doesn’t care about talking about them and that it doesn’t matter because it’s in the past and we’re together now. After going into detail he’s recently begun to blame me for making him depressed and bringing up the past after he explicitly stated to me multiple times over the years that talking about them wouldn’t bother him.  I’m not sure what to do at this point. He seems like a completely different person now who takes all of his anger and frustration out on me. I’ve apologized profusely, offered to give him some personal space, go to therapy with him, etc. but he ignores me, blames me, and gives me the silent treatment when he’s not yelling at me. Im considering taking a break from our relationship. Am I in the wrong for bringing it up in the first place and for feeling the way I do?	1642955407.0	saxexo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxexo/aita_for_asking_my_bf_about_his_past_traumas/	AITA for asking my bf about his past traumas?
94rrd7qh	I'm aware the title is hard to understand, but here's the story. Basically I had a friend, let's call her Kelly. She was a year or two younger than Me, and i had been friends with her for about 7 months at the time. We had gotten a new friend I'll call Frankie, he was nice, one of his friends found out about Kellies age about a week into being friends, and said he wasnt ok with being friends with her because of her age, Frankie agreed with his friend, so Kelly got her other friends to attack him, and also making fun of his name (he is trans) She flipped the story around to me, which I found out by talking to Frankie and looking looking the messages, I confronted her and she said that she didn't want to talk about it, so I started getting angry and ended our friendship. I then became friends with her again a week or 2 later. She then got mad at me a few days later for telling Frankie about what she said to me about it all, ending our friendship AGAIN causing me to become friends with Frankie and all his friends.

84ehrqfn	I (27F) am suffering from schizophrenia and daily anxiety that causes my energy to be generally lower than people who are not mentally ill. My friend (24F) suffers from PTSD due to a challenging childhood. She is going through a rough time at the moment, and I try to support her, with the spare energy I've got. I do things like seeing her at her place (it's a 30 min. walk from my place) buying her groceries and cigarettes, taking out her trash when I leave, and lending her money from time to time. When I see her, we watch what she wants and listen to the music she likes. I help her look after her son, as she doesn't allways have the energy  being a single Mother. She spends a lot of time on her phone, so when I am there we mostly talk about how she is doing for an hour or so, until she calls someone or starts texting, and she puts something on the TV, for me to watch while she does so. The other day I brought up the issue about me having to walk the 30 minutes to her place, and walk home (often after dark) and sugested we could be at my place half the time. She told me that due to her childhood, she doesn't like leaving her place unless it is for a party or something like it. I got really sad, and told her that due to my anxiety and low energy lever, I couldn't continue showing up several times a week, like we are used to, which made her dissapointed. I really want to support her and her son, I just don't know how to, without over exhausting myself. Am I the Asshole for bringing it up, when I know she his gping through a hard time?	1642955716.0	saxjag	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxjag/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_friend/	AITA for saying no to my friend?
b6px8fzn	My beautiful daughter "Maggie" turned 16 last month and is trans (relevant). Over the summer we moved halfway across the country. Mixed experience for Maggie. Obviously it was hard for all the usual reasons, but she was excited to start fresh.  For context: she passes very well. She more-or-less looks young for her age.  So in the lead-up to September, she told us that she didn't want to be "out" at her new school. She wanted people to just know her as a girl, not as a trans girl. I admit, my wife and I weren't sure what to make of this, but she seemed happy. She quickly made friends with several other girls her age (especially one girl "Brittany," important soon), things were going smoothly, and we relaxed a bit.  Then Friday I get a text from Maggie's best friend back home (we'll call her "Jenna") asking either me or my wife to call her, and not to tell Maggie yet. Basically, Maggie has been hanging out with both Jenna and Brittany online, and Brittany would sometimes say very transphobic things (along the lines of trans women not being real women, or they're gross, you get the idea), and Maggie would *laugh along and agree*. Apparently Jenna privately called her out, and Maggie begged her not to say anything or out her, said Brittany was an amazing friend otherwise, so on. Jenna, bless her heart, didn't want to be cut off from Maggie, so she agreed.  So then last week they were hanging out and Brittany made a comment about some "pervert" at school, and Maggie tries to change the subject but it all comes out anyway: there's another trans girl at the school and Brittany has been bullying her. In front of/with friends. *Including Maggie*. And Maggie has done nothing to help this poor girl or distance herself from Brittany.  This led to a massive fight between Jenna and Maggie, and they haven't spoken since. Now Jenna figures if she can't salvage her friendship with Maggie, she can at least maybe help her by telling us.  I exploded. I don't have room for details, but I tore a strip off Maggie for being a part of this, confiscated her phone, grounded her, and told her never to speak to Brittany/that group again. This shot her weekend plans to hell, it's been two days, and she hasn't spoken to me since.  My wife has been on my team in front of Maggie and is horrified by what's been going on, but she thinks that we can't expect to "forbid" teenagers from seeing one another, and I've now cut Maggie off from some of the only friends she has out here.  But I just don't get it. I've tried talking to her, but she just won't and I don't want to push her too hard. Her mother convinced her to bump up her next appointment with her therapist, grudgingly, but otherwise she hasn't had much luck either and she thinks we made a mistake.  So, here I am. I feel badly for the way I reacted, but I also don't see how else I *could* have. My little girl is enabling a *transphobic bully*, and I don't see how she can live with herself. Every time I think about it I just see red.

gnbd8330	I know the title already is rocky.   I (19F) don't want to be controlling or toxic. I love my boyfriend (19M) so much, and I don't want to ruin this relationship based on something stupid like who he can and can't hang out with.   The whole argument began last summer. Him and I went on a group vacation with six friends we graduated high school with (Four girls and two boys). The whole trip the girls gave me constant criticism for the way my bf and I acted. Saying we held hands too much, or that we talked too often, or even that they were upset my boyfriend rode all the roller coasters with me and not them. Petty stuff.   Things have only gotten worse since then. But the annoying thing is that they only ever talk to me about it, so I get upset, but they never have anything bad to say to my boyfriend. So he knows about all the drama, but doesn't have the emotional stake in it that I do. It all really came to a head at the beginning of this month, when I was on the phone with my one "friend" and she confessed to me what everyone says about us behind our backs. Even that his supposed best friend joins in and bashes me.   I cant do this with them anymore. I told my friend it was nice knowing her but don't expect me to be hanging out with them in the future. And since then I haven't responded to any of their messages.   My current predicament is deciding what to do with my boyfriend. I don't feel comfortable with him continuing to hang out with these people who apparently hate me. I don't want to see them, or talk to them, or think about them. And I know that if my boyfriend is still in contact I am eventually going to have to face them.   I talked about it with him. Basically saying how I feel, and also trying to explain to him that neither of us deserve to be treated that way, especially not by our friends. He pushed back a bit, saying he doesn't think it's that big of a deal, considering that while talking to him *I* was talking about *them* behind their backs, too. After a few days of this he said he would just do what I do, but he doesn't have the same resentment for them, and if not for me he would have no issues whatsoever.   I don't what this to cause future issues, especially of I am overreacting.

1q6k1z3w	I ended things with my ex in October and when he moved out he left a TON of stuff behind. This includes small stuff like clothing up to larger items like work out equipment. Once he was gone, I gathered up everything of his that I could find, with the exception of larger items that I could not get up or down the stairs on my own, and put it all in the garage for him to take when he came back to return my house keys. That was several months ago. He has recently texted me that he wants to come back and get these larger items. The thing is, he left them behind because he didn't have anywhere to put them and didn't want to be bothered with it so he has essentially been using my home for free storage for almost four months at this point.  Since he has been gone I have started therapy, it was a very emotionally abusive relationship, and I have also moved on romantically. I've been working on my boundaries and the bottom line is, I don't want him anywhere near my home and never want to see his face again. There's no way I would let him come back if I weren't here either because who know what he could just decide is his and take from me.  WIBTA if I didn't let him come get these last few items? He has had months to come get them and at this point I just feel like he had planned on me just rolling over and allowing him to do whatever he wanted and I want to put my foot down.	1642956600.0	saxvay	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxvay/wibta_if_i_refused_to_let_my_ex_pick_up_his/	WIBTA if I refused to let my ex pick up his things from my house?
hynmy1lh	I (22m) got in an argument with my father (54m) last night.  I live with my dad bc I’m in school and my old roommates abused me financially. My car is in the shop.  Last night, we were on a road that has one turning lane and it's a busy road. We have both been up and down this road for years. He was in the middle lane (straight) and at the last second put his turn signal on and started to turn; there was another car coming that I'm sure almost hit us but he says it didn't.  I said “what are you doing, you're going to get us in an accident?!" a little loud, because I was scared.   He said that both lanes there were turning lanes. I said no, it's not. He switched his story and said "oh, well, I'm used to turning from the right even when it's not a turning lane because I drive a tractor trailer." There was no indication that he was going to turn.  So, now I'm on edge.  We're going up a road and he goes to make a turn right in front of another car he stops for a second and decides to just go in front of them and speed up to 40 in a 25. He was still speeding and about to go through a red light, so I said "red light.”  He was on the phone with his sister, he asked me what my problem was and that he can see what's around him. I asked him what his problem was driving so recklessly with passengers in the car. He hung up with his sister and started to yell at me about how his sister is going to be worried about him when he's on the road now in the truck because I couldn't keep my mouth shut, he wants to have a little bit of fun in his fast car that he bought. He can never just have a nice night with me and that I dig too far into everything.  This brought up that he was right to ignore me for 13 hours even though he heard the phone, got the text, and heard me knock on his door when I needed to ask about my school books that he moved. I work 35 hours a week, am taking 19 credits this semester, I pay for my own school.  I couldn't take it anymore. I was 45 minutes from home. We were in a parking lot, but he was moving the car. He told me he'll take me home. I opened the door and got out. He told me I shouldn't have gotten out of a moving car and to get my a\*s back in the car. He called me about 3 minutes after I got out of the car. He told me he didn't want me to walk home. He called me back. I hung up. My phone died. If it didn't he would've kept calling me, and if I didn't answer would've left me dozens of nasty voicemails and texts.  The entire walk home he's driving past me and pulled over once. I ignored him and kept walking. I went on another road after he passed because I didn't want him following me anymore.  I’m minding my own business for 3 hours when he sends me a text saying "You shouldn't have walked home. That was wrong." then tried to call me 3 times.  AITA here?   TL/DR: Dad and I got into an argument. Instead of fighting more, I got out of the car and walked home.	1642956708.0	saxx18	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saxx18/aita_for_walking_home_after_my_dad_and_i_go_into/	AITA for walking home after my dad and I go into an argument?
7zwlxp6m	I (24F)grew up without my dad in the picture, I barely remember him from when I was 5 years old. Well, about 1Y ago someone messaged me on FB saying they’re my family and they’ve been looking for me all these years. I tried to ignore it but they knew details about my life no one else would know so I decided to message them back and find out. Indeed, the person who messaged me  turned out to be my brother, I know bc I have one picture of my dad and he’s his spitting image. He said my dad passed away 6yrs ago and during his last days he said how much he regretted not being in my life and how much he wished he was a better father,etc.For context, he and my mom met at work, they had a short romantic relationship before my mom found out he was married and had 4 kids. When he knew she was pregnant he told her to forget about him, he’d give her some kind of monetary support but that’s all. After I was born he’d come around like twice a year, up until I was 5, then he disappeared forever. I was shocked that 1) they found me after all these yrs and after I moved to the US (I’m from South America) and 2) OMG I have all these Family members! I literally have nieces and nephews that are my own age. Until now it’s just been me and my younger brother (not his son) After thinking if I should Keep in contact with them and get to know them, I decided I should. I asked my mom and she said that it’s not their fault what their father did and it’s okay to want to know more. Well it’s been a year and it’s been great so far. We talk on WhatsApp, we call and video chat regularly, I even feel close to them and definitely consider them family, there’s been talk of me visit them in my country of origin and finally be face to face.  Well, the ISSUE now is that I had recently become a US citizen and when I submitted my application I decided that I’d like to change my last name, just to keep my mom’s. The reason is simple, I don’t wanna have my dads last name, I never really knew him and I don’t feel identified with it. My mom is the most amazing mother and has worked so hard and sacrificed so much for me and my brother, I don’t need my dad’s last name. When I became a citizen with my new name, I changed all my social media name as well.  And that’s when my new “family” messaged me asking why I did such thing, I respectfully explained that while I’m very happy we found each other, I don’t identify with that last name, I only want to keep my mom’s. They all got so mad! They said things such as how dare I disrespect the memory of our father, he would be so sad and disappointed with my decision and how I’m rude and disrespectful. But he wasn’t in my life, I grew up without him, I don’t know him. I don’t even resent him because he just wasn’t present. There are no feelings towards him no good nor bad just none. I’m happy I have more family, they exist and somehow they are present via phone. I want to keep my relationship with them but I don’t owe it to them to keep a last name I don’t feel identified with.

enpfy7q7	So I (29f) live with my sisters. We have the most adorable dog - mixed collie female named Indie.  She is a rescue and had a terrible habit of sitting staring when we ate our dinner when we first got her. She also had a tendency to sit under our dinner table but after training her she now takes herself away to one of our rooms to lie down while me and my sisters eat dinner.   The other day we were eating dinner, I get so uncomfortable on our kitchen chairs that I tend to get up a few times and rearrange the way I sit. This day I had no idea the doggo was under the kitchen table and accidentally kicked her. It wasn’t hard or anything but my dog yelped. I got a bit mad and for some reason thinking dog would understand told her she knows not to come into kitchen when we are eating dinner, dog ran outta kitchen into one of our rooms. I immediately gelt awful and got up to check on her and my sisters asked what just happened as they to be fair were not paying attention.   My Indie seemed fine and her tail wagged while giving her a much deserved belly rub. She is too pure and is there a better feeling than when your dog wags there tail with happiness to see you?  But one of my sisters said I was a bit of an AH for not being aware off my dog and checking under the table. I got super defensive with that and we ended up in a verbal argument and where pretty nasty to each other. Now neither of us is speaking to each other and I don’t know if I should make the first step to apologise. So AITA? maybe I should have been paying more attention.	1642956994.0	say0w8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say0w8/aita_for_kicking_my_dog/	AITA for kicking my dog?
ixxmny9v	I F(51) and D(19) 'Joan' recently got into a heated argument and we are turning to random strangers on the internet for guidance in determining who is right. (I say 'we', as this post is her suggestion)  My kids were raised in a traditional, but non-religious, family. Husband and I have been married over 25 years. Although it was even admittedly rare back in the 90's, we actually waited until we were officially married before we had sex for the first time.   Currently, Joan is attending college and lives with us in our developed basement with a separate entrance. Our two other kids have moved out for good. Although Joan is not in a relationship, she is socially active and dates on occasion.  The issue - Last night, Joan was out with friends, and as mothers are prone to do, I never fall completely asleep until I hear her come home. So, last night, she was back around 1:00 AM and as I was still fully awake, I went downstairs to see how her night went.  I was, however, wholly unimpressed when I saw her on the couch with a guy she had just met that night. They weren't engaged in anything (yet) however, it was evident where events were likely to lead.  Although I was polite, I commented to Joan that she really needed to get to sleep as we were planning an early morning walk, and I waited patiently as her 'new friend' got the hint and left.  Afterwards, Joan was livid, and says that I thoroughly embarrassed her, and that, as she was an adult, she should be able to see whomever she wants, whenever she wants, and wherever she wants.  My position is that she is an adult, however, she has no right to bring a stranger into our house without my knowledge as:  1. It's a pandemic. We're all fully vaxxed. However, we have no idea of his health status. (She says that argument is a red-herring BECAUSE we are fully vaxxed and otherwise healthy) 2. Our house belongs to her dad and I. I'm not comfortable with having a complete stranger spend the night. (Her argument is that she's still a dependent as she's going to college and it's still her house too) 3. Although I don't approve, I agree that as an adult, she can engage in whatever legal activity she chooses. However, Not in my house. She knows my views on pre-marital sex, and by engaging in the activity in my house, with me at home, is a massive sign of disrespect. 4. If she really wants to spend the night with a random stranger, that's what hotels are for. (Her argument is that, although she's working, she's saving for her future, and that would be a stupid waste of money)  So, AITA for making her friend leave, or should I just ignore my long-held belief system and accept her choices as an adult?	1642956995.0	say0wg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say0wg/aita_for_not_allowing_my_collegeaged_daughter/	AITA for not allowing my college-aged daughter 'sleep-overs' at our house w/opposite sex
ixx4vb4x	MIL doesn't like me. She isn't the typical MIL with baby rabies who thinks I stole her little boy. It's kind of weird, because she isn't too attached to her son and has mostly healthy self imposed boundaries, but still just likes to piss me off.  This has been a challenge for years because she is good at it and she is subtle. She thinks I'm an idiot because I'm not as smart as she is. she looks down on me because being a mom is really my passion. My husband and I both like our lifestyle of me not working, so it is important that he maintains an income that allows me to be a SAHM.  He works in a field where networking (ass kissing) is everything. It is really important that the boss likes you. MIL should understand because her husband is in a similar field and he is the boss, so their wives suck up to her.   MIL became friendly with my husband's boss and his wife at our wedding. This does make me a little uncomfortable because mixing work and pleasure, but I don't view it as my business. With my husband's current boss everyone knows you have to suck up to the wife. Most of his previous ones had like a mistress in an apartment somewhere, but this dude loves his wife. I don't think she is the biggest fan of me, but I play nice.  She told me she was a medical scientist and I thought that was a weird term and I'd never heard it. I was casually unloading to my mom about the stressors of my husband's job and how awful some of the wives are (MIL was there) and I mentioned her being pretentious and that she told me she was a medical scientist but I don't know if that's a real thing. MIL told me she worked in cancer research and I was like oh that makes more sense.  Anyway MIL told the woman and his boss made a joke about it in front of me and my husband. My husband called MIL to confirm and MIL admitted they were talking about me and she thought it was funny. I took the phone and screamed at her that she is fucking psycho and went way too far this time. She is endangering her son's job and her grandbabies lifestyle and for what to take some digs at me. My husband agreed with me.  After the conversation I said he needs to really lay down the law, so whether that is not seeing her for a while or something else, he needs to do something in terms of boundaries. He said he just wanted to let it go and see if she messes up again with the boss's wife. I accused him of not being proactive and being afraid of his mom. I said he wasn't being a good husband or provider and I would not be letting this one go.	1642957120.0	say2lp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say2lp/aita_for_blowing_up_at_mil_for_effecting_my/	AITA for blowing up at MIL for effecting my husband's job and telling him she needs harsh consequences this time?
8rsggyaw	My girlfriend of almost 3 years has a an intimate relationship with her boss, ‘John’. They text each other all day, every day. He shares with her very personal “journals” and other thoughts about life etc. My gf feels a strong connection with John. She spends hours every day waiting for him to message, reading his messages, taking screenshots of his messages, and responding with paragraphs to his messages. I read their conversation once (which I admitted and apologized for), and they were saying things like “I love you”. My gf says it is a non-sexual, romantic love.   For months, I have felt 2nd-best to John. All I want is to come home from work and to feel like my gf is present with me, not on her phone. She sees this as controlling.   My gf is uncomfortable telling John how much time he takes up in her day - she doesn’t see it as a problem.   On Friday night, we were watching a movie, and halfway through she pauses the movie to text John. I’m not talking a 30-second message, I’m talking 10 minutes, paragraphs of a message. I was hurt - we can’t even watch a two hour movie without John interrupting. I felt at a loss - what could I possibly do to get my message across that this isn’t okay?  Saturday, I decided to message John myself (from my phone, I had his contact info already). I said who I was, and explained how much my gf admires him and feels mentored by him. I then stated how much time she spends messaging him and waiting for him to message, and how it’s having a negative impact on our relationship. I ended asking if we could work together to find more balance.   Instead of texting me back, John messaged my gf, asking if she knew I had messaged him.   My gf is now beyond angry with me. She thinks I went behind her back, that I broke her trust, and that im a manipulative asshole.

71ehe27d	Hi Reddit, I know this seems silly but I would like to know if I’m being insensitive.   TLDR; I feel like a butthead for not being more understanding towards my boyfriends cats.   Okay, so let me start this post out by saying I love cats. I’ve never had one as a pet in my home growing up, but I like them. I have always had dogs, and I currently have a 2 year old large dog, he’s very sweet and I’ve worked hard to make sure he is well trained and has manners around people. Now, my bf of 2 years has helped me raise him, but he has always had cats. He has 4 actually. I love them, but good lord they are disgusting. None of them I think have been brushed in years, there are only 2 litter boxes so they often overflow or get full, so they walk on their own shit. They have no “boundaries”, a few examples include drinking out of the faucet or shoving themselves into the sink if you try to brush your teeth, eating off of your plate or fork, knocking take out boxes off the counters, throwing up on clean dishes and counters... My bf will get pissed if I leave food on the kitchen counter, because the cats will knock the plate onto the floor and eat it. You have to battle them off the stovetop while you’re cooking so they don’t set their paws on fire or eat out of the pot as you’re cooking! They puke where you can see it, like in your bowl of oatmeal or work lunchbox, my favorite was when one cat jumped onto the counter as we were having dinner and coughed up half a hairball onto my fork I had set down for 10 seconds. I understand they are cats, not dogs, but am I being THAT insensitive to tell my bf that the cats shouldn’t be walking where we eat if he isn’t going to keep the litter box clean, or just shouldn’t be all over the counters in general? He gets upset and says they’re too old to be taught differently. My dog does not counter surf, he is fully house trained, rarely barks, waits politely outside of the kitchen while I am cooking and would never steal food off my plate.   Am I being too critical?	1642957630.0	say9x2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/say9x2/aita_for_telling_my_bf_to_get_his_cats_under/	AITA for telling my bf to get his cats under control?
ixz7sqds	I (23M) have been with Megan (21F) for five years.  Megan and I started living together when she was 16 as her parents kicked her out; she pretty much took on a large role in our family by cooking and cleaning - at that time the household was us, my parents and three siblings so it wasn’t an easy thing to do. My mother suffers from mental health, potentially personality disorder but no solid diagnosis (Megan believes it’s narcissism but she and my mother don’t get along)  Megan originally insisted that she was fine cooking and cleaning but she then came to the realisation that my parents thought it was expected since she didn’t pay rent.  We had our son and moved out where Megan usually cooks and cleans, we rotate days where I do Mon,Tue and Sun - I usually cook just meat for me and my son whilst Megan cooks whatever she wants, on her nights she does cook both meat and vegetarian but when I’ve offered to cook vegetarian for her she said she doesn’t like the seasoning or she doesn’t trust that I’ll use different spatulas etc.  My mother decided to visit for a few days and it’s been hellish because Megan is going through a phase where she’s experimenting in the kitchen; home made pasta sauces, chilli, sweet and sour and curry and usually they’re nice! At least our family unit enjoys the meals   Megan made the mistake of  not cooking meat and instead and did  a vegetarian bolognese…which had carrots in. Now my mother and I do not eat carrots, I did try the pasta and it was nice! My mother refused to try it and offered to buy take out instead and I took her up on the offer, it was just Megan and our son who ended up  having the pasta.  My mother made a few snide remarks about how it isn’t normal, she found a beetroot pasta sauce and asked Megan if she’d try that next and Megan absolutely lost it on her saying she’s been at school and work all week, has ketones because of a UTI that’s spread to her kidney (she’s on antibiotics) and unfortunately my mother isn’t as able to sympathise so now my wife is being passive aggressive till she gets an apology off my mother, which point blank isn’t happening.  She’s still upset; despite me apologising but it’s been like a week now, and I do believe she’s exaggerating her illness because she’s on antibiotics - not at a hospital, last time I was sick with a cold I still cooked.

jc0iv	I get takeout from the same restaurant a couple times a month. The restaurant is next door to a furniture store. Both the restaurant and the furniture store are storefronts on a public street. The furniture store often places traffic cones next to the curb in front of their store blocking the parking spots. This makes it much harder for those of us coming to the restaurant to find parking spots.  &#x200B;  This morning, I parked in front of the furniture store just as a person (worker or owner, I don't know) was coming out front with traffic cones. As I exited my car, he politely asked, "Can you please back up a space or two (further away from the restaurant) because I have a box truck coming and need this spot?"   &#x200B;  I have been recovering from a broken leg and have a handicapped placard. But this restaurant just has street parking. So every time I come to pick up food, I have to park farther away and walk farther because the cones are always out. This person had no idea I had this pent up frustration building for months. But I did. So when asked, I responded with, "NO! You don't own the fucking street! This is a public fucking street and you can't fucking reserve it! Fuck you!" I walked away and he yelled behind me, "Have a nice day!" sarcastically.  &#x200B;  I went and picked up my food, came back to the car to find cones both in front and behind my car that I had to move to leave. As I was moving the cones, the same guy came out to pick up the cones and presumable place them in the street again. So I reiterated, "It's a public street asshole! You can't reserve a public street for your own use." He replied, "You got your spot, you got your food, now get out of here. I'm just trying to do my job." I repeated, "It's a public fucking street, fuck you."

idvmmsrx	So I recently bought co-owner ship of a Netflix account from DH Gate. I basically got the password to an open Netflix account. Everything was working fine until yesterday, when it said the the log in info had been changed!  I thought about contacting the seller on DH Gate, but it is China ya know…they got my money so they probably just disappeared:(. So I figured I have the e-mail of my co-owner of my account. I introduced, very nicely, and told them them the situation. At first it seemed like they were confused that I contacted them. I told them they needed to change the password back or tell me the new one so I can use it.  They said no and called my an asshole and thief.  I told them I bought co-ownership fair and square, and they were in the wrong to deny me my new account. Well they stopped responding, and now I am out 20 bucks.    But being called a thief really bothered me!

ivhxoqny	For context, I (17 M) Have been on and off with working since I would mainly focus on school but do some side gigs or do seasonal work so I can save some money to help me get my first car. My little sister is (13F) and has had a money issue in the past.  For a few days now, I noticed on my bank app that random transactions were on my card ( Ex. Apple-BILL, AliExpress and Depop), I originally thought these were late charges as I had ordered stuff from those places but when I called my bank, they informed me these look like recent transactions and I had to lock my card due to fraud.    The total of the amount of money that was taken out of my account was $67.39, I informed my mother about the situation and she said she would keep an eye on everyone in the family to see who was using it.   Today, I had to go to in-person school and I left my wallet at home, once again, I see another transaction of $1.05 was placed on my credit card and I received a message from a Depop account asking for confirmation of a squishmallow. Immediately I got upset, called my mom and demanded that she gets my sister and tell her that I know that she’s been using my card and that when I get home, she will have to pay me back.  I got home and my sister refused to give up any money, insisting that I can’t take her money and that she would do all my chores and that I can cancel the items she order but still refusing to give up any money. I got angry and went through my sister wallet and took out the whole amount that was taken out of my card.   My mom thinks that I went too far and that I was in the wrong and that my sister is going to have major trust issues with me but I don’t think I did anything wrong.	1642959760.0	saz3ps	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saz3ps/aita_for_taking_my_sister_money_after_finding_out/	AITA for taking my sister money after finding out she’s been using my card?
116v9u	My friend (30F) and I (30F) are planning on going on a cross country road trip to a music festival in a couple months. My friend is a disabled vet but while she has had dogs, she has never had a service dog. Her first dog is currently a 20yr old blind chihuahua. She’s always wanted to get another dog and recently adopted a German shepherd lab mix. She wants to train the dog to become a service dog. I have never had a dog and I’m not very fond of dogs in the first place. I don’t like the shedding and the drooling and a lot of them like to jump and lick, which I am not about at all.  The trip is in a couple months and we’ll likely be on the road for at least 3 weeks in my Chevy express 2500. It’s a small van for two people to live in. This new dog has yet to be introduced to me and I have no idea the temperament and quirks of this dog. I’m not sure if she can train it in enough time and I’d rather the dog not come at all even though she says the dog would be for protection as well. The music festival only allows service dogs not ESAs. But according to the ADA rules, the owner is allowed to train the dog and there are no real qualification terms for service dogs. She can just say it’s a service dog and whatever she decides it’s supposed to do to help her but the dog doesn’t have to prove it’s task is medically necessary.

h8y1n54d	I’m 26 M and my sister is 35 F and married with a kid and husband. They recently moved countries and came back home (dec 2021) so they sold their car and other stuff. We all live at home with my mom and other sister (29 F). We all have jobs but my oldest sister is married to a hot shot IT guy and they make a ton of money. Since they’re been back they keep using up a lot of stuff in the house including electricity and our cars. They talked about contributing but haven’t and as of the numerous times they used our cars never replaced any gas. Yesterday she asked me to borrow my car to go to the movies and I said no go ask my other sister to borrow hers because I just wanted to get take out for dinner. She didn’t say anything to me but didn’t end up going to the movies again. So I’ve resolved to not letting them use my car since they can afford to buy one and at least offer to pay for gas. My mom is telling me I’m being selfish because she is my sister and I’m not using the car right now as the want to go to the movies again today instead so AITA?	1642959677.0	saz2ex	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/saz2ex/aita_for_not_lending_my_sister_my_car/	AITA for not lending my sister my car?
ixz2yeqy	My (F22) boyfriend (M22) of almost 7 years, is the middle of his two sisters. His older sister is two years older than him, and considered the golden child and an academic. She always get the awards at university and has good marks. His younger sister (3 years younger) is also good at academics, and definitely their father's favorite. My boyfriend got average marks, but prospered in many other things.   It was little things at first, like when he wanted to go to the movies, he would ask for some money to pay, and his parents (especially his mom) would say "they don't have enough money." When his sisters would ask they would give them a lot. I thought that it might be that my boyfriend wasn't good with money, but when he asked his mom for a new pants for his uniform (which didn't cost a lot) she said there wasn't enough money, but they bought his younger sister a brand new guitar when she asked.   He says that he is used to it. On birthdays and Christmas, it is SO obvious that he is not equal. His sisters got Polaroid cameras and expensive clothing, whilst he got a backpack and socks.  I started to get treated the same as he did. His parents would buy expensive gifts for their daughter's boyfriends and sometimes get me things that are broken and/or used. I know that I/we should be greatful for what we get and that it's the thought that counts, but not when you have been with your boyfriend for 6 years and his sister's boyfriends (who have only been dating for a couple of months) get shirts that "show that you are part of the family now."   When they moved to the new house his sisters got to choose  rooms first. He was left with the smallest room. When his sister's boyfriends are at the house, they get to sleep with them in the bed, but because my boyfriend's room only has a single, we slept on the couches, but then his mother said that we aren't allowed to sleep on the couches because it "breaks" them, so we have to make turns in the night for who sleeps on the bed first and who sleeps on the floor.  When we all went on a camping trip together, his sisters got to choose rooms first and we (me and my boyfriend) had to sleep on a punctured inflatable mattress in the hallway. When he voiced his opinion on the matter of not being able to choose a room first for once, his mother turned to me and said "I heard you whining to him saying 'say it, say it, say it'" (I had said to him if he feels that he needs to bring it up, then he should say something-not that it was going to change anything). She usually twists my words and is a big gossip.   I brought up the blatant favoritism to his mother, she said that I was lying, jelouse and just trying to start problems between her and her and my boyfriend (my boyfriendand his mother do not always get along). It might sound like I am jealous but I'm really not. I just want my boyfriend to feel loved and appreciated in his home.

fdgcovn3	Sorry for the format or any errors I'm on my cell phone. No throw away because honestly I don't even care anymore.   So for background, my partners parents have always been really controlling, and for years we've stayed quiet about it as we are trying hard not to disrespect them. As of the beginning of the pandemic we've been staying with them. It sucks and we feel incapable but it's been tough getting out. First we had to move in with them from long beach. We have a two year old child and my partner had just graduated college when the pandemic started. He could not find work at all in his degree field and so he started working at a minimum wage job to hopefully save to get a place when we had enough funds. I've been unable to get a job because I have no family nearby and his parents weren't willing to watch out son, which is fine that's their right. They then told us last minute they were selling their house to move to Las Vegas and that either we come (moving me even further from my family) or we figure something out. My partner and I both worked hard to find work and a place back where my family lives and we did find a place but there was no way to pay for it on one income. I found a job but my partners fell through, so we ended up having to move with them. His father is really toxic and mean. Like majorly so. He's gone as far as saying I have zero skill, talks badly to my partner all the time, and even has hidden my partners mail from him. Now don't get me wrong, we appreciate him and having a home to live in, but he tries to control what we do every day. It's gotten to the point where he walks by my partners door and screams for him to "get the fuck up." Now we are in his home, and my partner has gone through for interviews for coding work and is just waiting to hear back. They were recent. But his dad is just driving me nuts. He yells at our son for simple things like making vehicle noises too loud or crying. I'm just at my wits end. There's a lot of details lost in this post but I feel as though I could BTA if I treated him the same way simply because we live with them. And that's understandable. He hates having us here, and we hate being here. He doesn't clean and doesn't cook. His wife does everything for him 100%. And now I'm at this point where when we leave I almost want zero contact. He's made racist, transphobic, and sexist comments. One being that women shouldn't run because their boobs will bounce too much and it isn't good for them. I'm just at my wits end.   So, WIBTA if I treated him how he treats us? Like what if I woke him up yelling? I'm sure I would be.. I think I more just needed to vent this out somewhere to strangers.   TLDR WIBTA if I was as rude to my almost in law that I live with when he's rude to us daily.	1642960733.0	sazhfu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sazhfu/wibta_if_i_treated_my_almost_father_in_law_the/	WIBTA if I treated my almost father in law the same way he treats my son, partner, and I?
ixywnne2	Hi all, throwaway so I can't be identified. I want to make it clear that I am actively looking for another job; this wasn't the deciding incident, but it didn't help. Please don't reproduce this story anywhere.  I work retail, which is a hell all of its' own. I live closer to the store than anyone else so I have become, by default, expected to do a lot of things, including open and lock up though I'm not remotely a manager. The door we use to get in is almost the whole length of the building away from the alarm panel, and there's another locked door inbetween, so whenever I open it's a race down to the panel to get the code put in before the alarm company is alerted.  What the entry door *is* very close to is the main till counter, a long counter with three tills and space inbetween. Under the counter, at the far end from where you enter it, is a soft backed copy that we all sign in every morning to show that we're in on time. (The company won't spring for an actual time clock.)  So this particular morning I let everyone in and raced down the shop, through the locked door, to the alarm panel to turn it off. Back through the locked door and up to the counter to start waking up computers. As soon as I get into view, one staff member shouts for me to hurry up and get the sign in book out for them; others join in, shouting and laughing. They all seem to think it's a big joke. (Please note, it's perfectly normal for them to wait for me, even though it makes them late because after signing in they still have to go upstairs, take off coats and bags and come back down. We don't have any rules about who can or can't go behind the counter, either.)  I walk behind the counter, down to where the book is kept, take it out, and fling it at them. (Soft backed copy, it didn't go anywhere near them, it just fell on the floor in front of the counter.) When they stop laughing, apparently surprised, I remind them that they're all perfectly capable of walking behind the counter themselves, and that they should do it in future because that's the last time I'm ever getting it out for them. I busy myself with starting the computers, and eventually someone picks up the copy and they all sign in, talking loudly about how some people can't handle a joke.  The next morning I open up, do the alarm and find that no one has gotten the book. I go behind the counter, take it out, sign myself in, put it away again and walk upstairs.  Now most staff are mad at me, talking about how I'm not a team player, won't help them out and can't take a joke. I shouldn't have thrown it, but I stand by the rest - they could easily be fetching it and signing in while I'm doing the alarm.

ixzvkhh0	I (65m) currently live at home with my pregnant daughter (26f). Her and her partner do have a place together but I live 5 minutes away from the hospital, compared to 30 mins to an hour commute from their place.  Now my house still uses a electricity meter where I have to top it up every week or so depending on how much money I put in. Last night I told my daughter i'd have to go out to get some more in the morning and to please not use anything she didn't need to, which is fine she did.   Well at 2pm today we still had power but I do admit it could have gone at any second. I mentioned to my daughter who was quite fidgety that I would have another cup of coffee and then go top up the meter. Well while I was a getting ready to go out I spilt the remainder of my coffee and decided to make a new one to which my daughter stormed upstairs. When I asked her what was wrong, she said she was going to run a bath to which I told her to wait. She snapped back at me that she had been waiting, that she hadn't used her phone incase the power went and she needed to phone the hospital. She went upstairs to the bathroom and I told her she hadn't dare run a bath.  She came back down 10 minutes later she had obviously been crying, I told her off saying she doesn't dictate when I top up the meter, that I will do it when I wanted to. To be fair my daughter did need to wash her hair, she says it gets greasy quickly since she's become pregnant.   I did put money in the meter and before anyone else asks my daughter didn't put any in because she has no money left since it's been 6 weeks from her last pay day as her company payed her early due to Christmas and she is currently waiting until she gets payed. Otherwise she would have gone to put money in the meter herself.  My daughter did have a bath, and she did some washing which is something else couldn't do she we didn't have enough power.	1642961100.0	sazn6n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sazn6n/aita_for_telling_my_pregnant_daughter_she_doesnt/	AITA for Telling my Pregnant Daughter She Doesn't Get to Dictate What I Do?

twpchrg	Happend <10 min ago.   Be me, 22M living in a foreign country where you don't speak the language. Book a flixbus ticket for a day trip to yet another country where you don't speak the language. I paid extra to reserve a seat, and then an additional fee ontop of that to book the seat next to me. Covid Era, I'm being precautions.  After a long day and freezing my behind off in the cold, I board the bus 20 min before departure. Find my seat... there's a purse in one of them. There's 2 people standing a little bit in front of the row a couple in their late 50s/ early 60s. I point to the purse and ask if that's theirs, she says it's hers. I tell her I reserved that seat and ask her if she can move the bag. Then she, in Slovenian, tries her best to tell me it's "normal" seats by saying normal and pointing at the seat while waving her arms around. I pull up my ticket and show her the seat reservation and tell her I paid for it. She still tries to insist open seating bc her husband is sitting across the aisle from my booked seats and I realize she didn't reserve any.   Realizing I'm going to get nowhere, I go to the driver and politely ask him if it's open seating because if I can't use my reservation, then I want the money paid for it refunded. He makes the woman move to the row in front of me while she mutters angrily.   Im really struggling to tell which of us is the Karen in this story, since my destination is the next stop (~2hrs away) and the bus is nowhere near capacity now that we're moving (which I couldn't have known at the time, since seat reservations showed ~80% booked when I bought them).

9slg18v2	Hi everyone,   My (20F) and bf (21M) have had a rough year resulting in a lot of conflict and growth of insecurities. As a result, his actions would trigger my anxiety at times and I'd start getting panicky and eventually my bf would start lashing out, telling me that I had become controlling and that he was fed up of my insecurities and him trying to take care of them. Sometimes, he'd even give me ultimatums and tell me that I needed to fix it otherwise he won't have a choice but to head out. During our fights, he has mentioned that I need therapy or even said that he'd go to couples therapy (which I suggested to him a few times) if I went to therapy/got medication for my depression and anxiety.   Eventually, we had another fight where he stonewalled me for a whole week and that's when I decided that I was going to start therapy and set up an appointment through my school's counseling center. My bf and I have a shared Google calendar to help us keep track of our commitments as we're both fairly busy people, and I made sure to add the appointments I had in the calendar, but I did not verbally tell him that I was in therapy.  A few weeks later, he noticed it in my calendar and got upset, saying that I should have told him and I said to him that I was not comfortable having a conversation with him about therapy because he mentioned it to me like I was the plague ruining his life and needed therapy to fix it. His response to me was that me going to therapy is a failure on his part if I did not feel okay talking to him about my emotional wounds and needed to reach out to a professional because he prides himself in being the person I go to. I pointed it out to him that you mentioned therapy multiple times to which he said that he expressed that out of anger and that I should have at least made him feel comfortable with the fact that I was relying on a professional because he has an insecurity that I would find emotional comfort in other people and then leave.   &#x200B;  AITA?	1642962457.0	sb06sl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb06sl/aita_for_keeping_therapy_a_secret_from_my_so/	AITA for keeping therapy a secret from my SO?
d97b7nxy	Background, I (18f) inherited a pretty nice 2bed 1bath house from my late aunt. My father (56m) said he was going to renovate it and make it really nice. This was said back in April of 2021, it is now January of 2022 and while he has spent a lot of money on it, no work has been done and the house is completely gutted and unlivable. Our agreement was I would give him $100 from every paycheck to pay back what I owe him, quickly though I felt like this wasn’t fair. He hasn’t gone to work on the house once in the past 2 months, in early December he spent 1 day (about 6 hours) there but prior to that there was nothing for about 4 months. I was paying him this entire time up until right around Christmas. When this deal was initially made in April of 2021, he assured me the house would be done by September 2021. Now he has pushed the date back and *hopes* for it to be finished by September of 2022. This doesn’t seem like it’ll happen because the house is completely gutted and he always makes excuses like being “too busy” or “too tired” and then I find him watching TV all day long.   Now here comes the issue. I still owe him $1500 for materials he’s spent, but I feel like I don’t owe him that if he won’t hold up his end of the deal. I do have intentions of paying him eventually, once he makes some progress. However he’s under the impression I’m not going to pay and has gotten my mother on his side too. She keeps leaving passive aggressive notes on my door “reminding me” that I owe this money or criticizing every purchase I make because she also thinks I owe my dad that money. I’m honestly sick of it and I would rather just go get an apartment and sell the house. I got such a shit end of this deal and I don’t know what to do. So, am I the asshole for not paying him back?	1642961647.0	sazv62	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sazv62/aita_for_not_giving_my_dad_1500/	AITA for not giving my dad $1500
6puqjg87	Hello reddit. I never thought I was going to post here but here we are. Anyway my sister and I was in church and we were listening to the church play music and she touched me. I thought it was on purpose and moved my hand for a bit. After a while I put it back and then it happened a few more times and I moved my hand. However there was one time that got me here so she touched my are, I move hand and she touched my back which I know was on purpose and I just moved one seat to the right. During the next song she pointed to the seat I was in previously and my dumb self thought she was asking if I wanted to sit down. And I shook my head left and right. She looked at me for a single second and just looked back at the main event.  A hour later we were leaving everything was fine until she said "I didn't appreciate you moving away from me" so I said "you touched me on the arm" and she said "it was a accident" we argued over this for a while and then she said the time she pointed to to seat wasn't asking me to if I wanted to sit down but to come back. And even tho I keep saying we misunderstood her multiple times. She said it was worth taking my stuff away until she felt like it(she gave it back the same day and I'm typing it before I have to vacuum) and she was embarrassed because people was looking at me(nothing else happened) so when we got back home she was ranting to herself (out loud)  that me crossing my arms was a huge sign of disrespect because I didn't want to be there(when you force someone somewhere when they think they could watch it on there phone of course I wouldn't want to be there) and I said I misunderstood you and she said the conversation was done. So I'm  sitting here thinking if I was in the wrong for moving my seat.

ixz021ym	This past fall my brother(19) moved in with me(35m) and my wife(27). For context my wife and I live in a city that houses a university, the same one my brother now goes to, and we offered to let him live in our spare room after his freshman year to help him save on $. He lived on campus his first year because that is what is required of the freshman of that school. We charge him a fraction of what it would cost to live in the city, and he commutes.  Since me and my brother have such a large age gap between us we've never been close, but my wife has a 18 year old brother who she is very close with so her and my younger brother hit it off immediately. I work full time in finance while my wife is a freelance writer who works from home. She will often stay up late into the night writing or watching tv because she sometimes has trouble sleeping. It's never bothered me before but since my brother moved in he and my wife's schedules line up and I noticed they started to spend a lot of time together specifically watching anime.   My wife has always been a big anime fan, and it's something we don't share. I enjoy some anime, but most of the time she watches it alone in her spare time. My brother didn't watch anime much either before he started living with us, but after moving in and spending some time with my wife he started watching it. They would even watch together, and this didn't bother me, but one night I woke up and found my wife and brother watching anime together at 4 am. They weren't doing anything inappropriate but my wife's schedule has shifted a lot more especially after my brother went on break and didn't have any classes. I would regularly find them watching tv together in the early mornings and my wife's work schedule shifted so she was mostly working towards the evenings as well. They also talked a lot even when they weren't watching tv together, and my brother will regularly send her tiktoks that are anime related.(I don't have tiktok)  It got to the point where my wife and I were almost living completely opposite to each other. I would wake up in the mornings and she would go to bed and then at night she would still be completely wide awake by the time I went to bed. Several times my wife and brother made comments about me joining them in watching during the weekends, but I declined because I wasn't interested. I decided to set a boundary with my wife one day when I came home and I was in the kitchen with them both. My wife was prepping some dinner and my brother was just talking to her and most of their conversation was just inside jokes or things I wouldn't understand because I don't watch anime. It was extremely frustrating and I felt very left out so I spoke to my wife later that night and told her that I didn't want her and my brother watching anime together anymore because it was making me feel alienated in my own home. My wife agreed, but a couple days later I noticed my brother being very distant around me specifically.

i5kei4t5	I (F16) have been dating my boyfriend (M17) for 4 months. I’ve liked him for years but had a lot going on and I was extremely shy. My one friend E (15F) used to be obsessed with my boyfriend for months. Starting at the end of the school year last year she would make creepy comments about his body. Saying “he’s so delicious” “he’s so hot omg his tattoos” “his muscles are so hot” “he’s so fine” it died down over summer since she didn’t see him. During band camp in August she made more comments about how she wanted to see his muscles. My boyfriend was creeped out by this and in August/September we started hanging out. Everyone was mad at us and fished for information we brushed it off and didn’t say much. In mid september he asked me out and I said yes. E still made comments about him except these comments were rude. She would say he needed to cover up and hit the gym more and she didn’t like what he was wearing. I brushed it off assuming she was jealous but Wednesday I hit my breaking point. He hugged me at the car like normal and went back inside school to work out. E asked where he was going and I said “He’s going to workout.” she laughed and goes “He works out? It doesn’t look like it” everyone laughed. I calmly said “Says the one who was obsessed with him for months.” She denied it, I was tempted to mock the creepy comments she would make about him but I didn’t. After she got out of the car she called me a b!tch. Not wanting to cause issues and escalate things I closed the door without saying a word. My sister said what I said was uncalled for but I don’t thinks so.  I told my boyfriend about it afterwards and we laughed about it. He has never liked her and he didn’t plan on dating anyone because he leaves for basics. When he and I started talking more that changed.

bg7r9do0	I(M25) am a transgender man and I have been out for 10 years. I have known my friend, A (M26) for 14+ years and he came out as gay a year or so after I came out as trans. When I came out, I had absolutly no support at home and my entire family practially ignored my coming out. However, when A came out to his famliy he was met with a more loving atmosphere than me.  A and I recently had a small argument over a game, I wasn't mad and was in fact laughing at the altercation until A said that I had "always resented him" for having a better relationship with his parents than I do with my whole family. I was in absolute shock as I thought A was one of the most supportive people in my life, besides my husband. I snapped and bust out with "being trans is harder than being gay, i've had to spend thousands of my own money to be who i am today and all you had to do was wave a pride flag and find a guy to sleep with you." A's boyfriend, J (M25),heard the agument from his office and told me to get the hell out of their house.  When I got home I told my husband, B (M26) about the altercation and he agrees with me, being that him and A were there for me throught my whole transition. I was then harrassed for a few days over facebook by A,  J and their friends, saying that my outburst was completely uncalled for and unnecessary. Most of the friends i've told about this all agree with me, saying that what A said what out of order and down right disrespectful.   I'm starting to have second thoughts about what i said and i'm thinking about apologising to A and J. but i'm unsure.

2ref1vvl	I (26F) came into some money after my parents sued their now ex landlords after I got hurt on the property that the landlord should’ve taken care that of (that nearly killed me) and put it in stocks for me that grew a lot since 1997. They decided to do it this way because they just got divorced and didn’t want to use my money for petty things. I have 4 nephews (11,2,2,and 1). I haven’t revised  my Will since 2018 (mainly because time is going by way too fast). I haven’t met my youngest  nephew partly due to Covid but largely due to his parents and I got into a big fight right before lockdown (they just told everyone they were expecting and he was born in September) and I’ve only seen pictures of him.

7p3m0d3p	Okay so my sister(21f) called me(20f) and told me she didn’t have anywhere to go and she was on meth, I told her she could stay with me as long as she gets clean and Eventually gets a job, she agrees so I go to pick her up which is a whole 6 hour drive. I don’t live near any family or family friends, I just live with my husband in a small town.  So since she started living with me I could tell she was getting clean by going cold turkey, sleeping all day and sweating buckets, I let her use my laptop so she can check on her Facebook and put in job applications. About two weeks later she said she was gonna go out with a friend, she doesn’t know anyone around here but I thought she was trying to socialize. She left and I went to go turn off my laptop but I got this gut feeling so I checked her messages. She was messaging some guy saying “Do you smoke with crystal? I have her on me.” I was so enraged, I went outside(she was waiting for her ride)and told her that she needs to pack her things tonight and needs to leave by tomorrow. I go back inside and cry, she left with that person for the night so I just throw her things into a trash bag and set them by the door, I went outside for a cigarette… she slashed one of my tires. My husband and I called the cops and explained the situation. She got arrested for criminal mischief but she didn’t have meth on her when they arrested her, she spent a total of two days in jail with a fine of 200$ which she will never pay. She walked back to my place crying and begging for us to let her back in but we just threw that bags of clothes out and locked the door.

iy2jetns	I (40 M) and my father (87) have been estranged for twelve years. He and I have an extremely storied past, and he was very emotionally abusive when I was growing up. He went as far as to theaten to disown me when I came out to him as a teen, and tried to financially control me well into my mid 20's. He's tried to control my mother financially as well through a divorce settlement by using her disability against her. For my own mental health I cut ties with him twelve years ago, and have been a much happier person for it.   He has been harassing me and my partner ever since. He's called the police years after I went no contact for a "wellness check", and sent threatening mail and emails. He's also showed up at our house more than once asking neighbors about me.  Back when I was still under his thumb he put my name on the deed to a house that he had previously inherited, fully paid off. He uses the place as a vacation house, and we are both on the deed now. He wanted to make the house easier for me to inherit. I haven't had any access to the property over the last twelve years but he hasn't asked for any financial contributions either.  Now he's getting older, and has sent me messages over the last year saying he wants me to sign the deed back over to him. He has threatened to sue me if I don't do this, had a lawyer contact me, and has sent people to my house to pressure me into signing.  I haven't signed, but I don't really want to either.

8mua0b79	Hello reddit. I'm in a bit of a pickle and I just wanted to ask what I should do. I a F(18) still live with my mother, step father, and younger sister. My mother who has been in several accidents before and after I was born left her with permit damage to her back and neck to where she has to take medicine marijuana which obviously isn't cheap. We don't live in the most wonder life style but aren't dirt poor and my mom has been able to keep our heads afloat. Well sense I was 16 and started my first real job she started asking me for money for her medicine. I trying to be nice and caring to my mother said yes which was a mistake. After that for years she has been "borrowing" my money and when she does pay some back she just "borrows" the money she gave me. So today she came up to me and asked for some money for medicine but I said no and she asked me again to which I stood my ground and said no. My sister was there witnessing all of this and tried to keep the piece and told my mom I just want to save up money. This is where I may have been the butthole. I then turned to my mom and went off on her telling her I never get any money to myself and she makes it impossible to save money for myself and to move out because I hate it here. She left in tears and my sister helped her out with getting the medicine. I'm in conflict and not sure what to do and just want to know your thoughts.	1642963336.0	sb0jpn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0jpn/aita_for_not_giving_my_mom_money_for_her_medicine/	AITA for not giving my mom money for her medicine?
5jkas3da	I know gender roles can be a sensitive topic so I’ll try to be delicate about this. But my wife, whom I love dearly, has a habit of asking me to do things that might cause her discomfort for whatever reason, even when she’s perfectly capable of handling them. And it’s clearly because she thinks the “man” should do certain things when the “woman” doesn’t want to. Today’s example…we’ve got an inch or two (max) of snow. Apparently, she’d ordered a grocery pickup from a store that is 3 minutes away. Literally. Because it’s snowing a bit, she asks me to go and get the pickup that I wasn’t even aware that she ordered until just a few minutes prior, and then insinuates that I should do it because I’m the man. Last week, I caught heat because I couldn’t take a look at an issue she was having with her car at the exact moment she wanted me to, and she ended up taking it to her dad’s house. Mind you, even if I were to have looked at it, I know next to nothing about auto repairs.   Last and final example. A while back, her toilet was stopped up and she asked me to fix it. I’ll just say that the toilet was filled with her waste. Now, we do have a plunger that is extraordinarily easy to use and I know that she knows how to use it, with no issue. When I asked why she couldn’t repair it, again, my manhood is questioned. This is a bit of a recurring theme. Love her to death and we don’t have any significant issues, but AITA for refusing to do menial tasks that she’s uncomfortable with and appear to be clearly based on her idea of what a man should be doing?? I don’t feel like a lesser husband but maybe I have the wrong perspective.	1642963247.0	sb0iac	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0iac/aita_for_not_bending_to_my_wifes_idea_of_gender/	AITA for not bending to my wife’s idea of gender roles?
ixyks4m8	My boss started his business while we were both in undergrad. We were dating at the time and I helped him a lot in the beginning. After we both graduated, I started working for him full-time (as did some of our friends). We broke up about two years ago.  I like my job and my co-workers so I never quit even though we broke up, plus I felt like I've put so much into this business and I don't want to just walk away from it all. It was hard at first but we now have a strictly professional relationship but I’m still very close to his family. My boss is now dating someone else. She frequently comes into our office to visit him and is trying to get him to give her a job. So, she has befriended some of my co-workers.  About 4 months ago, she randomly asked me if something had happened between me and him. I told her no, that we used to be good friends but we weren’t as close anymore. I couldn’t completely lie since she had seen me at events with his family. There wasn’t an issue until the beginning of this month when she found proof of our relationship and had it confirmed by his sister.  She came into the office to confront me and was pretty rude and the entire thing was embarrassing since she was yelling in front of everyone. She was angry at me for not telling her the truth when she asked me. Now she wants me to quit my job and has been pressuring me to even after I told her no.

781aedx6	I (21F) had a driving lesson on Friday 21st of Jan, I impulsively decided to book a tattoo afterwards as I was feeling good about myself.  The first tattoo shop was closed, so I went and checked out another shop close by and was able to get booked in for a tattoo at 2pm - this was at 12.45pm so I had some spare time to kill and I was waiting for 1pm to tell my partner (32M)  about it over a phone call when he had a work break.  The time was 1.20pm and I was anxious that I wasn’t going to be able to have a phone call with my partner, thinking that he got caught up with some work stuff on his break.  I checked my Facebook and to my surprise he was active, I called him to see if we could have a quick chat while he had some break time left however he didn’t answer and left my messages on read.  I quickly texted him instead to let him know I was a little sad we didn’t get to call but my driving lesson went well and that I was booked in for a tattoo.  He messaged me back almost immediately asking what the fuck was going on and I apologised for booking a tattoo (without asking first) because I was unsure what he was thinking, he continued to say he has no clue what my problem is and accuses me of booking my tattoo out of anger and knowing it would piss him off (I didn’t know).  I let him know I booked my tattoo before he was even supposed to be on break, I even supplied a screenshot of the email confirmation - he replied back saying “you and I are fucking through, you know exactly what getting a tattoo would upset me cuz we talked about me tattooing you”  I can’t remember explicitly saying he would be the only person to tattoo me or the next person to tattoo me. I told him this isn’t about him, it’s about me and that if he wants to break up over a tattoo then that’s fine but I think he’s overreacting. He said I was being ignorant, playing dumb and that I was the one overreacting. He kept swearing at me and saying I only got a tattoo to upset him and to have fun talking shit to my tattooist about everything, he said that I really know how to make him feel small. I kept trying to reassure him I wasn’t getting the tattoo out of spite and I didn’t want to hurt him. I got called multiple names under the sun, a juvenile, a cunt, a bitch, a selfish cunt, a horrible person, a fuckhead. It’s now Monday morning, I’ve been apologising all weekend and he still keeps finding things to get upset about and demanding apologies from me. On Saturday, he tried to say he knows I’m tired of him and that’s why I’m not putting effort in and if I’m not putting effort in then im clearly giving my time to someone online, which I reassured him I only want to be with him. I thought we cleared our misunderstanding on Friday, and on Saturday, but I think yesterday we finally built a bridge and got over it.

iy35p6tv	This is a throwaway because I don’t want anyone I know to see this but let me preface this by saying my parents don’t have a very good track record with alcohol. My mom is a borderline alcoholic but she doesn’t seem to see it that way and both my parents, despite being in their mid-50’s enjoy going out and drinking. I have no problem with this as my parents are very hard working people and spend most of their time during the week keeping us in an upper class household and keeping it tidy. (My mom is stay at home and my dad works)  This being said its not uncommon for my parents to become irresponsible drinking and either get plastered and embarrass me infront of my friends or, much worse, my dad has driven home drunk a few times, even with his entire family in the car. My dad having his license is crucial to owning his company so I fear one day he could be pulled over, or worse.  Last night, I 16M went out as well as my sister, 26F, and my parents, mid 50s  I was under the impression my parents were just going to eat and see a play and my dad texted me he would be home at 11.  1:30am rolls around and when i go inside I see no one is home, I call my parents 20+ times with no answers, I check there locations and my dads is off but I see my mom is in some random parking lot in a very shitty area of town around 15 minutes away.  I’m not going to lie i freaked out and worried for the worse so I got in my car and sped over to see my moms car in the parking lot of a strip club, this isn’t super weird for my parents, they’ve been married 30 year and they were just at the bar not staring at the women. Heres where i might be the ahole  I barged into the club and walked through the bouncer, found my parents at the bar and freaked out on them for not giving me any sort of heads up they wouldn’t be home and having me worried sick over their wellbeing  My parents and my sister both think i’m the asshole because they’re “adults” and can do what they want and I’m stuck feeling worthless and like i’m alone  sorry for bad grammar im on my phone and in a rush	1642964018.0	sb0t72	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0t72/aita_for_barging_into_a_strip_club_to_make_sure/	AITA for barging into a strip club to make sure my parents were okay
a09kzq24	My dad recently passed away after being sick for a few months. My mom has hoarding tendencies and my Aunt visited my parents last year and felt that the house was dangerous for my dad and that my mom wasn’t taking good enough care of him. She started pressuring me to move back home to take care of them but I was on the opposite side of the world, had a job and a community that I really liked and I wasn’t sure how much I’d be able to help if I moved back home since my parents hadn’t asked me to and I didn’t know how much I could interfere.   When I finally did come home I decided to stay because my dad was hospitalized for heart problems. While he and my mom were away in the hospital my Aunt came over to the house every day for two weeks to help me clean the house enough so that it would be safe and comfortable for my dad to hospice at home. Unfortunately he died in the hospital two days after my aunt left town after helping me.   I called her two days after the death and she was very unsympathetic and said that she was very upset and hurt that she heard about my dad’s death through a mutual friend instead of through me. She also said that she was disappointed in me because last year when she kept calling me about my mom’s hoarding problem I snapped at one point and told her that it wasn’t my responsibility to spend my life cleaning up after somebody else’s mess. She said she didn’t realize I was so cold. Since my dad has died she hasn’t really checked in with me except to tell me how hard it has been for her (she is not directly related to him, he is my adopted dad and my mom’s first cousin so she is only related to him through marriage) and how hurt she was that I didn’t call her right away.

iy0gk9t5	This morning I got up earlier than my Gf to finish off some paperwork. I went straight downstairs and started working 1.5 to 2 hours later my GF and her teenage daughter (I'll refer to her as TD) got up and started heading downstairs. After hearing them moving about TD shouts down something about me not being bothered to open the curtains which I ignored.   GF then came downstairs and started complaining about me not opening the curtains and calls my by my surname (which I have asked her before not to do as she seemed to use it more than my first name). She then asked me in a raised (but not shouting) voice why I hadn't opened them and I told her (in a similarly raised voice) that I hadn't done anything not even getting breakfast as I wanted to just get the paperwork finished and out of the way.   At this point she said "oh someone's hangry" and I just glared at her as if I'd opened my mouth I would've shouted and I didn't want to do that.  As a bit of background TD has a habit of trying to order me around which I usually ignore but have spoken to my GF about it and she said she would talk to her about it and call her out on it when she does it, but to me the things that went on this morning feel like GF validated TD telling me off.  All of this happened without my GF even saying good morning to me.   As I was leaving to go get my kids and be with them for the day my GF asked me what was wrong with me and I again just gave her a look as if I'd said anything it wouldn't be in a normal voice and I don't like shouting at people.   I text my GF later to explain all this and the response I got was "sorry for not saying good morning!"   I feel annoyed and that she should give a better apology and for more than just not saying good morning.	1642964334.0	sb0xez	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb0xez/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_gf/	AITA for being annoyed at my GF
iy125n51	For some context, I (F28) just moved from my city to my first house in a suburban neighborhood about six months ago. Just me and my dog Oaken, a Dutch Shepherd. My dog is trained as a Personal Protection Dog (PPD).   I’m a runner and Oaken runs with me. We were running in our neighborhood’s park and pond area, I had my AirPods in, it was just getting dark.   I’d noticed in passing a guy on his bike on the same trails, and as we were coming around the pond he was stopped on our path. He waved us down and said he had dropped his keys, asked if I had seen them on the path, asked if I had a light on me because he thinks he dropped them in the grass, wanted to know if I lived in the neighborhood, which house was mine, if I was nearby because he didn’t see any cars in the parking area that he didn’t recognize, basically anything to keep us there and keep talking.   Not scary, but annoying with a definite hint of creepy.   After he forgot his initial story and said “I’m gonna be so pissed at myself if I lost another earbud, that’s my third pair and they’re nearly 300 bucks a pop” I moved to leave and he stood in the path and started asking about Oaken. Oaken wasn’t doing anything aggressive at this point, no hair raised no growling or barking, he was doing exactly what he was trained to do and every time the guy would move to get closer to us he would just stand between me and him. The guy asked if he was friendly, asked to pet him, and I said I’d rather he not. He kept saying dogs loved him, blah blah, I again said no and we started to walk around the guy to go.   That’s when he decided it would be a good idea to try to grab Oaken’s leash. (I have no idea why, your guess is as good as mine.) Oaken backed us up, low growl, showed his teeth. Didn’t snap, didn’t bite. We left.  The encounter was strange enough I posted in the Neighborhood app. Nothing accusing the guy of attacking us or anything over the top like that, just that my dog and I had gotten stopped by a stranger out running and a reminder not to grab at a person’s dog or dog leash without permission.   Apparently, Park Guy's wife read the post and recognized her husband immediately, because since then she’s been telling every neighbor who will listen about my “aggressive attack dog.” I’ve now gotten a letter from the HOA and apparently the next homeowner’s meeting has breed specific bans on the agenda. While I believe Oaken’s response was appropriate and controlled, I’m feeling sad and disappointed that my new community has the wrong impression. I’m not out to terrify people.  AITA for posting what I posted to the Neighborhood app and apparently starting a feud with my new neighbor? Was I wrong for calling out Park Guy publicly?	1642964600.0	sb11ob	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb11ob/aita_for_threatening_my_new_neighbors_with_my_dog/	AITA for “threatening” my new neighbors with my dog?
ixf31evn	this happened a few yrs ago but still bothers me. i feel like TA because i might’ve unnecessarily brought my mom into an issue.  one night, my (m16 at the time) dad (69) was bringing me home from a defensive driving course (it’s a short course, better than driver’s ed imo because you do… defensive driving). whenever my dad is otw home he calls my mom (57) to let her know how far he is & asks if she need anything from the store.  this annoys my mom, she thinks its stupid & that he could just text her or that she’d text him if she needed something. so when she answered she was kinda snippy (she’d been in a bad mood all day anyways) and was short w my dad. it was on speaker so i heard it. this made my dad rly upset.  when they hung up my dad said “you know you’re mom is just waiting for me to die so she can sell the house” and ranted about her to me. this made me really uncomfortable for so many reasons. i didnt want to wait til i went to my next therapy appointment to talk to my therapist and so i just told my mom the next day what he said.  this ofc made my mom mad/upset. she said my dad shouldnt be saying those kinds of things to me because im his kid and that the statement was very gruesome. she called a meeting between the 3 of us and my dad started to call me a liar, saying he never said that. then he said ok well it was just a joke. can i not joke with my kid?  my mom kept trying to tell him that what he said whether it was a joke or not was inappropriate. i said i didnt want him saying things like that to me. my dad in turn said alright then, i just won’t ever talk to you again.   like, just full on insisted that i was too sensitive and therefore he didn’t want to risk “triggering” me. this sparked a massive argument between my parents. my dad, being the man child he is, didnt speak to me for a couple days.  it was really tense around the house. i feel like TA because i could’ve waited for the weekend to talk to my therapist and do a more mediated version of that discussion- without my mom.	1642965013.0	sb17ek	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb17ek/aita_for_telling_my_mom_what_my_dad_said/	AITA for telling my mom what my dad said
d75a7zzd	AITA. so here's my situation.   My wife and I have custody of our grandson.  Over 4 years ago we found out the house we owned had lead paint because our grandson had lead poisoning.   Didn't have over $5000 to take care of the issue on a house that wasn't worth fixing.  Decided to move.    So a friend came to me and told me her fiancee (also a friend) had a house that would be available.   Long story short, we entered into a rent-to-own agreement on April 7, 2018.  We have a notarized agreement..  I take care of all utilities and repairs and pay his monthly mortgage payments.   A bit to the backstory- his ex-stepdaughter and boyfriend were living in the house and not taking care of it, financially or repair wise.  To date, I  have replaced - ceiling fans in both bedrooms & the living room, range hood, garbage disposal, removed carpeting saturated with dog urine, repainted bathroom, living room and both bedrooms, installed laminate wood flooring in bathroom and hallway, cut down large dead tree in back yard, replaced fencing separating our property from the neighbor, serviced the oil furnace and replaced parts, & probably more I'm not remembering right now.  Friday, he informs me verbally we have 60 days to get out.  He and his fiancee are splitting and he intends to move back in.  Don't get me wrong, I feel bad that their relationship didn't work put.  But in the same aspect, I've spent thousands of dollars in repairs on this house that we believed would be our forever home.  The housing market in our area is scarce and is complicated by the fact that we have pets, cannot be more than 30 minute drive from my job as I am on-call every couple of weeks, and have to have at least 2 bedrooms to accommodate us.  We don't want to leave.  AITA for wanting him to stick to our agreement and he finds elsewhere to live since he's single with no kids?	1642964702.0	sb132c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb132c/aita_house_agreement/	AITA house agreement?
iy2zwc6x	Okay so my family have been going in at me for a year now about why I won’t go further in academia even though I keep telling them I’m happy with post-grad qualification that I’m aiming towards now.  Recently, the conversation came up again and they kept asking why I wouldn’t go further & they got the same answer as always. They then asked why I wouldn’t do it to get a job as an ambassador for the country. I said I had no interest. My mother then said that as a child, I always said I would be President (not US btw). I responded saying that I always said I would become a published writer but was always told it wasn’t a viable career. I was told again that it wasn’t.  I asked how becoming President is more accessible than becoming an author. My brother (who has a bit of a thing that when it comes to discussions, he can never ever be wrong) said that he thought it was more accessible. I asked for explanation & he said it was just opinion. As the discussion went on his voice started rising a bit more but he wasn’t quite shouting yet. I then told him that if I could get published I would be happy, even if it meant that I had to keep on another career to stay financially steady. His response: ‘why don’t you do the PhD, then? You can publish that.’  I reiterated to him (for what was the sixth time that night alone) that I had no interest in a PhD and so I would not want to publish anything in that realm and that I have always wanted to write fiction (which my family have known for at least 10 years). His response, voice still raised: ‘well we can’t be psychic and that know that’s what you meant! You made the qualifying point - you want to be a published author and you can get published after a PhD!’  So I started shouting louder than him: ‘I already told you loads of times that I have no interest in a PhD so why would I go that route for writing.’  Him: ‘stop shouting at me. You’re annoying me now, let’s just end it here.’  So I said OK, got a glass of water and left the room.  Him, shouting: ‘yeah go throw a strop and go to your room and huff.’  I shouted back: ‘yeah as if you don’t throw strops when you feel like it too. You’re full or sh*te.’  So, did I overreact? Was I too rude? AITA?	1642965219.0	sb1ah1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1ah1/aita_for_getting_too_riled_up/	AITA for getting too riled up?
69na5x9q	I (27F) am living with my mom who is a tour-guide. So her job requires her to travel away from home, sometimes for several weeks. Although I usually stay by myself while she's gone, my aunt (my mom's sister) offered me to send her daughter -my cusin (21F) this time, because my mom would be away for much longer than expected.   Although I initially thought of staying by myself since Im in the middle of my exams and having someone over seemed a bit of a burden, afterwards I then agreed to it ca's Im close with my cusins and she being here would not hurt.   So my cusin came today morning, and I prepared a room for her, which had these large mirrors. Now, I am so much scared of mirrors, let alone large ones. So I never went to her room after dark. But she was cool with it, she liked the room and everything went well.   But today, when It was the bed-time, she suddenly asked me where I was gonna sleep. I said Im going to sleep in my room. She asked my if I could sleep in her room since it's just us in our place. I said I cannot, explaining the fear I have for large mirrors. She seemed to be okay with my decision, and I assured her, since my dog is also here, there is nothing to be afraid of.   And then after a while, her mom called us to see how we were doing, and asked me again -if I could sleep in my cusin's room. And I again told her as well, that I just can't do it. Then she started shouting at me that is unacceptable and I am crazy, and I should sleep with my cusin (her daughter) in the same room, because of safety issues, and to put my fears aside. The more I tried ro reason with her, the more she said that I am irresponsible and childish , and that I don't think about my cusin's safety at all.   So to stop her from shouting anymore, I just agreed to sleep there. And I told my cusin that I'm gonna be late ca's I need to study, and now I am sleeping on a chair in the corridor leading to her room, and I am pretty exhausted.   So now I am thinking of going to my room and sleep there - without thinking about my aunt would say. Because I just can't deal with not having sleep because of my exams.   So tell me , WIBTA if I go to my room and sleep, despite what my aunt instructed me to do?	1642965500.0	sb1e70	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1e70/wibta_if_i_sleep_in_my_bedroom_despite_my_aunt/	WIBTA If I sleep in my bedroom despite my aunt instructed me not to?
iy4baz7s	This is a friend I met in college. We live a few hours away from each other now, with her living in a large city that hosts a ton of events. One of our favorite bands had a concert this weekend, so I agreed I'd come in on Friday night, we'd see the show on Saturday and then I'd go home Sunday.  In the past few weeks, my friend has texted me saying things like "Oh, I forgot my keys at work! Now I have to go all the way back and get them." She lives way across the city from her job and it's a two train, lots of walking in between to get there. Even from the train I came in on to her home, it was a 20-minute walk. The day I was due to come in, I texted her a reminder about her keys and she assured she'd remember.  I arrive and she tells me that she forgot her keys at work, but she's certain her roommates are home to let us in. I ask if she wants to call and make sure, she insists they should be there. I have a pretty heavy duffel (I had to leave straight from work, so I had all that stuff with me) along with my purse that I'm carrying. We walk all the way to her apartment and no one was home. She starts laughing and I'm not. She says the only other option is to walk back to the train, take the line to her job, etc. I'm not thrilled but put on a good face and off we walk, with all my stuff. It's important to mention, we had agreed to have dinner together so I hadn't ate a thing since breakfast that morning. I got in around 5, already pretty hungry. I offer to split a cab or an Uber but she says that'd be too expensive.  Between taking the train and all the walking we did, it took us nearly 90 minutes to get to her job. She keeps laughing about the situation, I'm not. We arrive at her work, she grabs her keys and then gets to talking to someone still there. She wants to show me around and I say "Hey, I'm starving. Could we do this tomorrow before the concert?" (as it was in the same area) She seemed hurt but we found a spot to eat, devoured our food and then started the trek back to her apartment. By the time we got there, I was wiped and not in the mood to do anything. So, I went to bed. I could tell she was upset about that.  The next day, we went to the concert and things were a little tense. We were grabbing a bite afterwards and she mentioned that she wasn't having a ton of fun. She said she had a lot of stuff planned for the night before and I just went to bed. I told her that it was ridiculous to expect me to stay awake after I worked a full day, then had to go all around the city to find her keys. She said how I acted during that type was assholish too and said it was a simple mistake. I said maybe, but put herself in my shoes. This divulged into a fight where she said I'm not understanding and I told her that she isn't taking accountability for being kind of a shit host. I decided to just grab my stuff and go back home a night early. This morning I woke up to an essay of a text from her telling me that I'm a bad friend.

2dedr8b9	Cutting a very long story short, my (F28) dad is going through the process of moving to Spain. He sold his house in England about a year and a half ago and since then has been trying to settle in Spain. Due to covid and Brexit, this has been much more complicated than he anticipated. As I speak Spanish, I'm helping him with his paperwork to get a visa, which has unfortunately been really time-consuming.  When he first moved out of his house he ended up moving in with me and my boyfriend. We live in a rented 2 bedroom cottage. He said it would be for a couple of weeks but it ended up being about 3 months. While he lived with us he paid £500 rent (our rent is £1,250/ month. He also gave each me and my 2 siblings £1,300 as a one-off gift from the house sale proceeds, which I was of course extremely grateful for. I should definitely also add that he has promised to contribute a very generous amount to our wedding.  After 2 and a half months of him living with us, I told him that he couldn't live with us forever, especially as my boyfriend was working from home and needed to use my dad's room as a study. My dad ended up moving into a hotel, but due to another lockdown, he ended up there for about 2 months. During this time, I booked the hotel for him (he's incapable of doing anything online), and did all his washing. I also helped him sort out his visa. Unfortunately my older siblings aren't in the position to be able to help with these kinds of things. I also offered to help him find a flat to rent short-term, but he wasn't interested.  As he still doesn't have residency in Spain, at the moment he's living between the two countries. I've spent hours booking his flights and covid tests and completing passenger locator forms. When he's in England he'll stay with us for a couple of weeks at a time. I love my dad but he's a very difficult house guest. He goes out most days to the pub and is very loud and annoying when he gets home. He's also a messy person and has basically taken over the main bathroom. As he now only stays with us for 1-2 weeks at a time, he has stopped contributing to our rent.   I was talking to my mum about it the other day (my mum and dad separated when I was young) and she said that I should be charging him rent. To be honest, this would come in really handy as, even though my boyfriend and I work full time, we do not earn a lot and are saving for a wedding and also a deposit for a house. Also, my dad's monthly pension is more than my salary. But, he is offering to contribute a lot of money to the wedding, so I think charging him rent would be greedy of me.  So, WIBTA if I asked him to contribute to our rent when he stays with us?	1642966563.0	sb1t27	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1t27/wibta_for_charging_my_dad_rent/	WIBTA for charging my dad rent?
12romh	\*first post, sorry if I mess up\*  So me and my room mates moved from an apartment with two rooms to a house with three rooms, one of which is in the basement. We decided that living together would be the best for everyone because we got along so well. Our room mates decided to take the room in the basement so that they can do their own thing without there being too much going on upstairs.  The house is alright, but it's very old and needs some work. One of the main issues that our room mates have is that the basement stays cold, it's the middle of winter so it's consistently colder than it is upstairs. So "room mate A" decides to come upstairs and change the temperature in the house to 80° anytime he thinks we're not watching.  This gets very expensive really fast, my power/gas bill has doubled and so I'd like to keep it ah 76 as a compromise. I ask our room mate if that's alright and we get into a shouting match over the temperature and how I should keep it higher for him in the basement.  The main reason I say no, and force the issue is that our room has 2 vents in it, right above the heater so our room is consistently about 5° hotter than the rest of the house anyway, so we wake up in a sweat. We even went out and bought them an electric heater but they refused it saying it stinks and they can't do that.  Am I the jerk for making them stay in the cold at the expense of my own comfort??

8cwad8da	So I (17f) no longer live with my mom (38f), although I do still visit for holidays and such. Yesterday was my cousin's birthday, which I was planning on attending until my mom asked told me she was taking me and my siblings to a surprise. I told her that I was already planning on going to the birthday party, but she guilt tripped me into saying yes, saying that she had already bought me a ticket. At this point I still had no idea what I had agreed to, so I asked her where the event was taking place. She refused to tell me, instead saying I had to drive an hour and a half out of my way to meet her at her house. So I drove to get house and she said I had to drive her partner's kids in my car. So I followed her another hour to the stadium where the game was taking place. At that point I had guessed what was going on, and I must have been visibly upset because my mom asked me what was wrong and why I wasn't excited. I told her I was a little bit upset that she made me miss my cousin's birthday for a hockey game (she had ended up cancelling the party because nobody showed up). My mom also knows that I don't really like sports, but I didn't say anything about that. Her and the kids I had driver were trying to hype me up about it, saying that I've never watched a hockey game and that they're lots of fun etc etc. I tried to just smile and pretend I was excited but I guess I wasn't doing a very good job. Anyways, I made it through the game and had to drive the kids an hour back to their house before driving myself back home which took another hour and a half. I do feel bad about the whole thing, and I know my mom just wants to spend time with me. But she knew ahead of time that it was my cousin's birthday. If it helps clear things up, the cousin is from my dad's side of the family and they stopped keeping in touch with my mom after my parents divorced. My mom doesn't like when I choose to go to family events on my dad's side instead of whatever she plans. It's just that her house is so far and I don't even get along with her that great to begin with. Our relationship ship has gotten so much better after I moved in with my dad, and while I do feel bad about not seeing her as much, I think it's for the best. So AITA for being ungrateful towards my mom, or do I have a right to be upset that she keeps making these plans and not telling me before hand?	1642967077.0	sb204n	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb204n/aita_for_being_upset_with_my_mom_for_taking_me_to/	AITA for being upset with my mom for taking me to a hockey game?
cx0zrxcp	Several months ago my dad brought me some basic acne products. My acne isn't bad whenever I get some acne it always goes away in about a day or so. But whenever I did have the slightest acne, my dad would always try to get me to use a product or say "here, let me show you how to use (insert product)." I never liked it because he made me feel very self-conscious about one TINY little pimple on my cheek or something. I never told him because I never wanted my dad to feel bad. After all, in his eyes, he probably thought he was just being helpful. He stopped after a few months and I didn't actually use the products until a month or so after he stopped because I forgot about how he made me feel and I honestly just got bored.  Today we went shopping and my dad was talking to my younger brother about acne products. (mind you he hasn't even hit puberty yet and his face is pretty clear.) My brother was disturbed and didn't want my dad to buy these acne products for him. Shortly after we got home, my dad was trying to teach my brother how to use these acne products. I said over and over that he didn't need them and my dad kept telling me to shut up.  I finally cracked and raised my voice at my dad, telling him how I felt self-conscious when he was pushing me to use acne products all those months ago. And about how I didn't want him to make my brother feel the same way. My dad just went quiet as my mom was telling me about how I shouldn't raise my voice at my dad because it's disrespectful.  I don't think I was being disrespectful and I think children should learn how to tell their parents how they feel about certain things because it's not okay to bottle things up. Yes, I shouldn't have raised my voice but he shouldn't have yelled at me to shut up. And honestly, all of the emotions that I bottled up so long ago came back and I didn't mean to raise my voice. I know I can't speak for my brother and I know my dad was probably trying to be helpful but I think what I did was justifiable.	1642966519.0	sb1si2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb1si2/aita_for_raising_my_voice_at_my_dad_for_buying_my/	AITA for raising my voice at my dad for buying my younger brother acne products?
c44i9qts	I, (F16) am a Christian in a mostly Hispanic church. The church is a really nice place, and it’s known to be loud, colorful, and amazing worship music to dance to. My problem wasn’t with the church, rather a woman that sat next to me. I have sensory issues, which makes church really hard to go to, but usually I manage it well. But this lady, hit EVERY mark of my sensory issues. She was loud, screaming the songs out, clapping excessively, and constantly touching me during worship. It was so bad I legitimately got pissed, which has never happened before. The bottom line was during the server. Where she clapped, every. second. possible. I snapped, and I aggressively moved from my seat to the bathroom. I hid there for about 15 minutes before my mom asked me where I was. Once I came back, she wasn’t as loud and only clapped and said “ahem” when it was appropriate. Although  my mom was slightly annoyed, once she heard my pov, she understood. It’s also uncommon for me to leave service, I love hearing the messages. But I feel like I may be the butt-hole for walking out. After all she was most likely just excited to worship and learn. But what she was doing was so excessive, and she was right next to me, and facing my direction.

9hd85n2b	First I wanna say that English isn't my first language so sorry in advance.  For a little bit of context me(14m) was told by my mother that she will get me something that I wanted under 400$ if I take good grades. I learned that hard and got the first place in my school, and my mom was as happy as I was , and I didn't brought it instantly to her attention, and now that my birthday is close , I asked her about a drone, she knows how much they mean for me , it's my favourite thing to watch every single documentary about the uavs and their evolution,  technology etc. And the drone I was asking for (an UPair 2) was about 350$ , and in a limited stock , because they were discontinued and the last ones are being sold on Banggood.  But when I told her this , including that I don't need a birthday present except to combine it with her promise of getting me something so I could get that drone, but she just told me no, without any reasons given.  I kept casually asking her for a month , but everytime she told me no , even if I asked why , her answer was no. I'm feeling sad because I studied a lot for it , and I'm also helping her around the house , for an example I'm the only one doing the dishes, I also vacuum the entire house sometimes , and I feel like I deserve it.  And 2 days ago she told me that I'm an AH for asking for that drone , even if I worked for it, and it hurt my feelings. And don't get me wrong , we're financially stable and we're doing pretty good, but I can't get over the thing that I worked hard for it , and all I got was a no.

iy4ku7pi	   My dad is one of 6 siblings. I get along with almost all of them with the exception of one. My uncle and I have never seen eye to eye. My family is okay with his boundary stomping, I never was. A little after my parents divorced, my uncle would talk terribly about my mother. I set the boundary that he not discuss her around me, he ignored it time and time again. When I turned 18, I made the choice to never see or speak to him. I told my family they could still invite him to events, but I would not attend. They've respected my choice and I am still close with all of them, my dad included. They don't even see said uncle often.   Fast forward to now. I am 30, my dad's 60th birthday was a week ago. My sister and I decided to throw him a surprise birthday party. We invited most of his family, including siblings and cousins, along with friends (all vaxed and boostered). The one person I did not want to invite was the uncle I do not speak to. My sister agreed that it would be for the best. The party came and everyone was having a fun time. Then my dad asked if his other brother was coming. I told him that he hadn't been invited.  My dad let it go but a few days later we were discussing the party and he said I should've invited his brother. He said it wasn't fair that the entire family except for one person. I reminded him that I do not speak with him and he replied "It wasn't about you. For once, it was about me".  He's not mad at my sister as he knows it was "my idea".

blg6oiub	I run a fairly large tabletop rpg group on Facebook and discord with really limited interactions on Facebook with a majority on discord. Many people game master campaigns in the same world setting and we’ll jump around from Call of Cthulhu to 5e and Stars without numbers etc.  Here’s the issue, we have a few artists that advertise on our server so they make character art or group pictures or scene art etc. the problem is as of recent that many of our players and Game Masters stream the game on YouTube or Facebook live and a couple of them actually make some money doing it, not money that’s life changing but like a couple hundred a month.   The artists in the discord server have gotten together and demanded that to use their art on a streaming service like twitch, they want a commercial license fee for the art, it’s ranged anywhere between $15 to $400 depending on the artists and there has only been one instance where a terms of service was agreed upon where a Comercial license fee for streaming was required.  This resulted in my shutting down the thread for advertising artists and made a requirement that hosting advertisements on the server required you to have reference sheets and dedicated prices that could fluctuate + or - $20 but the fee for advertisement would be 25% of what they charge as a commercial license fee a month.  Alternatively they could just not charge a commercial license fee and advertising your work would be free.  Am I the asshole for trying to, in my mind, stop people from taking advantage of one another? I’ve been told being an artist is already hard enough without big shots like me trying to take advantage of their revenue sources and “demanding” a cut of what they make.  As an aside the games we run are 100% free, for most of us prep time story writing and adventure writing is almost like a part time job, I don’t see an issue with these people trying to get reimbursed for their hard work without even more stuff getting in the way.  TLDR; Artists banded together to make a commercial license fee to profit off of Game Masters and players who streamed the character art they paid for on twitch, I told artists they need to pay 25% of their license fee a month in order to keep benefiting from advertising on my free platform or just not charge the fee.	1642967640.0	sb27xv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb27xv/aita_for_now_charging_artists_to_advertise_on_my/	AITA for now Charging artists to advertise on my server?
8h3j6x7d	One of my(19M) cousins, B(19F) came to stay with me and my parents this month during a visit to my city. The day she arrived, I fell down on my rolling chair and she laughed hysterically at me, and I didn't think much of it, since she's known to keep laughing at times when they're unnecessary. The next day, while stretching myself after waking up, I raised my hand and hit the ceiling fan(which was on) by mistake and hurt my hand(6'7 for context). She laughed hysterically at this as well. Almost uncontrollably.  My other cousin K, (20M) loves to make fun of people, at their expense most of the time. So, when he made fun of B, I began laughing. This happened many times, and I laughed most of the time, since it was genuinely funny. Now, she claims that I have hurt her for laughing and refuses to talk to me, whereas she still keeps talking to K. I am now sleeping on the couch, whereas K and B are still talking and laughing in my room.

748q77pe	For context I (f14) and my sister (f16) live with my mom and her husband in an apt. My mother is a control freak and is obsessed with cleaning (i’m pretty sure she has undiagnosed OCD but i’m not a professional) and is constantly calling us dirty, which we definitely aren’t. She constantly comes into our room everyday and inspects everything, if she sees even one piece of trash on the ground or something that doesn’t belong there sh forces us to clean the entire room. And if she doesn’t like the way we clean it, we have to do it again. it’s honestly been so irritating and I feel like it’s a violation of our privacy to enter our room everyday and dictate how we clean it and when. This happened to today when she came back from church and she immediately goes in our room and starts complaining abt how “dirty” it is and that we aren’t boys. I proceeded to then say that if she felt the room was so dirty she should clean it herself. So AITA?	1642968002.0	sb2coj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2coj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_if_she_finds_my_room_so/	AITA for telling my mom if she finds my room so dirty she should clean it herself?
iy4mns1l	My(19m) gf(19) loves bread. When we first got together and I started hanging out at her place I noticed she always had like 3-4 baguettes and multiple different kinds of loaves. It's just her niche. She also bakes her own bread at home constantly. I like bread too and at first I thought I had hit the jackpot because she bakes such good bread and also other things too but mostly bread, but she has one fatal flaw and that is that she eats bread in her bed.  We don't live together but I like spending the night at her place and one thing I noticed is that I would fall asleep in bed with her and when I would wake up I would be sleeping on huge bread crumbs that had not been there when we had laid down. I didn't know what it was, but then one night I woke up and I could chewing from my left and I grabbed my phone and turned my flashlight on and there my gf was just chowing down on a huge piece of baguette. I just kind of stared at her and she was like "oh sorry am I being loud?" Turns out my gf wakes up in the middle of most nights and gets a snack, of bread, and will lay down and eat it while she scrolls on her phone and waits to go back to sleep. It explained the crumb problem and after this it kind of started to get on my nerves.  I sleep without a shirt on and breadcrust crumbs hurt a little. I asked my gf why she didn't just eat it in the kitchen but she said she likes eating it in bed. I asked if she could refrain from doing that at least while I was there, but she didn't want to because it is her room and her bed and she didn't think it was a big deal. I was like whatever even though I still don't get how she can stand sleeping on crumbs all the time. I literally keep a little vacuum by the bed for in the mornings. Of course I love my girlfriend and this doesn't make or break our relationship, but it does bother me and I am honest about it and she is honest about the fact that she doesn't care. So we exist in limbo.  At one point we were hanging out with our friend group and someone mentioned my gf's love of bread(this is common knowledge in the group) and were making jokes about it. I chimed in and said "Yeah I wake up to find her eating bread in bed like some 18th century orphan with tuberculosis that just found a scrap of moldy bread off the street." Our friend group that this was completely hilarious and apparently it wasn't common knowledge that my gf eats bread in bed because they obsessed over this and even started calling my girl "Little Orphan \_\_\_\_\_" and renaming her in their phones. It basically became a meme between everyone. This isn't uncommon and we've done similar things for others in our group.   My gf is pretty peeved though and claimed that I only made those comments in order to try and shame her into doing what I want, which would be not eating bread in bed anymore, and that she thought my actions were manipulative and over the top. Maybe I was projecting a bit and maybe I was letting out some frustrations over her bread habits, but it's still true.	1642968112.0	sb2emu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2emu/aita_for_comparing_my_gf_to_an_18th_century/	AITA for comparing my gf to an 18th century orphan with tuberculosis in front of our mutual friends because she eats bread in bed?
fghyv4pn	So, last night, me, my husband and his parents were playing a game where you estimate or judge how many card sets you can make in a game. We play this game with my fam too- I have probably been playing this for over 20 years at this point. Anyway, in my family (moms side) when we play, we play to win, and not that we make others lose purposefully. It’s the flip side with my in-laws specifically my FIL who plays so that not only he wins, but also others lose. I usually brush his behaviour like getting angry when he throws the cards or when he talks loudly about how he lost the game. Yesterday, he did the same to me probably for the nth time, and I said he was being vengeful unnecessarily.   My husband has also said the same to me (not to his father directly). I had enough so I decided to say that we must play to win and make it fun rather than play with malice. This led to a huge fight, and they said vengeful was a wrong word to use (which I disagree, because my husband says the same thing to me in our native language) I tried explaining the same to me and both father and son blew up and ganged up on me. I understand the word can have different connotations, but they stuck to their ground even after I explained my intention was not to hurt anyone. My husband fought with me the entire night about this. And in the morning I expressed to him I wish he supported me yesterday. He said I always pick a fight ( which I didn’t , I nearly shared my feelings) and I am not accommodating. And I am wrong to pick an argument with his temperamental father.

mtfprre	I’m constantly shopping for food and cooking things that my partner enjoys. He does not do either of those things without me explicitly asking him to(which is hardly ever.) He is dealing with chronic stress at work and will be for another year and it’s started to make him physically unwell. I have a problem with mornings every now and then, he knows this. So while I try my best to be understanding and make sure he has all he needs, I really appreciate a Sunday morning breakfast made with love by someone else.   So I asked him if he would this morning and that he could cook whatever he feels like cooking, he wasn’t happy about it, and he made a pre-made hashbrowns mix  and some…eggs. You can’t go wrong cooking the hashbrown mix , it’s good every time. But his eggs… are so sad. It’s like so disappointing to eat. And so I tried to tell him with a joke: “you’ve really gotta step up your egg-game… he didn’t get it and just got more upset, asking what’s wrong with them? I said “everything… the taste, the texture, the presentation, it’s just really hard to eat it and feel like you really wanted to make something tasty.  I think you should look up some YouTube videos for ideas.” He got quiet then said that he’s “just trying to think of all the times my food was dogshit,” so I reply saying “I know everytime my food is dogshit and I take your criticism, but I would never call food you make dog shit.”   He got more upset and said I could give better criticism than saying “his food was god awful”.   His upset reaction then makes me feel frustrated that I can’t tell him how I feel even if I try to say it lightheartedly, as he takes it as a personal attack.  So I tell him I wasn’t trying to make him feel bad and that I was doing my best to be playful about it, and I wasn’t trying to hurt his feelings, but I’m now crying while saying this, because I cry when I get frustrated when my communication falls short.   He tells me that I can’t get over my own emotion and that he is super stressed and super sick so what did I expect.  I was trying to make a crappy meal situation better… but it just makes him more upset and it just leaves me feeling like he won’t ever put effort into cooking anything the way I do for him.  It’s like … walking on egg shells.  :(	1642968099.0	sb2efz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2efz/aita_for_telling_my_partner_he_needs_to_step_up/	AITA for telling my partner he needs to step up his egg-game?
hev4a9zs	My roommate took a quick overnight trip to about 40 mins away and asked me if I would walk their dog in the morning (they left late, around midnight, and walked the dog before). Said they would be back a bit after noon and I could just keep the dog in their room when not walking it.  When I woke up early this morning the dog was roaming the hallway, which was unusual as he's not allowed to do that when Roommate is gone. I went downstairs and it smelled horrible; I saw that the dog had pooped twice on the rug in the living room. I texted Roommate to let them know, they responded apologizing and telling me they'd come back as quickly as possible and I was like well, whatever, and cleaned up the poop but told them they'd have to get a spray and do the scrubbing themselves.  Since then I have walked the dog *twice* and each time it has come inside, of its own volition, and proceeded to run past me and poop on the rug again. Seems an abnormal amount of poop, I think the dog may be sick, so I texted Roommate and explained. I also said I really don't want to keep cleaning up dog poop again when it's not my dog and shouldn't be my responsibility. They told me their plan to return early has changed because they got drunk and don't feel well, they will be coming late, and told me I should clean it.  Obviously I don't want to. I've got a bit of a weak stomach and am just really bothered by it, plus it isn't my dog, but also I did take some amount of responsibility when I agreed to walk it for them and ultimately I guess it's just poop and isn't a huge deal. I gave them a noncommittal answer and I'm strongly considering just leaving the house for the rest of the day and letting it be their responsibility when they return. So, WIBTA for leaving the poop for Roommate?	1642968618.0	sb2le6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2le6/wibta_for_not_picking_up_my_roommates_dogs_poop/	WIBTA for not picking up my roommate's dog's poop?
9r3hwfa7	Weird one but hear me out.  For context, I F30 have been with my husband, M35 for 8 years and married for 3. We work at the same school and were friends for a few years before  we started dating. Despite really liking him, I held off for a while because he was my boss and I didn't want to be 'that girl' or have that dynamic hanging over us. We kept it very low key for the first year (just HR and our boss knew), but figured it was time to tell people when we got engaged. For the most part everyone was very supportive;  inevitably I got a few jokes from people about having to watch what they said around me and being a management spy, but I laughed it off and eventually everything went back to normal.   This last year has been pretty stressful for teachers with all the covid fallout, and management haven't helped by throwing loads of shit at us on top of that. Recently, there's been a lot of negative chat and people are understandably not happy about all the extra pressure. After a particularly bad meeting, my husband ended up walking in while some of my colleagues were complaining about him and the rest of management. He didn't say anything to me at the time, but when we got home asked me what had been said. I told him that I didn't want to start drama and that what my work friends share with me is based on our relationship as colleagues and has to stay at work. We had a heated discussion about it and eventually he conceded that it's normal for people to vent about management and agreed not to take it personally. I said if anyone ever made it personal I would always defend him, but that this was about general management decisions and to be honest I agreed with some of what they said.  It came up again while we were having lunch with his sister today and she went off at me saying I was a bitch for letting people say anything at all and that I'd clearly upset him even if he was unwilling to say so. This was exactly the kind of situation I was trying to avoid at work and now I'm worried I am the asshole!	1642968854.0	sb2olz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2olz/aita_for_not_defending_my_husband_from_my/	AITA for not defending my husband from my colleagues?
aux0f7c7	My friend (F22) and I (F21) have been friends for around three years now. She has an ex-boyfriend who she only dated for two months and knew for around three months when she was 18.  She’s always had an obsession with her ex that I couldn’t understand. While they were together, they were never stable, constantly argued and didn’t see each other often. When told that the relationship was toxic she would say “it can’t be toxic if the two people in the relationship think it’s not toxic.”  Two months ago, she told me that she got put in a groupchat with around 9 other girls that all dated her ex in the past. They wanted to ask her if she was also a victim of cheating and emotional abuse and manipulation while she was dating her ex. She couldn’t believe that he would do that. She asked the girls if she could confront him but they told her they wanted to wait until they could confront him together.   My friend and I both went home for the holiday months. When we met up again she told me that she hung out with her ex through the entire month.  I couldn’t believe that she would let this man back in her life after it was proved that he was an abuser, manipulator and cheater. I asked her why she got into contact with her again and she claimed that she didn’t believe the girls because she didn’t know what type of people they were. She didn’t believe them because her ex “wouldn’t ever lie to her”. Although the group of women asked her to respect their boundaries and not confront him, she chose to.   She told me that her feelings for him came back although he has a girlfriend. I asked her why she was so forgiving with him and she told me it’s because he has been through a lot. I told her that our struggles are not excuses for hurting other people that we love. She told me that even though she got cheated on while being with him she doesn’t care because he was struggling and said that if someone I was close to cheated I would forgive them and find sympathy “deep within my cold dark heart”.   This comment sent me over my edge and I told that she needs to enroll into therapy because she sounds stupid. I told her I couldn’t understand how she wouldn’t believe the victims over a guy she claims she is close to. Her extreme obsession with this man is healthy and I believe it is due to her underlying issues she struggles with.   I know that it wasn’t the best thing to say to her but I’m tired of hearing about this ex that she hasn’t dated in almost four years now. I always knew that this man was a walking red flag and it confirmed it more when I saw the messages from the girls. I talked to our mutual friend who she also told the story to and she told me that she also told my friend to enroll into therapy.   Am I the asshole for telling my friend that she is acting stupid in this situation?	1642968865.0	sb2orw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2orw/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_shes_stupid/	AITA for telling my friend that she’s stupid?
iy625kx2	My husband and I live a reasonable distance from the rest of our families. 10 years ago, we both had job opportunities in the south, our families live in the north. We chose to take said opportunities as it'd be cheaper housing and an increase in salary. Since then, we typically see our families once or twice a year, usually going to them.  Right before the world fell apart, my husband's sister and her husband retired about a half-hour away from us. They're 20 years older than we are, pretty well off and tired of the cold. From that point on, they started showing up unannounced. I didn't really mind, so long as I wasn't expected to play hostess. In the beginning, they were really coming by to play with our kids and visit with my husband for a little bit. In time, that delved into them wanting to drink out on the deck with us after the kids go to bed, chatting for hours. I work 50-60 hour weeks. When I come home, I just want to unplug and relax. My kids are getting to the age of being self-sufficient and don't need a ton of help. I recently told my husband, I have no issue with his sister and BIL coming over all the time, but I'm not hanging out with them each time. He yes'd me but I don't think he believed me.  The other night, I came home and there they were, helping my husband make dinner. I went upstairs, took a leisurely bath and then got into some sweats. By that time, they had already eaten dinner. I nibbled on some leftovers, checked on my kids, talked with them about their day. Once they made it clear they just wanted to play video games and chill, I slipped back into my room to watch TV. After my kids went to bed, my husband texted me asking if I'd join them on the deck for some drinks and dessert. I declined and went to bed early.  The next day, my husband said I was completely rude for not hanging out with them.

80essif5	Okay so I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. i have a severe case of eczema and it causes me to miss out on most life activities. it will sometimes cause me not to be able to move my hands or my legs without a lot of pain.   my friend, lets call her brenna, complains about everytime she gets hit with a ball her skin gets red. at the time i said "that happens to everyone" but now i know that it is a type of skin condition. but it hasnt ever gotten that bad before.  (i am allergic to every day stuff, i have a a list the size of a magic treehouse book on what my allergies are and what i can have)  brenna acts like everything is worse in her life, i wont lie, it annoys me a lot. she basically gets everything handed to her. everytime she gets hit with something or something hits her she complains that her skin is red and that it ruined her day. i've told her countless times that i have a condition that actually affects my life a lot. my other friend, lets call her kayla, agrees with me.  but i still feel like an asshole.  everytime i talk about how eczema affects my life shes always like "no one cares" but when she talks about her condition and her life its always "omg why dont you guys care!!" it makes me angry. am i the asshole??

fv6ytmlg	A friend of mine (we are both late 20s female) recently invited me to lunch since we haven't seen each other in a while. However, she insisted that we sit outside because she feels more comfortable that way.  The area we live in is undergoing severely cold weather currently, and I have never done well in the cold. The only way I can stand it is dressing really warmly (if I need to be outside), and so I got this balaclava that's a lifesaver, especially since I feel the most discomfort in my head and ears. It basically tightly covers my whole head and neck while leaving a slit for my eyes, but I can easily rearrange it to expose my mouth and nose if I'm eating/drinking.   I would have preferred to sit inside, especially since the restaurant she chose doesn't have outdoor heating units, but I agreed to my friend's condition and layered up. When she saw me, she was visibly taken aback. She told me that I looked ridiculous, and she didn't feel comfortable sitting with someone "dressed like a burglar". I told her that I'd remove the face covering part once we got our food, but I wanted to keep my head and ears warm so I'd be keeping it on throughout our meal.   She didn't like this and kept pestering me and pushing me to remove it because it wasn't even that cold (it was 10 deg not counting windchill). I finally said that the only way I'd remove it entirely is if we ate inside. She didn't want that so we remained outside, but she was pissed the whole time and kept calling me an unreasonable asshole (she knows how sensitive I am to the cold).  I don't think I was, but I asked a mutual friend who told me I was being ridiculous.	1642969178.0	sb2sxn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2sxn/aita_for_refusing_to_take_off_my_balaclava/	AITA for refusing to take off my balaclava?
8ub5u04f	 Warning, a VERY long story ahead, but the details matter. I think. Throwaway acc.   When I was a HS freshman I met this guy, A. We eventually began talking on platforms like Tumblr & FB. The next year we mostly spoke through online platforms and in class. He was someone I considered an acquaintance as I am on the spectrum and have a hard time feeling a “connection” to others + feeling genuine friendship. I know back then he had a crush on me but I was not interested.   I don’t know when we started hanging out in person but the next few years is a blur until 2018 when we hung out a lot. I don’t think we were that close until then. Just former classmates who talked online.   In 2018 A started getting bouts of depression. When we would text he would suddenly end the conversation with a “Ttyl.” And then disappear. Sometimes after he would block me. Then he would unblock me, come back, and apologize, saying he was depressed. This happened several times. He would also sometimes say mean things and then say it was his depression and that he is impulsive. It got to a point where I would get anxiety any time someone used Ttyl to leave a conversation.  When we hung out in person he was never really mean. If anything he just made me a little uncomfortable by hugging me and squeezing me a lot. I had mentioned once that I wasn’t comfortable with so much physical touch and he’d apologize and say he couldn’t help it or something like that. We would also "cuddle" which was basically me forcing myself to do that. I don't know why. I force myself to do a lot of things that make me uncomfortable and I don't know why.  So then comes the first time I cut him off. One day while I was driving with him he picked up my photography camera and I asked him not to look through it because it had some NSFW pics. Nothing too bad but not something I needed my male friend seeing. I think because I said that though, he went into my images enthusiastically. I was driving and couldn’t do anything about it. I felt uncomfortable & embarrassed.  Another time he was over at my house and I had been locked out. I climbed up through a ladder into my window, wearing a skirt. I asked him not to look up and trusted him not to. Then we got inside and everything was fine. After he left he texted me and confessed that he did look up while I was climbing. He said it was impulsive and he regretted it as soon as he did it.   Honestly I had some somewhat fresh sexual trauma + a PTSD diagnosis at the time so I reacted stronger than I maybe would now. But the buildup of the blocking and unblocking and the camera situation and then that caused me to blow up at him and try to cut him off. He argued with me for a long time about it, saying he wasn’t that bad, and the good times with him were good, right? That he was just impulsive.    He started messaging my friends, asking them to get me to speak to him. After I blocked him on Instagram he made several new ones to follow me there so he could see my posts.   You are going to think I’m SO stupid but after this behavior I accepted him back as a friend. I have a lot of trouble setting boundaries and a HUGE issue with people pleasing. So we became friends again.   I think that was 2019. Then he got another friend, a girl, and spent a lot of time with her. His depression was still bad and I think he treated her the same as me. Eventually she cuts him off. He would not tell me why and to this day I don’t know. He was suicidal and he broke his cell phone (two cell-phones within that period?) by throwing it. I think he was also self-harming but my memory is bad. I’m just too afraid to get any details wrong so bear with me please. He asked me to come over and I was scared he’d hurt himself so I did when I really didn’t want to.   Over the next few years I made small attempts to cut him off again, only to chicken out/people-please and cave. When 2020 & quarantine hit is when I stopped hanging out with him in person for good except for one or two more times after consistent asking. He would ask me almost daily, and then get upset when I said no.   This all leads up to a few weeks ago. His depression/impulsivity were still there and he was saying passive aggressive things to me for not wanting to hang out in person, and then he’d apologize and say he’s depressed. Then he’d say I’m not good for his mental health anyway. Then he’d apologize for that comment. Repeat repeat repeat.   After a while of this he confronted me and found out I did not want to be his friend anymore. It isn’t one specific thing he did and I am a pretty forgiving person. Like I think someone could stab me and I would be like, oh I'm sorry.   I understand I should have said something. My only explanation (not excuse, explanation) is that I was afraid he would do something bad. Like hurt himself or worse. I saw his response when the other girl cut him off, I saw his response the first time I cut him off. I was afraid. I feel my concerns were justified because some time during our conversation he posted something on IG about a bottle of pills.  He was very angry that I didn’t tell him sooner. He kept saying, “After 10 years of friendship” and “Did I really mean so little to you?” “How is it so easy for you to just drop 10 years of friendship?” “How long… How much time did I waste on you?” He said he didn’t want to lose his best friend of 10 years.   It felt more like I was breaking up with someone than cutting them off. He was devastated. He kept saying things like “fuck you. I don’t deserve this.” Then he’d come back and apologize. Then he’d say something angry again. Then he’d say “I’m sorry, I know how I’m being…” Then something else mean. Then he said he was going to block me, then changed his mind and said he would just unfriend me but asked me to please accept his friend request when he sends one back.   After a few days he didn’t text me. I didn’t block him on anything because I felt like it would be mean? I don’t know. But then he texted me on FB and said, “How was it so easy for you?”   After that I did block him. Only on FB. Almost immediately he messaged me on snapchat. He said “I’m sorry. Bye.” “Actually I’m not sorry. I didn’t do anything to deserve this treatment. Bye.”  Then he texted my number and said “Seriously it’s so fucked up how you went about this. 10 years meant so little to you? I used to think you were nice lmao.”   I understand he is angry and I understand how I could be TA because I should have ended it way sooner and stopped pretending everything was fine when I wanted to leave. I understand it must hurt to lose someone you care about and I know how I'd feel if it were done to me. I get that he needs something to express his anger toward. There are people who have hurt me who I would love to confront.   So I guess I get it although I wish he would accept my decision and move on. I wanted to include details of our past because I think the buildup is important to explain my thought process and why I made the decisions I did and why I was afraid. I think I am going to block him soon but because I can see why I’d be TA, I decided to stop lurking and take this here.	1642969069.0	sb2rho	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb2rho/aita_for_cutting_off_a_friend_who_is_obsessed/	AITA for cutting off a friend who is obsessed with me?
361ixvqg	About a couple weeks back, my husband and I came to an agreement that as long as I spent my art commission money on it, I could get elden ring because we were tight on money. I had saved up my money and told him I had enough for elden ring and I was really excited to be able to buy it, and he told me that was awesome. Then a few hours passed and he told me I needed to send my money over because he forgot to pay a bill before he took us out for drinks the night before, and I was very upset, but I agreed because it's a bill and it needed to be paid. He tells me he doesn't understand why I'm upset and I shouldn't be crying because it's just a game and the bill was more important. I told him that I understand that, which is why I agreed to pay our bill, but that it wouldn't change the fact that it was money I had put back for my game, and he should've been more responsible before taking us out. Though we both enjoyed the drinks, we should've checked to make sure all things important were paid off prior, so that's both of our faults.

4dwd8kv2	My partner and I have been living together for 6 months. For context: I was super stressed by my prior job, and they helped convince me to walk away from it, and then convinced me moving in with them was the logical step as I was unable to find a job in the month after quiting. When I moved in with them (35yo NB) and their child (12yo), I (28m) did the lions share of the chores (vacuuming, cat litter, dusting, tidying up after everyone in the house, dishes, laundry, cooking, taking out the trash, etc.), while job hunting and doing odd jobs for friends, family, and community to pay my lessened bills.  I have since found a job where I work 4 shifts overnight, 12hrs a night, every week. My partner has been going through schooling and two internships this whole time, as well as having their kid to take care of (its a poly relationship, the kid is taken care of by both parents as well as a stepmom, a third parent figure, and myself a little). They have asked that I start shouldering some of the bills, approximately 1/3 of them (any more could apparently effect their divorce settlement) , while also paying down debts both from my 4ish months jobless and from prior mistakes. I'm very happy to do so and not feel like as much of a burden.  But the heart of the issue is this- they still want me to do the following chores: tidying up after everyone on the weekends, cat litter, helping tidy the bedroom on weekends, all of the laundry still, all of the cooking still (do large batches on the weekends), and any dishes that are generated on the weekends (which, if all the cooking is happening on the weekends, will be 80+% of them). They've taken up the chores of vacuuming, dusting, and about 2/3 of taking out the trash and other random things that pop up.  AITA for getting grumpier every day that I can't keep up with chores, and when I ask for help it's an argument?	1642969773.0	sb311q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb311q/aita_for_chore_division/	AITA for chore division?
bk2cgcc4	My boyfriend (34M) of six months makes annoying remarks about food each time I’m at his place. Before he comes over at my place, he tells me exactly what he’s craving and I always go to the store and buy the ingredients even though I already have food at my house just to please him and because I enjoy seeing him happy. When I’m over, he nags me over every little thing. Why you didn’t finish your cup of coffee? Don’t waste coffee. Why you didn’t finish your croissant? Are you going to the kitchen to add more cheese on your pasta?! Cheese is expensive. Don’t buy this juice for 3$, get the 1$ one. I tried to be cool and ignore it but I can’t anymore. I’m not a food waster but I can’t have someone policing me over two sips of coffee left or a bit of cheese on top of my pasta.

iy6cmpbv	To give a background, me (30f) and my husband (32f) were due to do some decorating, we asked my mother if she could have our daughter (5f) for 3 days, she agreed. My daughter has medicated dietary issues which mean she needs to eat fruit before meals so that she doesn’t just fill up on carbs and sugar otherwise her condition worsens and becomes painful. My mother knows this and despite being asked to give my daughter fruit before meals (and usually doing this on previous occasions) my daughter has said that her grandmother gave her no fruit before meals over the 3 days she stayed. My mother has confirmed this saying she’s sorry and she “forgot”, this had made me lose trust in letting her look after my daughter again. On top of this I asked if my mother would take the time to read a book a day with my daughter for school, my mother took the time to read one book over the 3 days which has frustrated me as all I’m asking for is a little help. We both work full time and still find time to read with our daughter in evenings but my retired mother didn’t find time in 2 days to read a book with her (I expect my daughter spent hours upstairs watching an iPad instead). Bottom line, I appreciate that she did me a favour by looking after my daughter but to “forget” about her health issues and not bother to spend reading with her has really hurt me. She is the only grandparent my daughter has and the only blood relation (apart from my daughter) I have but I feel totally left down and alone as I don’t have any support from her. These are just 2 examples of how she disregards requests when it comes to my daughters care. I should also note that I don’t expect my mother to provide care , I would pay a stranger if I needed to but she had said she’s happy to look after her.	1642970245.0	sb37pe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb37pe/aita_for_threatening_to_stop_my_mother_from/	AITA for threatening to stop my mother from looking after my daughter without supervision?
iy6uybem	I (21f) recently developed tinnitus a few months ago. It's devastated me because I've always made sure to take really good care of my ears as I play instruments (never go anywhere loud without earplugs, don't listen to anything at max volume etc), but I woke up one day with ringing in my head out of nowhere. It's not caused by any medical issues, so my doctor said it's unfortunately something to learn to live with.     Taking showers is pretty much my only relief from this, as fans and white noise machines I've tried don't work. I take a shower every day and lengthened them from \~10 minutes to about a half hour long, with the majority of time spent sitting down and chilling. Being able to have a clear head even for a short amount of time really helps stave off the depression and dread I feel of possibly having this for the rest of my life. However, my roommates Kay (24f) and Ray (19f) absolutely hate it.     As this is a somewhat recent development for me, I make sure to try and take my showers when they aren't home. If they do happen to be home and need something in the bathroom I get out immediately. They say this isn't good enough though and that it's annoying to know I'm going to be in the bathroom "forever" for something that's not even that bad, which really frustrates me because they know how much this has affected me. I've offered to pay the entire water bill as compensation, but Ray said she just wanted me to stop wasting water and Kay agreed. It's caused a lot of tension whenever we're all home and I'm wondering if I should just suck it up because I'll probably have to eventually.

iy70qsut	Basically, I'm in a discord community. It's not a big one, but it is for a video game. Recently- about a couple weeks ago- I was asked to become a moderator for said community. I said yes, of course, because I really liked being there and had made a few friends; I also thought that the admin of the server was friendly and liked me.   Well, that all changed real fast I guess.   The catalyst event was when the discord admin showed up to a community event both high and drunk. They were so stoned and inebriated they couldn't talk or lead their part of the event (they were co-leading with me) so I had to step up and lead the entire thing. They eventually passed out midway through, and many people left.. including the server. After that, I asked the admin to try not to drink or smoke so much before hosting a large scale event- which they said they would. They then said if they were that bad, they would take a momentary step back from the server to work some things out.  Now comes the kicker- the final straw in what I assume is the coffin. I reached out to a member for help with a tech related issue (they had had far more experience than me), and in the middle of the conversation they asked me, a mod, to remove a role they weren't affiliated with anymore. Thinking it was no big deal, especially because I had never been told we weren't supposed to do this, I said I was able to do that and so therefore I removed the role.  I let my fellow mods, as well as the admin, know what had happened and then I went to bed. When I woke up- I had messages demanding why I hadn't redirected the request to the admin, or why the person hadn't let the admin know. I said that I don't know, and I didn't think it was a big deal since they asked us to become mods to help manage the server.   I was then told I had stepped out of line and we were not to mess with roles- which, okay. I've modded and admined servers before and not once has this ever been told to me; and it especially hadn't been told to me when I joined this team- and I wasn't sure why it was a big deal since the mods and I all had the ability to create, give, and take away roles.   The admin is now giving me the cold shoulder and some of the other mods are too. I don't see why, because all I did was something a member asked of me as a mod. So am I the asshole	1642970730.0	sb3eeu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3eeu/aita_for_doing_my_job/	AITA for doing my job?
5u9j0cil	Long story sorry, we recently started having issues with our upstairs neighbors D (f) & J (m). They complained about our dog barking all day to property management and then about two weeks later complained again that our dog barks constantly.  Honestly, I do not believe these complaints to be valid as we have never had any complaints before and our two other neighbors both said that the dog does not bark all day. I would like to make a point that the people above us have never complained about our dog barking all day before nor did they ever let us know if he was. My husband and I were always under the assumption that our relationship with our neighbors was good. We would say hello and talk to each other so I don’t know why they never felt like they couldn’t approach us if there was a problem.  Well last Friday, after my husband left for work and I hadn’t gotten home yet, J apparently came down to our apartment with 3 other guys and started banging on the door shouting profanities, calling my husband a p***y and trying to provoke my husband out to fight. This is all according to my other neighbor, we will call him S. S approached us on Sunday when we saw each other to let us know what happened and I promptly wrote an email to the property manager about it. I assume that J heard my husband call the leasing office to discuss the complaint and heard my husband complain about the loud music that we can hear over our tv all the time (yes kind of petty I know but we have never complained about them before and they would have parties until 2am on a Wednesday night and some of us had to wake up at 4am). I feel anxious in my home when I’m here alone now since this, which is a decent amount of time since my husband typically works nights until 8:30pm and I am usually off on weekends while he works.  Anyway, today around 12:30-1:00pm, I’m home alone and I can kind of see someone moving around outside the doors, and I hear a bang, look out my window and see J using S’s step stool and my grill and window to get onto his balcony because I assume he was locked out. It freaked me out obviously to see someone climbing on the windowsill and annoyed me that he was using other peoples property without permission to get on his balcony when he could have called his girlfriend D to come home and to unlock the door. Especially after everything else recently, I don’t know why he thought this was ok. So WIBTA if I emailed property management about this most recent incident? I haven’t told my husband yet about it and I don’t know if I am going to.	1642970688.0	sb3dtu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3dtu/wibta_if_i_complained_to_property_management/	WIBTA if I complained to property management about my upstairs neighbor using my window to climb onto their balcony?
iy6vpnia	I will not add gender ages or my injury due to it all still being fresh, and since this is a burner account On mobile I was hit by a car the other day on my way to the bank. Due to work not giving me enough hours and a quarantine I didn't have enough for bills but my roommate agreed I could pay mostly and pay the rest on a later date. Then I got his and will be out if work for 6 weeks to heal if I heal. Now my roommate was not heartless and went straight for the rent. They did ask if I was okay and when I told them about everything they then went on about rent once the shock wore off, so I was crying and alone because I wasn't allowed visitors yet. I did cuss at them about how I would work if I could, obviously I was stressed, they then went on about how their name was on everything and they couldn't afford rent without me and their stress. I'm unfortunately a people pleaser and told them I was sorry, I felt awful for making their stress and anxiety worse. But I needed their support. I as a coping mechanism is tell people the pain I'm feeling and what's going on with me not the best but I used to bottle these things. They told me to stop and they were going through their own thing. I replied with an sorry. But they continued with telling me to ask before sharing which is fair, but I have asked them not to talk about rent well I was still in the hospital but they didn't. They gave an apology well going on about how they were stressed. They keep thinking I'm just going to move back with my parent and leave them in the dust, I decided to spend a week with my parent until I can stand with supports. So they don't have to carry me to the bathroom. Am I an asshole for getting upset with them for going on about rent and not helping me emotionally through this?

92ziiouy	in my previous post i talked about my father and my resentment towards him. i (15f) brought my hatred of my father to my mother. i told her how scared i was of him. i told her how i panic and flinch when ever he comes around me. i told her how lonely and un loved i feel.   she told me that i need to respect i him and i can’t be so arrogant about everything. here’s where i might have been the asshole; all my life my father would yell and scream and beat my confidence down and my mother will never do anything to stop him. she let it happen and then would console me saying that “your father doesn’t know how to speak correctly” and that he didn’t mean it.  i brought it up to her how uneasy i felt when she didn’t have the guts to stand up for her own kids (i have a twin (15f))  i told her that if she refused to help me she was equally as bad as him. i also told her how pissed i was that her and her husband didn’t bother getting me therapy after i was diagnosed with mental health issues.  at this point i told her my number one was my sister and that’s when she got really upset with me and asked why she wasn’t number one. she kept saying me she knew me bette than my sister did and that’s when i lost it. i told her “that’s ridiculous considering how neither you [my parents] never cared about my mental health, how do you expect to know the real me when you created a situation where i had to put an act on so i wouldn’t get in trouble” for background info i got yelled at after getting my mental health diagnosis because i apparently had no reason to feel that way. so aita for snapping at my mom?	1642971206.0	sb3kwo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3kwo/aita_for_snapping_at_my_mom/	AITA for snapping at my mom?
7bvvozra	So maybe about a year ago my fiancé (M 26) surprised me (F 27) with flowers. It was a really sweet gesture that I appreciated, but when he came home with the flowers the only vase we had that would fit them needed to be cleaned. The kitchen was also a big mess so I needed to do the dishes before I could properly clean the vase. I kind of just temporarily put them in the only thing I could find, which was a big pitcher we usually use for iced tea or lemonade. I just stuck them in there with some water but they were still tied with all the stems and the plastic wrapping. They were still in the pitcher the next day when we were leaving to see my mom for lunch he asked if he should just give the flowers to my mom because I didn’t seem to like them. I was hurt that he wanted to give my flowers away and sad that he thought I didn’t appreciate them, so I cleaned the kitchen and the vase and cut the flowers and arranged them in the vase before we left. This is whole story is clearly something he still thinks about because he brings it up a lot. This morning he brought it up again so I finally said, “look, I love when you buy me flowers, but it would be nice if you put them in a vase so I don’t have to.” He immediately got agitated and said it was all about the gesture and to let me know he was thinking about me when he was out. I said yes it’s a thoughtful gesture, but taking the extra step to put them in a vase doesn’t take away from that gesture. I also explained that when you give someone a gift that creates extra work for them, it sort of distracts from the niceness of the gift. This really upset him and he just said “fine, I’ll never buy you flowers again,” and now we aren’t talking. AITA? I love that he does little things for me and I want him to know that I appreciate him. I just wanted him to know where I was coming from with the whole flower debacle.	1642971169.0	sb3kf3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb3kf3/aita_for_asking_my_fiancé_to_put_flowers_in_a/	AITA for asking my fiancé to put flowers in a vase when he gifts them to me?
25fzk569	Me (23M) and GF (22F) of almost 3 years live 2h apart (but my hometown is her current uni town and her hometown is my current uni town so we see each other every weekend). GF has been with my friends quite a lot, at smaller house gathering and we even took a month long trip together this summer. She also gets along super great with my best friend and the three of us have done many things together. But since autumn, we haven't hung out with me+GF+friends, bc I live in dif. city and bc of the pandemic also. And my gf doesn't either, bc she isn't that close to be hanging around without me (she doesn't want to also).  But I got an invitation to a party at friends' country house (about 1h drive from my hometown) just after the holidays and it was an overnight party on a Monday. The host was the same friend who we took the month long trip together. I told my girlfriend that and she just said "okay". I didn't think of anything since the party was Mon-Tue + she said she was busy with school during those days. When the party got closer she found out that due to some other factors she was free during the days and asked if she could come to the party. I said I'll ask the host. She also asked who else will be coming and I said the names of friends (all she knew), and 2 of their girlfriends were coming as well, all others were boys. She asked if I wanted her to come, to which I replied, of course I do. But I still didn't ask the host if she could come. Idk why, I hadn't been talking to the host as much recently (like 6 months) and I feel a bit like an outsider to group and I thought it was weird if I asked another guest there.  So the day of the party arrives, she's at her hometown, I'm at my hometown. The plan was for me and bf to start driving there around the afternoon, but I found out best friend has some errands to run around 2-5 pm. My gf called in the morning around 11 and asked if she can come since her plans were cancelled. It was still sufficient time enough for her to make it into town. I said that we have to do some work (outside of town) and after that we'll drive there and that she probably won't make it in time. But I don't know why I said that, when we actually started driving to the party place around 6 pm. The party wasn't anything special anyways, just drinking and some games, but it was so uncomfortably cold there, so I decided to come back earlier (original plan was to be there until Wed).  The next day after the party, she had come to my hometown to do some errands, and called, asked when I'll be back. I told her around what time I'd be back. We met and made up, I said to her that I wished she had been at the party too (since I actually did), but she probably wouldn't've liked it anyway since it was too cold and the party wasn't even that special  She didn't seem mad she hadn't been there, but seemed hurt I didn't invite her still.

4huu28ui	So about 3 years ago, my husband "John" and I bought a piece of land in the country so that we could eventually build a house. We assumed the timeline would be in the following year or two, because I was pregnant with our second/last baby and figured it would take some time.  One thing I was adamant about when we purchased the land, however, is that John needed to finish and sell an antique car that he was restoring before we built a house.  He bought this antique car as an "investment" over 10 years ago, expecting to finish it within a year or two, and to make a profit that would become a down payment for a house in the future.  Narrator: It was not an investment, and would not make a profit.  After some rough experiences with some not so nice people, as well as life getting in the way (marriage and 2 kids), here we are over 10 years later with an antique car that has had tens of thousands of dollars sunk into it and is still not complete (although a lot closer than a year ago). If John could work on it full days, it would probably get to 95% complete in 2-3 weeks.   John was disappointed last year when some unlucky things happened and it was evident that we just wouldn't be able to start building in 2021. He was hopeful that 2022 would be the year. However, I kept noticing that as much as he would like to get the car finished, it is not getting finished.  Yesterday we had an argument about the whole situation and now I'm wondering if I'm TA. He came to me with a plan that we could start the process this year - we would start meeting with banks and get a mortgage ready to go with a start date of this spring. He could keep working on the car and get the majority of it done before we start building. Then once it's sold, we can put the $ on the mortgage and it will be the same as if we held off.  Apart from holding firm to my original condition, I also argued with him that I doubt he would be able to complete as much work on the car as he thinks he can (he is notorious for overestimating how much can be done), not to mention right now we are keeping both kids home from daycare because our region is going through a COVID outbreak and it will be hard for us to get everything done that needs to be done in preparation for the build (building permits, bank meetings, gathering information/docs needed for quotes, etc).  I'm feeling like an AH because if I hold him to this promise, it is pushing back our plans by another whole year (because we can't build during the winter), and he is pretty disappointed that I'm being so stubborn. He thinks that planning to sell the car this year is the same thing as selling the car before we start any of the process, but I have watched him and others in his family struggle to finish projects on time, as well as the long process of selling (even when they are convinced it will sell in a flash - and almost ALWAYS selling for less than they expect).  AITA for holding him to this promise and making us wait a whole other year to build?	1642972615.0	sb44y8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb44y8/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_go_back_on_a/	AITA for not letting my husband go back on a promise?
iy6iq7c8	My husband (41M) and I (38F) are together for 4 years and have been living in Brazil for our entire relationship. He’s an American, I’m a Brazilian. We met when he came to work in Sao Paulo, initially just for a year.   According to him, his marriage had ended before he moved here, but apparently his (now) ex-wife thought they were still working things out, because she saw it as infidelity when he started dating me and, in her eyes, I’m the woman who “stole” her husband from her. You can imagine it’s not an easy situation.  The thing is, they have a son together, who’s now 12. My husband and I also have a 2 year old daughter. Lately, he’s been pressuring me to move to the US with him, so he can be close to his son. I can understand that, but he’s asking me to give up a lot of what I’ve been working for in these past few years – career-wise, I know I won’t find an equivalent job in the US.   So I told him I will agree to move, even though it won’t be the best scenario for me, IF and only if his ex would give us joint custody. Apparently she’ll only agree on “every other weekend”, which amounts to less than 30 days a semester. That’s pretty much the same amount of time we have with his son now, since he comes to Brazil every holiday to stay with us (the last summer he spent more than a month here, which is more than what we would have living in the US). I don't think it's worth it for us to change our entire lives over that kind of time.  In my husband’s eyes, I’m pushing him into a custody battle with his ex, instead of just agreeing with his request. He says I wouldn’t make this request if I really cared about his relationship with his son, which makes me sad, because I love his son just as if he was my own. I also fear he will resent me if things continue this way. He’ll see me as the person who’s keeping him away from his son.

a1q8uuy6	I 26f spent the night at my parents place but before I left I had slept in to almost 2pm and I didnt do all of the usual cleaning I do on Saturdays. My husband 27m said I must have needed it because I work so hard and have been so down lately. Late at night while texting, my husband says that something smells really bad in the apartment. I ask if it could be the dishes or the garbage, and he says that it isnt either of those things. I said okay I will deal with it tomorrow and he says 'nah bro'   In my head I took that as he will find the source of the smell himself and deal with it. I came home to find the window open. The garbage was not taken out but its not smelly so whatever. But the dishes he made were put into the sink that I was drying a mop pad. So the sink REEKS because he had thrown dirty dishes ontop of the pad then ran water over it and now the pad is dirty again but worse because its saturated in old food run off at the bottom of the sink.  I asked if he really just opened the window and called it a night? He told me that he opened it because he was hot and that i should fix my attitude. I said "yes master, your quarters will be cleaned upon your arrival. Please forgive dobby" he is pissed and said nobody even asked me to clean. And he is right about that.   Maybe I took it too far because I know I have a higher standard of clean then him which is why I do all of the cleaning, but this time the hole apartment stuck from it and i feel that means it NEEDS to be done. Not optional.  I work full time and he works 3-4 days a week. His job is very physical and mine is very mental. I do all the cleaning laundry and budgeting and he cooks 2-3 times a week and does like 90% of the grocery shopping. He doesnt clean up after himself though. I have been very exhausted lately and was so happy to think I was getting a break. I think I may have just snapped when I realised that was not the case.	1642972895.0	sb4904	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb4904/aita_for_referring_to_myself_as_a_house_elf/	AITA for referring to myself as a house elf?

There are thick layers of dirt and grime throughout the house.  I need somewhere to work temporarily but there literally isn't a 3x3 foot area that I could use - I could shove all of the garbage into one side of each room, but, that's how it's already been for decades.  Everyone hates themselves here because of how filthy the place has been for decades, and I need a place where I can set up a workspace so I can go to work.  My dog came in to lay down beside me just now but there isn't enough room for him to lay down anywhere on this side of the house, so he's resting in another room somewhere.  WIBTA if I threw out some of the trash that's already trash?  Asking my brothers if we recycle has already caused an argument, and I have no idea why - they went on an insane rant about how some of the things in the garbage piles are very valuable, and, I'm not looking to throw anything useful out.

7qnx1bhr	For some context, we had been keeping the yoga ball just in our living room next to the couch. It annoyed me and my dad a lot. Whenever we had company coming over we would throw it in my dads office, which was already jam packed with other stuff that my mother refused to get rid of. My mom and dad were having an argument over all the clutter when I got home and I suggested that we could deflate the yoga ball since it hadn’t been used in a while. My mom immediately got defensive and started going off on how their conversation had nothing to do with me. I backed off and said that I was just trying to offer some suggestions, but she continues to shout, saying that she was going to use it (which is the excuse she comes up with any time we try to get rid of something). She continues by saying that one yoga ball does not take up that much space anyway. This starts to upset me, so I bring up the fact that my dads office is piled to the roof with shit we don’t need, and the yoga ball is an awkward thing to try to store inflated. She refuses to listed and continues to shout and berate me. I go to the bathroom in an attempt to avoid it. At this point I am very upset and am in tears. She continues to shout with my dad, and she says that we are trying to force her to get rid of something that she has a use for to lose weight. She gets progressively more and more loud and angry, and next thing I hear is a loud pop. I come out to find that she had taken scissors and popped the ball.

84sdnk4g	My husband & I (43,f)have found ourselves being left out with more & more as the years have gone on from our friend group. Or what we thought was our friend group.  My husband has been friends with the same guys since high school. I moved to live with him after college, they all became my friends too. We even all lived together. Since my husband & I had been together since we were in college we married a good 5 years before the rest of them did.   They met girls & got married & we all started having families. Having met & hung out together when they were dating the guys, the girls are a lot closer to each other than they are to me. It never dawned on me to be an issue, because I’m super close to their husbands.  To start off, we were invited to everything. Birthday parties, parent’s night out dinners, girl’s nights. Slowly, we have found ourselves being invited to less & less. We’d watch as they posted pictures of our group of friends doing things together without us.   I mean it felt like one moment they were throwing us a baby shower & letting me host my husband’s 40th birthday party at their house & the next moment they were going camping without & not inviting us to their kids birthday parties.  So we asked our best friend, my husband’s best man of next time they were making plans, if he could bring up we were feeling left out. I know it was a lot to ask him, but like we said at that point we were confused why they were forgetting us.  When the next event came along an we still weren’t included we were past confused & now hurt.  I told my husband I was finally going to speak up. He told me it wasn’t the best idea, but he wouldn’t stop me.   So I clicked sad faces on FB posts of their trip we weren’t invited to. Immature, I am well aware. I deleted them, but not before they saw them.  Thinking maybe they didn’t understand why I was sending sad faces, I decided to send them this message ( from FB Messenger)  ‘I know I’m not showing a huge level of maturity with the sad faces.   But I have to admit Jake and I are pretty hurt.   We feel like we don’t get included in a lot of things that you all do as a group these days.   And I don’t know why.   If we made some kind of mistake at some point? Are we annoying? Is it our kids?  I know Jake especially, because those are his guys. And he doesn’t know what he might have done to fall out.  He even went as far as to say something to the guys last year about it.   But I’ll stop being a crybaby. I just wanted you to know why.’  From that all hell broke loose.  According to them my husband and I were being butthurt their words exactly. They were all best friends & if they didn’t want to hang out with us they didn’t have to. There was definitely a bit of a fight.  Our best friend told my husband that his wife will NEVER forgive us for my FB message. That she will hold the grudge forever.   I really am asshole for wanting to know WHY we weren’t being included?	1642974896.0	sb514y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb514y/aita_for_asking_why_we_were_being_left_out/	AITA For Asking Why We Were Being Left Out?
iy8kxn1k	My 23f ex husband 35m and I have 1 year old twins together and due to a lot of complications from that pregnancy I got a partial hysterectomy. We divorced during my pregnancy after I discovered he cheated on me. He’s a good dad and his girlfriend is now pregnant. He cheated on me with his current girlfriend but she didn’t know he had a wife at the time, and I firmly believe that.  I run a pretty successful baking company in our small town and I do custom desserts including gender reveal cakes.   My husbands girlfriend called me and asked if I would be willing to do a gender reveal cake for them and said it would mean a lot of “the mother of her baby’s siblings made the cake for the party.”   I told her I had to think about it but eventually told her no. I am admittedly incredibly bitter at my ex for cheating on me while I was bedridden and medically fragile being pregnant with his children, and I don’t want to be involved in the celebration of their new child. I did specify that it wasn’t her, but I couldn’t do it and she said alright and hung up.   My ex then called me and told me I was being rude and unreasonable and completely unprofessional putting our issues before my business. I told him I was allowed to refuse service to anyone and hung up on him.  I feel like I have let my feelings get in the way of my business and if I made the cake it’s not like I have to be there to celebrate.   On the other hand, I do feel like I’m allowed to refuse business however I see fit.

iy9d8ta0	My (23M) longtime friend (25M) recently had a child and decided to get married, asking me to be one of his groomsman. Though we aren't the closest friends anymore (live several hours apart), he was my next door neighbor since 6th grade and all the way through high school. We went to college together and were mutual friends with his now fiance. Since he is a young recent college graduate who now has a family to provide for, he is asking the groomsmen to pay for the expenses of the bachelor party. This wouldn't seem unreasonable to me aside from the fact that its a very expensive schedule (about 800-1000 dollars each for the weekend, complete with limo rides, wine tastings, high-end restaurants and hotels, etc.) The wedding itself will likely cost an additional 300-500 for hotels and what not. I understand that its not out of the ordinary for groomsman to pay such expenses, but considering that all of his groomsman are in a similar situation to me (under 25 recent college graduates still looking for long-term employment), I find it unnecessarily expensive. For context I am currently living at home with my parents and working doordash part-time until I start grad school. While I am fortunate enough to have my parents looking after me, these expenses would leave with little to nothing from what little I already have saved for minor personal expenses. I've voiced my concerns to him and he responded by saying that if I can't afford the bachelor party then I shouldn't come to the wedding at all. I find it rude to the say the least considering he understands the situation I (and likely some of his other groomsman) are in. I'm happy for my friend and want to be there to support him, but I can't justify making what I consider to be a piss poor economic decision in doing so. Thanks in advance for reading.  tl;dr: Am I the asshole for not wanting to spend what I consider an exorbitant amount on my friend's wedding?	1642975012.0	sb52sj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb52sj/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_what_i_consider_a/	AITA for not wanting to spend what I consider a lot of money on my friend's wedding?
7ix0lc55	Sorry for the grammar, english isn't my first lamgauge  So, my mom (37F) recently got a divorce and started dating F(26M). They act all cute and stuff yada yada yada. But now, he wants kids. This wouldn't be an issue at first, if my mother didn't have an autoimune disease that lowers her platelets. As a result, wounds won't close properly and stuff. Althought it seems to me that my mom doesn't want more kids, F, my brother and F's mom are very convinced they are going to have more children.  He constantly talks about having children and it makes me very uncomfortable. When I told him that my mom shouldn't have more kids, he said that they are going to wait a year, which still isn't good because this things take time to heal and my mom is already somewhat old to have children, and I'm afraid that she might die while giving birth, or misscarying. He kept joking, saying that I'm afraid that the baby will steal the spotlight.

a26aptr0	Howdy folks,  Here's the scenario for you.  At the end of summer, I was fortunate enough to find a 3080 at market value which gave me the platform to build a new PC.  My old computer was built in 2017 and was sitting around doing nothing so I was thinking about selling it. My cousin, however, had a computer from 2011 and wasn't doing too great so I decided to give it to him on the condition he use it until he could afford his own new build, in which case, it would come back to me and I'd sell it then.  My cousin agrees and comes to pick it up no problem. Not even a week later he tells me it's not working. I *know* with 100% certainty it was working fine when I gave it to him so I ask him what happened?  Turns out, instead of just plugging his hard drives into the computer and running it, he pulled out my power supply/cables to put in his computers power supply. He did this without ever having put together a computer before in his life so when he turned it on, it blew the motherboard (or at least I think it did, the error code suggests as much but I didn't know that at the time).  A week before Christmas, I'm at his place swapping everything back how I had it initially to try and tinker/troubleshoot in person (we live in separate cities so I can't just pop over). The computer is sitting in the basement in -10C weather. I bring it upstairs to warm up, then begin rerunning the wires and while it doesn't boot, it does give me a MOBO error code that suggests the board is fried. I tell my cousin that he can just put the video card in his old computer for now and when he gets a chance to take it all in for repairs to do it and let me know the outcome.  He says he'll do it when he gets the money. I say sure, no worries.  Christmas comes and goes, and he tells me he's buying a new tattoo machine with some money he got from his parents. A few days later he tells me he's buying a new freezer. Sum total for each item = approx. 1k.  Now, in my head, I'm thinking if I were in his shoes, I would have used part of the money to fix the computer and use it. After all, he just got a new tattoo machine earlier in the year that has nothing wrong with it but the computer is a signficant upgrade. It just seems like the right thing to do imho but who am I?  Instead of causing a scene over it, I look on Amazon today and find a replacement motherboard. I'm willing to forgive and forget what happened and the material cost of the card he broke. I just ask him if he'd be able to throw the video card back in my build and bring it out to me so I can fix it.  He seemed fine with the request at first thinking I was just going to fix it and give it back to him. I say I'm going to fix it and will be looking to sell it since I feel betrayed by him. I tell him what I think without being confrontational just trying to lay out facts how I saw them (like how I'm trying to do now for you all).  He tells me since I'm selling it, it's my responsibility to come pick it up. He's not going to do anything to help.  So, that leads me here, am I the asshole for asking for my computer back (regardless of whether it was to fix or sell)?	1642975720.0	sb5cz3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5cz3/aita_for_asking_for_my_computer_back/	AITA for asking for my computer back?
iy7x4lzw	I'm going to refer to everyone as in-laws despite BF and I not being married just for simplicity.  Last month, during the holiday season, SIL was at her parents' house and decided to go through stuff in her old room. At the bottom of a drawer, she found an old keychain that came with a special edition of a videogame she had gotten many years ago (it's unclear to me if she bought or if her parents bought it for her). It happens to be a game I really like and still play from time to time. Since she didn't want it anymore she asked me if I wanted to keep it and I said yes.  So, I go to my in-laws house for new year's and SIL brings out the keychain to give to me. As soon as MIL sees this she kind of flips and tells SIL she has no business giving that to me and that she wants it. Everyone was kind of in shock and not even taking it very seriously at first because no one understood why on earth MIL would want it (she never played the game). MIL is known to want to keep things but never really using them for anything. I wasn't present for the whole discussion, as they moved it to another room, but I got the impression MIL just wanted it because she thought it was cool and was in her house therefore it was hers (which I don't really agree but whatever). I was disappointed, but I didn't want to upset and go against MIL in her own house, so I didn't put the keychain away with my things and just left it on a side table in the living room where it had been left sitting during this whole discussion.  For the 3/4 days I was there the keychain just sat there. MIL didn't put it away, I don't think she even touched it. When we were about to leave my BF told me to take it (MIL wasn't present), as it wasn't his mom's to decide who it went to, since it was his sister's and she had given it to me, and that his mom would just throw it into another drawer and never look at it again. He put it in my bag and I didn't take it out, and we haven't heard a word about this subject from MIL since.  Well, as it turns out, MIL has been giving SIL hell over having given that keychain to me. Apparently it comes up literally every time they talk on the phone. We learned this because SIL called my BF to ask him to please just give the keychain back to their mom. BF said their mom is being ridiculous and just wants to hang onto trash whereas I actually appreciate it.  BF says I should keep it and that his mom will eventually let it go and forget about it. I want to keep it, and do think MIL is being unreasonable. But it's also not like giving it up is going to devastate me and it would put an end to this ridiculous drama between MIL and SIL.

iy9bbbnq	MIL has a best friend "Sarah" We are in a social circle where most of the women their age at least don't work, so one thing I've noticed is extremely close friendships. I'd say Sarah and and MIL verge on co-dependent. I'm not judging or anything, just trying to establish when I saw friend I mean someone she sees multiple times a week for like four hours at a time and lots of girls trips, a couple weeks a year together on vacation at least, so I do understand if she feels closer to Sarah than her son.  My fiancé and SILs grew up with Sarah's kids and my husband is best friend's with Sarah's son "Jake" Sarah is unhealthily attached to her precious baby boy. She was the MIL from absolute hell and made Jake's partner "Riley" miserable. She bullied her, belittled her, tried to set him up with other girls, really hurt her self esteem.  MIL isn't a huge fan of me either, but she is nothing like Sarah, but MIL has her own life and isn't one of those people who clings to her kids. Now I know no one acted great here, but after Sarah bullied Riley at her own wedding, wore an inappropriate dress, and was rude to her, Riley was so done with her shit, so we printed text messages from Sarah's husband's phone which proved he was cheating and put them in a birthday card and left the card and flowers for her to find the morning of her birthday.  I will just summarize it as Sarah is not doing well at all. She loved that man. She spent a little while in a wellness center, lived in MILs guest room or a couple months, and they are in the process of divorce. I actually go back and forth and sometimes feel bad for my role in it. MIL hasn't really spoken to us since it happened, but I was still surprised when she RSVPs no to our wedding. My husband took it really hard and almost teared up a bit (they used to be close)  I called her and said I understand why she is mad at us but a wedding is once in a lifetime and her son loves her. I personally would really like her there. MIL said I shouldn't have reached out and bothered her and we are awful people and she hopes our wedding is a mess and our marriage fails. I said she was wrong to chose a friend over her own child and I have a hard time respecting that. I said I know how close they are, but he is her son, her flesh and blood, and Sarah isn't going to take care of her when she is old or give her grandkids. MIL yelled at me that she couldn't care less about our wedding and that I had no right to call her.	1642976119.0	sb5iw4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5iw4/aita_for_telling_mil_she_is_wrong_to_chose_her/	AITA for telling MIL she is wrong to chose her friend over her son?
iy9hwbvt	So me (21F) and my boyfriend (22M), let’s call him Ben, have been together for nearly 2 years and have lived with one another for about a year.   When we first met we were both going to uni, but covid made things really difficult. Ben decided to leave and is now pursuing an online course instead. I’m still at uni, but resitting my second year. Since I’m estranged from my parents, I get quite a large student loan and I also work part time (have done for 3 years now) which is how I pay for my phone bills, rent etc. Ben comes from a slightly more well off family than me, and his mum manages to give him a budget for these things.  Now before I start bashing him, I just want to point out that Ben is an amazing boyfriend. He does help with housework when I ask him to, he cooks and cleans when I’m working and have a lot of studying to do and overall he looks after me like nobody else. But despite all this, in all honesty, I think he’s lazy. He just refuses to get a job, he wakes up between 1-3pm every day and will stay in bed for an hour after that, and from what I’ve seen he rarely does any work for his online course. He gets flustered and irritable if me or his mum mention getting a job to him but I feel like I work so hard trying to balance studying and my part time job, shouldn’t he be trying to save some money too?   We are looking for a new flat to rent for next month and are struggling to find one we can afford, and once we finish school we want to move into a house together, but he has no intention of getting a job or saving money. It’s gotten to a point where it really effects me and how I feel about our relationship. I feel like he has no intentions of contributing towards our future. After many teary conversations and arguments about the subject I told him he is to get a job in two months (by Feb) or I’m leaving. It’s not the end of January, he doesn’t seem to have gotten anywhere and I’m wondering whether I should stick to my guns or have I been too harsh?

iyaomcw3	When my older siblings and I each turned 13 we got our phones and the allowance of 10 dollars a week as spending money. For as long as I can remember, we've had this routine involving my money. Mom will do her weekly phone checking, if I pass I get my spending money - My older sister will steal my money when I'm in the shower - mom will find out in someway and get mad at sis, leading to a fight - sis will still end up keeping the money and I become mom's verbal punching bag for the rest of the day. My older brother actually saved up his money and bought me airpods for this reason, so I could drown out her words without getting in trouble.   I've finally saved up some money to buy myself a pair of shoes i've been wanting but I'll also have some money left. I felt guilty when my brother bought me the airpods so I want to get him something in return also. But my sister is always keeping an eye on me and I know she'll be upset and think I favor my brother over her if she knows I bought him something and not her, which in turn will make me feel guilty. I honestly would buy her something but I'm still pissed that she's always taking my money while my brother only spends his money on snacks to share with me.

ijlx9ch7	I (F28) recently got married to my husband and have been a stepmom to the sweetest little girl. We didn’t have a wedding. My husband and I agreed it would be a big waste of money, we just wanted something for us so we eloped and had a small dinner party with just my parents, siblings and my husbands parents, siblings and our most close friends.    A cousin (F32) on my dad’s side of the family reached out to me via Instagram being upset and hurt that she wasn’t invited, I told her I was sorry but with covid, we didn’t feel comfortable having a party and it was an expense we didn’t want to take on.   She then proceeded to call me a hypocrite because I just didn’t want to invite her because “I am not poor” and said I always have my nails done, dressing up and think I’m just better than her and I’m selfish since I’m not a “real mom” and that I’m pretending to be a mom and I have no idea what it’s like to be a “real parent” that’s why  I told her that was incredibly bitter and rude for her to say. considering yes I like to dress nice because it makes me feel good but I do not wear expensive clothes like she claims. All my clothes comes from target, old navy, etc, my nails might always be done but I paint them myself with cheap $2 Walmart nail polish to say I’m not a real mom because I don’t look messy or “mom-like” it doesn’t make me less of a mom or because I didn’t birth my daughter, she’s still my little girl and yes I like to spend that time with her painting our nails, going to target, those are things we enjoy doing together but to say I’m not a real mom?   My husband and I both work and we prefer to spend our money wisely if that’s why she’s pissed we didn’t throw a big party and invite her. I told my husband after and he suggested it might be greed/jealousy.   I told her that if she was going to say stupid things and be a bitter bitch then I didn’t want to keep contact with her. She got so mad and blocked me and told her parents and siblings that I was rude snobby bitch that thinks she’s better than everyone because I married someone with money.	1642976275.0	sb5l10	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5l10/aita_for_calling_my_cousin_a_bitter_bitch_and/	AITA for calling my cousin a bitter bitch and telling her I do not want to keep contact with her after she got mad at me and mom shamed me?
iy967n0h	I (23M) rent my own apartment. My girlfriend (22F) is finishing up her last year of college, about an hour away from me. We have a deal that she can stay with me whenever, rent-free, but after graduation when she moves in officially, we'll add her to the lease and she'll start paying rent. Up until Monday, my girlfriend was staying with me during her school's holiday break. All of these events happened the week prior.  My sister (25F) is looking into getting a job in my city. She currently lives 2 hours away and had a job interview early one morning in my area. She asked if she could spend the night in my guest room so she didn't have to wake up early, potentially hit traffic, etc. I said of course. I'd be working the night before but she has a key and could come in whenever. It's important to add that my sister is very low maintenance. I knew she'd probably come in and go straight to the guest room for the night to hang out on her computer.  The morning of, I mentioned to my girlfriend that my sister would probably be there around 7 or 8, she was leaving right after getting off work. My girlfriend got weirded out that I hadn't asked her first and mentioned she was having some friends over for a movie night. I said it'd be fine, my sister isn't the type to intrude and would just go to bed. She asked why I didn't ask her first and I said because as of right now, it's my apartment. If we were both paying rent, I'd have asked. She thought it was super rude and was trying to convince me that my sister could just drive up for her interview tomorrow or get a hotel, etc. I stayed firm and told her to not give my sister a hard time. I get home around midnight, my girlfriend is still watching movies with her friends, my sister is sleeping. The next morning, I had breakfast with my sister before the interview and she said she had came in around 8, crashed at 9, didn't even here them.  I thought the issue was resolved but then my girlfriend texted me on Wednesday saying she had talked to some friends and felt I was still inconsiderate, stating in the future, regardless of her lease status, she should be asked not just told. It's lead to a bigger argument. AITA?	1642976621.0	sb5pyi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5pyi/aita_for_not_asking_if_my_sister_could_spend_the/	AITA for not asking if my sister could spend the night?
c4dx9t2f	Okay so context: I currently work as a manager at a store that is very diverse. I’m one of about 6 people there. Our staff is a good mix of hispanic/black/Asian/white.   So today I was giving fistbumps to everyone as I was heading out, and one girl didn’t want to give me a fist bump and put up her hand and said “Have a nice day, Mintyjinx”. I was like “..okay thanks!” Then she said “oh don’t take offense to that, I just don’t like touching peoples hands.”   Here’s where I may have messed up.   I said, “Oh yeah, I get that. I don’t like touching customers hands. One time a guy called me racist at my old store because he thought I wasn’t touching his hand because he was black. He was like ‘the black won’t rub off on you’ and I was like ‘I’m sorry? That’s not what I meant, what?’ It was strange, I just don’t like touching customers because they’re gross and money has a lot of germs on it.”   and she just gave me a weird look and said “Have a nice day, Mintyjinx.”   So I just kind of blurted that story out because it was related and nobody had ever responded badly to it before. When I told people at my previous store (where every employee except myself was black) their responses were usually “oh that’s bizarre, just ignore him wtf” so I didn’t think that story would make anyone uncomfortable. But I see how it’s kind of awkward/insensitive now. Did I mess up?

1kyey9cs	A little info before the post:  We both work at the same place but I work mornings 5am-4pm and he works nights 2pm-1am. We invite frinds over regularly but rarely throw party's. I have my school friends/bf over sometimes and he invites his coworkers and friends whenever. He hosts poker night, weekly, with his co-workers and we have made an agreement to close the hallway door and try and be quiet so I can sleep. I sleep though almost anything so no biggy right? Also sorry for the essay...  Ok, ok. About a week ago my roommate (M20) told me(M21) he was going to invite someone friends over after work. I was totally fine with it since he works late into he morning and I want him to have friendships. I asked him to clean up and keep it down so I can sleep and he agreed. Around 2:30am I was woken up to yelling and screaming on the balcony, loud base, and the strong sent of cannabis (no issue on this one I smoke all the time lol). I was fuming. My bf was confused next to me. I kindly texted my roommate to "tone it down" because I needed sleep. My and my bf both fall asleep in 20 min. Boom my morning alarm goes off. I hear my roommate having sex through the walls the girl loudly moaning. I made my coffee and dropped my bf off. Fast forward to that's night (he was off) I brought up the situation. I explained how he was so rude and woke me up knowing I wake up at 4am. I told him I wanted him to have friends and chill but what he did last night was unacceptable. Not even an hour after I was home the apartment manager came over and was pissed. He's said the neighbors filed a noise complaint and he was going to file one with the police. I spent the next 45 minutes talking this man out of it and telling him the situation and sticking up for my roommate. After that my roommate was made at me and is threatening to leave the apt. He said he doesn't have any time to do anything and it not his fault I work the morning shift. I retaliated by telling him I respect his days off and either leave the apt so he can sleep in and have "me time" or I stay quiet in my room.

8usfew0x	My girlfriend and I got engaged. When we wanted to break the news, we video chatted people that we knew before we made it public, including one of my closest friends of 10 years. Let's call him L.  L and I have been friends since roughly Junior year of high school. Whether it was a call or a friend to help with our cars or moving, we were there for each other.  Even though he doesn't have animosity against my fiance, she doesn't like him the least bit. Us being gun enthusiasts, she wasn't a fan of him touching her gun without her permission and didn't take it lightly when, in an effort to show how bright his light was on his rifle, POINTED THE GUN AT HER TO DISPLAY the brightness. His finger on the trigger, but it didn't sit well with us.  We were hesitant on having a wedding given our budget and complexity, but her parents decided to cover the costs on the condition that we limited the list to 30. Inviting L to the wedding poses problems. I can deal with his ball busting, but her brother (with an anger problem) and father are not the kind to accept his bombastic behavior and my best man might act a fool. Knowing that I will be solely responsible for his behavior, I couldn't bring him to the wedding.   All in all, i really did have mainly family, but I have 5 people that I invited that aren't related, but are like family to me through high school or are church family. Out of 4, he knows 2. I'm inviting them because I love them and i was invited to their wedding as well.   Breaking the news hurt, NGL. He was hurt. I tried to tell him it was mainly a family thing and I couldn't take a risk with him going because my fiance's family might not get along with him, specifically my brother in law and father in law. It hurt, but he respected it.  The next time I saw him, he mentioned that he hoped that no one else from high school was going that we both knew because "he was going to throw a fit". I assured that he had nothing to worry about that it was mainly family (truth is I was actually telling the truth because the people on my side were either actual family, married in, or people i have known for so long that I feel like we're family). My fiance pointed out that the fact that I contacted him means almost nothing because we didn't even want a wedding, just to share. Also, what he was doing was manipulative behavior. Her own friends knew that they might not even make it on the list and they were fine with it. My friend found out that I can't have him at my wedding because at minimum it's a family gathering and got salty. She challenged me to even ask my best man the same scenario if he was okay with not being invited to my wedding given our long time history and how he would react. For consolation, I did offer that while those who I can't bring to the wedding, I would be more than happy to have a dinner privately with them to celebrate the occasion, even if it's just me that's going.	1642977216.0	sb5yab	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5yab/aita_for_not_inviting_long_time_friend_to_wedding/	AITA for not inviting long time friend to wedding?
gcasvy0b	My nephew (Matthew, 22) has had a rough relationship with my brother (his dad) for as long as I can remember, and honestly I put the entirety of the blame on my brother, however most of my family do not see it that way.   My brother treated my ex-SIL(Diane) terribly, which matthew and my other niece(Katie, 23) and nephew(Jamie, 26) had to witness. With the other 2, he never treated them bad at all, with matthew my only guess as to why he treated him the way that he did was because matthew always refused to bond or have any sort of relationship with him the way the other two did.  Diane and my brother divorced when matthew was quite young and it was only really Katie and Jamie that spent time with my brother, and when matthew did, my brother and mom would always complain that he’d always cry because he wanted to go home. Diane told me that he always tore him down for crying and said that even she hasn’t seen him cry since he was very young. I know he started therapy around the time he was expecting his daughter so i guess that is what steered him to the decision of no-contact.   In my eyes Matthew only went no contact with them because of my brothers own actions, he treated matthew terribly in an emotional sense, never physical and because of that my mom and most of our family downplayed it all. In the end, my mom just refused to see any fault in my brother and to this day shuts down any time I mention how he treated my nephew.   It’s my son’s birthday coming up, the invites are getting written and about to be sent off and my mom keeps asking me to convince my nephew to come with his daughter, and if he has any doubts just say that my mom won’t likely show. I said no because 1. why would i want to risk any drama happening at a child’s birthday? and 2. I feel like it would be a massive breach of my nephews trust.   The reason I feel like the asshole is because she non stop crying about wanting to reconcile with him and i feel bad every time. Every time she sees me she has to somehow bring it up, saying that he’s her grandson and he hasn’t spoken to her in over 4 years, and that I have the opportunity to allow her to fix all their problems and refuse to. My mom also never hurt my nephew the way my brother did, so I guess I can see why my mom feels like him cutting her off is unjust in her eyes.   She also says that it’s cruel of me to keep the kids apart on my son’s birthday, which is what’s conflicting for me too.	1642977395.0	sb60jl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb60jl/aita_for_refusing_to_invite_my_nephew_to_my_sons/	AITA for refusing to invite my nephew to my son’s birthday under the impression that my mom will not be there?
86eoy7ks	So these kids are constantly being noisy. I understand kids playing outside tend to get a little loud, but these little demons are literally blowing airhorns and screaming at the top of their lungs. My first day living in this house, they were riding a go kart in the street (illegal in town) and hit my car. I talked to their grandmother about it, and she immediately dismissed me as being racist because the kids are black, so I called the police to deal with it. I'm not asking that they be entirely silent, I just want them to stop scaring the literal shit out of my dog with their airhorns.	1642976762.0	sb5rv8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb5rv8/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_neighbors_kids/	AITA for calling the cops on my neighbors kids?
b6y6mztu	My neighbors have been "fighting" with us over street parking for a while but never told us until we went over today to finally ask if there was a problem, after watching them run out at 8 am in boxers to move their car in front of our house for no apparent reason. When talking to them they expressed that our car is one foot over their property line.   It's a public street and if we park anywhere else we'll either be several houses away or right across from another car which will block the entire road.  We have an extra car so our driveway is full and they don't so it's not like they need the street parking. If they would have said something before instead of blocking the spot as soon as the extra car is gone or rushing out just to park in front of our house to try and anger us (we really don't care as I said its a public road so it's not "ours" anyway) we could've worked with them and figured it out but now I don't know.  Am I missing something and am really the AH or what?	1642977829.0	sb66f6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb66f6/aita_for_parking_on_the_street/	AITA for parking on the street?
d3enzz97	AITA for getting upset with my husband?  A quick little back story— I’ve been in the service industry for almost 15 years now and eating a hot meal is sacred because typically it’s grazing in between tables. My husband knows this. Ok here goes— AITA when my husband (34 M) made me (33 F) breakfast and coffee (super nice, yes) but after literally a bite my dog starts barking and clearly wants to go out. He insists he took him out already and it’s my turn. Husband already ate breakfast so he was just hanging out on the couch on his phone. I said I’m eating can you take him? Obviously he gives me push back and insists I take him. Fine. I take dog out and he goes #1 and #2. (Now I don’t really believe he took the dog out less than an hour ago. I digress). I’m annoyed but I go back inside and can’t find any of the doggie poop bags. He says they are all in his car. I ask for the keys and instead of handing them to me because he tosses purposely ON THE FLOOR for me to get. Now I’m fuming. I find this incredibly disrespectful and become angry. He says I couldn’t do one basic thing this morning and take our dog out. I rebuttals with what was he doing that was so important on his phone sitting on the couch that was more important than letting me eat some warm eggs for five minutes. He doesn’t see my point at all and says I’m mad about taking the dog. It’s more than that. I feel he was being inconsiderate.

ipx7lii6	My husband has a 19 year old daughter that’s in college. She tested positive on Wednesday afternoon and has been by herself in the dorm since. She is mildly sick. She’s been FaceTiming my husband for hours everyday. We also have two small children (7 and 2 years old). Our 7 year old is a daddy’s boy. His daughter was not in his life prior to last year when she wanted contact with him, he never mentioned having a daughter.   On Thursday, my husband was at work and I guess his daughter kept trying to FaceTime him throughout the day, which he said annoyed him. That night, he was FaceTiming her from around 7pm til midnight. He put his phone facing the TV so we could watch movies/tv as a family, he ate his dinner on the couch separate from the rest of us, he ignored bed time routines and told me I can handle it, while our 7 year old was crying for him.  He was sitting on the couch with his phone chatting away to his daughter for hours. On Friday night, our 7 year old had hockey game and he wished him good luck and gave him a hug, but didn’t bother to get dressed and go to the game. He stayed home on FaceTime with his daughter. I took our kids and my mother out to the game. I came back home to find my husband on the couch sleeping and his daughter sleeping on FaceTime.   Yesterday she FaceTimed him in the morning for a little bit and then again around 4pm. He ate dinner in the living room while watching football and FaceTiming her. He got off FaceTime around 2am last night after making something in the kitchen and being loud on his way upstairs. He again didn’t help out with bed time routines and ignored our oldest when he wanted to play legos or video games with his dad.   Today, my husbands phone kept ringing while he was sleeping and it was his daughter. I told my husband when he woke up that he’s been ignoring our kids lately and he needs to limit how long he talks on the phone with his daughter. I get that she’s sick and lonely but he’s putting his small children on the back burner. My husband said he feels bad for his daughter and he wants to build a relationship with her. He said our kids see him everyday and all his daughter has is FaceTime calls, she has no friends and nobody else to talk to and she’s going through a lot. I said with you working during the week and the few hours you have during the evening being spent FaceTiming your daughter, you really don’t spend time with our kids that much and yesterday you blew our oldest off for hours for her.   He got up and said he was done talking about this, his daughter is going through a a lot, she is sick and stuck in her dorm, with nobody to talk too. He said I’m being ridiculous, our oldest can entertain himself and if not, then I should go do something with him. He then said why do I always have to do things with our oldest, what’s wrong with you. He got dressed and left. He has been gone for hours and isn’t returning my texts or calls.	1642977798.0	sb6613	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6613/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_cut_back/	AITA for telling my husband he needs to cut back on FaceTiming his daughter and spend more time with our kids?
7i1rbfmo	Sorry if I have any grammatical errors.   I (19F) have a Poodle Toy that had an accident days ago. She is very hyperactive, so she was jumping and hit her hind leg against the corner of the couch. My mother and I were scared, but in the end, it was nothing serious. In case you're wondering, she's fine and walks perfectly. Only that day she was limping. We just gave her an analgesic that my veterinarian prescribed.  That day at night my brother (26M) arrives from work. He is very playful with her, so I told him to be careful. He picks her up, and immediately changes his attitude, telling me that I must have dislocated her (it didn't happen). I told him that I didn't do anything, that she was jumping and hit herself, but that there was no problem because we already gave her an analgesic.  He told me that it didn't matter and that it was my fault because she is mine and anything that happens to her it's only my fault. So I replied, "Under that logic your dog died because of you".  To give context, my brother also had a Poodle that we had to put down last year. He developed a tumor in the testicle because my brother never wanted to castrate him even when my mother offered to pay for it. My mother couldn't bear to see him like this and took him to the vet assuming the costs of the exams and everything else. He needed an operation, but his tests revealed some altered things that prevented him from being able to operate immediately, so he had to receive medication until he was regulated. He had to receive daily medication (intravenously). My brother only took it for two days. The others woke up late and said "it's too late, I'll take it tomorrow" as an excuse.  Time passed and one day he wakes up with a strong fever. I took him to the vet and they told us he was worse. He was on medication for a week (I took him to the vet those times, not my brother), but he could not recover and they told us that it was best to put him to sleep. He was literally urinating blood, he couldn't walk, he wasn't eating, his skin was turning yellow. My brother wasn't even there when we put him to sleep. I alone carried him to the vet so they could put him to sleep because keeping him in that state was already inhumane and painful.  Coming back to the story, my brother looks at me and says "No. That doesn't apply to me." I told him that it did apply, because it was his dog and everything that happened to him was his responsability. He just shook his head and didn't speak to me for the rest of the night.  I don't think I'm the asshole, but I don't know if I was right for answer him like that. I know that my pet is my responsibility but it bothered me that he said it was my fault as if I had caused the accident. So...

gdg54ang	For context, my MIL is a stage 2 hoarder, stage 1 for me is keeping unnecessary things and creating clutter (minor go-paths) stage 2 is hoarding trash but not enough that passes the knees. 3 is hoarding both but passing the knees. 4 is both and reaches the waist, and 5 is having to walk over things to get to a certain spot in the house amongst the go-paths. (My opinion) My in laws own a townhouse that is separated into 3 units, one tenant is a stage 5, you can see everything stacked against the windows and the garbage on the small balcony on the second floor. The other tenant is very clean, and the 3rd are my in laws. My MIL has hoarded the living room and my (extremely disabled with a cane) FIL has to climb over things to get to his chair, so I offered up our finished basement to them so my MIL could clean up the house, I trusted that she would keep my basement clean out of basic respect so I never thought to make sure it was clean, my mistake.  They’ve been living with us for 6 months, and she’s at stage 4 in my basement. I immediately broke down and started yelling, I told her she needs to clean my basement up in 3 months, or she’s back in her own hoard, and 3 months later, nothing has changed, I found out she extended her hoard into my garage (it has a wall in between the ports so I didn’t know about it) and also found out she started to fill her car and my dads old Mustang that’s been under a cover for almost a year, which promoted mice and rodents and has destroyed the car. After I saw that, I kicked her out and back into her hoard she went. I let my FIL stay since he’s physically unable to contribute to the hoard, I cleaned out everything, got all the mice and rodents out of the car, but it was still left destroyed, I had it all fix and reupholstered and sent her a bill for all the damage in the mail My BIL is calling me petty and I can afford to fix it so she doesn’t need to pay for it, I told him and her that she’s lucky that I didn’t make her pay for the damage she caused to my basement and that paying for the car is the bare minimum. It’s caused a lot of stress and conflict between the family but I don’t think I’m in the wrong.	1642978044.0	sb697h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb697h/aita_for_kicking_my_mil_out_and_making_her_pay/	AITA for kicking my MIL out and making her pay for the damage to my dads old car?
iy9miw80	My dad's belt recently wore away, and he has yet to get a new one. I normally wouldn't care, but it's started to affect me.   When I go run errands with my dad, he'll walk into the store with half his ass hanging out if his jeans. It's absolutely embarrassing. When I ask him to pull his pants up, he gets annoyed, says the young kids do it so he can too, pulls them up anyway, then his ass is on full display again a minute later. It's even worse when he bends down, and I just can't take the embarrassment anymore.  After errands today, I straight up told him I wouldn't go out again unless he bought another belt. He got pissed and told me I don't tell him how he should dress. I retaliated with this statement. "Apparently I do need to since he can't pull his pants up like a toddler."  After that, he stomped away and locked himself in his room. My mom brought a message from him tonight saying he's not gonna talk to me or by me anything else until I apologize. I told her I ain't gonna apologize. My mom agreed with me that it's embarrassing, but that I should be the bigger person and apologize and she'll buy him a new belt next week. I still refused.

9n8m82ei	My husband (28) and I (27) have 3 sons, 6 3 and 4 months. I am a SAHM while my husband works outside the home. Every day my son asks to go play with his friends that live in the same apartment complex as us. During the last few months he's been able to go into friends homes and play for a little and then come home. He's supervised and I have the contact info for the parents he's with. Sometimes his friends come over to our apartment too, it's not just a one way street. His friends parents tend to have different rules than us. Not "parent-shaming", just different. My son has come home with soda when I don't usually let him drink that at home, or he got to have some candy or ice cream as an afternoon snack when in our home those are strictly dessert after dinner. But, if he gets a little treat when playing with his friends that's fine, each family is different.  However, with the sun setting later now, his friends have been getting kicked outside to play nearly every day and aren't interested in playing together if it's inside my house. I get it, when all these  kids play together it's a group of 5 6 year old boys. They are A LOT. My son wants to join his friends outside, but their parents aren't watching them. These kids are 100% unsupervised free roaming the apartment complex on their bikes. There isn't a playground or really anything "kid friendly" on the grounds so they end up riding in the parking lot and I personally have seen several near misses when they shoot out of a parking spot in front of a car that's moving. They've also gotten in trouble with the management for digging holes in the grass, trying to climb trees, breaking bushes, just kid stuff but stuff they shouldn't be doing on the community property especially after getting in trouble for these things several times.  I have not been letting my son go out and he of course feels that is unfair when he knows his friends are out there. My husband also thinks I should just let him go play and supervise the kids myself if I'm so worried. I would except I have my other sons too. 3 is a runner and I have mobility issues that prevent me from being able to chase him down even when I'm not also carrying the 4 month old. I feel that 6 is too young to be able to go roam unsupervised, especially since these kids have been playing unsafe and not following rules when no one is watching them. Am I really being that unreasonable here?	1642978377.0	sb6dvt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6dvt/aita_for_not_allowing_my_son6_to_play/	AITA for not allowing my son(6) to play unsupervised in the apartment complex?
i86mjcrk	On a Sunday a friend comes to hang out at my house. But his mom needed him to bring his brother along because she needed to run some errands.  My friend’s brother is five years old.   When my friend and I played 2k I heard some ping pong balls bouncing down the stairs. My mom was with the three of us and I told her that he was rolling balls down the stairs. She told me to leave him alone and help out clearing the stairs.  I was furious because I don’t like people going into my room without my permission.  After my friend and his brother got picked up, I went in my room just to find out that the kid threw underwear and socks out of my closet.  The next time his brother shows up at my house I had to tell him not to go in my room but he’s just a little child and I might make him upset or something if I do so.  And here I am.

iy8tqpqh	I (enbie22) and he (M25) dated for almost a year. His humor can be dark and controversial in my opinion and had a lot of insults. Along the lines of South Park and also NOFX.  I am a bisexual, non binary individual, who is Caucasian. Growing up I’ve been surrounded by “controversial” jokes but it’s not really something I feel totally comfortable with or comfortable with making if I have not personally been through something based on my experience and how I’m perceived by society. I have not felt comfortable with slurs. I don’t find it funny at all.  He explained to me that that’s how he grew up, that the insults and slurs were used to take away the negative connotations and to reclaim words. I understood this and agree, but felt it was for the community or people who it was being used against in a derogatory and hateful way. He is White and has never said the N word or other racial slurs however. He called me B—and C —at the start of our relationship as a joke and I said I didn’t find it funny and to not EVER do it again. He didn’t do it again but continued to use it towards other people.  A word he used often was the F— slur. I asked him to stop, at least stop around me, but he said that he was often called it growing up because of his dress sense and appearance even though he is a straight man. I understood that he was bullied in that way, but I still didn’t like it and knew the people around me wouldn’t either. He saw it a different way, and said that he has queer coworkers in the restaurant industry that he calls this in a light hearted way and they think it’s funny. He also said the people around him, including people who are in minority groups or communities think it’s funny and dont have a problem with him using it. He also stated that it was how he coped with life and trauma, and the terrible things in the world. From the other things he was saying, it made me feel that I was too “leftist” and that I was apart of cancel culture and easily “triggered”. He also didn’t understand fully my humor and had insulted my humor by saying it was like 12 year old girl jokes. My solution to our humor clashing in that way was firstly to ask him to not use it with me or my friends and family because my feelings are valid and I’m not his audience for that. I told him to find a different audience if he has so many people that find it funny. I also said I would try to find some comedians that we both found funny. We went and saw some comedians live and both had a good time.  After a few months he said he felt restricted, like he couldn’t be himself or express himself without us getting in an argument. He also said he felt judged by me, and that I was viewing him like garbage when he talked like that. We are no longer together, but am I the asshole for telling him to stop? Am I being higher than thou if he has experienced hatefully the f slur toward him himself and then telling him not to use it?	1642978423.0	sb6egj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6egj/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_stop_using_the_f_slur/	AITA for asking my bf to stop using the f slur?

I ask him consistently to do chores and he will say that he will do them then never does. He tells me I’m putting too much pressure on him and I need to remind him to do chores but I feel like an adult man shouldn’t need reminded to to chores in the house he lives in. He has epilepsy so I try not to be too hard on him but at this point, I am working full time on top of doing chores. All of my money goes towards paying bills and I don’t even have the money to buy myself new work shoes/clothes/tools. Before we got together, I had the money to get my nails and hair done regularly (I understand this is a luxury, but with my kind of work I have to look presentable). When he isn’t working, he will spend all of his time with friends or playing video games. So, am I the asshole for expecting more of him?

4sru48l1	Over the Last few years the relationship between my mother and i has deteriorated now to the point she's not even at the end of a rope but off it. She lets me know that "if you weren't her daughter we would not be friends." She does not want me to communicate with her. "I have 2 months to move out." Anything that lets me know how much she wants nothing to do with me or help me or speak to me she will say it. "its our fault i nearly died."  She suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm  in October and I found her in time and to a hospital.  we live in the Caribbean and the healthcare here can be hit or miss. Through it all she has made a FULL recovery after brain surgery and is back out to work right now.  I honestly always saw my mom as my bestfriend and I don't hold things from the past. But she has been strongly. I have no idea how to repair things.  I (28f).I'm the eldest of her 4 other children. Boys 21, 19, 16. Girl 10. Their father, she had been with since I was 4 but she left him in 2018 finally as he was and still is a HUGE narcissist. She left all of us with him actually. Due to the stress of that situation though I was of adult age. It activated my chronic illness in a bad way. At the age of 17 I was diagnosed with crohns disease. Most of my flares are triggered by HIGH stress. So after heading to the hospital and returning home after treatments my stepfather would not allow me into the house and this is how I got back with my mom. We lived in a 1 bedroom and i gratefully slept on the couch. For 1 year things were ok but Her dad at 83 left his wife i showed up at our place saying he wants to help as she was struggling financially. Please note in the periods where I do feel better I try to find work, or hustle and do little things to help financially. When i cant help financially I cook and clean. Cooking and food are my passions so its like having an in house chef. Anyways when he showed up we moved into a small 2 bedroom. I still sleep on a couch in the living room. My sister lives with us permanently. And since November she let my brothers 19 and 16 move in too. They also sleep on the pullout couch here with me. After her incident my health has been out of control from the stress. The boys are exactly like my step father + dirty and lazy. Disrespectful most of all. She thinks at this point she can fix them. But when angry about her life and them she dishes it out on my shortcomings.  I DONT want to live here. I dont want to almost be 30 and nothing to show for my life. I have a plan but executing it from 0 under this pressure and a Flare is stress on its own. I don't want to be her enemy. I didn't ask to have Crohns disease. She let me know that If i ever got sick again don't ask her for help. And her sons follow same. How do I fix this? Im not asking if I'm the asshole for having Crohns but AITA for not making better choices through it and being a more independent daughter ?	1642978860.0	sb6kbq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb6kbq/aita_in_my_mothers_life/	AITA in my Mothers Life?

They came out to our mom and my mom said ‘you’ll always be my *****.’ When she said that my sibling started arguing and I heard it so I came and helped defend them, when they told me and our mom to leave their room I started going upstairs to my room but my mom said something to my stepdad and I started lecturing her about basic respect for your child, my stepdad said something about me not having basic respect so I told him that he’s not my real dad so he does get to tell me what to do.  My dad is still present in my life and my mom divorced him when I was 5. My mom and stepdad have know eachother for awhile but started dating when I was 8 and got married September 2020. I still call him by his name and have never referred to him as my father. I see my dad once a week and we have a good relationship.   So am I the asshole.	1642980662.0	sb789i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb789i/aita_for_telling_my_stepdad_that_hes_not_my_dad/	AITA for telling my stepdad that he’s not my dad
gccgy680	I’m F, 22, and live with my parents. I’m a college student so I can’t afford to live alone. I grew up in an extremely conservative and religious household, and I mean SERIOUSLY. My parent’s religion has been labeled a cult by like, a lot of people, so you can imagine how strict my upbringing was (and can be to this day, sometimes).    I’ve dealt with depression since age 12 and didn’t get on antidepressants until age 18 (my mom would always tell me I “didn’t need them”, even though she herself takes antidepressants). They worked for a bit and eventually stopped. I tried new meds, new dosages, nothing. So the summer after my senior year I started smoking weed. It was only recreational at first, but it helped my mental health so much. Once the pandemic hit, my mental health got worse, I had nothing to do all day, so I started smoking every day. Multiple times a day. My parents had their suspicions but didn’t find out until about 6 months ago, when I had to go to the hospital and the doctors mentioned the THC in my system. My mom literally cried for so long, and I felt so guilty. Her and my dad are older — both in their 60s — so I think to them, weed is a lot more serious than it would be to even 40 year old parents. My dad was convinced I’d go to prison (doesn’t help that I have family members who have done time or died due to drugs, but it was never weed, always heroin or meth).   Since I live at home, I often find myself sneaking around and making up lies to smoke. I hate lying to my parents, especially when I live in their house and they don’t have to let me live here. But at the same time, I feel like it’s 2022, a LOT of people smoke weed, and it truly helps my depression more than anything else. I live in a town of like 1,500 people so it’s not like there’s much else to do, anyways. I can’t tell if I rightfully feel guilty for deceiving them, or if I just feel bad because of the way I was raised, and knowing my parents will overreact. They genuinely think weed is like coke or something.   I have two siblings who are substantially older — 42 & 38 — and they both smoke (one even sells occasionally) and my parents don’t know, so I feel like I might just be being sensitive. A possible case of “sheltered child” anxiety/guilt? Or is my guilt here completely warranted? In this scenario, isn’t it better to just save my parents the heartache? Or do I only think that because I don’t want to take responsibility? Sometimes it REALLY makes me feel like a bad person.	1642981336.0	sb7gym	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7gym/aita_for_lying_to_my_parents_about_smoking_weed/	AITA for lying to my parents about smoking weed?
iya7djd4	Hello. Two  months ago my friend (m24, Mark) and I (f23) started playing around with this side project that hopefully was going to bring us some $$. It was just me and him. I have a good amount of artistic ability after majoring in illustration, while he is a coder. His gf (f24, Letitia) is a creative as well. Here is what I suspect: Letitia is the sort of person who you always need to poke for something to be accomplished, so Mark did not bring her on. He either did not offer her to participate, or she refused, not wanting the pressure of deadlines and the uncertainty of success. Also, my ability is clearly stronger than Letitia's, because I went to school for illustration and she practiced the craft on the side. It probably played a part.  Fast forward to the beginning of January. We actually started making some money. The project is still in the making, as we are yet to deliver 100% of what we promised to deliver. I spent a ton of time on the thing. In the beginning, some help would be a huge boost and I seriously considered asking Letitia to help out, but she did not express any interest. This stage ended after a couple weeks of grinding and it has been a much smoother sail since then. Me and Mark agreed to reinvest necessary amounts in advertising our creation so we can build a brand. The rest was to be split 50/50.  So, now Mark wants to bring Letitia on again, and suddenly she is down. This queen gambit is being marketed to me as extra help. I would have accepted a few weeks earlier. I like Letitia as a friend and I knew we were going to find a common language. But now, my inspiration from getting even small $$ is enough to make me do the work, so I don't want to share and have to negotiate my artistic decisions. Mark, as he is responsible for building the following, also mentioned that Letitia will be illustrating another future project that he will lead, through the brand name we are creating. Well, I don't want my money to be reinvested for Mark to create the brand and for Letitia to come in and be successful off of the brand that I invested my fair cut in. I would rather get less and cut out the free rider, than get more but prepare the soil for her to shine. My attitude to Letitia as a friend is different from my attitude to her as a business partner. She saw success and decided to hop on, and Mark loves her so logic gets warped.  He does not explicitly want to replace me with Letitia. He just wants her to work with me, which means I will have to share with someone who turned down the opportunity and can be replaced with a more professional designer now that we crossed the first threshold. But at this point, who knows, I have every reason to believe Mark will replace me entirely.   So, WIBTA if I told Mark to either stop being insistent on bringing Letitia on or give me my 50%, and build the following on his own 50%?	1642980354.0	sb741r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb741r/wibta_if_i_told_my_friend_not_to_involve_his/	WIBTA if I told my friend not to involve his girlfriend in our side project?
iydyd7w6	For context my brother kept me awake all last night because he was playing fortnite or something like that (his room is separated from mine with a thin wall) I asked him to be quiet and he told me "no" and proceeded to get louder. Today I wake up and my mom tells me I'm filling in for her (she works at home) While her and my father take my brother (same one who kept me awake) to a 2-3 hour appointment, now I'm a broke high school student so I agreed and asked if I could be payed $20 for it. She told me no and said if I don't do this for free she will not buy me anything again and my nana said the same. I made the point that SHE was the one who decided to have kids and take on the financial needs.

iydrefgc	My ex was supposed to see our son on Saturday. He told me 30 minutes before he was supposed to be here that he wouldn’t be able to make it as an emergency had come up that needed his attention. When I asked what the emergency was all he would say was work.  Now, my ex completely abandoned our son for close to 2 years so a big part of me thinks he’s lying. For that reason, when he asked to reschedule, I told him no and said he would have to wait until next week. This isn’t the first time this has happened and usually I would agree to reschedule.  Now he and his family are threatening to get full custody. I know I shouldn’t poke the bear in this case because I really can’t afford to go back to court again but I’m just so sick of him thinking he gets to dictate everything and not think about how our son feels when he doesn’t show up.

r3z8o	I (31f) have a core group of friends from school, consisting of two guys, one other girl, and me.  However, one of the guys has become more and more of a sexist edgelord pot-stirrer over the years. I lived with him for a while and he wasn’t very nice at all, once going so far as blowing his dandruff in my face because it was “funny”.  He also once had naked photos of girls he slept with as his screensaver and would should them to people as a “joke” and persistently made sexist comments.The pandemic was a great pruning opportunity to just let the friendship go.  So the gal in our group lives abroad and was home over Christmas, hadn’t seen her in two years and we kept a low level of contact nothing deep. She doesn’t ask questions about your personal life and keeps everything quite surface level.  Anyway the other guy in our group had a party last week but edgelord couldn’t make it for family reasons. He came up in conversation and I think it was about how great he was.  This is where the AITA comes: I was very drunk and basically laid into him and was like I’m not sitting here pretending I like him, he’s a blah blah sexist cunt! And my gal pal was defending his actions and I was having none of it. I was like if you want to be friends with him fine but I’m not. She cried and the other guy was in shock, especially as his wife and her friends were like yeah never wanted to say anything but not a fan and can’t disagree with anything that’s been said. Haven’t heard anything from my two non-edgelord friends even after I put a message in a group chat with just the three remaining amigos saying it was a lot to take in and prob not the best time to say it but all true. The gal just shared some photos and a video and didn’t acknowledge anything had happened.  Not sure if I was TA or not. Sister thinks soft YTA.  TLDR: got drunk and had an outburst about how I will not to be friends with the edgelord sexist in my group of school friends.	1642982160.0	sb7r8v	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7r8v/aita_for_giving_a_drunken_speech_that_i_dont_like/	AITA for giving a drunken speech that I don’t like a friend in our group, want nothing to do with him, and making another friend cry
8fr5okuy	Okay so I work an extreme amount in order to make my dad proud, I've gotten over so many obstacles. But I have a big problem, last year I ended the school year with only 10s (only As) and my dad just said "ok, nice" and nothing else. My mom did congratulate me, but I'm not sure if I'm being a brat or in the right. A couple weeks ago I took a semestrial exam that was very hard due to the teacher I had. I had to learn every lesson since I didn't understand all of it. I thought this would make my dad proud of me. I got an A and a perfect A score for this semester. When I got home, he didn't say anything, it was like nothing even happened, the only thing he ever brings up are my failures. I've only once had him take me out and my sister for ice cream after my mom told him to when I was in like 4th grade just because I passed a slightly harder english test. I'm not sure if I'm just acting like a spoiled brat, but I really wanna know. That's not everything but due to the fact that I love my dad, I'm not going to share the rest of what he does.	1642982782.0	sb7zjt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb7zjt/aita_for_wanting_my_dad_to_tell_me_if_he/	AITA for wanting my dad to tell me if he appreciates what I do?
i6kuiwmp	We've been married 15 years and sporadically throughout our marriage my husband talked about how ideal it would be if I worked at our local school since we have kids and I would be on the same schedule as the children. Each time he mentioned it, I voiced my desire NOT to work there. (I have never ever had even ONE fleeting thought about working in the education field.) I was a SAHM for 10 years with some decent side gigs that I developed for myself. Husband works for himself in a blue collar job 60+ hours/week. Regarding the school job, hubby wasn't taking no for an answer and when my youngest went to school full-time, he talked me into working there. Now I'm 2.5 years into a job that I find incredibly stressful; my physical and mental health are suffering. I want to quit and go back to the work that felt right to me. I am well educated and very entrepreneurial. Husband is telling me that having a "real job" is "part of being a grown up". He did not believe in or support me when I was working for myself even though I was successful. I make more money at the job I'm in now, but feel like I had one-hand tied behind my back when I worked for myself because I was raising children full-time. He thinks the stability of a guaranteed paycheck and insurance is more valuable than my "immature fantasies" of owning my own business. I have money saved up for two+ years worth of expenses in the event my dreams don't pan out. In light of the fact that I have a family to help support, am I the asshole for wanting to give up stability for personal fulfillment???	1642982982.0	sb820k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb820k/aitah_for_wanting_out_of_a_regular_job_or_is_my/	AITAH for wanting out of a "regular" job.

qh9xxvu	If the title is confusing I apologize in advance. So my girlfriends family invited me over to celebrate Christmas with them and have Christmas dinner. And they have a tradition where they have a family shirt that everyone wears and asked me if I would like a shirt to go with their tradition.  (Side note my family is religious and her family is but no where near as much but my aunt is really out there so to speak but not to the extreme) Where my aunt has an issue with is that the shirts said "jolliest bunch of assholes". I truly have no problems with wearing the shirt and don't mind it. I heard through my mom that she was upset with me over wearing the shirt and I'm thinking to myself wtf it's just a shirt. I've been trying to please my family since I was a kid as that was what I was taught to do but I'm just tired of it and am thinking of cutting ties with almost my entire family Sorry for ranting reddit but is what I'm saying making any since? If not I'm sorry I've had a really long day and just want to sleep if you have any questions I will do what I can to clarify any questions.

34f6gygm	I (21F) live in an apartment with two roommates, Carly (20F) and Amy (20F). Carly and I have been living together since 2019, but Amy just moved in this past August. We’ve been having some issues with Amy lately, due to her breaking some house rules and being generally very messy. We’ve tried having roommate talks over these issues but they haven’t really gone anywhere. Recently, I had a fairly big conflict with Amy due to her breaking a major house rule of no drinking in the apartment and trashing the place, leaving it for me to clean up. She’s spent 90% of her time away from the apartment in the two weeks since then, so there hasn’t been much interaction between us to judge how things are right now. I’m only mentioning this because I don’t know if the issue of this post would seem like a further petty jab at her after the conflict.  One major issue of her messiness is that she leaves coffee grounds EVERYWHERE in the common area. Both Carly and I don’t really drink coffee often, but we had a Keurig prior to Amy moving in. Since then, she’s been the main one using it, and she got reusable K-Cups to use with Folgers coffee (in the big red containers.) Since the coffee is loose grounds, it can get messy and she just doesn’t clean it no matter how often we ask, and I’m tired of stepping in dried coffee grounds and finding them places they shouldn’t be (such as in the stove). I’m at the point where I just want to tell her that unless she starts cleaning up the coffee grounds, she needs to get the single use K-cup pods since those don’t make a mess. I feel like I might be an asshole if I do that since she drinks a lot of coffee, at least 3-4 cups a day, and she uses Folgers to cut costs, but I can’t handle the mess anymore. WIBTA for telling her she either needs to get her act together or buy a different brand of coffee?	1642983576.0	sb89kf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb89kf/wibta_for_telling_my_roommate_that_she_has_to_use/	WIBTA for telling my roommate that she has to use a different, more expensive brand of coffee?
9602f2dd	History: I have been going out with my GF for almost 3 years and know her and her family very well. I have never been a big eater and only eat about 1 meal a day. When I tell people they oftentimes don’t believe me because I am a larger woman.   Last month my gf (18f) and I(18f) went on a date where we got lunch and walked around a mall, normal teenage date stuff, and at the end my girlfriend asked if I wanted to eat dinner with her and her family. I said no because I wasn’t hungry and she gave me a strange look. I took her home and when we got to her house she asked one more time and I responded no. Her mother was at the door and asked if we were both excited for dinner and I said that I wasn’t eating dinner with them and that I was sorry she gave me the same weird look as my gf. I felt a little awkward and said my goodbyes. When I got home I got a text saying that I was rude for not coming to dinner and that my gf was mad at me.

iuyereyn	So my gf of 3 years’ grandfather passed away a few days ago, and tomorrow will be the funeral. Normally I’d call in sick to work to make the event, but where I am doing so would force me to be away from work for a week, and I’ve been forced to take days out of necessity for other events in the past week, and am really going to need days in the next few months for various reasons. With that said, my boss will let me leave work early tomorrow to make the viewing, and I’ll have an hour to get there essentially, and can obviously stay and support my gf and her family for as long as they need me. The drive should take 40 minutes to get there, so I should be fine to make it in time, but when I asked my gf if it would be a problem if I was 15-30 mins late because of traffic, she said I’d look really bad if I was late for the event, and told me she assumed I’d go to her house beforehand and go with her family to the viewing, which we never discussed.   Would I look like a jerk for being late for a viewing (if I even am late)? Just given the unfortunate situation I think I’m doing the best that I can, and if it was mass I’d completely understand being late being an issue. As far as I understand, viewings aren’t as “formal”, in terms of punctuality, as the whole time period is there for people to give condolences, but obviously as the SO of one of his grandchildren I should (and intend to) be there and show my utmost respect for the family. That said, I’m not expected to stand with my gfs family and accept condolences or anything, which  is why o was thrown off by being told it’s “so bad” if I’m a bit late. I’ll try and leave earlier than scheduled tomorrow as well, but would I be the AH if I was a bit late?	1642984419.0	sb8kil	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8kil/wibta_if_im_late_for_a_funeral_viewing/	WIBTA if I’m late for a funeral viewing?
4ugsq424	So I (M31) am currently living in an apartment building in a loft. I moved in with my fiancée(f27) 6 months ago and since I have been here, the neighbor down the hall has been having friends over on random days of the week, but always on Sunday nights. They play live music with the bass up so loud, it shakes the pictures on our wall. The little "parties" were going to 11pm - 1am and they never turned down their music after, even with our cities 10pm noise curfew. I asked them multiple times to keep it down and was very polite about it. To make things worse, we all have assigned parking spots in the parking lot with a few spots for visitors. there is also a small dog park in our parking lot for tenants to take their dogs. I have 2 huskies, and when I would take them out before bed, the guests would park in front of the gate, making nearly impossible to get into the park. After dealing with this for 2 months, I had enough of the disrespect. There are signs all around the parking lot for a tow company that will tow illegally parked cars. The tenants are aware of the rules and are supposed to tell their guests where they can and cannot park. So, one night I decided to call them. They told me I had to call the police first and have them come ticket them before they can tow the cars. So that is what I did. The police came and ticketed 5 of the cars($50) and once they left, I called the towing company who came and towed the cars. There is a $175 tow fee and another $25 fee if it is kept past midnight of the day it is towed. Since it was 1130pm, the 5 illegally parked cars ended up with $250 worth of tickets and towing fees. I felt kind of bad because it was only a few of the guests at the "party" and not the actual tenant who ended up getting hit with those fees. Since that night, their parties have been ending around 10pm and are not as frequent.   AITA for screwing those people over?	1642983211.0	sb856f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb856f/aita_for_getting_my_neighbors_guests_car_towed/	AITA for getting my neighbor's guests car towed?
7vh0yu9k	I ,48f, have a friend, 52m, who I've known for over 30 years. We even dated once for 4 years, but it didn't work out. My friend Danny is successful in his chosen career, and while he's not rich, he can easily afford his bills. I'm a single mother to a special needs boy, the father is a deadbeat who lost his parental rights. Danny is very much a surrogate dad to my son. I don't make a lot of money, and what little I make goes to paying my rent, utilities, and all the cost of raising my son. There's nothing ever left from my paycheck. Now, onto the issue at hand. Danny stays with us about 4 days a week. I'll make dinner, he'll eat it, but then after I go to bed, he eats me out of house and home. I wake up to a lot of dirty dishes and evidence of his late night binges. He denies it was him because when he does it, he's blackout drunk.Now I wish I could say that was the only issue, but no. He's a man-child that tries to run my household, like he's the man of the family. He's not. He'll constantly talk over me with a disrespectful tone of voice. In front of my kid. Now I do not put up with this behavior, and we'll argue. He acts like I'm a bitch for "always busting his balls and constantly calling him out". Another issue is not only is he eating all my food, but he's a slob who rarely helps with dishes or anything. Things finally came to a head this weekend. I was constantly defending my place of being the head of household. He keeps changing my thermostat,  which really pisses me off, and finally, this guy took what was left of my Chinese takeout, mostly full, added it to his food, mixed it all up and put it in the fridge to eat later. That was it for me! I'm struggling to survive and he's really adding to my burden. I finally told him I'm done with it and to get out and don't come back.

ixhsg35a	This probably sounds really ridiculous, but it’s an ongoing conflict between my mom and I (F, teenager). My mom and I live in an apartment with only one toilet.  I usually spend upwards of 20 minutes in the bathroom at one time. I know that this is probably disgusting, but sometimes I’ll use Bluetooth earbuds when I’m doing my business. Also, I have IBS so I suddenly have to shit all the time.  A few days ago, I was going number 2. My mom knocked and I didn’t hear at first because of the music (I know, the earbuds are unsanitary). I said, “what!” And she kept banging on the door and yelling, but I couldn’t make out what she was saying. I opened the door a crack so that I could hear her. She told me that she had to pee before she went grocery shopping. I was mid-poop.  I yelled, “Ma, I’m sorry, but I’m taking a shit! I’ll be out in a minute.” She wanted me out at that instant. I didn’t get out, but I finished as fast as I could and apologized. She then compared me to my dad, who spends an hour at a time in the bathroom.

Earlier this evening, my husband told me that he was going to go take a shower, and I said, "Yes, please go take a shower." He looked at me with a confused expression, and I said, "Your feet stink." He said, "G****m, I can't help it." I said, "You literally can help it, though. You can shower and wash your feet." He stomped off and now he won't talk to me. We've had discussions about this before, but he has consistently taken showers only once or twice a week over the years we've been together. I think it's ridiculous.

7ihj5iw9	Do not post anywhere else. This isn't a huge life issue but I figured I'd take it here to internet strangers lol. My (F31) husband (M29) and I have two kids Charlie (M2) and Kyle (M1).   Anyway on to the story. My mom (F55) and my sister (F28) came to visit us today for lunch. We all had a great day playing with the kids and having fun. Before they left I always double check they have everything because they frequently forget items.   They said they had everything and left. About 20 minutes later I let my dogs out and saw her wallet sitting on the counter. So I called them to let them know so they could turn around and come back. My mom asked if I could bring it to them which I told them I couldn't because I was in the middle of trying to get my kids down for a nap.  She then proceeded to ask 3 more times and I told her I couldn't just drop everything and drive 30 minutes each way to bring something she forgot. I feel bad she forget her wallet and I know it sucks to have to double back but I don't see how I'm at fault.  My husband agrees with me but they think I'm the asshole. We're all over this already but I wanted to see who was in the wrong here.	1642985528.0	sb8ybz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8ybz/aita_for_not_bringing_my_sister_her_wallet/	AITA for not bringing my sister her wallet.
hplxk0x0	[ive never made one of these before and idk if I did this right]  Throughout high school and middle school I (bio female) used to be “friends” with this girl in my grade “Lea” (female) until she outed me and my then girlfriend to our homophobic families (and me to my school) in high school because I refused to date her. She was never a good friend to me even before this but I keep giving her more chances (big mistake) so I gave up and decided to start trying to pull away. She didn’t really care until my last year at that school when rumours started to spread that I was leaving. She was furious with me and came up to be crying and screaming at me about how I was “horrible” and “how could I do this to her” and how I “was never a good friend” etc. I told her that I didn’t care what she thought about me and then walked away. Later in my PE class she started another fight with me and she demanded to know why I hate her so much and I lost it and said that I couldn’t stand her because she was entitled and homophobic. She then started screaming that she wasn’t and that I was just jealous that she had parents that care about her and I didn’t and how I was literally being a jerk to her just because she’s adopted. And I said “I’m the jerk? Your the reason I was sent to conversion camp” which I admit now thatI shouldn’t have said because by the end of the day everybody knew and no one wanted talk to her anymore. The next day she then came up to me screaming and crying that saying that I “ruined her life” and how it’s not her fault her mother outed me (it wasn’t her mother who outed me it was her I was there) she harassed me until I left the school after that and sent me dts for months. I was told by my school therapist and my teacher that I went too far and that I need to apologise for bullying her. I refused.   Summary: My friend outed me and my gf to our homophobic families and I ended our friendship but we had an argument where I got angry and exposed her for what she did which caused people to refuse to talk to her and my teacher and school therapist said that I needed to apologised but I refused.	1642985604.0	sb8zau	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb8zau/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_friend/	AITA for refusing to apologise to my friend
eb9371y8	My uncle has a huge vaping problem, and usually I don't seem to care so much. This time, we were coming home from church and he starts vaping in the car. I tell him not to, but he ignores me. My little cousin, who is also in the car, tells him to stop. He doesn't. I open the windows to let out the vapor, but he closes then and LOCKS THEM. I get mad, so when we get home, I tell my mom. She says to stop meddling in adult business and to just respect them. She then tells me to apologise. I told her that I'm not apologizing. She got mad and yelled at me. Am I the asshole?	1642985833.0	sb91yu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb91yu/aita_for_telling_my_uncle_not_to_vape_in_the_car/	AITA for telling my uncle not to vape in the car
3kouqzob	I’m a 19 year old girl, and I’ve been living alone for a year. Right after I turned 18, I started looking for places to move due to the situation at home.  At my moms house there was living me, my mom (39), my stepdad (43), and their two kids who are 13 & 5. My stepdad and mom have been together since I was two, but he never took on the role of a dad for me, which I don’t really care about.   These problems started when I was 15, when my mom started to ask me to pay for my own medication, transports to school and other things that I needed. It only grew from there. After I turned 16 I started dating my ex bf, who’s mom needed an assistant because of her disability. I loved to help so she would schedule me as her assistant on days that her other assistants were taking their vacations or days off. They pay was good and over the two years of us being together I gather quite a nice amount of money to be able to move out and start a life for myself. My mom saw this as an opportunity to get money from me.   You see, when my mom was pregnant with my youngest sister she started studying. She never actually ended up going back to work until my sister was 3, so she didn’t have a lot of extra money. Over the years I’ve had to pay the phone bills of my whole family so that they wouldn’t be shut off, food for all of us, my sisters medicine, car payments and sometimes she wouldn’t even give me a reason why she borrowed money. For the most part I wanted to help because I didn’t want my sisters to go hungry or sick. The worse things she borrowed money from me were an Apple Watch and eyelash extensions. I doubt my mom has even told my stepdad about all the money she has borrowed from me.   Now after a year of living alone and refusing to loan any more money to my mom she has basically cut me out completely. In the past month I’ve spoken to her maybe an hour at maximum. From 2019-2022 she has borrowed over $1600 from me, from which she still owes me $550 that would cover a months rent for me, and the biggest thing she hasn’t paid me back is the Apple Watch, which she was supposed to pay back after she got her other watch sold. (A few months later I found out she sold it but never gave me any of the money). I have grown more and more upset with her after finding out that she would also borrow money from my biological dad and her parents for the same things she borrowed money from me. I have come really close to sending her all the information about the money she still owes me but I doubt she would even acknowledge it.   That’s why I want to know, reddit, WIBTA if I sent the information to both my mom and stepdad so I could finally get the money I’m owed?	1642986028.0	sb94pg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb94pg/wibta_if_i_sent_my_mom_and_stepdad_an_invoice_for/	WIBTA if I sent my mom and stepdad an invoice for all me money my mom owes me?
57q53eje	Hi everyone! This is my first ever post so I’m sorry if I do something wrong on here lol  Backstory: My husband (M23) and I (F26) have a dog and 2 cats together. I don’t ever want children so my animals are my pride and joy. We moved from Virginia to Oregon in Oct. of 2020 and before we moved our dog was up to date on all of his vaccines, heart worm meds and flea preventative. We took him to the park pretty often in VA because we’ve never had a fenced in yard and he needed to get his energy out.  Once we moved, money was tight along with Covid hitting hard and the housing crisis here, everything was expensive and taking a dog to the vet for vaccines was just out of the question; so no dog parks. My husband is in grad school along with being chronically ill with no clue what’s wrong, I’m the only one actively working and getting paychecks. He gets student loan refunds which gives us about an $8000 deposit twice a year. He uses this to pay his credit card bills and get groceries and other expenses. My checks go to our phones, rent, car, insurance and utilities. Which is TOTALLY FINE by me because him getting his masters while being chronically ill is a job itself. But I’m paying a majority of our bills. Which again, is fine and this is how our home dynamic is.  Now to the actual problem:  I JUST took the dog to the vet this past Saturday for his vaccines. He’s now up to date and rabies, bordatella and leptospirosis but we still need him tested for heartworms and prescribed a heart dewormer.   Husband asked if we could go to the dog park the day he got his vaccines and I told him no because I would like the vaccines in his system for a little bit to have his antibodies built up. There’s been reports of leptospirosis outbreaks in our dog parks with a couple dogs becoming critically ill. My husband thinks I’m being ridiculous and gets mad at me. He tells me that doesn’t matter and he’ll be fine and the chances of him getting sick is very slim. But I stand by my decision. This makes him mad and depressed and he thinks I’m being unreasonable. I try to explain my logic and I tell him that I understand where he’s coming from but I’m not risking the chance of our dog getting sick and having to take him to the vet and cost even more money since I’m the one who pays the bill. His vaccines were $118 (which was already pricy for me) and a vet visit for a virus will be even more expensive and we can not afford that.   We just had a scare with our cat and he suggested we rehome her because bills would be pricey if it was chronic. so you would think he would want to be careful with our dog. Since I pay the vet bills I think I should have major say in the situation.  He once again asked me today and I apologized and said no and he has once again shut down and is just sleeping the day away.  Am I being unreasonable?  TLDR; AITA because I don’t want my dog in a dog park a day after his vaccines because I want his immunity built up?	1642986154.0	sb96iq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb96iq/aita_for_not_letting_my_dog_go_to_the_park/	AITA for not letting my dog go to the park?
inm052hg	I’m really torn on this one because I really can’t tell if I’d be exaggerating but also, this encountered was terrifying for me.   So I, (20f) work in a private business that shares the building with a garage. We are connected in the lower level to the garage and have our own back exit that leads right into the garage. It makes things comfortable because our boss gets us monthly parking passes and we don’t have to struggle finding where to park outside.  I also always leave through the back exit into the garage because we live in a downtown area and the street exit at night doesn’t make me feel the safest.   So, there’s a new parking maintenance guy that started a few months ago. He’s probably mid 50s- early 60s, and he always stares. Yesterday, I left work at around 6:30pm and as I walked toward my car, he stopped working and started staring. I was in the 2nd floor and the exit to the garage is like this spiral to the outside, then the pass scanner and wait until the bar goes up. As I approach the scanner, he stands in front of my car blocking and has a trash bag in his hand. When the bar goes up, I moved forward and he moves over to be next to my window (lowered bc I was scanning). I’m waiting for cars to pass so I can incorporate into traffic, and he tries putting his whole hand (and open trash bag) in my car through the window. I had to swerve to the right o his hand wouldn’t reach. I immediately incorporated into traffic and left.   I describe this encounter to my boyfriend, and he says “did you ask him why he did it?” NO! I was too busy getting the hell out because I found it terrifying! I’ve never speaking two words to this man, and I can’t think of a possible plausible explanation that would make it ok for him to do that.  I was seriously considering writing to the garage management, telling them what happened, and explaining my discomfort. However, given my boyfriend’s reaction when I told him, now I wonder if I’m exaggerating and my fear is unnecessary ?   So, WIBTA if I contacted the garage management team and told them about what happened?	1642985909.0	sb92wz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb92wz/wibta_if_i_sent_an_email_to_the_employer_of_a_man/	WIBTA if I sent an email to the employer of a man that made me very uncomfortable?
byhn8lu	Just for background on the situation; last year i was in a very toxic, controlling and emotionally abusive relationship. My ex and my cousin went to the same school so they became friends after we started dating. At the time I was really happy with that and even when our relationship started to go downhill I made sure not to allow that in between their friendship. I never told my cousin anything that went on with us and we didn’t have that kind of relationship anyway. But close to the end of the relationship I found out that my ex had been telling my cousin all of our business and would tell him about any arguments we had. My cousin was only hearing one (probably altered) side of the story. in turn he always took his side.     anyway, about 3 months after we broke up i tweeted “why do i always choose the absolute worst men🥴” to my twitter with 10 followers (all close friends). me ex had been blocked but made a new account and saw my tweet. he then made a new instagram account to message me with a long rant about how he has a new gf and i don’t have the right to talk about our relationship because i’m publicly dragging him and “talking shit”. after that he sent screenshots of the tweet and our messages to my cousin.   now to the situation at hand. my cousin had ignored all my messages after that point and wouldn’t talk to me anytime i saw him (none of my messages were about that situation). he recently moved away for school and after almost 6 months of ignoring me he decided to message me. despite that, i was still glad to hear from him until i read the messages. he couldn’t even bother to ask how i am or anything. he only messaged to rant about how alone he is and that he’s struggling with school. obviously i felt bad for him but when i was at the worst point of my life he was no where to be seen. so i ignored his messages and removed him from all of my social medias. i don’t want someone who’s gonna hate on me behind my back but then come running when they need help. am i being petty??	1642987115.0	sb9i66	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9i66/aita_for_ignoring_my_cousin_and_removing_him_from/	AITA for ignoring my cousin and removing him from social media when he reached out for help
iyeo158u	 Repost w fewer characters  My mom died when I was really little and it was just my dad and I for a while, so we naturally were very close. He then got remarried to my stepmom who's husband had died. She has 4 kids ranging from 5 years younger than me to one year older than me. I was not against my dad getting remarried because I didn't want to him to be alone when I went to college, and it wasn't THAT awful for any of the kids because my step-siblings and me kind of just took the whole situation as "our parents couldn't be together because of death so they are with other people because they don't want to be lonely" and they all accepted my dad and I accept my stepmom. Just want to clarify that I do not hate my stepmom at all  I am a very solitary person. I like my space and would rather hang out with a few people instead of a million and my hobbies are usually done alone.  Everything changed when they moved into our house. It is all chaotic and loud and I feel like I have no say. I had to share a room but my dad and stepmom realized that it was a horrible idea and had another room built in the basement and I luckily got to be the one who stayed in my room after some fighting. But it was just so bad because we used to always do what my step-siblings wanted since we voted and they always sided with each other. Even for things like eating out, we switched off but they just picked stuff they liked together so I barely had any say. It was just awful living there. I always got A's but then I got a B because it was so loud and I could never study and then just gave up. My dad and stepmom said that they tried but its unfair to ask kids to be silent all the time.  I lost it one day and went to my grandparents (mom's parents) and told them I wanted to go to this boarding school which is a feeder for good colleges and I was very concerned about my grades. I told my dad and stepmom all my grievances and said I didn't actually want to leave my home but was driven out by my step-siblings. I said I wanted to go to this boarding school. It took them a while to agree, but then they said I had to call them twice a week. So they got it set up  I go to this school now and I do miss my house and dad. But I don't want to talk to my dad because it is his fault that I felt uncomfortable enough to leave the house I spent my entire life in. I still pick up their calls because they are annoying but I got frustrated and told my dad he was a bad parent for putting me in this situation and that he was betraying my dead mother by choosing some other woman's kids over me. I told my stepmom that she should be ashamed that she let her kids get rid of me. I also told her that I would never refer to her as my stepmom again because they doesn't deserve the title mom, and told my dad that I would no longer be facetiming him because I won't appease him just because it makes him feel less guilty  Anyways, they are both being clingy now and it is making me wonder if I am the asshole	1642987115.0	sb9i6i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9i6i/aita_for_telling_my_dad_hes_a_bad_dad_and_that_i/	AITA for telling my dad he's a bad dad and that I won't be facetiming him anymore?
aeve3gwl	For context, me and my friend “Ginger” have been friends since we were 12 and struggling with our mental health. We’ve been there for each other for years and spent most of our days together. So years pass, I’m not 18 and she’s 17 (7 months younger than me) she’s always gotten on my nerves for having irrational fears and acting younger than she is but I try to be understanding. For example, we wanted to have a picnic outside her apartment building and I thought the back of the apartments would be best since there’s not heavy traffic and it’s the parking lot. She refused because there might be “zombies in the woods”… yeah. Lately she’s gotten even worse about being fearful of the smallest things and trying to be a *quirky* girl.  Ginger came back to town after being away for a year, I was so excited to see my best friend and planned a whole day for us. Immediately off the bat I was getting fed up with her non stop talking, but again I was trying to be understanding, she was probably just excited. Through the night she tried holding my hand (which she hasn’t washed her hands since picking her nose or using the bathroom. Plus in a pandemic. Ick) and kept making attempts to kiss me and kept asking if I wanted to make out. Every time I said no she kept insisting. Obviously this made me want to distance myself from her because it made me extremely uncomfortable and I even told her it was making me uncomfortable. I was genuinely so annoyed with her after she did this that I started to hate her for everything she said and did afterwards. Every time she texts I have a deep feeling of “Jesus leave me alone”.   Yesterday Ginger called me on FaceTime crying over deleting an app with little characters in it. She said she doesn’t want them to feel abandoned and she regrets deleting the app. (I’m currently pregnant so I’m having a hard time leveling my hormones or controlling my anger). I yelled at her to never call me again with “stupid ass shit” and told her she needs to grow up or I’ll stop talking to her and hung up. I feel really bad about treating her that way.

iyemzuc9	I (20sF) am a high-school English teacher! (I'm Indian which becomes relevant to the story). Admittedly, English is an boring subject. Because of this, I plan my lessons a bit differently as opposed to most English teachers in my faculty.  To give you an idea, there are PowerPoints we are supposed to follow for each of our lessons. These PowerPoints include content material such as texts or videos and then follows with activities based on the material provided.  I teach my lessons quite differently in comparison to the rest of my faculty as it makes for more fun and engaging lessons. For example, we use bubble machine guns and other wacky props. It sounds strange, I know, but my students have lots of fun. They pay attention to lessons and can understand the material as well, which is the main goal!  During one of our lessons, a teacher came into our class to borrow a student. It was during a chaotic charades activity, and the teacher was a bit stunned. We all laughed it off and I continued my lesson. Once the period was over, I headed to my English staffroom and met the teacher who borrowed the student. There were many other English teachers there as well.  This teacher started insulting me, saying that I needed to 'stay in my lane.' (I'm not too sure what she meant by that). She started ranting about how I was an incompetent teacher and wasn't teaching them the curriculum. She threatened to report me to the head of English to get me fired.  This is not the first time she has talked to me about disliking my teaching style, yet this is the first time this has happened with other teachers around. Usually, I do not make a big deal out of this, however, they made a racist comment about how I am "a pathetic little brown who should be deported, even if I was born here," and that "I should stick working in scam call centers."  I snapped at her and told her to stop making horrible comments. At the end of the day, these lessons are more engaging for my students. I still give them mandatory work and assignments and the classes I teach end up being the top English classes for that grade, and that me being brown has nothing to do with anything.  She called me delusional and left the staffroom afterward.  Here's where I think I could be an AH.   I talked to my coworkers about reporting her and they told me I would be a complete bitch if I did so, as she is struggling financially and with her mental health as well. They said I should shut up and move on with my life.  WIBTA if I reported her?	1642986597.0	sb9bst	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9bst/wibta_for_reporting_my_coworker/	WIBTA for reporting my coworker?
7s8bg5cy	A bit of backstory, Every year my family expects me to play Santa at their Christmas party (I really have no interest in going because i have no interest in hanging out with people I'm not particularly fond of on any other day). The problem is It's expected. They don't even ask anymore. They just tell me when it is and to bring my suit (The suit belongs to me as I bought it for personal use). This year my aunt sent me a Facebook message telling me when and where. I told her that I was busy and couldn't make it this year as I had a prior commitment. She told me I had to as it was my responsibility and I had to do it. When I told her the plans were made weeks ago she asked if they could use the suit. I told her that the suit was being used because I was doing a gig and needed it (if you haven't guessed already I was being less than truthful......OK I was full of crap, I admit it, the suit itself is very expensive and I didn't want someone else ruining it. If I ruin it then it's mine to ruin and it has to be dry cleaned, I can't just throw it in the washing machine and that's not cheap either).    My aunt then proceeded to tell me off in a response that would make the author of War and Peace say, "Damn that's a lot of words!" It seemed to go on forever and I stopped reading at "selfish jerk"    and just told her, "Maybe if I was asked and not told, maybe I'd be a bit more inclined to change my mind and play Santa, but now I'm definitely not doing it. Good luck finding a Santa." and then promptly turned off my phone. I'm still getting angry messages from relatives I've never met asking why I was being such a jerk about this. I only know they are related because I'd ask who they were before blocking them. The party was December 20th and I still get messages asking me what my problem is (I have a huge amount of relatives, my ancestors were prolific fornicators it seems). I don't think I'm the asshole for wanting to be asked to do something and wanting some consideration and appreciation. But all these people messaging me has me wondering. I only do the Santa gig for the kids because I love the looks on their faces when they see a near seven foot tall Santa walk in going "HO HO HO!" There are two reactions, Pure Joy or pure terror LOL It is quite entertaining.	1642987337.0	sb9l31	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sb9l31/aita_for_not_playing_santa_at_the_family/	AITA for not playing Santa at the family Christmas party.
igflgxvr	I (39F) am divorced with 2 kids (11 & 13). A few years back I got a house in the same neighborhood where my parents live, so my mom (68) could help me with the kids after school (mostly picking them up where the school bus dropped them) and stayed with them for 45 min to 1hr until I was at home. This stopped with the pandemic situation. My single brother (40) lives with me, to help with the house expenses and with my kids too, and because he doesn't get along so well with our older brother (41) that lives with my parents after his divorce. Single brother has a 12 hr shift at work (6AM-6PM one day and the next 6PM-6AM). I work from 6AM til 3PM M-F. This is just background info on why we sleep late on the weekends. Yesterday, I had to go to the school to pick up books and supplies for my kids between 8AM-12:30PM. I got up at 9, and I was just in the bathroom when my dad (80) barged into my house screaming my name and waking up everyone, and my brother just arrived from the night shift on Friday. He was complaining that he was going to be late to his Association meeting, meeting that I didn't know about. When I told him that school and his meeting where in opposite directions and I couldn't give him a ride cause that would made me late and school would be close, he got mad and left. I was furious. I went to get my mom to go with me (she loves to be involve in these things) and we found my dad in the corner waiting for a taxi (it's a residential area, so it's not like you would find one in every corner). I told him that I could give him a ride where he could find one. Once we were in the car, I "pick a fight" with him (his words) saying that what he did was disrespectful, that I'm not living under his roof and he's not paying my house, he has to ring the bell like everyone else, not just scream his way in, that was abusive behavior and it has to stop.  He's not speaking to me right now and he says that I was out of line speaking to him like that.  I was furious, maybe I could've used a softer tone, but the message needed to be clear, right?

iw4scu6v	So my husband, 4MO and I just moved to a new house after previously being in a condo (that my mom never visited because no grandchild and elevators)   Since we moved we’ve asked her to watch our baby a few times while we went out to get things for the house/errands (we weren’t home - she was babysitting)   One day we came home and my aunt was here. Turns out my mom just invited her. I said ok, I like my aunt, but like can you let me know so I can make sure my house is clean and I have food for guests?? I let it slide. Context: my aunt has a pool and I often visit it, but I ALWAYS ask first. I never just show up. And she’s always home.   Then it happened again. And again.   And now it’s like every time my mom comes over she’s like “oh your aunt might come over to”. Or the most recent “I invited your aunt, uncle, and cousin over “. She doesn’t tell me until she’s already here. This was when we went out for our first late/drinking night and coming back drunk to my parents is one thing, but my aunt, not what I want in my own home.   My husband and I are pretty possessive people. Like our shit is our shit. My house is not your house. I have to tell her she needs to ASK permission. I’m going to be blatant. This is my house. You need to ask to have people here when I’m not home.  But like she’s doing me the favour of watching my baby.  But ugh it’s so irritating.  It’s going to start so much drama.

hvn6fspq	So my friend said they found a lump on the side of their dog and took them in to the vet to get it checked out in case it could be cancer.    I expressed my concern and said that i hoped everything would be ok, but also said that she is a pretty old dog anyway and that it would be a matter of time and losing her to either cancer or old age was going to suck.   My friend then said don't jinx it she's going to live forever and that's when I said what I said of course in a joking matter because of course it would be amazing if the animals and people we loved could live forever but reality is they don't.

c5ef9c47	a few weeks ago, i told my bf that winter sports were starting and i couldn’t hang out the next wednesday bc of the informational meeting. he was chill with it and suggested maybe we grab some food after if there’s time. i mentioned this informational meeting 2 or 3 times afterwards, and he never once showed any interest of going. he made a joke abt how boring it was gonna be, too. since it never seemed to peak any interest in him, i assumed he didn’t want to go with me. i made plans with one of my closest friends to go together as she was looking for someone to go with, and since it ended at 4 pm, i also made plans with my bf to get some food after. he asked me if he should stay at school too, (not asking if he should go to the meeting w me but just school in general) and I said it was up to him. he never gave a definitive answer, just said “we’ll see”.   the last bell rings and my friend and i walk to the room of the meeting. i didn’t have my phone in my hand and i wasn’t checking, there really wasn’t anything i needed to check my messages for- and we were rushing to find the room before everything started. after we got there, i pulled out my phone and saw he called me twice and was asking where i was. i didn’t think anything urgent of it? i texted him back, apologized and explained that i was walking to the meeting w/ my friend. he seemed kinda upset and asked “well cant I join?” the supervisor was talking to me so i told him i had to go for a second. when i came back, he was really upset because  i left him mid convo. i told him someone was talking to me, and told him i thought he was gonna go home since he never said he wanted to stay for sure (and he never stays after school). he got *really* upset and told me there’s no reason he would go home for a few hrs just to drive back and was hurt that I never texted him to check if he was staying for sure, which made him feel like I didn’t care abt him.  this turned into a big fight over something i thought was just miscommunication? then he told me he was in the office, crying over me and got mad that i didn’t leave the meeting to come over to him & make sure he was okay. i do feel bad about this part, obv I care about him and I should have done something but this meeting was kind of a big deal to me (he knew that- and also he’d just blamed me for his own miscommunication? i felt pretty upset and defensive at the moment). he told me the least i could’ve done was leave the meeting and respond to him, because he should be more important than some after school meet. he said it felt like i didn’t care about him & once i met with my best friend, i totally disregarded him. from my pov, i thought he was going home & i was staying after school. we literally rearranged things this way, so i had no doubt. he got mad at me for miscommunication, then got mad that i didn’t ditch an important event for him *while* he was blaming me for not inviting him when i didn’t know he wanted to go.

iwvv6tck	I (f18 bout to be 19) am receiving an unwanted birthday party from my mom (f42).   I do not like my birthday, it has always been a hard day for me and while I've tried to "tough it out" in my teen years I'm finally letting myself say no to birthdays. My mom, on the other hand doesn't understand that. I agreed and came to a compromise that I will have a dinner with my boyfriend, my grandparents and my intermediate family.   About 30 minutes ago my cousin called wanting to talk about some family business when my mom started talking about my birthday. The cousin invited themselves even though no mention of a party and planned on bringing several people with them. Before my mom could say anything they said that they were excited and hung up. My mom called me from the living room in our house and told me what was happening and I was upset. She was refusing to call them back and say they couldn't come because they were excited. And if I was truly not okay with them coming, I would have to call them and tell them not to come.   I hung up and just cried in my room, I'm already having a hard time with this and I just feel like shit and guilt. I vented to my father about this and half way through my rant my mom yelled from the living room that she had texted and they arent coming now. She's giving me weird looks and making small comments cause I didn't want to invite them.

iyhiukkl	TW: heavy mentions of drug and alcohol abuse !! hihi!! so this story is a wild one,, Basically my stepbrother constantly makes jokes about my dad.   background info on my father: my dad is a drug addict and an alcoholic. he loves me and i don't know how long he has left to live. I cant see him unless he is 6 months sober. his liver is failing and it hurts to see him every time.  my stepbrother (lets call him rob lol) , rob constantly makes jokes about him. one time we were in the car and he pointed to a trashcan and asked "is that your dad, azure??" of course i was upset. i love my dad, but i didn't let it get to me. i didn't take my anger out on him. i just said "no it isn't now stop." then he proceeded to say "is that your dad azure?" he was pointing at a man with a metal leg. this pissed me off. not only was he basically making fun of a dude who didn't even do anything, he was making fun of my dad too. again, i didn't let it get to me.   a couple days later i get a call from my mom asking if him joking about my dad bothered me. i said yes to her and she told me to start making jokes about his mom. (his mom is also a drug addict and an alcoholic.) i think its wrong to do but i also like the idea, i haven't done it and don't plan on doing it.  but every time i tell rob to quit it his dad gets onto me. in-fact half of my family get on to me when i call rob out on his disgusting behavior. they are always like "he's  younger then you! he will eventually learn!" i think he's old enough to know that its wrong. he's about to go into 4th grade and still acts like he's a 1st grader.   this isn't even a one time experience. he does this constantly. i've always told him to stop. aita??	1642989150.0	sba72r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sba72r/aita_if_i_tell_my_younger_stepbrother_to_stop/	AITA if i tell my younger stepbrother to stop making jokes about my dad?
iyh7j2jr	I just turned 42 and in a few months I  getting married. This will be my 3rd wedding (I know, I know - long story) I emigrated to another country 8 years ago so I don't have any family near me. I don't have much friends in here as well. I have a lots of colleagues, people I like but not real friends. And I am OK with it. This will be my third wedding but first that I can make perfect for me. I finally have money, opportunity and ideas to have my wedding like I want. My fiance is happy withe venue we both chose, happy with the guest list etc and basically agrees with whatever I want. He is involved with whole organisation project but he is happy with whatever I want. Knowing me that I will not go crazy with super fsncy/ expensive stuff. We both like simple and elegant so I can have wedding I want. Wedding won't be big, I will have only one bridesmaid. I have asked the lady who I have know since I came to this country. She is the same nationality as I am and15 years older. We were quite close. Many time we helped each other in different situations. So as she wax the closest person to me here it felt natural to ask her. Because of covid we needed to postpone the wedding twice. Just before covid, at work I have met another girl from my country, closet to my age. Wr bacame friendly over the next 2 years and really close. And she was the one helping to choose a wedding dress, to choose, design and make wedding decorations. She visited venue with me, went shopping for bits snd bobs in relating a wedding. I didn't ask her for anything, it just came naturally with the amount of home we are spending together. At the other side, the 'proper' bridesmaid did get involved in anything relating to wedding. Other than to criticising my choice of wedding dress (it us not in her style and what she likes) she didn't have time to go for dress hunting, she is refusing wear the dress I would like her to wear (just for ceremony and few photos) because she has a vision how shecwznrs to look. She bailed from visiting a venue in an 3 hours before we were supposed to go. She dobt like wedding hair ideas. She didn't even thought about doung anything for my hen do ( going out just for simple dinner would be OK with me) basically she just wants to show up, I offered pay for her dress, I am paying for transport to the venue on tge wedding day, I am paying for her hotel room etc. I am just getting fed up of her attitude, I have mentioned polite what I want and tha I wish she would be more engaged and flexible with what I want. At the end this is my wedding and the first one that I can make special for us. AITA wanting her attitude to change and thinking about replacing her if that will not change?

x6m1z	Every single year we send out a holiday card to ~70 family and friends. Every single year my mother complains about the holiday card, asking for photos of her not to be used and be sent to our family and friends. Most years we'll be able to find a photo she can agree to, but this year we just caved. We sent out a holiday card without any photo of her on it, just her name.  She is now complaining constantly that we don't care about her and we don't want her on the card. When I ask her if she wants to be on the card, she says no, but if I ask her if I can send a card without her on it, she also says no.

iyg5xgbm	There's honestly a lot to this backstory that honestly would make the post too long if I explained everything. Long story short, I was friends with someone since highschool (23 now) and they were friends with me and our friend group. Let's call her "A."     After high school, she started having serious issues with the friend group. I tried my hardest to be the neutral part of the group, but that changed when she started saying not-so nice things (fat-shaming, unsupportive to LGBTQ+ unless they were her friends, etc). It got to a point where she was so angry with events that happened years ago, that she kept asking me, "are you really going to be friends with people like that?" even though I've explicitly told her to stop bringing it up and that I was friends with everyone.      During my wedding, she was supposed to come the morning of to my house to do my make-up, but instead "slept in" and wanted me to come over to her hotel instead, knowing that all my other friends were helping me at mine. At my actual wedding, she wore a white/ivory coat, which made all of my friends upset. This didn't exactly bother me, because I told people to wear what they wanted as long as it matched the color theme. She told me she went home crying after the wedding, saying that one of my friends was talking shit to her, which I didn't know until at least a few months afterwards. My friend said something along the lines of, "I could slap "A" right now" referring to how she stood me up the morning of and then wore white to the wedding.     Anyways, recently she has been making me feel bad for not "messaging her" as often. I'm 23, married, and I have a life. I don't live close to them anymore. She used everything that happened at my wedding, and then the past, to be upset with me and then told me to "do better." I'm honestly sick of it, and I'm no longer speaking to her. Years ago, she gave me a sweater that she "cared" about. It has holes, bleached, and ratty. She cares about it because her (deceased) grandmother gave it to her. I threw it away the other day, but I want to know: am I the asshole for throwing something away that she cared about, despite everything?	1642989904.0	sbag87	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbag87/aita_for_throwing_away_clothing_an_old_friend/	AITA For Throwing Away Clothing an Old Friend Gave Me?
iu0m66ar	I have 2 friends I'm closed with (C and L) and we have a group chat together. We usually talked a lot about everything and even our problems especially now when we all are separated in different colleges.   L has a habit of accepting strangers who suddenly texted her. When she showed the convo it was a bit noticeable what the stranger's intentions are. She also admitted how uncomfortable she was with them.  We would always tell her just blocked unknown numbers and people who makes her uncomfortable but then she keeps making excuses saying, "what if the person was in serious trouble and chat me for help and I block them, so I can't help them" and more over the top excuses. We usually just sigh in defeat and just let her be because she's so stubborn about it.  Until one day, she showed us a chat from an unknown number asking her is she would be attending a competition she was hosting with her friends. The way the person texted was so creepy. She showed more and the creep actually even stalked her! The creep said they saw her at the venue and even described what she wears at that time.  So, I was a bit worried for her because the creep could be close to her as she was in college and asked her to block the number immediately. I also told her the consequences if she did not do that.  Again, she refused and gave more exaggerated excuses. I had enough of her excuses and directly confronted her. I told her that she actually liked unknown strangers text her (which she denies) and I even compared her to her other friend who kept on rant about her problems but don't want to act upon the advices given (she was the one who told us this and was annoyed by her friend's action as well)  I even told her, the stranger would live their life no matter if she block them or not and she should prioritised herself. Finally, I accidentally said, if she's just gonna rant about it and won't block that creep then there's no point in telling us at all (I know what a jerk I was for saying that)  So, now, we are having a cold war between each other (including C because she defended my points) and she kept posting stuff of how her other friends in her college appreciate her more and now I am starting to think I am the asshole for being too direct with my words.	1642990272.0	sbakqp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbakqp/aita_for_directly_telling_my_friend_she_needs_to/	AITA FOR DIRECTLY TELLING MY FRIEND SHE NEEDS TO CHANGE HER HABIT
iyj1fgvv	  TLDR: Learned dad had a very serious relationship after his death and refused to let this girlfriend and her family be at the wake/funeral.   After mom died, dad began dating “Pam”. They were together for 5 years. Dad never directly told me about Pam; two years into their relationship I saw their texts as I was resetting his phone. After that, I would offer to troubleshoot it, so I could learn how the relationship progressed (not proud of this, but it’s the truth). But I was never informed of her from dad! our relationship was strained. After mom’s death he wouldn’t let me come to his office, assist in his hobbies or attend events- now I know it’s because he feared someone would tell me about Pam or I would meet her.  Now he’s died. I was “officially” told about Pam when I (only child) collected his office things, and a large photo of her (no one else including me on his desk) was there. They were STUNNED I didn’t know. I threw that photo away right there.  I made all arrangements. Pam tried contacting Dad’s phone/messenger- I assume she saw all the posts on his Facebook and the funeral date online. I never responded to her.  Yet before his wake started, Pam and her family showed up- and planned to be a part of the services! I came in at 5pm for the 6pm wake, and she and her 3 sons, DILs, grandkids were there talking with some of his friends. She’s known them all for 3-4 years!  I was FLOORED. The funeral people asked me why I didn’t include her, since she’s his significant other. I told them right in front of everyone that I’ve lived with my dad all this time (we had issues since I became an adult) these last 5 years and I never met or knew her. At this point Pam got out of the provided chair and tried to play it cool by saying “oh come now!” while pulling me aside to “chat”. During this chat she told me “you’re going to embarrass yourself and father if you don’t just keep it together. I cant believe you refused to meet me until now but that was YOUR choice. Now let’s get through this and figure it out later.”  WHAT THE HELL?! All my life my parents wanted me to keep quiet, be a “good proper lady”, don’t complain, etc. and ALL of that just bubbled right to the surface and I LOST IT. I went to the funeral home’s manager and told them to remove Pam and her family, as they were NOT family, or I would call the cops. Pam followed me, saying she knew this would happen because I never wanted to meet (according to dad), and I spent 10 minutes explaining to her and her family that HE NEVER TOLD ME ABOUT THEM.   Pam wanted to stay, because in her mind she was all but legally his wife. I said no, because I’m the family, and she should have thought this through. Right before the 6pm service, she and her whole family left, and it was just me facing, among other things, constant questionings of “where’s Pam? Why couldn’t Pam come? We saw Pam outside leaving, why did you do that?...”  AITA for just not putting on brave face and let her be there with me as “family”?	1642990464.0	sban1q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sban1q/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_kicking_out_dads/	AITA: Am I the asshole for kicking out dad's girlfriend at his wake and funeral?
byhn8lu	I plan on moving out of the country within the next 4yrs and my biggest concern is what will happen with my dog. When i adopted him 7 months ago I was 16. To adopt and register a pet with the city you have to be 18. Because of this, my mom signed all the paperwork and the pet insurance is under her name. So legally she owns him, but I am his main financial provider and caretaker.   A few weeks ago, I brought up the fact that I’ll be moving and will take him. My mom said that since she legally owns him she won’t let me do that. My parents and brother don’t ever take care of him and they wouldn’t even know how to. They only occasionally play with him but usually ignore him for majority of the day. Additionally, my dog has severe separation anxiety with me.    If I have to, I will take my parents to court to get custody of him. I told my friend this and she said that would be really shitty of me because they love him as well. I agree they love him but i don’t believe that’s enough to be a good caretaker.

iyiqsdzj	Apologies for formatting I’m on mobile Backstory: Me(14m) and my brother’s(16) parents are divorced. My dad is bipolar and refuses to acknowledge it(not sure if he is taking meds or not also he has been diagnosed with it multiple times) I go to a therapist because of this. My mom is very kind and supportive. My dad will constantly make up stories that are change every time about how everyone in my family including my cousin who is 13 are all alcoholics. They are not alcoholic. I don’t really spend time with my dad when it is his time because of this I mostly just read and do homework, same with my brother. I used to spend more time with him.  I was doing homework on my phone because I did not have my computer. My dad knew this and I had told him. He asked about some movies I had told him some trailers had been released and went back to my homework. He was quite for about 5 minutes and then said that he would be taking this board game I own from me. He had given it as a gift two months ago. I had had liked it for years before hand. Once I got it I spent about using retail price $250 of expansions. I told him that I would be taking it home because of this reason. He then got up approached me and started talking raising his voice very loudly. We went on a rant about how this was in fact his and I said again it was not. At this time he was fuming and his voice was rough. My brother was in this room and he has always stood up for me. He stopped my dad and my dad told me to go to my room. I went and heard my dad and brother fighting(verbally) through the walls. I texted my mom saying I wasn’t feeling safe and what was happening. I went to the other room and told my brother. We need to leave I don’t feel safe anymore. (We were planning on walking back home at this point.) My dad started going on a rant demanding why I get like this and hadn’t interacted with him recently. I explained why my brother stayed close to me and packed. I told him that he had called my whole family alcoholics and was constantly trying to manipulate us. He yelled and demanded I leave the board game including the stuff I had bought. I decided that the safest bet would be to take the stuff from the base which he had bought out of the box and keep all the stuff I had bought. He then said forget it and he would drive us. We went in the car and he called out mom trying to talk to her. She ignored him and talked to us making sure we were okay. He hung up on her and said that the way I act makes him think I need a therapist. My brother said that we already go to the therapist and my dad responded with “good OP will get more.” We got to our house and got out. My dad stepped in front of me and stepped on my foot which his foot. He then tried to revive the argument but I pulled my foot free and ran inside.

5940jxqi	Sometime ago, I (F21) was in a heated conversation with my dad B (M51). I have a younger sibling M (M11). B decided to bring out the weight card. What initially I brought up was in retaliation turned into a confrontation. My dad has been smoking for a while. In earlier days he used to feel guilty, would smoke a cigarette or 2 and discard the full box. In recent years, he has been chainsmoking beyond control due to the stress at office. I try not to judge him for it as it's his business, but at the same time, he's my dad, as much as he annoys me I can't imagine a life without him. It got so bad to the point where he has 2 backup packs in the mailbox. He also lostso much weight, that he takes full pride in as he's glad to not be as fat as me. He can't even laugh for 5 seconds without coughing violently. Growing up my relation with B strained due to different beliefs but my mom, C (F46), would practically beg me in tears to talk to him about it. That night I felt that it was the best time to not just talk about it, but give everything I have to get him to change his smoking behaviour. After some more back to back arguing, I started tearing up and genuinely voiced out my concern and literally said, word for word (but in my home language) "I need you, we all need you. Don't you want stick around to at least witness M's highschool graduation?" Looking back it feels silly how that's all it took for a change, like I didn't deliberately mention the word "death" etc, but given how my family extremely conservative, I can't say that I'm not surprised.  Anyway, it struck a chord with him as it's been 3 months since and he doesn't reek of cigarettes. He comes home early, is able to wake up early, eats more, shows more energy. Of course, his withdrawal shows it more than anything, but he stopped, or at the least reduced the frequency. No backup cigarettes inside the mailbox.  Now C says how in a conversation between C, M and B, B mentioned "anyway, Im gonna die soon, right? What matters". Later that day, C say how what I had said was extremely disrespectful. C wants me to admit that what I said was wrong and apologise to B.  I personally don't think I'm in the wrong. He had a severe smoking habit, and given his age and other existing conditions, there was a considerable chance of his lungs getting just worse enough. I'm not gloating, his change literally happened after what I said. And I didn't call him names, or say it in a rude manner, ffs I was sobbing when I told him.  It's been 3 days and C is still sour towards me for not apologising. Am I the Asshole?

c3g0k76b	I (28f) have three women in my life who have had kids recently. The wife of one of my husband's friends (Sarah) had one in September, my sister (Courtney) had one in November, and one of my long-time friends (Amanda) had one in December. I have gotten to visit Sarah and Courtney's babies since they have been born, but I travel for work during the weeks and my husband and I have been working in transitioning into a new home since November. I have been trying to get out to see Amanda's baby, but I haven't had a chance because of how busy we've been. I keep reminding her that I still plan to go see her baby. Since Amanda had this baby in December I think I asked once or twice how she was, but I will admit that some of the time I update her on how my life is going.  This is where my issue comes in. Yesterday, my husband's friend invited us out for brisket dinner and we accepted. I'm not too close with Sarah, but I still go because I don't mind any chance to spend time with friends. I also know that when my husband and his buddy get together, I will likely end up being the DD and I didn't want to leave him without a ride home. While I was there, I posted a picture of me holding Sarah's baby and Amanda seemed to take this pretty hard. She feels neglected because I haven't come by to see her baby yet, and I haven't asked her how she has felt after having the baby. I felt bad, owned up to it, and told her I will do better, but then I saw that she requested to be my friend on Facebook...meaning she deleted me off of Facebook because I hadn't kept in touch with her in the month that she has had this baby.  Besides all of what I just said, we have had a great friendship. We have gone shopping together, had tons of laughs together, and are always up to vent to each other about our significant others or whatever other drama we are dealing with.   I feel like I'm an asshole, because I have a "friend" that has KNOWINGLY done the same to me, but I didn't mean to make Amanda feel neglected. She is more than welcome to come to me if she needs to talk, but I have had a lot going on myself and haven't had a chance to check in on people.

7aujd2om	  My best friend’s wife, let’s call het Penny, is a mother in question in regards to this story.   Penny and I haven’t always gotten along in the years we’ve known each other.  Though when around her I just know to keep to myself.  She is known for being a bit sarcastic.        Over the years she’s made a few comments to me that rubbed me the wrong way.   Them all indicating that she seems to think I’m wanting to see her naked or something to that effect.   One being that she and my friend were visiting my home once and she went to go take a shower and announced to the whole room she was going to do so.   As she was walking to the bathroom she stated for me to not follow her because she was about to get naked.  I was confused and slightly annoyed, but bit my tongue.       Skip ahead little over a year later.   My friend and Penny had a kid since then and was still in the breastfeeding stage.   I was over at their house at this time.   While I was there she needed to do so with her child and as she lifted her shirt to do so she warned us she was doing so and I just was going to have to be ok with her boobs being out, “just what I wanted.”    Now for context I’ve never made any passing comments to her or said any jokes around her indicating I wanted to see her naked or anything further.  I’m not sure as to why she made comments about me in this manner.  I don’t know if she just thinks that these are jokes that people think are funny or if she actually believes this.      Fast forward to recently to the incident.  We were at Penny’s kid’s 2nd birthday party.   The birthday party was at an indoor pool.  There were many adults and kids there including some of Penny’s family.   We all were having a good time and most of us were swimming around and having fun.  After it started to wind down Penny made a comment that she was going to the locker room and change out of her swim suit and said something about me not staring at her anymore. At that I got irritated enough to finally speak up about it.       I said “I’m Not sure why you think I want to see her naked but I don’t.  Please stop.”  I must have said it a bit loud due to me being annoyed but as I turned around to grab my own things everyone was silent and some were staring at us and others were trying not to stare.

7nukpahs	Today around lunch, my boyfriend (m26) and I (f21) were heading to his friends house to watch football. On the way there, we both were hungry so decided to stop and get something to eat. I was driving, and we stopped at McDonald’s. Ordered at drive thru, payed at first window, then went to second window. A young girl hands me the drinks and she looks extremely sad. Like on the verge of tears. So, when she hands me the bag of food, I asked her if she was okay. She said she was just having a bad day and I asked her if she needed someone to talk to. She said she was okay. I said “Okay, I hope your day gets better” and drove away. My boyfriend immediately asked why I did that and what I was thinking. He said she’s at work, she probably just didn’t want to be there and I made her feel awkward. My reasoning was that she reminded me of younger me. Sure, it could’ve just been work or something small, but I feel like it didn’t hurt anything to check on her. My boyfriend told his friends all about it and they said it was weird of me and I shouldn’t concern myself with others. It’s been a topic of conversation all day and no one is on my side. So I’m bringing it here. AITA?	1642992185.0	sbb7dv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbb7dv/aita_for_asking_an_employee_if_theyre_okay/	AITA for asking an employee if they’re okay?

I sat down with my friends after I’d nearly slipped and fell on junk they had lying around. I expressed how much it hurt me the state they put my home in and never clean it up. Snow and John lost their minds at me saying I would be cruel and selfish sending them out and that I know they can’t afford to pay me while they’re working on their house. I told them I never even wanted payment I just wanted help but they continued to belittle me , so I told them they have until the end of February to find other living arrangements. As for Nell, she and I had a talk when I broke down a few days before this fight and she apologized profusely , told me she landed a great gig, and she’s started cleaning my house everyday and has even cooked me meals as well. It’s not the outcome I wanted as I didn’t want to lose any friends but thanks to all the helpful comments I decided to put my foot down. I want to thank everyone again for all the time you took to comment and help me. And yes my baby is doing just fine I can’t wait to meet my little Angel.

iy2wi7l6	I (Teen M) have recently felt like my mom has been invading my privacy. I'm not allowed to have my door closed, and she always asks what we're doing on our phones. (Like " who are u texting, oh really? what about?") She looks through my text messages and has an app on her phone that checks everything we do on our electronics. (She claims she needs to know what we're doing)   I have done things in the past when I was 10, but it's getting really irritating and she does the same precautions on my sibling, who's basically perfect.  She also controls how often I paint my nails, how much I spend on nail polish, and always judges what I buy in general. (She legit tried to control how often I cared for my nails, and she'll ask me to take off my gloves to make sure I didn't paint them again, otherwise she'll take away all my nail polish, which I paid for)  She's been taking away my monthly allowance when she has to remind me to do things (I often forget, but it's my only source of income, and she makes me pay for anything I want in general)  My dad just goes with what she says and I know he wouldn't make the same rules.   Would it be unreasonable for me to try and confront her or should I go with it? Or should I talk to my dad about her behavior?	1642992914.0	sbbfgf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbfgf/wibta_for_confronting_my_mother_about_her/	WIBTA for confronting my mother about her invasion of privacy?

Until one of my friend “C” mentioned about our mutual friend “B” (Female) just got married, and suddenly C asked about B’s health condition. B has throat cancer, and has undergone a surgery. She was hiding her scars for years and using Chocker to hid it, but her cancer recurring.  C mentioned about how amazing B’s husband is, because when someone can get a new car why that person would get a junk car. D told him that he can’t comparing B with junk car but C still went on, and A was arguing with C. C said why would someone get a junk car that can only be repaired with rare car parts.   I got really upset and screamed at C about how dumb he is and swearing at him, and the group call went silent. We finally end our call, one of my friend told me I was out of line for screaming at C and he said Men are usually talking about random topic that Insensitive. AITA for swearing at C?

itgb0sua	I (21F) have an apartment that my boyfriend (29M) stays at very often for free. I am going to college full time while he goes to college part time and works part time.   I ask him very often to help with chores (cleaning out recycling, putting away the dishes, helping with laundry, etc. all of which he contributes to), but he never does when I ask him to. I’m not demanding he help right then and there, but I expect him to help within a reasonable amount of time. It’s not like I ask him to help in the middle of homework or online gaming, I am reasonable in my timing.   For example, recently I’ve asked him to take the clothes out of the dryer and put the clothes from the washer into the dryer. It never happened (he instead spent time playing video games) and I ended up having to do it later the next day—as I can’t just let wet clothes sit and mildew. Tonight I asked him to help with the dishes and recycling, and he initially helped put away the dishes, but soon left to watch a football game, leaving me to put the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and clean out the recyclables.   This is where I may the the asshole.   I finished the rest of the chores because I’m not just going to sit around and wait on him to finish watching the football game. These items had been sitting there for a while, and I wasn’t going to leave them there to fester more (and that has always been my rationale). When I showed I was upset at him for ditching me in the middle of chores, he got upset at me for doing the rest of the chores instead of just waiting for the game to finish so he could help. He says that these chores “dont have to be done right then and there,” but they already aren’t done immediately—things often pile up because I have school and I can’t always put aside time to do chores because of homework and assignments.   He tells me just to tell him what needs to be done, but I already have the chores written on a whiteboard in the kitchen. I also believe that since he’s a grown man, he should be able to look at a sink of dishes and understand they need to be cleaned, he should be able to look at laundry piling up and understand it needs to be cleaned. I shouldn’t have to boss and mother him around on basic chores.   I understand that he wants to have fun and do what he wants, but there’s also fun things I want to do as well that I understand as an adult that I have to put aside so I can do the necessities. If I put off chores until I finished doing what I wanted, chores would never get done.   Nothing spiraled into a huge argument, but he constantly uses the same arguments of “just tell me what to do” and “it doesn’t need to be done immediately” to which I refuse to entertain.   So, AITA for not waiting for him to be finished with his games and fun time to finish the chores?	1642994124.0	sbbu7t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbu7t/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_not/	AITA for Getting Mad at My Boyfriend for Not Helping with Chores?
hvesawy7	So I (F19) am on a very strict diet for health reasons. For this reason I cannot eat a lot of foods that my family eat and I have to make my own meals. Usually, I cook for them as well under the condition that they buy their own food. I buy mine and buy what I'd like to eat (and am supposed to.) I am only cooking for one so I have a lot more options on what I can afford and I tend to buy a variety of things since I don't want to get sick of eating the same things repeatedly. So I will buy chicken, steak, fish, shrimp, scallops, and so on (Lean red meats and white meat.) I also buy fresh veggies. My family are a lot cheaper on the meats that they buy (bacon, sausage, pork chops, chicken leg quarters, etc.) It's not for a lack of money, they just don't want to fork out for food. So whenever I'm in the kitchen cooking, they see their food (I always make them meat, a healthy starch, and a veggie.) I get just my meat and veggies. Whenever I make dinner for myself, I get a lot of complaints of "OH so you get steak/shrimp huh? I see how it is." They also come into the kitchen while I'm cooking or eating (I cook my meals after theirs) and pick at my food (sometimes directly off my plate.) Any time I've ever tried to get them to stop by politely explaining that I portion out my food so that I'm healthy and not hungry after, I get told that I'm being selfish and that an adult should know how to share. I've also explained to them that i don't have the money to buy th3 type of food i eat for 6 people but if they wanted to buy it i would cook it for them (and still buy my own.) They also help themselves to my healthy snacks (fruit, yogurt, granola bars) and blow up at me whenever I say anything about it. Am I just being selfish by making a big deal of them having some of my food and making myself TAH?	1642994147.0	sbbuh0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbbuh0/aita_for_not_wanting_my_family_to_eat_my_diet_food/	AITA for not wanting my family to eat my diet food?
87l61p7q	My friend asked me and my partner what we wanted for Xmas around the beginning of December. I told her it’d be super fun to share a fun experience together, like a painting or cooking class. She ended up going with an escape room - which my partner and I absolutely love - so we were thrilled and excitedly looking forward to it!  Fast forward to the beginning of January, my friend sent my partner and I a group text message saying she’d be booking the escape room on Sunday, January 23rd. The three of us agreed that day worked for our schedules, so planning a local escape room experience would be perfect. We also discuss booking for a group of 3 or booking the entire room to reduce any COVID-related risks. My friend even asks if I’d like to invite any of our mutual friends. So far, she has been very inclusive of our preferences and opinion for this very generous gift.   My friend then says she’s booking it in a city about 2.5 hours away. My partner and I discuss it with each other and decide that 5 hours worth of round trip driving to visit the same escape room we have locally isn’t going to work for us. When we initially gave our availability, it was based on the assumption that the event would occur locally. My partner has every Sunday off except for the last Sunday of the month. So he has a good amount of things he’d like to get done on the last day before he works 14 days straight.   I ask my friend in our group chat if we can book the escape room locally (since it’s the same company/brand and prices) and that is when things go awry.   As soon as I ask about booking locally, she accuses me of trying to take control of the gift. I try to explain that we have other things we need to do that Sunday and can’t commit all of our time to the event, which now includes the escape room, 5 hours of driving, and eating out. She then tries to explain her response by drawing a parallel to any gift she’s received from us. She says that any time she’s ever been gifted makeup, clothes, perfume, purses, etc., she’s never asked us to return one so she could get something she liked more - and she expected us to receive the gift in the same manner, accepting and attending regardless of how the travel would affect us. I was completely floored by this response and didn’t even know how to respond. I eventually told her to plan it for the farther city and let us know what she wanted to do.   And when the day finally came, we never went. When I asked her why, she said she was waiting for us to choose where we wanted to go and said I was an as*hole for trying to control the gift and take away her say in where it would be done.

iyl63sm6	A few years ago, my girlfriend ran into some financial difficulties. Over a period of around a year or so, I loaned her approximately $18,000 for rent. It was with the understanding that it was a loan. It's worth mentioning that I did make quite a bit of money at the time, $100k per year, so I could certainly afford to loan her the money.  Over the past six months, she has started to pay me back slowly. Thinking it over, I decided at one point to tell her she only needed to pay me back half. I love her, and wanted it to be easier for her. It's also worth mentioning that with the whole covid situation, I ended up losing my job (and other difficulties arising financially for me) so the repayments became more important, but I 100% stand behind saying she only needs to repay half.  She mentioned the situation to one of her friends recently, and her friend told her "Get the fuck out of there immediately, break up with him, go no contact, never pay him back. He's a terrible boyfriend, he should be paying for 100% of everything for you, my boyfriend does this, it's a huge red flag that he's asking you to repay that money."  My girlfriend is still working on repaying me, but hearing that made me feel like I'm taking crazy pills. I've never confided in any of my friends about this situation as it feels much too personal.

w92ded	So I’ve been having this problem with my bf since we started living together two years ago. Anytime we go out to eat I end up having leftovers. I eat in small increments over a long period of time. Some leftovers can last me a week of snacking. Sometimes I’ll save my left overs for a rainy day when I’m craving something more.  My bf has been eating my leftovers ever since we moved in. He doesn’t ask me first and he doesn’t tell me that he’s eaten my food. I have to find out about it when I go to eat the food. Usually I’ll end up asking “hey have you seen (food?)” to which he’ll reply “ssss ooooh yeahhhh I didn’t think you were going to eat it cause it’s been in the fridge for (days).” The first few times I told him it’s ok just ask me next time. After that I started trying more and more to tell him to stop eating my leftover and ask first. He always offers to buy me food after and states that he feels really bad about it. I’ve told him before I appreciate him trying to make it right but that I don’t want more food, I want him to stop eating my left overs without asking me. I made it clear that most of the time if he asked I would’ve given it to him anyways.  Well tonight was the feather that broke the camels back.I had leftovers from two different places this week. Yesterday I snapped at him for eating one of them. Today, I asked for the other one.  He said “sttttt oh... about that.... I ate that one like three days ago and i wanted to tell you yesterday but I thought you were already upset enough...”  I snapped at him again.  After i did he got very quiet and depressed he said he didn’t want to tell me yesterday because he knew I’d snap at him and that he ate it before he ate the other one and I yelled at him for it. He then decided to go to bed for the night crestfallen. I felt like an asshole. I attempted to apologize and stated that I shouldn’t have raised my voice. I attempted to offer him a few things like movies and videogames but he just went to bed.  I feel like a jerk for getting that worked up over leftovers.

chxnw2wz	I’m an alumni of our HighSchool (turning19F) and I used a Google Form provided by our school’s Academic Department to request a reference letter for University applications. I requested it on the 19th and put the due date as 24th (the actual due date is 26th but it’s too risky to put the day of and highly unadvisable). They stated we should give them at least 3 days, which I did, but as for why it was still kinda “last minute” has a reason I will get into later  2-3 days before the 24th father did say that I should maybe follow up through the Studies Department etc. but by then it was the weekend, and with past experiences (recent too) whenever I messaged them on the weekend they sent an automated message stating they were closed, I also had a few things on my plate, besides, it wouldn’t be rare to get snapped at by teachers for trying to remind them of stuff, plus I didn’t wanna seem rude  So before this I had asked other teachers for my reference, but only on the 18th or 19th did I find out through inquiries with the agent I have been working with all this while that it had to be from previous and most recent institutions I studied in A.K.A. HighSchool, even though the other teachers did teach in other institutions the agent said there had been instances such letters were rejected. The universities themselves did not really all state this requirement, but the website I had to use to apply to these universities did state it had to be from previous or recent institutions, but that really had an open meaning to it but maybe I misunderstood  Way before this I had asked school teachers too, they didn’t really reply, since the school year just opened it was probably because everyone was busy, so at that time I resorted to other teachers  24th I received a call from a lady from the Principal’s Department, I just know she’s not out principal, maybe a teacher who works there and helps with the principal’s documents  She asked me if HAD to be today, if applying to the UK really was my first choice, if they had second intakes, if I was applying to other countries, how usually these types of things and the whole process takes about two weeks, and told on me for not following up, how usually other students would follow up, and the one who called was her and not me, how I could have called other departments to notify them, reprimanding me to quickly answer her, that she was rushing for a meeting; I was just trying to think and she wasn’t really asking questions I could answer, a question was: “What do you think I should do?”, I was kinda shutting down. But I get it, she was in a rush  After the whole thing I’m just feeling bad. Lesson learned, follow up.

8rfmofvb	My sister is due to deliver her 3rd child, her husbands first, in a few weeks and I have been organizing a baby shower. This is not a surprise party and she has been involved in some aspects of the planning - as has my mother who is paying for most of the shower. I picked out, paid for and am handling the decor, flowers, invitations & RSVP's, favors, games and prizes. When putting together the guest list several weeks ago, with my sisters input, it was decided that no children would be invited, except my sisters two daughters.  As the event has gotten closer, and many people RSVP'd No, my sister began telling some guests that they could bring their children because she wanted more guests. I found out about this when these people texted or called me to RSVP that they were attending & bringing their children - all girls aged 10+. My young son is not invited because of his age and because he is a boy. While I can follow the logic I am hurt because I made sure to include my sisters young children in my bridal & baby showers and other events in years past but she is excluding my child and wasn't up front with me about it. When I explained that I was hurt her response was "my shower, my choice", which is true - but i feel that I have the right to skip an event my child is being excluded from.	1642995694.0	sbcdjz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbcdjz/aita_if_i_skip_my_sisters_baby_shower/	AITA if i skip my sisters baby shower?
fote0fv9	Throw away account because me sister in on reddit.  Context: My sister is always stingy with food and can never get enough. She's also kind of selfish when it comes to food as well. There was a point a little over a year ago where my mother was skipping meals so we could eat. My sister didn't seem to care. She would go out to eat with her boyfriend then come home with leftovers and eat what little food my mom scaped up for her while putting her fast food leftovers in the fridge. She'd even put a sticky note on them and yell at anyone if they ate them.  Now for the issue: A few days ago I bought dinner for my family. It was just take out but I wanted to treat my mom. So I got her favorite take out as a thank you for her working hard for us. My sister had work that day and told my mom she was going out with her boyfriend after. I even privately texted her to ask if they were getting food. She said probably. So I didn't order her anything.  Well she can home (with taco bell left overs) and saw us in the middle of eating. She smiled and put her food away before sitting at the table and asking what was hers. My mom asked if she had wanted any and she got upset saying of course she wanted some dinner. My mom offered my sister her food but I cut in and told her that she could eat what she put in the fridge.  This didn't go well and devolved into a screaming match. Which in turn led to both if us being grounded. Just a simple no going out and less screen time. My sister, however, is still mad at me for "not thinking or caring about her" and "buying dinner for everyone but her." I was positive I wasn't in the wrong but a lot of my friends and family are saying its wrong to have not gotten her anything since she didn't actually say for sure if she was getting dinner and that she's family and stuff like that.

i9ccn5sd	Hey everyone, obligatory apology for the formatting since I’m on mobile. I’m an eighteen year old with divorced parents, and my dad remarried in 2018 to my now stepmom, who had a son from her previous relationship (let’s call him Gale). I love Gale with my whole heart, even if he’s your stereotypical dramatic newly teenaged boy, and I call him my little brother. My stepmom, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated. We often have fights, get snappy with each other, etc. It gets bad sometimes, like when she admitted that she expected me to do everything she did in high school despite my mental illnesses and lack of friends, but that’s not the story I want to tell. My seventeenth birthday in 2020 was very stressful for me. I had worked a full shift that day, so when I got home I was already emotionally wiped and tired. My dad cooked the family a nice dinner and I opened my gifts afterwards. One of the gifts my stepmom wrapped had a lot of tape on it, and due to said exhaustion, I was struggling with opening it. My stepmom saw me struggling and said, “God, you can’t even unwrap gifts? You’re the person they have to put instructions on shampoo for.” She then laughed. I remember that the room went silent, and I started crying, asking her “Why would you say that to me on my birthday?” She backtracked immediately, saying it was just a joke, don’t be so sensitive, but the damage was already done. My dad and her went into the other room to argue, because he was pissed, and my brother tried to cheer me up. She came back in and said “I’m sorry if your feelings were hurt.” To me, that’s not an apology. Even though it’s been a year, it’s all I can think about whenever we have fights, and I’ve brought it up to her only to be shut down with “it was just a joke, you need to let go of that!” I feel like an ass because I do have trouble with holding onto grudges, but I just can’t let this go. Am I the asshole?  TLDR: Stepmom called me stupid on my birthday a year ago, tried to pass it off as a joke, refused to apologize, and says I need to let it go.

i6vnrw88	First off, Throwaway account, my girlfriend and my friends know my main. I'll have to keep a few things vague, sorry!  I 20F been friends with my 2 best friends 19M and 20M (Who I'll call Matt and Claus, respectively.) for more than 10+ years, we've been through thick and thin and I love them both to death, we all started hanging out at kindergarden because we shared the love for Pokémon and to this day we still do, obsessively. Matt always updates me in pokémon media and we like to draw pokéfusion together while me and Claus have been pokémon rivals for as long as we had our first pokémon games. (I won a battle against him for the first time in our friendship last year and I almost cried, seriously.)  With the new pokémon game coming out in 4 days, I decided that I'm gonna buy a switch lite for Claus, as much as I also love Matt, Claus is more of a video game person, is more into Pok´´emon and we've been comparing our game journeys for years, this is the first pokémon game I've bought since 2014 and I really want to share this experience with someone who has also not played one of the mainline games for years too. Plus he's the only one who gives me birthday gifts, albeit not compared to the price of a switch, still manage to give me the most amazing things for my birthday.  The issue is; this might go terribly for Matt, I don't want to make him feel left out or that I don't care about him, he's always been very needy and jealous so I know this is going to hurt him. I can't hide from him that I gave Claus a switch because he knows Claus never had the financial stability for a switch (hence why he could never buy the other pokémon games), gets no allowance and his job doesn't pay enough. Even if I gave it on his birthday, he'd still get jealous because well, no one on our friends group gives birthday gifts due to not having money. (We're all fresh adults in this economy after all, lol.)  Second, I don't know how his girlfriend will react. He has dated multiple women in the past who were... not so thrilled about me, I've never met any of them but they all seemed to hate any female friends of his and especially me, even though I'm a lesbian, dating, and see him as my brother. The girl he's currently dating seems an amazing person, really, she's the first girlfriend of his that I met, she's super cool and also into gaming, I've gifted her a few games so she could play with us on our gaming nights and everything went well, still, I have this nagging fear that she'll react badly.  And well, I could just not give him the switch, and you'll be right! But again, I want to have this experience with him again, I feel like it'd be nice playing a pokémon game we dreamed of when we were 12 years old actually being reality and I miss when we would sit together at my garden just showing off our new pokémons and battling. And no, I don't have the money for 2 nintendo switches.  TL;DR: Want to give my childhood best friend a nintendo switch so we can relive our childhood memories about pokémon, scared that this might be an asshole move to his girlfriend and my other best friend.	1642998418.0	sbd8y5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbd8y5/wibta_for_giving_a_nintendo_switch_to_my_friend/	WIBTA for giving a Nintendo Switch to my friend?
iynani8p	 I (15F) just turned 15 this Friday. I invited my friend (16F) and my girlfriend (16F) to my birthday weekend. My parents are homophobic af so the relationship stays on the down low. This might be relevant info but in been friends with let’s call her A since we’ve been kids.   For my party my parents rented some cabins by the beach for us to stay from Friday to Sunday. During the days I would spend time with both of them instead of my family. A would constantly be talking to her bf and she gets slightly pissed if you were to interrupt them since A’s bf barely cares a about her so she clings on the every moment they are together. I stayed in A’s cabin the whole weekend. Like I said my parents are homophobic so by staying at A’s cabin I could be more physically affectionate with my girlfriend like hugging her and shit. Nothing extreme since I’m still a little uncomfortable with most physical affection.   Saturday when by normally until night came around. When I went to A’s cabin she was talking to her bf so I decided not to interrupt so I sat down on the inflatable mattress on the floor next to my girlfriend. After some time I feel asleep. I woke up and A had gone to sleep and me and my girlfriend where still laying on the mattress. It was warm and stiff. It wasn’t comfortable. I asked my girlfriend why we were there and she told me that A went to sleep without telling us anything, so did her parents.  I keep texting A but she didn’t respond. I could see she was texting in group chats and things so she was clearly awake. Long story short we needed Sneak into the room to be able to do to sleep on an comfortable place.   Sunday morning rolled around and A kept ignoring us. Then randomly she texted me saying that she was uncomfortable with our displays of PDA and us ignoring her yesterday. She called us toxic and said that she would burn the gift I gave her. I was shocked and really mad, was shaking.  My girlfriend went to confront A. A’s mom budged in to the convo to tell me that we can change then for the cabins and to not fight since it’s gonna fuck up their weekend.    Me and my girlfriend left. I texted A to tell her that I’ve felt equally as uncomfortable when she and her bf were on a date cuddling and shit and I just had to sit in a corner totally ignored.   A’s been on a rampage trying to convince us that we are wrong, that I’ve never been uncomfortable with third wheeling and that she is the victim of our toxicity. She blocked me and taking me out of group chats   So am I the asshole	1642998388.0	sbd8ok	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbd8ok/aita_for_being_exited_to_see_my_girlfriend/	AITA for being exited to see my girlfriend?
8kqel0yd	Normally, I don't peace out with these friends, since I'm usually the one responsible for their transportation. This time my car broke down so I used the bus/train. They knew I wasn't really all that savvy to PT. We went to the mall and I really wasn't feeling it. They talked more with each other and didn't really seem to be interested in what I said. The vibe was off and I just felt disrespected. I usually dip out when the vibe gets off, which has led to some issues in the past. They got really worried when I decided to leave and I, in my infinite wisdom said "I had something going on at home." It turned into a way way bigger deal than I ever anticipated and they were freaked out. Now they're super worried about me, when it was supposed to be a vibe check peace out that turned into a way bigger thing than I expected.

iyl2lqcb	tw: mentions of disordered eating, body shaming and dysmorphia, slight mention of abuse and a lot of talk about weight/ appearance me(14f) and my best friend (13f) have been knowing each other for around 2 years. she's amazing, supportive, kind and understanding. she's been there whenever i needed her to be. both her and i have slight family issues regarding abuse so it was very easy for both of us to understand and relate to each other. around feb 2021, i really got obsessed with the with the idea of weight loss  and decided to lose a little amount myself, while later developed to a whole exercise addiction and an ed. my bsf was there throughout this whole thing for me. i was so grateful for her. i've been attempting recovery since nov 2021 (by myself, telling my parents about my problems only gave me the answer that i was making up all these problems and it was all in my head) and i feel a lot better now. about two weeks before my attempt at recovery, my best friend started showing really big signs of her developing an ed. i did everything i could do. anywhere i was, i was so darn scared for her. she did not think about herself this way before my whole thing and i felt so guilty and would frequently apologise for being the reason she was suffering so much. she always said she had brought it upon herself. i really want her to be okay. a few days ago she told me how she wasn't skipping any more meals and only having a bit of body image issues. i told her i was so proud of her. i was so happy she was getting better, i truly was. until yesterday, where she texted me, and i quote, "how did you reach (insert my lowest) bmi? did you like overexercise or skip meals or" that was so triggering. her mentioning how much she had lost and would lose more did trigger me in the past but i always convinced myself that she had helped me throughout and i should too. but reading that made me so scared. i knew it was bad, and i knew that if i answered her question i would only be starting a train of thoughts and would possibly pull me under again. i do not want to revisit those days ever again, the lowest point of my life. i texted her back saying '"wtf is wrong with you? do you not understand that while it may sound appealing to your ed those were the worst and lowest few weeks of my life, and i have never felt more terrible? i know your thoughts are uncontrollable but please atleast consider how i would feel reading that." she replied soon apologizing and how she should've considered my recovery before sending. i told her it was all fine. i've been thinking about putting a certain boundary for what i can help her with and what not now because whereas i do want to help her as much as i can, i do not want to risk my mental and physical health again. at the same time i feel like that would be really selfish of me because she had helped me out with everything and now me putting a certain boundary means that i would just be abandoning her after a certain point.

iymaml0a	My friends and I all had a week off after we finished our exams so we decided to go on a trip together. It's usually me, two other guys and three girls in our group. But this time we agreed to let this girl come with us cuz we kind of felt bad that she seemed to not have much of a life outside of school. We had hung out with her a few times before and didn't exactly vibe with her but we thought this would be a good opportunity to try and get her loose now that the semester was over.  So we're able to get adjoining rooms and we split up into the guys on one side and the girls on the other side. We visited each other freely throughout when we weren't out and pretty much only stayed in our own rooms when we were ready to go to sleep.   This happened last night and I type this from my room as we haven't left for home yet. Two nights ago we all watched this movie. It was a comedy and in one of the scenes this guy comes in and talks to the guest in his underwear with his dick sticking out under them. We all thought it was pretty absurd and funny.  So the next night I decided that I would recreate the scene. Our group has a weird dynamic so I thought we'd all get a kick out of it. My penis is nothing any of them haven't seen before, except for our plus one girl. So I pull the bit on my guys first and they find it funny. So I decide to go over to the girls and do it. Since I didn't know how the other girl would react I waited until she left the room to go grab something.  So with my penis sticking out of my underwear, I go over to the girls' room and recreate the scene. They loved it, they were cracking up. In the middle of me doing it, the other girl comes back, I thought I covered up before she got back in because I did it as soon as I heard the door. But apparently she saw it, and she absolutely freaked out.  Literally everyone was trying to tell her to be cool but she wasn't having it. I left the room and I got close to the wall hearing her literally screaming thinking everyone was in agreement that I was wrong. But everyone else thought it was funny. She was beyond pissed at me and saying that she should call the police.  This is all over a joke that I was trying to make sure she wasn't a part of in the first place. But now she's mad at me cuz she doesn't feel the same as everyone else. AITA?	1642999420.0	sbdk2t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbdk2t/aita_for_making_a_joke/	AITA for making a joke?
1zkphero	My aunt(f49) asked me back in December if I (f21) could watch her son’s (m21) dog. Tina, his dog, is a very sweet adult dog that has a few behavioral issues. She very scared of strangers (very loud barking, growling) and has pretty bad resource guarding. I did not know this when I agreed. I have a 5 month old puppy, and I’d seen them play well together so I agreed. I’m in college, and I knew that it was going to be a tough week, but I also knew that I was going to have a lot of help from my boyfriend and my best friend to help me deal with two dogs. My aunt also assured me that if I needed help, her neighbor would come and help me out. My aunt left the country on Friday morning.  My best friend got sick and wasn’t able to come. My boyfriend forgot about our agreement and went out of town with his friends. This left me all alone with two dogs. I didn’t know how different my puppy was going to act in a new environment. He completely regressed. He has never had issues with his crate, but all of the sudden it became an issue with him. Same with separation anxiety, I couldn’t even leave a room. Diarrhea as well. A new home with another dog was too big of a change in his routine for such a young pup. It also didn’t help that Tina kept growling and barking when he got too close to her crate if she had a bone. I had a lot of homework over the weekend, I wasn’t able to get any done because I was so busy with the dogs. Not crated= nonstop play, crated=nonstop whining. I had a small mental breakdown, putting it lightly. I called my aunt and I told her I was having a really rough time. She told me not to worry, that her neighbor would come and take care of the dog and I could go home. I waited for the neighbor, but Tina wouldn’t go with her, she wouldn’t stop barking and growling. The neighbor and I ended up coming up with an agreement: I watch her in the mornings (pup now at home) and she comes in the afternoon (Tina is warming up to her slowly) and stays with her until she falls asleep, like 11 pm or so. Thankfully my classes have the option to attend remotely. However, Tina does have to seep by herself, from 11pm-9am she is alone. We did this today, and when my aunt found out she had slept by herself she freaked out. She was very upset and said some mean things, and how dare I leave her dog alone.   I agree I bit off more than I could chew, but I honestly did not foresee that I would end up having to care for 2 untrained dogs by myself, I was relying on my friends. I also didn’t know that my puppy would react so poorly to the change. Even now, I am trying my absolute best, but I still feel really bad about not being able to be there for Tina overnight.

9z3ifm33	So 3 months ago my partner had a stroke, so he is considered partially disabled. This is relevant to the story. So my partner atm is quiet vulnerable mentally, and recent events made is so that our house is unliveable.  Now to the story, due to the events that occurred to make my house unliveable, my MIL, his mother had blocked me from communicating with her, i cant text her, call her or contact her on messenger, my partner can. My sister has offered temporary housing to me my kids and my partner (this matters) my partner doesn't want to live with my sister. Why i think my MIL is being conniving is because she has offered her spare room to him alone, her house is 2 bedrooms.  He house is 2 hours away by train (my only mode of transport) from my sister. My partner cannot travel alone, she would have to come with him, so if he moves in with her for the months it would take for our house to be liveable she will never give us the chance to be alone as a family.

i08hky2l	My friend has health issues so when she got pregnant she had to have an emergency c-section. She often gets upset when she see posts of people invalidating c-section births, as do I because I believe that all births are valid. I always stick up for her when it comes to this topic and always assure her that she had to make a difficult choice for the benefit of her and her baby.   A few days ago she shared to me that her sister in law who is full term, but is having an elective c-section was being “stupid” because she could give birth vaginally. This is her SIL’s second pregnancy. SIL made the choice because she’s scared to give birth vaginally again. She elaborated that her SIL is close to her due date and the doctor she sees is allowing an elective c-sec and how she doesn’t understand why she wouldn’t just wait for her baby to come naturally.  Now I understand completely why my friend feels the way she does, but I also felt like she was projecting her own birth trauma onto her SIL, making her feel bad for making this choice. I haven’t had a c-sec so I don’t know how it feels but I have had vaginal births and they were very traumatic births. So I also understand SIL’s decision.  I explained to her that child birth is extremely painful and gets worse with each pregnancy. How she never felt Braxton Hicks or any of the labor pains so she simply doesn’t understand. She got really defensive and kept referring to how she and her baby could have died without a c-sec and if she had a choice she would have given birth vaginally. I told her that she is free to have an opinion, but there wasn’t a need to make the SIL feel bad about it, because she’d be no better then the people who invalidate her birthing experience.   It got to point where I got super annoyed because she kept harping on it. I ended up telling her to shut up because she doesn’t know how painful full term vaginal child birth feels like. She got extremely upset and hasn’t talked to me in the past few days. Today a mutual friend reached out to me to tell me I was wrong for saying that to her.   So, am I the asshole?   TLDR; My friend thinks her SIL having an elective c-sections is “stupid” because she had to have an emergency c-section getting her choice to a vaginal delivery taken away. I tried to talk to her to make her see the other side of it, but she didn’t care to hear about it. We ended up having a passionate conversation on the topic ultimately leading to me blurting out “shut up.”	1643000375.0	sbdu7z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbdu7z/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_shut_up_because_she/	AITA for telling my friend to shut up because she thinks elective c-secs are “stupid”
dq8ovhwj	I’m almost 40 with 3 kids on my 2nd marriage, my brother 5 years younger is single with no kids. Our Dad died 5 years ago. In our family the girls have always been expected to be the caretakers. I’ve spent my life giving up opportunities because my family needed me. I often feel I’ve been taken advantage of since my brother is rarely called upon to offer any real help.  My husband lives 3 hrs away from my family home. I’m still living with my Mom part time due to my career and to help her with the family business. The time I spend away from my husband has been hard on my marriage.  My Dad loved my brothers dogs so much that he begged for “a” puppy. There were 2pups born and my sick father fell in love with both and We’ve all been really attached to those 2. When my brothers dogs accidentally bred again, that fall we ended up with 2 more that I begged my mom to get rid of. We are all animal lovers but my mom can be really eccentric. She wouldn’t allow just anyone to take these pups.I think it should’ve been my brothers responsibility to find homes for HIS dogs’ puppies anyway.  My Mom ended up keeping them. Now we have 4 grown siblings, 2 old dogs, my 2 dogs and we keep my brothers 2 dogs when he works 24hr. Shifts. We can have up to 10 small dogs in the house.  The younger set of pups are ill mannered and just a general nuisance on any normal day.   Wednesday my Mom fell and broke her hip. I was at home 3 hrs away and I rushed to be with my mom.  We’ve been trying to make a plan for how to care for her when she gets out of the hospital. I wanted her to go to a rehab because I didn’t feel like her house was suitable to be in her condition, but insurance wouldn’t cover it. She comes home tomorrow. I tried to arrange with my brother to take the younger set of pups to his place. He was willing to take them but made it clear he expected me to continue watching all the dogs while he’s at work.  My brother told my mom I asked him to take the pups and was adamant that she didn’t want her dogs taken out of her house. I’m the one that has to take care of her and 10 dogs and 3 kids since I’m now here full time to take care of her. My sacrifice, not his!  My husband drove here today to help me get her room ready and it was nasty! I’ve never seen so much dog hair in one place! And feces and urine! My Mom has been in poor health for years and hasn’t been able to take keep house the way she used to. I’m sure it’s harder now with 10 dogs in the house. My husband and I were both appalled by how bad it was.  When I told my Mom if she let the dogs knock her down she would take care of herself, Her response was to send my brother to the house to fence an area off in the house to keep the pups away from her. The house now looks like a maze with gates everywhere. I’m so disgusted I just want to throw my hands up and go home.   I feel like she’s choosing thedogs over her health and my brother is enabling her.

I had this weekend with my parents and all was well. well, supposedly they were sick. i had no clue, as i had thought they had recovered (heard nothing of the sickness the whole week and the weekend) and thought all was fine and normal.   Tonight i come downstairs and my father yells at me for apparently ignoring him and my mother the whole weekend while they were sick because i was “too busy playing games” (I’m a student and have rare time to do this during the week) and that i was being egotistical, lazy, and selfish.   i keep thinking about this subject and i feel like i was bot in the wrong here. they seemed fine and did normal weekend things. so i paid no mind. but i guess I’m an asshole for “ignoring” my parents and not offering to help them. uhm, hello? if you need help you can text me or call me and i’d be happy to help you. not one thing came through. how was i supposed to know?!

4bf9qwa9	[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/rgwrle/aita_for_trivialising_assistance_dogs/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)  I've had a few DM's asking for updates etc so just putting it here.  My wee cousin *adores* "Bambi II" the plushy Assistance Dog, and she is already being super helpful.  The most adorable part is, wee cousin makes sure that the plushy has "off duty" time and gets to play etc, and only wears the Assistance Dog jacket for going to school or into shops etc (mimicking how I am with my live Assistance Dog)  But, it is working, thanks to the plushy, there have been fewer meltdowns and much better communication and coping at home and at school. It hasn't been a miracle cure - obviously - but my wee cousin is better able to cope and manage their emotions and communicate what is distressing them so problems can be solved *before* they escalate to unbearable levels.  I'm still firmly in the belief that a live dog is not the right option for wee cousin at the moment as their household isn't capable of the daily care/exercise/maintenance training of a dog due to schedules/disability/other stuff with the adults - and I don't think wee cousin is actually emotionally capable of dealing with the reality of a live dog that isn't always going to be in the mood for their energy/volume 🤣  But this has worked out to be the right gift for their age, situation and needs and I feel a lot more secure that it doesn't "take away" from the legitimacy of live Assistance Dog teams like my own girl or the many others out there like us.

3cr1bdvc	My roommates rearranged our dorm room for the semester and they were adamant that they had to do it before classes start (tomorrow). I said it's fine as long as my bed was against a wall since that's how I feel comfortable. I assumed it was a valid request since another roommate requested that she definitely couldn't sleep on a top bunk because it also made her uncomfortable.   Since I live about an hour away from school I'm thinking about doing 1/2 week there and the other home. I gave them permission to move my bed and desk but when they sent me the video of the room my request wasn't made. The only reason they were moving the room around was to make one roommate's desk accessible but they rearranged EVERYTHING.  At this point I'm at a lost since they tend to gang up on me if I don't agree with them. I think I should take my fridge and microwave back and leave them to figure it out.	1643003160.0	sbep1e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbep1e/wibta_for_taking_my_fridge_and_microwave_that_i/	WIBTA for taking my fridge and microwave that i paid for out of our shared dorm room?

I gave a good online friend of mine, I've known them for a couple of years and were fairly close, about $200 CAD for their upcoming wedding that was set up happen in December.   However a few days before their wedding, everything was cancelled and the couple broke up.  I did ask my friend about what happened but they didn't share any details of what happened, and given it was a definitely a sore subject I didn't pry. They mentioned themselves about giving the money I gave them back when it first ended and I said no worries and to get it back when they can. Though they did say they spent my portion of gift money of a plane ticket to go to their fiance and have their wedding (they were a long distance couple and having a small wedding with him) and the flight company doesn't give refunds, only a ticket for another flight worth $200.  It's almost February and I've only asked about a money update once before this and I feel really bad about mentioning it since it was probably a really bad memory for them but at the same time I'd like to know..

iypitunf	I (f16) live with my mom most of the time because my dad, (step)mom, and half siblings moved 2 hours away a few months ago and I didn't wanna leave my friends. I honestly like him, my mom, and half siblings on that side better than my bio mom, her husband, and their kid (8) and kinda regret staying here.  My half sister wanted a cat and her dad got her one. I made it very clear from the first day that I didn't want a cat and that I would not help with it or do anything for it.  This cat is a demon. He sneaks into my room and shits in my hamper all the damn time. He has also peed on my rug so many times that I had to throw it out. I've always been annoyed at this and reminded bio mom and her husband to close my door when they leave my room but they always forget. The one thing that I can't stand is that this fucker eats my lunch but nobody has the decency to tell me until I've been looking for it for a few minutes and don't have time to make a new one. Then nobody gives me lunch money because I should've gotten up earlier so I would've had time to make a new one. This is especially bad on the days that I have dance rehearsals for my school play because I don't eat breakfast, don't have lunch, then do pe for an hour then dance for 3 hours straight before eating for the first time that day. Those days are hell.  I finally snapped the other day because it was a dance rehearsal day and it already ate my lunch, then I came home to find a pile of shit in my clean laundry, another pile of shit on my comforter, and my pillows torn up. My room smelled so bad because it had been left there all day even tho my bio mom doesn't work and could've cleaned it up. I told her that she had one week to get rid of that fucker or I'm moving in with my dad. I'm staying at my grandparents' house and have barely spoken to them since.  I told my dad about this and he was pissed and he and my mom have been arguing with my bio mom and she's been coming to my grandparents' house to tell me that I'm putting her in a really tough position and that my half sister has already bonded with that hellspawn (not what she called him) and it would break her heart to get rid of him but my dad's child support helps a lot and she and her husband can't afford to live in this apartment and pay child support to my dad. I told her that's not my problem.  I feel really bad because I know my half sister will be upset but I just can't deal with that thing anymore so AITA?	1643003534.0	sbet69	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbet69/aita_for_threatening_to_move_in_with_my_dad_if_my/	AITA for threatening to move in with my dad if my mom doesn't get rid of my sister's cat?
iypg6nc2	I (30f) was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. It was difficult to process, especially for my parents, as we come from a country where mental health is heavily stigmatised. I've struggled throughout my life with my sense of worth, but with my therapist and medication, I've done pretty well for myself. In my spare time, I volunteer at an organisation that assists children with ADHD. I've seen the struggles associated with it, & am a strong advocate for spreading awareness about it so others don't need to suffer as I had.   A childhood friend of mine, Val (27f) was recently diagnosed with ADHD by her therapist. It came up during a gathering recently, & I can't remember how/ why it was brought up, but she said that it was such a relief to know that there was a reason for her struggles. I'm not one for doubting a diagnosis provided by a trained therapist, but I was curious as to why she wanted to get assessed in the first place.  She gave her reasons, & I asked if she & her therapist had thought of alternative explanations for her behaviour (e.g., inability to focus as maybe having too much coffee or being tired). I also brought up that perhaps she had accidentally reinforced those behaviours as a child, and they were now manifesting as adult ADHD. She asked what was my point. I told her that it was strange that she would be assessed now, after so long, when she had never complained about stuff like this before.   She said that not every suffering was meant for public consumption & I felt that was unnecessarily rude. I told her that she could always ask me for help since I had a lot of experience with managing ADHD, but she just shrugged. I was a bit annoyed, & told her that managing ADHD without support was tough, so she shouldn't be so flippant about help that was being offered, especially if she wanted to let her employers know.

aero3ky1	 I've never said anything, as I am an only child, and I don't really know how a normal silbling relationship goes, so I don't want to cause a fight over something that is normal, but here is the situation: My boyfriend is 19 and his sister is around 16-17 years old. I've always known that they are very close, which never bothered me, I was happy to see that they got each other, as their parents and other siblings are not the best. However, a few months ago I heard him calling her by a nickname that we used to have at the beginning of our relationship, it's not a romantic nickname like honey, or sweetie, it's just something that relates to our previous friendship, and he calls her by that with a baby voice. It bothered me because I felt weird about him calling me the same way as his sister, but I thought that I was probably over reacting so I never said anything. Another thing is that in our relationship we sometimes use a baby voice when talking to each other, or we pout when one of us talks in a colder tone than usual, and I loved that because I loved the hugs and sweet words that came after a pout, however, I recently heard during a call with him that he acts the same way with his Sister, she comes, makes a pout and talk in baby voice and he comforts her the same as he would with me, just without the kisses... I've heard them use this baby voice EVERY TIME that I have heard them talking to each other, and it makes me so so soooo uncomfortable, knowing that he treats his Sister the same way he treates me... He calles her his Princess, and is all overprotective with her, and that alone wouldn't bother me as much, but knowing how they treat each other makes it so much worse for me. I don't want to say anything before making sure that this indeed is weird, so please call me out if I am wrong for being uncomfortable with this. Am I the asshole?	1643004062.0	sbeypi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbeypi/aita_for_hating_that_my_boyfriend_and_his_sister/	AITA for hating that my boyfriend and his sister use baby talk?
3df7i6qj	Okay a bit of context I (21f) am a professional makeup artist and my cousin 26m and his fiancée 26f are getting married in 7 months. My cousin and I are super close and so are his fiancée and I, I genuinely normally love the woman and we’re great friends and when she asked me to be a bridesmaid I was honoured and thrilled and I of course agreed (please note I am not the maid of honour just a regular bridesmaid) she also asked me to do her makeup and I agreed to do it for free as a wedding present. The wedding got delayed twice due to covid and is now happening in about 7 months. We have a group chat of all the bridesmaids and they text A LOT And I sometimes feel out of place, these girls have all been friends for years and I’m the newbie. The issue really arises with the fact that I am working a lot at the moment as it’s school holidays and I work in a tourist town so I don’t have the time to respond to every inside joke they text the group chat (seriously they can send over 50 messages in less than an hour) now the fiancée is texting me privately saying that I need to contribute more to conversations and that she “needs all her bridesmaids opinions for every decision she makes” when I told her that I’m trying to respond as much as possible but I do work 6 days a week and between 8-12 hours a day and don’t always have time she told me that I need to prioritise text the group chat and that she “doesn’t think I understand that being a bridesmaid isn’t just about the day” even though I am well aware. She is now texting me that she would “fully understand if I wanted to drop out of being a bridesmaid if I can’t cope with the pressure and it kinda feels like she wants me to quit so she doesn’t have it on her conscience that she decided she didn’t want me as a bridesmaid. I don’t think that I’m in the wrong for prioritising my work over text messages but she’s also making me feel like the bad guy  So aita?	1643004626.0	sbf4q3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbf4q3/aita_for_not_replying_to_my_bridesmaid_group_chat/	AITA for not replying to my bridesmaid group chat
c2gqk2mz	My daughter (9) and best friend (also 9) are in competitive sports together, have been in school together and have had many play dates at both my home and best friends home.  Generally they get along well.  I recently found out best friend’s mother lied to me about staying over night in a hotel after a school field trip.  The mom mentioned to me months ago that we should stay in a hotel together after an out of town class field trip and continue to tour the city the following day.  I didn’t agree to go at the time, but also didn’t decline the offer.  To be honest, I probably wouldn’t have gone anyways.  Fast forward to the week of the field trip and mom had been acting distant towards me for a few weeks but I’m not super close with her so i just brushed it off.  I felt like I should at least ask mom If she would like to make the 3 hour drive to field trip destination together.  Mom said that she wasn’t sure since she had to drop best friend off at her dads house after the field trip.  The morning of the field trip, when we were dropping our children off at the school, I overheard Mom ask another friend if she needed to get anything from her car before they left and drove to the field trip.  It was obvious that best friend’s mom lied to me and was riding with another mom.  At this point, I realized this mom was likely an undercover mean girl - or she is extremely codependent and didn’t want to hurt my feelings by telling me she already made plans with another mom. Both of these things are equally annoying because, well, we are adults.  Meanwhile, my 9 year old keeps asking why her friend couldn’t ride home from the field trip with us or why her friend couldn’t meet us for dinner after the field trip.  I just went with the original story that the mom told me since I’m not about to pull my daughter into petty drama that could affect her friendship. The following week, my daughter comes home and tells me that her best friend was bragging to her about staying in a hotel with another friend after the field trip. Later that day, I see mom at sports practice.  I had planned to say nothing but mom brings it up.  She asks me if we stayed over night.  I told her no.  She then said she didn’t either, blah, blah, blah.  I told her what my daughter had told me and she got all weird and said she didn’t want my daughter thinking that since it’s not true.  Apparently it was only then that she realized that this was actually more hurtful to my daughter than anyone.  Luckily my daughter wasn’t super upset about this or I would have probably ripped mom a new one. But now, my daughter has been asking to have best friend over but I don’t want to interact with mom and now question how mom’s lack of integrity may trickle down to her daughter - which will directly impact my daughter.  So… AITA for not letting my child play with her best friend after her mom lied to me?	1643004499.0	sbf3ak	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbf3ak/aita_for_not_wanting_my_daughter_to_play_with_her/	AITA for not wanting my daughter to play with her friend after friend’s mom lied to me?
bnwvg4fa	Hard to make the title accurate but a friend (18F) of mine (18F) had another mutual friend (18M) of ours do something truly awful to her. Exactly what he did isn’t too pertinent but he said a lot of horrible and hurtful things to her. Long story short I made a private story on snapchat with only him and my friend in it when I was hanging out with her the day after it happened. I posted a picture of the two of us and said something along the lines of friends show up, not hurt eachother (it was a few days ago I don’t remember my exact wording). Anyway today I get a message from his mother (which seems ridiculous he’s an adult he shouldn’t need his mom to handle things for him) telling me how horrible of a person I was to target him and call him out directly and make him feel like shit. I assured her that as I understood the story getting out could tarnish his name (very small town word gets around fast and I didn’t feel it would be fair to spread stuff about him for this one incident that was a very shitty thing to do but not end of the world), I only posted in a space where only he would see it. I honestly don’t see too big of an issue with this because it’s not as if I did a mass post calling him out or even said anything that hurtful, hell i didn’t mention his name in the post only he could see, but she is insistent that I am an awful person and has threatened to contact my place of work to tell them I have been “harassing her son”. Anyway I kind of just need confirmation here that i’m not being crazy here.	1643005049.0	sbf93a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbf93a/aita_for_making_a_snapchat_story_about_a_touchy/	AITA for making a snapchat story about a touchy situation?
9355mi77	I (F19) realized I was attracted to the same gender around two years ago. It took months for me to come to terms with it, and almost another year for me to come out to my mom. I’m out to literally everyone on my socials, friends, family, everyone. Except my dad (M57). My dad has been homophobic my entire life. Never in a way that I believe I would be in danger, but he has made it clear that he will never support the community. I have a great relationship with my dad, as he is one of my best friends. I always go to him for advice, and he’s a great parental figure. I firmly believe that coming out to him would damage our relationship beyond repair. I don’t think he would disown or hurt me, but our relationship would definitely never be the same. When I came out to my mom, she said the longer I waited to tell my dad, the more hurt he would be. I want to tell him, I really do, but I can’t justify hurting him to be confident in my identity. If I tell him, I’m hurting him. If I don’t tell him, I’m afraid he will find out some other way and be even more hurt that I didn’t tell him. So, AITA for not coming out to my dad?	1643005157.0	sbfa7k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfa7k/aita_for_not_coming_out_to_my_dad/	AITA for not coming out to my dad?
ixp97z24	So, this happened a few years ago but recently I was telling a few of my coworkers about it and they said me and my friends were aholes for kicking a guy out of our friend group over this.      Some background info about the guy we kicked out, who I will refer to as “Chad.” He was honestly a douchebag and i‘m amazed we hadn’t kicked him out sooner. Several examples of his douchebagery are him pulling the “I forgot my wallet” card when we’d go out to eat, after he ordered something very expensive and rarely paying us back. Chad bailed on us last minute once  to get laid when we had plans to see Jurassic World when it released and then proceeded to get mad at us when we all went without him. He also has ZERO respect for women, and views them as sex objects.  So, now for the actual story. Christmas 2017 we all decided to do a secret Santa thing between the six of us. We set a date for the party three weeks later, so we had plenty of time to buy something, and we set a $25 minimum on gifts, which we all unanimously agreed to. The day of the party comes, we’re having fun playing video games, watching movies, good party food, etc. We get to the gift exchange and “lucky” me, Chad had drawn my name. He proceeds to hand me a wrapped box about the size of a standard moving box. I was actually surprised by the size of the gift initially until I lifted it and felt how light it was. I opened the box and, oh joy, there’s a smaller box inside. You probably all know where this is going. Well, six boxes later, I find a $10 gift card for Starbucks in the last box. I don’t like coffee of any kind and he knew that. I proceed to look at him and he’s got this stupid grin on his face that just screams “did you like my prank bro?” Before I can even say anything, another guy in the group perks up and asks, “is that really all you got him? It doesn't even meet the limit we set!” To which he says, still with the dumb grin, “yes it does, with the boxes that all cost me $30.” I’ll spare you the next several minutes of arguing but it culminated in us all agreeing that we were sick of his attitude to the people he was supposedly “friends” with and the this was the final nail in the coffin. The friend hosting the party threw is jacket at him and told him to get out of his apartment. A few more minutes of arguing later he finally left and the five of us spent the remainder of the night venting about how we let this guy hang out with us for so many years.  So, now that you know the full story as well as some background info about Chad, was I the ahole for siding with my friends and cutting all contact with this guy?	1643005497.0	sbfdw3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfdw3/aita_for_siding_with_my_friends_in_kicking_a_guy/	AITA for siding with my friends in kicking a guy out of our friend group?
drxzfe6k	So for context, I was fostered by my sisters friends mom when I turned 18. Due to unfortunate circumstances my bio family was very abusive. When I told her I was engaged and I wanted my foster brother to walk me down the isle, she became very upset and stopped talking to me up until the wedding day. She showed up in a suit like she was going for dinner and told her family to do the same. Now it’s been a couple of years since then and she only wants to be apart of my kids lives when it looks good for her. The reason I’m asking this is because she’s never apologized or even acknowledged what she did. Knowing my actual mother passed 3 years prior and she was my only mother figure and she chose to distance herself only hurt more.	1643005600.0	sbfews	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfews/aita_for_being_resentful_and_annoyed_that_my/	AITA for being resentful and annoyed that my foster mother chose to ignore me during my whole wedding planning but says she loves me like her own?
gjjgmxh1	So lately my (F24) boyfriend (M24) of almost 10 years has been joining discord servers for random topics that he likes. He’s made quite a few online friends this way which is good for him considering a lot of his friends have now moved away or grown apart from him. But the more servers he joins and the more friends he makes means the more time he is spending on his phone replying to their messages. This has become an increasing problem to me. We live in separate places but still see each other every day for at least 3 hours or more, so his logic is that the amount of time we spend with each other should be enough to keep a girlfriend happy. But in my eyes, even with the amount of time we spend together, only a fraction of it I feel is genuinely spent “together”. To put it another way - I feel like he is equating quantity of time with quality time. Yes, we see each other for hours every day, but I feel like I only have a fraction of his attention in those hours because he’s constantly online chatting. It’s gotten to be such a problem in my eyes that I asked he turns off his notifications for Valentine’s Day. He was quick to agree, but responded with “I can get off at any time” (to me- sounded like an addict who thinks they aren’t an addict which I feel like is another sub aita question in itself).

hynkoa8q	I and my fiancé live in a 2 bedroom home. One of my fiancé's friends, "Richard", asked us several times to let him move in. Richard and my fiancé have been friends for many years, 20+. I don't usually have a problem with him, but he has a few habits that I didn't really think would mesh well with us. Richard is a massive gamer and if Richard really wants to play a multiple player game, he can get verbally abusive. For example, if my fiancé isn't feeling video games but Richard wants to play, he has called my fiancé an AH and will push until he gets his way. Richard also talks a lot. He talks so fast and so much that it's hard to participate in the convo or get a word in edge wise. These are the major points that made me hesitant to let him move in. This is where I might be the AH as, when my fiancé first asked how I felt about Richard moving in, I said that while I don't mind him, I thought that Richard might monopolize my fiancé's time and that I would quickly come to dislike him if I had to put up with constantly being talked over. My fiancé also agreed. So, we put him off for a while. I should also note that Richard was NOT in desperate need of a place to stay. Richard at this time was living with his sister. Richard, however, would tell my fiancé that he NEEDED to get out of his sister's place because she was crazy and a b*tch. He also complained about his young niece. My fiancé and I listed the room but didn't get any bites. So, we agreed that we would give Richard a trial period so we'd be able to see if he meshed with our lifestyle as well as give Richard a break from his sister. Richard also has another sister that he maybe could’ve moved in with and later told us that other friends had offered to let him stay with them.My fiancé called Richard to let him know and he IMMEDIATELY started tearing a strip off my fiancé. Telling him that he was an AH and how dare we treat him like this and called me a manipulative b*tch. He said he couldn't believe that my fiancé would "throw away a 20 year relationship for SOME GIRL". Richard told my fiancé that he'd told other people how we were treating him they all felt that my fiancé and I were AHs. I know my reasons for not wanting to live with him are petty, but I also feel that these would have affected my ability to get along with him and affect my fiancé. Since Richard went off on us, we've heard from a mutual friend, who has known both my fiancé and Richard for many years, that Richard will sh*t talk us to her and to anyone who will listen that we treated him like crap. He was doing this even a couple months after the incident originally happened. My fiancé and I feel, as well as other friends who don't know Richard, as though we've dodged a bullet. I feel bad that my fiancé has lost a long term friend, but it's tempered by the fact that Richard felt that he was worth more to my fiancé than I do as well as that Richard felt that I didn't get a say in who lived with us.	1643006097.0	sbfk7l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbfk7l/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancés_friend_to_live/	AITA for not wanting my fiancé's friend to live with us?
8kkxw6he	I’m getting married soon, & am looking for hair/makeup for the big day. A friend of a friend said she knew someone, so she sends me the stylist’s number andI text  her to ask if she’s free for a trial. She says she’s actually free the next day for me to come in. I’ve never done a hair/makeup trial before, but my married friends had paid like max $60, if anything at all, so I stupidly thought I wouldn’t be paying much.  WhenI get there, she tells me she’s going to do my makeup too. I didn’t know she even did makeup, but hey, that’s great! So I show her some pics, she gets going, and…it’s awful. Like, bottom mascara on only one eye & crooked eyeliner (she put liquid eyeliner in my waterline too?). BUT the hair was fine & she was perfectly nice, so hey, doesn’t matter if she’s not good at makeup, at least we maybe have some hair!  I ask if I owe her anything, & she says she’ll calculate it. Here I get kinda concerned, because I thought it would be a standard trial fee, but like I said, I’ve never done this before and I didn’t get to do any research given the quick turnaround time.   She says I owe her “70.” That sounds like what my friends have paid for trials, so I say “70? Great!” I give her my card for her to swipe in her phone, & go to add tip as she hands it back to sign. When I click 20%, I notice it says I’m adding…$140?? I ask if it’s $70 or $700, & she now says “700.” Darn, I must’ve misheard, or she misspoke when she said 70. Well, either way, it’s on me for not asking, so I kind of dazedly sign away a whole paycheck, thank her, & leave. Did I mention I hate confrontation & have a terrible urge to please everyone I meet?!  I’m beating myself up for not asking the price before going, and am just stunned at how expensive it was. So I Google the rates for hair/makeup trials in my city.  $50-150.  Okay, I think, she must’ve made a mistake and accidentally added a zero.  My fiancé sees how upset I look when I get home, especially since I’m not loving the look, and is like whoa, this must be a mistake. He offers to stay with me while I call her from my phone for moral support. Like I said, confrontation is hard for me. I call, and ask if she’s sure it was $700 and not $70, and if she has an itemized receipt. She says she can send me the receipt, but that it is $700. She texts me the receipt but it’s just the total: $840 with tip. Here’s where shit gets worse. My fiancé jumps in, asking what she’s charging $700 for. And she says “my services.” He counters there’s no way it’s $700, and that as a lawyer he’s not going to just pay that much money without knowing why. She flips, saying “talk to your fiancée,” that he’s “harassing” her, & finally hangs up on him.  My fiancé says she’s scamming me because she knows I’m people-pleasing & don’t want to cause a scene. He says we need to dispute the charge with the credit card company ASAP, but I’m so afraid I’m actually the bitch here, especially because I did like her as a person.

iltnximl	I know that the title paints me as the total AH, but please hear me out. My (47f) daughter Sara (18f) is a very smart girl. She has a 4.0 GPA, she's valedictorian of her class, and she's just gotten word from her dream college that she has received a full ride scholarship. We have a college fund for her of about 250,000. When we found out about the scholarship, we agreed that we would still give her the money to pay for other things that she would need in college, such as housing, food, etc. Well she came home yesterday kind of sad. I asked her what was the matter. She said that she was not going to go to college anymore. Apparently, her boyfriend Bryan (19m) told her not to go anymore. Some background on Bryan, his family is VERY well off, and his parents have never issued discipline on this child. I mean, he is very rude and disrespectful, and although he seems sweet to my daughter when they are alone, she'll complain that whenever they're out with friends, Bryan is constantly putting her down and comparing her to Instagram models. Bryan is currently enrolled in college, but he has no set course for his future. He's just "rolling with the cards" as Sara says. Some other background info is that my daughter is going to school for marine biology. Well, with what my daughter told me about their conversation, She was telling Bryan about her full ride scholarship, and how excited she was to finally go to school for marine biology (he's never supported her dream of being a marine biologist and has always told her to go to college for a "REAL" job) when he sat her down and told her to not go to college at all. He told her to wait for him here in our town, and don't worry about getting a job even, because his parents will support her, and that he didn't feel comfortable with her going to college out of state and so far away. He also said that it made him feel unmanly when she has a set course for her future which will give her a good life, while he has none. After she told me what was going on, I didn't make a decision right away, but I knew that I wasn't going to just let my daughter throw away her future like this. She then asked me for her college fund so she could help support Bryan's dreams(?) So I took time to think, and I sat her down today. I told her that she can not have her college fund to spend on Bryan. She started freaking out asking why and it was her money, and I asked her to listen. I asked her if she actually could see a serious future with Bryan in it. She said nothing the first time, and then started crying. I asked her again more gently this time, and she admitted no while still crying. I pleaded with her to please not throw away her future for someone who she can't see herself having a life with. She then nodded and went up to her room for some time to think. From what I've learned, she broke it off with Bryan and he has been calling nom stop, crying and begging to speak to her. I feel very guilty, and sort of like an AH.

dhnd7lue	 My (26F) friend (29F) always go to the same bar on Sundays after work. My friend, we'll call her Anna, is the type of person that always has to be right, I usually just brush it off because its too much energy to argue about it. I should also note that Anna does not have a licence so I always drive and she relies on me to book her Ubers because she doesn't trust banks and only keeps enough money in her account to pay her rent. We are both servers so todays dumb bar topic was about how we each prefer to set up our aprons. I keep my book in the left pocket, my phone in the middle pocket, and my pens in the right pocket because I am right handed, its easier to grab my book with my left hand and my pens with my right. Anna says thats dumb and that set up would only make sense if I was left handed then starts yelling to the bartender Im left handed and making jokes about it. Idk why this bothered me as much as it did tonight but I asked her to stop because it is dumb and really shouldn't matter because it's simply how I perfer to set up my apron. I should note that Anna also thinks its so funny to give people wet willys when they don't agree with her which I think is  absolutly disgusting and have told her on multiple occasions to stop and how I feel about it. I watched Anna suck her finger  and reach for my head so I put my hand up over my ear and told her if she stuck it in my ear I was leaving the bar. She got angry with me and started yelling that I can leave because Uber is a thing and how dare I assume she was going to give me a wet willy.  I was a bit dumbfounded with how mad she became and told her I don't like it when she sticks her fingers in my ear and I've asked her to stop many times before. With my hand still over my ear Anna made a fist and got louder saying things like "Do it, I dare you to hit me" and "Way are you being so f\*\*king defensive all of a sudden" I at no point threatend to hit her all I said was that I would leave even though I drove her to the bar. Other bar guests started staring at us as she was yelling so she grabed her phone and walked out of the bar. I think she's going to cool off but then a mutual friend came in asking me what I did to Anna to make her sob out front.  I walked out to check on her and see her crying on the phone to someone saying I am a horrible friend and how could I be so mean to her. It broke my heart to hear her say that about me because I have always bent over backwards for her.  So i collected my things, paid my half of the tab, cried in my car and went home. About 30 minutes after leaving mutual friend and the bartender texted me saying I shouldn't have reacted the way I did because a wet willy "never killed anyone"and I need to apoligize to her because I upset her. I feel kinda shitty for leaving her there but I'm not sure I'm entirely in the wrong for acting the way I did, AITA?	1643007948.0	sbg2p3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbg2p3/aita_for_not_apologizing_after_yelling_at_my/	AITA for not apologizing after yelling at my friend for attempting to give me a wet willy?

He used to ask us (the family) how we were feeling every single day and tell us that we shouldn't be sad 'cause he wanted us to be okay no matter what. He would spend so much of his time playing, taking care of and looking out for the sick kids while he was in the hospital. Everyone adored him. He was the sweetest, nicest, purest, smartest, bravest and most selfless person I've ever known. He was gay (out of the closet since he was 13) and had a longtime boyfriend since the age of 14. He was also a Wiccan.   Recently, I posted some pics of my beloved brother on my social media accounts calling him an angel among other similar things. Some relatives (conservatice Christians) decided to DM me and inform me that I shouldn't call him that because "you know he was gay so he can't possibly be in Heaven and thus not an angel either". To say that I got angry after hearing this is an understatement. I personally called each and every one of these relatives and told them that they're just some POS with archaic beliefs who lack any sort of empathy. Blocked them everywhere and cut off all contact. If only people like them go to Heaven then who the fuck even wants to go there.   My parents called me after that saying that they think I've overreacted, that those are their personal beliefs and I should respect them even though I might not agree with them, that my approach was immature and childish, etc. But why though, isn't there a saying "no tolerance for intolerance"?	1643009619.0	sbgige	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbgige/aita_for_telling_my_31m_relatives_that_theyre/	AITA for telling my (31M) relatives that they're just some POS with archaic beliefs who lack any sort of empathy?
ipobcs6b	I (22F) and my bf (24M) live together in a one bedroom flat (we share the rent and bill 50/50). We both work and finish late. Tuesday he announces me that he invited his friend to come for dinner and to sleep over for the night. Though he just announce it telling me that his friend is not available at another time so there is no discussion to be. We argued and I told him that for me it is a lack of respect that he invites people over without checking with me first when we live together and that it affects the both us (not saying that 1. My job is tiring so after work I m generally just tired 2. I am the one who cooks for the both of us but also for other people when they come and the one who takes care of them while he is just sitting there). He said that he didn’t need my permission and called me stupid for not understanding this - and that if I wasn’t happy and wanted to chill I could just go in the bedroom and I didn t need to take care of the guest. I am still pretty pissed off and feel disrespected that he doesn’t consider my opinion as important when inviting people over, mainly during the week.  I told him that it’s not like I would say no but it matters for me that he cares how I feel about it, that he checks with me first and that we can discuss options (like where and when) instead of just not letting me a choice as if the place belonged to him  or something. Anyway for him I am the asshole because he gave me notice and that he considers he doesn’t need to ask me as if it was permission.  Moreover this already happened and we had several arguments about that in the past, and still he doesn’t understand.  So here I am.  Am I the asshole for making a big deal of it and not wanting his friend to come over ?	1643009991.0	sbgln5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbgln5/aita_for_wanting_my_bf_to_ask_me_before_inviting/	AITA for wanting my BF to ask me before inviting friends over ?
58b39kf8	So, I'm 25,M and had this really great idea of starting a website and offer a great service that i could profit from . I suggested to my gf 23,F that we are together for three years now and i trust her that we could be partners.  The questions started: How much will i be paid? How many hours a day should i work? Do i have to put money in this thing? There are her first three questions and i mean like i was really bothered because she kept talking about how much money will she make. I told her the risk and the time plan and she just said i dont want partners i want  to be your employee because i dont want to lose any money. Notice that she doesn't work anywhere and her parents fund everything and i was not expecting much money from her but some that will help me a little or at least expected to be happy for the idea.   I didnt really say anything to her at that time but she mentioned afterwards: "about the website... if i am going to work there and you hire more employees, what are you gonna do there? Drink coffee?" I said she doesn't know anything about this stuff and shouldn't talk about this because I'm not gonna hire her like never. She raged yelling that she is my gf and i should be hiring her, also that its like i dont trust her and underestimate her for some reason lol. I yelled if you want you can work for free and that's it. She left the house. It's been two days meanwhile i have hired the person i needed so there is no space for her.

iypznhgw	My cousin (27F) and her daughter (1F) have been living in my(24F) house since the child was 8 months old. It's a temporary arrangement due to monetary issues on her side after having the baby and is set to end in March when she would be ready to find an apartment on her own. We both work from home and while I'm mostly taking care of everything, she chips in whenever she can.  I study part time for 3 hours a day and can't leave all the chores to her so we split chores. By the time I actually get to work, it's usually evening. I'm an author so it's okay as long as I get it done within the deadlines. So we have been okay and all BUT she has a tendency of waking me up at random. She knows that I often write late into the night and sleep at 1-3 am, wake up at 9-11am just in time for my online class. However, she still wakes me up at any time for reasons like watching the kid for a few minutes while she goes to pee, take a shower, etc. I understand that my niece likes to crawl away and might fall off from the bed if she leaves her there or crawl into kitchen/bathroom but it really is affecting my sleep. I can't go back to sleep easily after a distraction and she knows this.    There are mornings when I end up waking up at 7 with swollen eyes and a headache from not having enough sleep and become less productive all day, have to take coffee to stay up and write, go to sleep at later than 3am, repeat.  The day before yesterday she woke me up at 5 to watch the baby so she would prepare for her early morning. I could barely keep awake but I positioned the child where she couldn't crawl past me. She woke me up again before going to the home office to tell me that she would have headphones on and if the baby woke up again, I should give her a bottle. I had barely slept a wink when I felt the tapping on my shoulder again. At this point I was irritated and when she told me that she wanted me to check out what she was cooking, I almost flipped out on her. I  I spoke to her about it in the evening and told her I would appreciate it if she didn't wake me up unless she really had to because of the reasons I stated above. I thought she would understand but she was mad at me. This morning I was watching tiktok on my phone with  earplugs in and she was cleaning my room. I think the baby followed her in. She put her at the foot of my bed without saying a word and continued cleaning. I didn't know the baby was even awake and didn't register her presence until I heard a bang and a wail. I was shocked and after the baby calmed down, I asked her why she didn't tell me that baby was there. Her response was "You don't want to be woken up for her so..." She has ignored me since then and won't even tell me when she needs anything and won't let the baby crawl to me to play because "She will bother people"  I really didn't realize that my confrontation would make her feel that way.

3fw32cs	So I (39f) am an English teacher making a teacher's wage. My husband (44m) is a banker making twice my wage. We pool our finances, and after paying mortgage, savings and bills, we have equal "pocket money" each.  We're pretty tight with our budget, and save /invest a lot. I want more free money to spend, because I like spending money on clothes and makeup, which my husband does not. He is very tight, which is fine, but I want more disposable income. So I started tutoring a kid a couple times a week and get $100 per week.  There has been a discussion that because I earn less than my husband (true) and he works longer hours than me (true) that some of that money from tutoring should be used for paying down the mortgage etc, and not on the way I want to spend it, which is on frivolous frippery.

iyutwl9p	I shovel my own driveway everyday when it snows. Last week some kid (probably 12 years old) shoveled the driveways of everyone in my area in the neighborhood. I never asked him to.   He then says he's charging 15 dollars. We didn't have much snow it would've been like 5 minutes of work at most. I told him no because I didn't ask him to do it.   He then got his parents involved who came over to me and told me I should pay them and that I'm an heartless asshole. I jsut closed the door.   My wife says I could've been nicer. I think these people are rude entitled jackasses.	1643014309.0	sbhpsk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhpsk/aita_for_not_paying_a_kid_who_shoveled_my_drive/	AITA for not paying a kid who shoveled my drive way?
isugz6f8	I (15F) and my mom (50F) have a love-hate relationship with each other. The reason is because on some days, she’d be all lovey dovey with me. She would compliment/appreciate me and be nice in general. But then, the next day or later on she’ll insult me like make jokes of my attempts, make fun of how my body looks or call me lazy.   One day, she got mad at me because I hadn't done my homework. I understand she has her reasons to be mad at me because it has been days since she told me to do my homework. But it’s been difficult for me to catch up lately with my studies because I am suffering from PCOS. The side effect of the medication I'm taking is depression and her behavior towards me is making things worse.   Anyway, she went overboard and asked: “Why am I cursed with a child like you? What did I do to deserve this?”. That hurt me a lot so I lashed out and ran upstairs to our roof top. The rooftop is the only place I could get privacy from because I don't have my own room.   My parents tried to open the door and succeeded. I ranted out how I really feel but she just keeps invalidating me. I said I am trying to do my work then she says it isn’t enough. Then this part triggered me. She repeated the question she asked before. “What did I do wrong to be cursed with a child like you?” I responded, “You shouldn’t have given birth to me then.” She replied “If only it was possible then I would.” I then confessed that I read their conversation about me saying she’s jealous of my friend’s mom because she has a smart daughter and she misses posting my achievements on facebook. She replied, “What about it? It’s true.” which only made me feel worse. I said she should be your daughter then & she replied. “If only it was possible, I wish she was.” It angered me more so i told her i wish she didn’t stop me when i was gonna off myself.  We continued arguing and I was crying hard that time to the point I couldn’t move or breathe. That’s when she finally stopped saying bullshit. What made me more upset is something serious should happen to me so that she’d stop. It’s always been like this. I get scolded then I’ll cry to the point I couldn't breathe. Then it repeats, she acts nicely for a short period of time but then switches up the next day.   She joked the next day, “So not being able to breathe and move means you can’t do your homework?”. At this point, she’s probably aware I'm not mentally stable. It’s not normal for a teenager to lash out just because of homework, right? I’m honestly sick of living here because this always happens. I love her but sometimes she’s just too much. So AITA for getting mad at her?	1643013841.0	sbhlhv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhlhv/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mom/	AITA for getting mad at my mom
azu76ubp	Before anything, my roommate is genuinely one of the sweetest person you can meet, as well as her family. We get along well which is why it frustrates me that I have such a problem with this:  I love her when I say this, but she is also incredibly forgetful, messy, and dependent. I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm convinced she actually has no idea how to do ANYTHING involving cleaning. I've lived with her for 4 months and never seen her touch a cleaning product. This and other context leads me to believe her parents coddled her when it comes to chores. (She brings laundry home to her mom every weekend and needs directions when cleaning a spill)  Here's where the real problem starts. She's very artistic and hates to throw things away. (She's an environmental major). At first, I thought it was cool to see her recycled creations, but turns out, she only uses a tiny portion of what she saves  So far she has: -Kept cardboard empty cartons in the living room for months (we all used this for a Halloween decorating contest and each cleaned out part. Except for her of course) -Keeps jars of compose in her cabinet when she doesn't actually know what to do with them/how to compost -Kept empty toilet paper rolls on the sinktop  -Left out a  small bottle of ACTUAL milk she used for Halloween costume for days (even after I reminded her) until it grew mold -Left tomatoes rotting to the point where they grew white fuzz for compost (again...she doesn't even know how)  This is all added with the fact that again, she does not clean up in general. (She shares a bathroom with me too...not fun) Everytime I passively remind her/ask what she is going to do with her stuff she either says "I'll do it later!" Or tells me she forgot. That's where I feel bad, she GENUINELY forgets. Recently, I've had it and been more direct.  I threw away a pair of toilet paper rolls that have been sitting on the sink for a week now. Additionally, I grabbed the milk cartons mentioned above and told her I would recycle them (in wish she hesitantly took to her room saying "Haha, I forgot I kept those there!"  The second part gives me some relief and I plan on being more direct to show her it's been a problem.

iytpd9rr	Basically here's how it goes:  I have a friend, let's call her EL, and two other guy friends, let's call them KJ and MH.  A few months back, MH confessed to EL, but EL rejected him and she just didn't take it lightly. As in, she kept overthinking it and felt guilty for liking MH. KJ knows that MH confessed to EL. Fast forward to now, when a few days ago MH posted a shirtless picture of himself to show his progress with his bodybuilding, on his private account. KJ was in the private account while EL wasn't.  I have no idea why, but perhaps because KJ knows that MH liked EL (he got over her), but KJ took a screenshot of the picture and sent it to EL, claiming that MH was "so full of himself". All this while KJ had been acting like he was a good friend of MH, but then here he's badmouthing him behind his back. EL sent screenshots of the conversation between herself and KJ, which included the shirtless picture of MH to me.  She told me not to tell MH. But I felt that it was so wrong to have your own private photos circulated behind your back, especially by a friend. So I ended up telling MH, and MH confronted KJ and EL separately. MH told me he was grateful i told him, but now EL is pissed at me.  I think I did the wrong thing for betraying the trust of EL, but I think that it is also wrong to not know about things like that. Ignorance is may be bliss, but i would've wanted to know if someone had circulated private photos of me.  I'm not sure what to do now, but AITA for telling MH about his photos being sent out to EL?	1643015092.0	sbhwpw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbhwpw/aita_for_telling_a_friend_that_photos_of_him_were/	AITA for telling a friend that photos of him were being shown to other people?
r8l8s	Me and my girlfriend (twenties) have been living at a farm for half a year. We met the owners (50's-ish married couple) in summer. For health reasons they are behind on farm work and we help them, but we also cook and do art together. It's been great, we feel a great connection - Tears have been shed over how nice it all is until very recently.  &#x200B;  We usually share who is making dinner, but since the owners wife has been in a bad health state currently (it is very swingy and unpredictable, which is ok, I can very much emphatize) I have been doing the majority of the cooking after my work day. I had a long day at work though and didn't have the time to cook for 4, so I was asking if it was ok if I go get take-away for all or if we should skip group dinner today. This was 1pm. At 7pm after no reply, we just said "ok, we gonna go get takeaway now, just tell what you want", to which we got a very angry "nothing, I just need peace and quiet!". We didn't like that, so my gf texted "we were just trying to manage dinner and it can't be too much to ask. It really messed with our schedule that we didn't get a reply. If you wanted to skip today, that would have been fine." Which they got very pissed at. We decided to leave them be for a while until things settled.  &#x200B;  last saturday I baked some cinnamon rolls in the morning, and texted a picture of them with the caption "coffee? :)", just to get us chill and talking again. That was 12pm, the owner replied "who drinks coffee at 12, coffe is at 3". Yeah, sure, 3 it is. Me and my gf were stressed about this situation, we killed the time by making a small trip, we lost track of time a bit and at 5 minutes before 3 we texted "we are gonna be half an hour late". The owner texted "it really messed with his schedule of walking the dog that he didn't get a reply earlier". I was asking if it was ok if we have coffee later, he said "if you want coffee, don't wait for me, I'm walking the dog". I've had had it with texts, so I went over to talk to him directly.  He was furious, called me disrespectful for not being on time to this "appointment". I apologized for being late and not saying so earlier, but I also said that being that punctual has never been a topic, that he could have easily walked the dog at any other time (he currently is on off-season, so there is little work to be done) and it is really not respectful either to meet a gesture of reconcilation with such harsh rulings and judgings -not to mentioning that I think THEY should apologize. Refusing to make up because we're half an hour late while they were making zero moves to clear the situation was just insult to injury. He didn't accept my apology, had nothing to admit to or reconcile and just told us to move on. I said "yeah, that doesn't work for us. If you want to talk or eat or chill or whatever, YOU can talk to US now." and I went home. Haven't heard from them since then.	1643016249.0	sbi78j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbi78j/aita_for_being_late_to_a_conciliation_appointment/	AITA for being late to a conciliation "appointment" I arranged
78f2lzaf	Hi, Reddit. First post here. Please bear with me if I don't make sense.  For context, I (19F) am studying in quite a prestigious school in my country. It's quite expensive, costing about nearly $3000 a year. I am the last of my family to be studying in college. My two sisters have already graduated from a state university and are already working, however they're still staying with me and my parents to save expenses and save money to move out (they don't pay our parents anything). Overall, financially, we're doing okay. The only expenses we have monthly are bills and groceries. We rarely go out to eat or buy expensive items, and on the side, I do freelance transcriptions, so I don't ask for money either.  One night, my sisters and I were having dinner and had a conversation. They were asking me how I was doing in school and I told them I was doing great. They told me that I have to make "studying worth it in this university because our parents are paying so much for my studies." I told them that I knew that. Then they asked me when would the financial aid applications open. It opens before every start of the school year and they told me that I have to apply to save money.  Prior to this conversation, my father and I had a talk and he told me that I shouldn't apply for financial aid anymore for particular reasons:  1. He's doing really well at his job. He's getting paid more than enough to pay for the family's daily costs, save money for himself, and pay for my tuition. 2. The financial aid request is mostly granted for those who are in need and are only getting $500 worth of monthly income. 3. Additionally, his taxes are too big, which then means that he earns a lot. The university considers us as somewhat upper middle class. 4. And he wants to pay for it full because I was always the short end of the stick when it comes to education.  I told my sisters that our dad didn't want me to apply for the financial aid anymore and the two of them called me an asshole and a spoiled brat for it. They said that I'm not considerate of our father's sacrifices as a parent and that on the long run, we will get poorer and there won't be enough money for the family anymore.  I didn't know what to say because for the whole of my education since elementary, I have been on public schools and scholarships. They were the ones studying in private institutions (except college) and I was the one who adjusted for public education to accommodate them. I didn't say anything during the discussion because I didn't want a fight, but I really didn't want to apply either because I already applied last year and got rejected due to the school recognizing that my parents are well-off to pay for me considering that I am the only responsibility left. My mother is also working, though not earning as much as my father, she is earning enough to save money as well.  So yeah, would I be the asshole if I don't apply for financial aid?	1643016525.0	sbi9id	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbi9id/wibta_if_i_dont_apply_for_financial_aid/	WIBTA if I don't apply for financial aid?
iys6trtg	Throwaway because people I work with have reddit, also on mobile so sorry for formatting.   I work at a bakery (serving not baking) and have for nearly 3 months now. I’m one of 3 new girls and there’s 16 of us all together. There’s so many of us because you need to have at least 5 people on at once but normally there’s only 5 people between 10am-3pm because that’s when it’s busiest. M is the person this is about and she started 2 weeks after I did.   I picked it up really quickly and am the only new person who knows how to do everything. I was just open to learning and whenever there was something that I didn’t know, I went out of my way to ask. Because of how busy it always is there, I’ve made sure that I’m not making things harder for them and always show initiative which they’re really grateful for. The girls I work with actually forget that I’m new.   M however, hasn’t picked anything up. She doesn’t listen to instructions, doesn’t do anything she’s asked unless our boss asks her to (our boss is hardly there). She has to constantly be retaught   how to do everything or if she does do something, it gets done incorrectly and someone else has to redo it. She’s always on her phone, makes lots of careless mistakes and prioritises chatting with customers over doing something like making a sandwich she put through or going on to serve the next customer. It’s beginning to frustrate everyone because we’re all too busy to pick up her slack.   There have been a lot of things she’s done that have annoyed me but this is the only time I’ve ever snapped. We have a big oven out the back that we use to heat pies up to the correct temperature so they can be put in the pie oven to sell to customers. This thing is industrial sized and has a very loud (and very grating) alarm so you know when to tend to them. The first alarm, you turn the oven off and let them keep going through so they heat correctly, and the next alarm tells you to take them out, it takes 30 minutes all up. Every person was doing something, I was on the coffee machine and getting absolutely smashed when the oven alarm went off. It’s hard to concentrate when it’s on because of how loud it is. M has been taught how to do it, by everyone INCLUDING our boss who doesn’t even handle the training part. I watched her walk right passed the oven, not turn off the alarm and into the cool room which had already been done so there was no reason for her to be in the cool room. We’ve actually realised it’s where she goes to be on her phone. I had to stop what I was doing and go deal with it.   Afterwards when it was quiet, I pulled her to the side and asked why she walked past the alarm and didn’t turn it off despite everyone else being busy either serving or making things for customers. She said it was because she didn’t know what we wanted her to do with it so she just left it. I asked her why she didn’t go get someone and take over from them and she replied that everyone was busy so she figured someone would get to it.   I said “M, you have been taught by everyone how to do the pie oven. At this point it’s unacceptable and quite unfair that we have to pick up your slack. If you’re unsure, ask. Don’t just walk away when every single person is busy. We all have enough on our plates without having to make sure your jobs are getting done. Just do it and do it properly.” I walked away after that and we didn’t even look at each other for the remainder of her shift.   I was still annoyed when I got home and was venting to my stepmum and she said that while she understands how frustrating it must be, that I should’ve just let it be. Now i’ve calmed down, I’m unsure if I should have said anything at all.

4inv15zk	I volunteer at a German Shepherd rescue and in September a female was brought in after her owner said she was going to have her PTS because she couldn’t handle her. Loki was skeletal, timid, and reactive to men and other dogs. I went home from the rescue the first day and cried at the thought of her being in the kennels, but also at the thought of somebody else taking her home and hurting her even more.   At the end of November the rescue allowed me to bring her home as a foster. I live in a ground floor flat with a communal garden so I’m not allowed to adopt her until I move in April.   Because Loki is so reactive to dogs and men, I had to spend Christmas alone. My parents have 3 dogs, plus my dad and 2 brothers. It was going to be a lot of dogs in a small house and I knew it would be too much. Plus, Loki went into heat about a week before Christmas and my parents male GSD isn’t neutered.   Because I technically only foster Loki, people have been putting adoption requests in for her. I mentioned this to a group chat of friends and they unanimously agreed that I should give Loki up. They think that I will have no life with her due to her reactivity and that I will have to spend more Christmas’ alone. Their argument is that these other people may have more time / money / land / experience than I do. When I said I got where they were coming from but the idea of giving Loki up made me really upset and that not only has she progressed incredibly in her reactivity & training, but she’s been incredible for my mental health.   Since then they’ve not spoken to me at all. If I say anything in the chat, it gets ignored. One of the girls’ son had a birthday party and the other 2 got invited but I didn’t. When I asked one of them about it she said the whole point of fostering is to help the dog move on to somewhere better.   I’ve spoken to family about keeping Loki and they all say I’m her person. They don’t think I should give her up at all, unless I really want to (which I clearly don’t). The management at the rescue dont want to move Loki into a new home and unsettle her unless completely necessary and they’re really happy with the progress she’s made. But my friends are making me feel like an arse for keeping the dog and potentially keeping her from a better life.   AITA for keeping her?	1643018827.0	sbiu6z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbiu6z/aita_for_keeping_my_reactive_rescue_dog/	AITA for keeping my reactive rescue dog?
g1p0x8nn	I (14M) recently took my sister (4F) to a park close to my house, she was pretty excited to go because her dad bought her a bicycle and she wanted to try it out  When we arrived there was a lady with her 2 sons and a daughter, I made eye contact with the lady and just smiled and waved at her to be nice. After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore   I looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with "My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem" I then responded with "I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said "Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car   Later when I got home I told my mom about it thinking she would see it as a funny story, boy was I wrong, she started going on about how I was so rude to that lady and that I need to learn to respect my elders  Am I the asshole?	1643019787.0	sbj345	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbj345/aita_for_cussing_at_a_lady_at_the_park/	AITA for cussing at a lady at the park?
3b26s560	After unfortunate circumstances with my husbands health (brain cancer) I was forced to move back in with my parents and twin sister. I have always had my suspicion that my twin was the favorite if my parents and honestly this doesn't really bother me; they live their life and I live mine. However, for the past few months my mother and sister have been making snide comments towards me about how I don't work a real job compared to the hard work my sister does (I'm a department manager at a store while she is a nurse), and that I always use my free time to sit at home on my ass and do nothing.   So last night my mother left her phone on the coffee table and walked away and it went off, so I looked at it and saw a message from my sister with my name in it. I picked up the phone and went through my mother and sisters conversation about me which included topics of how: I'll never do anything or get anywhere in life, ridiculing me for my weight, saying how I'm a liar and nothing I say is true, and even that I'm lying about being sick so I can sit in my ass at home (I currently have COVID and needed to quarantine). After reading these messages I got angry, then cried, and then got angry again because I know they say comments like this to me but now I know they really do say it all behind my back, too.  Up to this point I've ignored it and chose to be the better person despite the comments because they were nice enough to let my husband and I move back into their house while he undergoes all of his treatments, but I'm starting to think I need to stand my ground. I am worried that I WBTA for bringing up their comments about me I found in their texts that were supposed to be private. I know snooping is a no no usually but I feel my self worth is on the line also.	1643022617.0	sbjt4z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbjt4z/wibta_if_i_told_my_mother_and_sister_off_for/	WIBTA if I told my mother and sister off for talking about me behind their back with information I found on my mother's phone?
a8id14wz	My (m25) brother (m28) has always had a tough time with money. Mostly because he cant hold a job for more than a few months before either getting fired or because the company wont renew his contract.   During one of his times as unemployed he asked me to borrow him some money for rent (around 600€). Me and my brother usually had a great relation to eachother so i borrowed him the money. He paid it back almoast 5 months later.  7 months ago he asked me the same question and since he had payed me back before i borrowed him the money once again. The next month he asked to borrow 200€ more and the month after that 150€.  Almoast 4 months ago he got a job and told me that he would pay me back when he got his money but then told me that almoast all of it got spent on bills since he hadnt been working a full month. Since then he always say the same thing "ill pay you back next month". I've told him that he dosnt need to pay back everything at once and that mayby 200€ a month is enough.   Last month I asked him again for the money and he told me "You already have enough money so you dont have to keep pestering me about paying back, you dont need it". I told him that i BORROWED the money and that it wasnt a gift and that if he wouldnt pay me back he shouldnt bother by contacting me again since i just feel like i am his personal bank. I also told him that if he didnt pay me back i would make sure i got my money back by selling the debt to a company that would instead take stuff from him.   I've seen him buying games, pizza and energy drinks not just once a week but almoast all of the time (we live in appartments almoast next to eachother).  My parents called me and was furious by what i told my brother but I wouldnt let it go.

2bwthg0p	So i recently got engaged In September '21 and my partner and I decided that we would get married in September 2022. For anyone who doesn't know, 2022 is the busiest year for weddings since the 80's so I had my work cut out for me. A month later everything is booked, save the dates etc...  Now, in the past week one of my bridesmaids (my best friend) has been talking with her boyfriend about marriage and they are choosing a ring as we speak. However, she told me that she had decided that she was having a destination wedding and that she was planning for it to be two weeks before or two weeks after my wedding. She then said that I would be definitely be a bridesmaid and she asked if she could have my wedding budget sheets and any other info I had researched.   I said i was happy to give her my research but that however even though I would be honoured to be a bridesmaid, I couldn't afford to be apart of it as well as fund my own wedding, especially considering that it was a destination wedding.   She didn't say anything but let me give her my information of weddings and then went home. She now hasn't spoken to me all week, even though I've tried to call and text. Am I the asshole for not being a part of her wedding even though shes in mine?	1643023765.0	sbk4dw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbk4dw/aita_for_not_accepting_my_best_friends_bridesmaid/	AITA for not accepting my Best friends bridesmaid invitation?
iyy5ty9u	To be clear, I used to collect Pokemon cards as a kid, but haven't for a long time. I know they are valuable now but believe my wife has legitimate ownership on them. Nonetheless, I'm asking the question to the community.  So when my wife was a kid, she and her cousins and Grandad collected Pokémon cards together. Each cousin would get a pack, open them and swap/trade them around with each other all reasonably friendly like. One day, my wife opens a pack and pulls a Charizard. Base set and not 1st edition, but a Zard nonetheless. One of the cousins starts kicks up a huge tanty "I want it, I want it", face is like a bucket of crushed crabs, full upset. Grandad steps in and strikes a deal and says "cousin" get's the Zard, but she gets all his other cards. She's not sure how many this was, but assures me it was "A lot, like enough to be happy with". All party's agree, trade is made and world keeps turning.  A few months and many disagreements later, and it's agreed by all the cousins that ALL of the cards would be combined into a single collection to be held onto by grandad. That way no-one owns the cards, no fights and they can all still enjoy the collection together.  Fast forward to 18 years down the track, my wife is telling me this story as we head to a family function at her grandad's. I ask her Grandad later that day about the cards after dinner, he nips off for 5mins and comes back with a binder. Full Base Set. Every holo, every rare in a single folder. I remark that it's a great collection and ask how much he wants for it. He offers it to me and my wife, knowing that she already owned a lot of the cards no cost whatsoever. We leave that night with the cards, and I put them away.  Couple weeks late, we get a msg from zard cousin, saying he heard about grandad giving them the cards and wants his zard back. Just that card, not interested in any of the other ones. Apparently he had Pokemon Red on Game Boy and Charmander was his first Pokemon, so there is apparently sentimental value in this card. My wife gets into an argy saying "All of the cards were put together in one collection", "No-one owns any of the single cards" and "he agreed to have a joint collection together" in this sorta shit. In her mind we are just holding onto them for safe keeping. Then I show her how much a full base set is going for online, (like $2ish K) and she digs in even further. I come up with a comprimise and offer the limited edition Pokemon 2000 movie metal 'mew card' as a compromise. He gets even more angry at this, saying it's not the zard. That's the ONLY card he wants.  We don't earn stacks of money, but don't need to sell the cards or anything. We see them as an eventual investment we were lucky enough to be gifted by the ACTUAL owner, not someone who frankly forgot about them and has no claim to them.  So, AITA for grabbing the cards from my wife's Grandad (knowing their value), or am I just looking out for my wife's best interests?	1643024831.0	sbkeb7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbkeb7/aita_for_ensuring_my_wifes_familys_pokemon_cards/	AITA for ensuring my wife's family's pokemon cards are safe?
iybixho2	I \[16m\] have been friends with ‘Rose’ \[16f\] since we were 5. Over the summer, she and her boyfriend had a baby and ever since she’s been less fun to be around. I’m not complaining that she’s tired or stressed, I understand kids are stressful, but all she wants to talk about at school is whatever new outfit she’s bought the baby, all she posts on social media is about the baby and whenever we see her on weekends she only wants to do baby-related activities. She’s obsessed. I have two little brothers, so if I wanted to do kid activities I’d hang out with them.  It was my birthday over the weekend and two of my friends \[15m & 15m\] and I went bowling and out for a meal where we could relax and have fun without thinking about babies crying.   Rose, meanwhile, turned up at my house with her baby to ‘surprise’ me as she didn’t think I was doing anything, so my sister \[18f\] had to tell her I had already gone out with friends. She was disappointed and texted me telling me I was a dick for not inviting her as she felt bad for me, being alone on my birthday. However, I had never told her I didn’t have plans, she had assumed it because I never mentioned it to her.   I explained that I wanted to have time that was about my 16th and not her baby and she was offended, saying that if I don’t want to hang out with her son I shouldn’t hang out with her either.   She’s now refusing to accept any messages from any of the three of us and our mutual friend \[16f\] says that I should have invited her to make her feel better about how tired she is all the time. I never intended to make her feel bad but I did want some time to relax, which I suppose was selfish.

h1igi2xj	So a family member has several times now asked me directly (politely) to stop sending IM's so fast... by fast I mean I thread my thoughts so could look like this:     * The car I bought is a Ford I really like it! * I mean there are tonnes of good options out there but I liked the ford. * Anyway, what are you up to today?     They would prefer me to group all those into a single message instead or at least less. I do get where he is coming from as in his phone might buzz 3 times instead of once, I get that annoyance too... however i mute the thread if it become annoying and come back later.  &#x200B;  The particular argument the worst it got was 6 messages but on an emotional topic each message addressed something specific.     So every time they ask me to stop I politely refuse saying that the problem is theirs not mine. Its how my thoughts collect,,, I do it in work also nobody else has ever commented.  I personally hate when people send a novel in a single message but I wouldnt dream of telling someone how they should speak so I dont believe anyone should tell me... there are tools to mute me, the thread etc readily available.

8w3c53wt	Last night I went to the kitchen to fix my 9 yr old dessert and as I was waiting for the ice cream to soften a minute I decided to put some dishes in the dishwasher. My spouse sees this and gets an upset face and won't talk to me for hours. I finally had enough and asked him to please stop being that way and talk to me. He did, and told me that he was angry that I was doing dishes and I didn't ask one of the kids to do it. We had a discussion a few days before about the kids needing to do more chores and he is upset that I "ignored" that. Mind you, he didn't ask the kids to do the dishes either. He is still upset this morning.	1643027434.0	sbl5t2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbl5t2/aita_for_not_telling_one_of_the_kids_to_do_the/	AITA for not telling one of the kids to do the chores?
3agp2h6h	Hear me out   This has been laying heavy on my heart for 3 days and I feel like i cannot keep quiet anymore.    3 nights ago my gf, myself and our 2 kids (13F and 11M) were at my cousins house for a bbq. My cousin has 2 kids as well (17F and 10M). There was also another friend of clmy cousins present with her son (also 10M)    Long story short, i went to the bathroom at some point and when i came back i heard my cousins husband say "It's just fucking tits. Who cares" I was a bit taken aback by this because i had been swimming most of the time and assumed the boys saw my bikini top and said something about it. My gf talked to our son (our son told her what happened while i was peeing) and that was that. My cousins husband and cousin kept hammering about the "tits". I tried to ask but they ignored my question. Anyway. I followed my gf to the bathroom when she went and cornered her. I asked her what the whole story was about. She told me the 3 boys were watching tv and then full on boobs appeared. Our son asked that the other 2 boys turn it off or change the channel because he's uncomfortable with it. The boys then proceeded to tell my son he's a "pussy" and "to get used to tits" Everything died down for a while and our son hung out with his sister and my cousins daughter instead of the 2 boys.   Later that night i got back in the swimming pool and the 2 boys (not including my son) got in with me. They left me alone for the most part, but then i caught their conversation   I've watched this blue movie and that blue movie. This blue movie's name is blah blah   I didn't say anything and just listened. I'm still shook. I don't think watching 18+ movies is a good idea for 10 year old boys, i honestly don't. I have a friend who has a porn addiction and it's ruining his life.    So, WIBTA for telling my cousin she's raising her son wrong, with the wrong outlook on life and women in general?    ETA: I am lesbian and my kids are technically my stepkids.  ETA 2: My cousin and her husband talks openly about their sex lives in front of their kids and dad even tells his son how he had morning glory and mom fixed the problem one time.

iz0yoapb	My best friend and I have been friends since forever. We go to the same college. She has recently been talking to a boy and spending a lot of time with him. She prioritizes  him over me and I understand she likes him but I feel really left out from her life right now. She does all the stuff we used to do with him and It is a bit upsetting if I am being honest.   I am a loner but I realized that the amount of time I spent with my best friend was unsustainable and I needed to branch out and make new friends. I have been spending more time with a groups of girls in my class. I like them and get along with them and I have been hanging out them lately.   My best friend doesn't seem to mind this but one night, she called me dead at night and said we should hang out the next day and that she missed me, I told her that I had plans with the other girls and I offered to meet up another day but she said she had classes.   She was really upset with me and she said she understands that I have other friends but she really wanted to see me and that she missed me a lot, I told her that I missed her too but it was something they have been planning for weeks and I am not gonna flake on them. She sounded torn up when I hung up with her. She has been spending less time with me now even though she is not spending time with him. I feel guilty because she is my best friend and I feel I was being petty by not meeting up with her. She is my best friend and she has been there for me so many times and I just feel like I did something wrong as she is a very reasonable and sensible person most of time and I feel I may have fucked up.	1643029926.0	sblwyn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sblwyn/aita_for_not_dropping_plans_with_other_friends/	AITA for not dropping plans with other friends because my best friend wanted to hang out?
iz0dg2an	My (26F) boyfriend (30M) for 3 years immigrated in my country (not English speaker country) 15 years ago, because his father and cousin (now about 40M) lived here already. They don't see each other often but my BF broke his leg, and yesterday his cousin "C" (with his wife) came at my BF's home.  They started talking in their own language (which I don't speak at all), after few minutes C told me "you should learn our language" I: "yeah, now he's home he can teach me!" C: "if you pay him" I didn't responded  BF used to work in a restaurant, and yesterday he was cooking. C "why is he cooking? Why don't you do it?" I "I don't know how to cook this dish, and he was a chef" BF "If I wait for her to do it I can wait forever" (he loves cooking I don't ask him to do it)  When they left I told my BF I didn't like what C said and ask to please speak my language if I'm there, he responded me "are you seriously asking me to speak your language? We never see each other and I can't never speak my language, plus his wife only speak our". Ok I didn't knows she don't speak my language (I'm not sure about it, as she's here since at least 10 years, and had some small talk before, but ok fine).  I asked him why he didn't said anything about paying for language lessons and BF responded "come on, he was joking" which may be true but they're from a very poor country (they count every cent) and we only saw each other two times (yesterday, and 1 year ago when BF and I went to pick him up at the airport - with my car, gasoline and highway paid for by me + 5 hour total) so we're not confident enough to joke, IMHO.   About the cooking BF said "I only said the truth: you'll never cook that dish", which is true but I can cook other meal and it's him who want to cook that particular dish (he do it for me, for friends, or my family every week on his own initiative).  BF has always been super nice and respectful with me, both in private and in front of our friends and my relatives. I don't know why he behaved like this yesterday. We had a fight and now we are in different rooms, and I wonder AITH?	1643030121.0	sblyzn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sblyzn/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_30m_to_take_my_26f/	AITA for asking my boyfriend (30M) to take my (26F) side against his cousin?
9o89w3nm	 Ever since I was little, I was never much of an eater but since I did like the occasional sugary food I’d save my snacks until I did want it (don’t worry, I kept track of expiration dates).   Now here’s the problem, if I didn’t hide it, my family would take it upon themselves to eat it cause "if I didn’t eat it immediately that means I don’t want it" even though I just wasn’t hungry at the moment.   So I grew up hiding my food in random places to stop it from being eaten. Of course, they didn’t really mean any harm it’s just they got hungry and took my food when there was a lot of extra snacks to choose from (I’m a relatively picky eater so I usually stick to snacks that aren’t too flavorful cause it gets overwhelming at times - plus, they got their own, they just ate their own and went to eat mine as well).   Now I wanted to see if in this instance I was the a-hole. Basically, my mother found my stash of food a while ago and she didn’t tell anybody about it and didn’t really touch anything in it as far as I know but a few days ago, she told me to go keep it upstairs instead cause they were cleaning out the area. I hid it in a back room that was mostly used for storing random unused things. She came up to me today and told me to give her the box because she wanted to clean it (she’s kinda OCD about cleaning even before Covid which means I missed out on quite a few childhood activities with my friends but that’s a different story).    Anyways, I refused to give the box cause it seemed pointless to clean a box for god’s sake and it’s not like she cleaned it when it was downstairs. She got mad and told me that I shouldn’t be hiding things from her. Normally I would just give it but recently I’ve noticed she’s been trying to take control of literally every aspect of my life because she doesn’t trust me and it’s driving me crazy since I’m a pretty private person in general.   She got furious when I refused and would not stop demanding it so eventually when she went looking for it in the other corner of the house, I grabbed it and moved it out from its hiding place and placed it a little more out in the open but still in the same room then told her to look there.   Afterwards, she got mad at me for keeping it in that room because she kept old clothes in there and god forbid I touch the clothes. Then, she brought it downstairs in a big huff and yelled about it to my father which woke up my brother. Now they both know where I kept it and what the box looks like which means I have to get rid of both. I obviously have other stashes of candy and stuff but I don't really like eating sugar that much so I usually stick to my snacks (cranberries, gum, and goldfish were a few of the things I kept in there). Also, she was mad that I was being difficult with her so early in the morning but I feel like this entire thing was unnecessary since it could have been avoided if she wasn't so obsessed with cleaning things.  Anyways, AITA for hiding my stuff?	1643030704.0	sbm5o0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbm5o0/aita_for_hiding_my_food/	AITA for Hiding My Food
bay3g8we	My boyfriend and I just moved into our new house together about 2 months ago. Since day 1 of those 2 months, there have been workers constantly in and out of the house doing various things to get it finished (it’s quite a big house so it’s taking a long time and even worse… we live in a country where the workers take the whole day to complete a job that should take maximum 2 hours).   I articulated my feelings (in a nice way) at the beginning, but now my boyfriend is just being disrespectful to me and constantly saying that I’m overreacting. Here are my concerns with people working in the master bedroom/master washroom where the closet is:   1. It’s 2022 and people are fucking weird these days. I have a problem with people rummaging through my things because when I was 16 years old, someone had actually broken into my families home in the middle of the day while my entire family was home and stole all of my underwear, which was found in a plastic bag in front of an open window that led to the roof (the person made a getaway when they heard us coming upstairs). This clearly traumatized me.   2. I grew up in a house with many, many siblings, and anyone who has siblings knows that at one point or another, you’ve taken/borrowed from your siblings without their permission. We’ve all been there lol, so I’m very protective of my things and take pride in them.   3. We hired a maid to clean the house 6 days a week from 9-6 every day - she has since quit, but I sat my ass in the walk in closet every day for 3 hours (waste of my life) ever since I quietly walked upstairs when she was cleaning the master bedroom one day, only to catch her taking pictures of the closet and going through everything as she “dusted”.   4. She was also not the first person I caught taking pictures of the closet - I’ve caught 2 other workers doing the same when they were working on the AC unit in the closet.   So with all of that being said, I asked my boyfriend if it’s possible for us to get some sort of sliding cage installed in front of the closet so that I can live a life and not have to be monitoring people working all of the time - he said no because it will look ugly.  Before anyone says, “it’s just stuff, who cares”. The closet is filled with AP’s, Rolex’s, Chanel bags, Louis Vuitton bags, and countless other items. While they all can be replaced, I also feel like I don’t want to set myself up for something bad to happen, and when I see the workers, people I don’t know, taking photos and getting a good look at where everything is, it makes me feel very uncomfortable.   TLDR: Boyfriend thinks it’s ok to have workers in the master bedroom where the walk in closet is with all of our valuables unmonitored. As well, I have had no life the last 2 months because I spend the entire day watching (monitoring) people work in the house.	1643031153.0	sbmaxc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmaxc/aita_for_getting_upset_because_my_boyfriend/	AITA for getting upset because my boyfriend thinks it’s ok to trust strangers (random workers) alone in closet with all of our valuables
iz1grgtj	The title is quite long, I apologize in advance. I've always had horrible hygine growing up. I never took care of myself and never really knew that I smelled. That had consequences, I now think I permenantly smell. I've been really focusing in my hygine these couple of years. I use bar soap, body was, loofas and etc. At this point I don't even smell anything, no bad odor or anything coming from me. I have a boyfriend of 8 months, we're long distance but we already met up once.  I was hungry the other night and I whipped up a dish that consists of onions and garlic. The smell stuck to my body but since it was already around 2 am I couldn't shower because the bathroom I use is my parents bathroom. The next day my mother caught a whiff of me and made comments on how I smelled like armpits and body odor. I hadn't taken a shower yet and I was sweaty because it was hot in my room, not to mention the smell of onions stuck to my body so naturally I'd smell bad. I immediately took a shower and scrubbed my body until it turned red.   I was on call with my bf and I didn't feel like it was necessary to mute. I went downstairs and ate food, my mother gave me a hug and proceeded to comment aboit my odor. My brother joined in on the comments. The comments consisted of "Wow you don't smell like armpits anymore." "Do you even still wear deodorant?" And do many hurtful shit. Before they could shut up, they already said to much. I tried countering the conversation with "I smell good even if I don't do anything." I felt like I was about to sob. I gave them a hush and pointed at my phone, initiating that I was on a call. They shut their mouths and was speechless.   After muting my mic, they began to scold me. Why was I not muted, why was I on a call with him and etc. After the interrogation I couldn't handle it anymore, I went to my room shut the door and cried. That was the most humiliating moment of my life. Thankfully I don't think my boyfriend heard it because he was eating and wasnt using his phone. I refuse to talk to them and they haven't even apologized for what they did. They told me why was I mad at them for telling the truth. I asked my friends, cousins and etc if I smelled and they said that I didn't. I feel like an ass for getting mad because they were right and I had to reason to be mad at them for that.  When my bf got back I began sobbing. I told him that I didn't have the best hygine growing up and my family continued to tease me about it. I told him that I felt like I was the laughing stock of my family. I asked him if he heard what they said and he assured me that he didn't. He also told me that they were just joking and that he'll love me no matter what.	1643031060.0	sbm9se	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbm9se/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_mom_for_commenting_on/	AITA for getting mad at my mom for commenting on my body odor while on call with my ldr bf?
iyzkzqf4	 So it’s only 2 weeks before the wedding and my fiancé’s brother’s (let’s call him John M21) new girlfriend (let’s call her betty F18) caused a lot of drama at the bridal shower this past weekend. This has been an ongoing problem since they started dating. They got a promise ring shortly after dating which I have no problem with at all, but at the bridal shower she used it to brag a lot and kept making comments such as calling my fiancé’s mom her mother in law and she said to me I’d soon be part of the family as though she is already married to John. She also spread a rumour about one of the nicest ladies at the bridal shower saying she had flirted with Betty’s father, which was merely impossible as she is married and is one of the most kind hearted people I know and has never met Betty. A lot more went down and after Betty was extremely rude to my Maid of Honour I had to go up to her and ask her to stop being rude to my guests and to please stop gossiping. Shortly thereafter a lady on their table came up to me and asked to sit with me as she couldn’t stand the bad mouthing by Betty at the table.   My MOH then took it upon herself to uninvite Betty as she caused a lot of problems and generally just took away from one of the special moments in my life, after she sent her a message Betty simply ignored it. My MOH then told me about this and I decided that she was right as it is her duty to make the wedding run smoothly and as this has happened so many times before.   My Fiancé’s father thinks I’m tearing the family apart for uninviting her, even after I said that John was still to come as a groomsman and as my fiancé’s brother.  My fiancé’s dad and brother have decided that if Betty is not invited they would not attend either.  (I left out a lot of her actions as I did not want to elaborate on everything)  I’m honestly stuck as to what to do, my fiancé feels that if his family chooses John’s new girlfriend over his wedding then they don’t care about him enough, it hurts to be in this situation. We want our wedding to run smoothly and drama free and Betty might not make this possible, so AITA for uninviting Betty?	1643031285.0	sbmcd0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmcd0/aita_for_uninviting_my_fiancés_brothers_new/	AITA for uninviting my Fiancé’s brother’s new girlfriend from the wedding after she caused a scene?
f3hrtq9i	okay so hear me out, My (17F) sister (21F), has been in a relationship with her bf (22M) since mid 2020 and i found out about it on accident. (her relationship was secret, none of eithers family knew except me)  anyways, since then, she thought it was okay for her to ft him/call him on speaker in our room while i’m in it.   at first it didn’t bother me, but one ft turned into 4 fts a DAY and approximately 7 calls through the day + texts the whole day.   he quickly became very possessive and toxic. he would get very angry and upset at her for not responding to his texts at the moment he sent them, then he proceeds to blow up her phone with calls, even if she had already told him that she’s sitting with our family or out or other valid excuses as to why she can’t reply. then after that she’ll have to spend the whole night trying to get her to reply to her again.   he gets upset when she goes out without telling him, gaslights her when she vents to him, sulks if she prioritizes uni or family over him.   there are many other issues i don’t have the right to talk about.   but then there’s an issue that also effects me as well, she overshares a lot of details about our family that i’m not necessarily comfortable with.   and she also facetimes him til 3am and falls asleep on ft til the next day, while i’m in the room… with uni the very following day at 9am.   it’s made me sleep schedule terrible and i’m always exhausted and tired, not to mention me having adhd and depression makes it 10x harder to get through a single day.   but she also changed alot since she started dating him. she shames me for my interests which is SO not like her, she’s always told me to embrace my interests no matter how ‘embarrassing’ i think they are.  not to mention that she now gaslights ME when i rant to her then gets upset that i don’t rant to her.   going back to the point of me having depression, i NEED to go out every few days if i want to avoid overthinking and bad thoughts, and i live with my grandparents and her. my grandparents don’t let me go out alone so i’m tied to my sister and her schedule but 9 times out of 10, she cancels our plans then yells at me for getting upset over it.  you might be wondering why i haven’t told her yet, but that’s because her relationship is kind of a taboo topic since i wasn’t really supposed to know + she gets really sensitive when it comes to him.  i recently found out that she also sees a future with him and frankly, i don’t want this man as my brother-in-law not to mention that he’ll probably get worse after marriage since he’ll show his true color  but i also feel bad because she seems happy with him. he spoils her with all he can and he’s working multiple part time jobs to be able to save for their marriage which they’re planning for after finishing their masters.  so,, WIBTA for telling my sister the red flags i see in her bf?	1643031397.0	sbmdl7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmdl7/wibta_for_telling_my_sister_the_red_flags_i_see/	WIBTA for telling my sister the red flags i see in her bf?
ivrhrj3n	I (17F) have three siblings with an 8, 9 and 15 age gap. In a week I am moving countries and have been trying to make time to say goodbye to everyone. I was hanging out with a mate (14F), whilst my mom was in town and my dad was looking after my siblings. For context, my dad has been working non stop for the past few years, sometimes even 20hrs a day, to the point where he slept in hotels halfway during a job (he delivered and assembles furniture all around the UK), now that his job is gone, he has more time to be home. My mum hasn't had a free day since she got pregnant with my youngest sister and I was really glad dad was finally home to give her a break.  So anyway, my mom is in town, my dad is at home with my siblings and I am hanging with my mate in our neighborhood. An hour into the hang out, we decide to get another friend and so we start making our way to her house. At the same time I get a phone call.  I pick up and sounds of children screaming and shouting come through, along with a crying toddler, and then my dad's worried voice, asking whether I could come home to help with my youngest, who should be having her nap at the time. He said she wont stop crying for mommy and he doesnt know how to get her to sleep. I hung up and apologized to my mate, saying I'm going to have to go home, and that I will come back as soon as I can, which would be no longer than an hour. I said I just need to put my sister to sleep.  She argued and said that it isnt fair, that I always choose to go help my family instead of hanging out. I agreed that I do that and it might not be fair, but my family always comes first. I said it will not take long and she can grab our friend and hang with her until I am back. I apologized and ran home.  I managed to put my sister to sleep and calm my brothers down so they wouldnt wake her up in 45mins and went back out. When I called my mate up, she said she aint hanging out with me anymore because I ditched her and obviously I dont like her enough to hang out. I got angry and said 'fine' then went back home and hung out with my dad instead.  AITA?	1643032119.0	sbmm6m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbmm6m/aita_for_going_hone_early/	AITA for going hone early?
11lb03	Spoiler alert for Encanto!  Last weekend I asked my best friend (we are both 40F) if she and her family had seen Encanto, which I loved. She has two boys, ages 6 and 7, so I thought they would enjoy it. She replied she had not but would check it out. Last night I got a message from her saying the movie was great but "you have to warn parents if someone dies. Lots of questions and upset from kids on those parts. We weren't expecting it so didn't prepare them."  At first I was confused, I had forgotten about that scene so I asked, "someone died?" Then remembered and sent an apology for not warning her, saying I had completely forgotten. She responded with "yup, two scenes. One very drawn out with the grief."   I originally felt bad but after the follow up text, I started feeling annoyed. I have a 15 month old so he is still really young and I don't know if this is an unspoken expectation when recommending anything. I don't know what her kids can and can't handle and a lot of Disney movies have some dark themes. I do know she hasn't shown her kids Moana because it's too scary.   Either way, I kind of feel that if there are a lot of things her kids can't watch, she should have asked me if there was anything to look out for instead of expecting me to know what her kids can't see. Alternately, I could be the asshole because maybe this is obvious, you don't recommend a movie for kids that has an upsetting storyline.

4lscoqr4	My (36F) boyfriend (35M) and I have been together for a year. We're currently long distance (I moved out of state at the beginning of the relationship) and plan on closing the gap in the coming year. As we plan to blend families with my daughter (10) and his son (9), his son's mother (Tina) has been a point of contention.  For back story, his son's mother was a stripper at a party when they met, they became "buddies" and when she got pregnant they decided to give a relationship a try. A couple years in, he found out she was cheating and that his son may not be his. He left her and they have been coparenting ever since.  My concern is, Tina calls my boyfriend a lot when it has nothing to do with their son and sticks her nose where it doesn't belong. For example, Tina called and insisted on FaceTime to talk about his dog and the collar and cage not being right and that the dog needed a bath and trim. She called 3 more times that night to discuss various other dog related things. Another time when he was visiting me, she called to ask him how he was traveling back home and when he would be arriving (nothing to do with his visitation). Most times when she calls, conversations can last from 5-20 mins and she calls 1-5 times a day, EVERYDAY. Sometimes, the son isn't even with her or it's not about his son at all. His son has the ability to call him directly when he's not in school so it's not always the son trying to reach him.   What brought this all to a head was my boyfriend received some news about his heart health. He mentions it to Tina and she then sends him some groceries and then wants to discuss vitamins and work out plans. I told him I felt like that was nice of her but I didn't really care for another woman being involved in this journey and that her assistance should end here.  I know Tina is coming from a good place and I don't get the impression she is trying to get my BF, she lives with a BF of her own. We have met a few times before and she's very nice. I coparent with my daughters father so I am not unfamiliar with the importance of communication between parents. I asked him to set some boundaries on the things she should be discussing with him and trying to condense the phone calls. He's in a relationship and simply put, some of this is really not any of her business. Am I the asshole?	1643033402.0	sbn1xi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn1xi/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_set_some_boundaries_with/	AITA for asking my BF to set some boundaries with his son's mother?
350xapu3	My boyfriend and I of several years live in a house with two other people. I don't really have a space of my own where I can get some peace and quiet. I value space to decompress as I get easily overwhelmed by excess noises. However, my boyfriend is a musician. He plays his instruments in the house and it seems like there's never any time where the house is quiet. He uses our extra room where my desk is to play his electric guitar. I can't pursue my own hobbies in our extra room because the guitar is so loud and overwhelming, even when it's "quiet" because his amp is huge. He plays his instruments in our bedroom, in the extra room, in the living room, in the kitchen. He tries to quietly play while we're watching TV together. I know he loves his instruments and it's his hobby, but it's starting to become incredibly frustrating for me to never have any quiet in the house. He will occasionally apologize for his instruments stressing me out, but he continues to play them at all waking hours. I am thinking of trying to set boundaries and ask him to give me quiet hours where there's no instrument playing, or even asking him to drive his instruments over to the music building down the street where he can play in the practice rooms. Would I be the asshole for asking him to stop playing his instruments so often in his own house?	1643033269.0	sbn0cd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn0cd/wibta_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_stop_playing_his/	WIBTA for asking my boyfriend to stop playing his instruments in the house all the time?
iz2fe9pc	I have two bio daughters Emily- 29 and Abigail- 13 and a stepdaughter Grace- 27.  Grace and Emily have never gotten along and my relationship with Emily has never been the best. She is very difficult. Abigail is much closer to Emily which bothers my husband.  When Emily got married 3 years ago Grace was jealous. She was nasty at the dress fitting and called it basic. She made fun of the ring for being too small. She picked a fight with me and her father the morning of, and she got drunk at the reception, cried, left because she was having a panic attack and didn’t talk to anyone for a while.  My husband brushed it under the rug because he said she was lonely and jealous to see Emily get married but that did change my opinion of Grace.   Now Grace is getting married and Abigail doesn’t want to go. She doesn’t like Grace, that’s the number one reason. She thinks most weddings are boring, and Grace is getting married on a private island so we’ll be kind of stuck there for a few days and Abigail has already asked to stay with Emily who isn’t going due to pregnancy.   I’m ok with that and think she should make her own decision. My husband says I’m giving her too much freedom when he reasons are superficial and that we just don’t like his daughter. He’s been sulking for the past couple days and clearly hurt by this. I said since Grace didn’t care about Emily’s wedding, why should Abigail have to pretend to care about Grace’s. My husband feels we are being selfish and judging her too harshly when she was going through something.	1643033561.0	sbn459	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn459/aita_for_not_making_my_daughter_attend_her_half/	AITA for not making my daughter attend her half sisters wedding?
iz3cvte7	I teach at a college that's going back next month to face to face teaching after having been online for most of the last two years due to you-know-what. Our admin is very hard-core about how once we're back, we're back. There's no support for continuing to offer online options, although they've (oh so graciously) told us that if we want to try and accommodate individual students we're allowed as long as we still do most of our teaching in person.   To make a long story short, I've figured out what I'll be able to do for students who ask. It's not ideal, but it should get them through the term. I wish I could do more, but I'm limited by a couple of things. First, because the college isn't supporting this, I have to figure out the technical side myself. It's not a wealthy college, so our classroom tech is horrible - computers struggle to boot up, wireless isn't reliable. I'm going to have to buy some new equipment (and I'm just an adjunct, so the university isn't going to help with that).  Second, I just can't commit to anything that's going to take hours of additional time a week. I've tried hard to give my students as good an experience as possible online, and it just about killed me. It left me working really long hours constantly. I actually wound up on anxiety meds last term because my ability to cope was just gone. I'm in a better place now, but I know I have to be careful.   I really thought I'd figured out a good compromise: I'm recording my lectures and posting them later and offering extensions and virtual office hours. But I've just had a student get really angry with me because I'm not planning to offer a livestream of my classes. They say it's not fair, that if they don't have the chance to listen to the lecture live and take part, then they're not getting the same level of education as people who are there in class.  I've tried to explain that I can't offer a live-streamed class, both for technical reasons and because I honestly don't know how I'd manage teaching the students in class and answering questions/helping the students online at the same time. We're also going to be masked in class, and I have hearing issues that are causing me a lot of worry already (about running discussions and not being able to hear students).   But the student's telling me that I owe it to them to try, that it's not fair if I don't and I obviously don't care about my students. I'm not worried about them complaining to the college or anything (they'll just get told the official line about no online options being provided) but I do feel pretty terrible, like I'm being TA for not trying.	1643033778.0	sbn6ll	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn6ll/aita_for_not_doing_everything_i_can_for_my/	AITA for not doing everything I can for my students?
28em08zt	For context, whenever I get hurt, or get sick, or something scary happens to me (a person starts following me as I’m walking my dog, or a person follows me on the train, etc.), or whatever else really, my mother has this habit of blaming me, or point out that it’s because I did something that caused this to happen. Sometimes I just want her to comfort me, but I almost always get those remarks instead.   It’s infuriating and heart breaking, it’s been a common thing for a long time now. I don’t want to believe that all of those actions are always my fault, but I’m starting to believe that I do hold some fault. Like getting sick, of course that is my own fault for not taking care of myself. But someone following me on the train? I don’t want to think it’s my fault, since I don’t overly dress myself for that reason alone and always mind my business, but she almost always finds something to put blame on me.   Well last night, i was starting to feel sick with my body being sore, my forearm slightly swollen, as well as itchiness (that could possibly be my allergies, I tend to get itchy when the climate chances, but the soreness is a new one). I didn’t workout or do heavy lifting, so idk why I would feel sore. Anyhow, I told my mom I was going to the doctors office, and I would have to miss work for the day. She understood, and then began to raise her voice saying that I shouldn’t have been asking for sips of water or juice from her or my brother while we were watching a movie yesterday (at the time I wasn’t feeling the soreness, and we are all not sick). She was implying that I got sick from taking sips from her cup and my brother’s cup.   When I heard her starting to do the blame thing, my already thin line of patience had snapped. I started to yell at her saying why she always does that, why does she always find a way to pin the blame on me. She tried to talk over me like she always does, but I didn’t let her and kept on talking louder. She got mad and asked that I stop talking, but I stood my ground and kept on trying to convey my message to her head, instead of just her ears. In the end, neither of us apologized, and only after repeating myself multiple times, did she saying some comforting words, not before saying how I should not have asked for sips from their cups.   If there is any info you need, don’t hesitate to ask. Please be as honest as possible. I’m starting to feel guilty for what I’ve done, but a part of me feels good for saying my piece to her.	1643034010.0	sbn9dm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbn9dm/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom/	AITA for yelling at my mom
iz2safl0	My sister, Toni, and my partner, Emma, used to get along well. Then a lot of family drama happened (my parents started the whole thing, we no longer speak to them). Toni blamed Emma for things that weren't true. She also decided to punish Emma and as a result deeply upset our kids. Things were patched up for the most part. Word count limits how much I can add here but Toni was unfair to Emma.  Now Emma tolerates Toni for lack of better word. Emma doesn't hate anyone, it's not in her nature, but she doesn't make an effort with Toni. She doesn't trust Toni either. She is fine with Toni visiting. We really only see Toni two or three times a year and hear from her on birthdays and big holidays. Toni is also child free. I don't know how Toni feels about Emma.   A while ago, Toni had some concerns about "behavior" my daughter was showing. My daughter copied her older cousin and called herself a word she thought meant cute. We told Toni everything was fine. Toni also sent articles to Emma about how to talk to teen girls when they're insecure. Emma said it was just another sign Toni hasn't really changed but she wasn't upset.  This Christmas, Toni got Emma a book on overcoming body image issues. Emma started laughing as soon as she opened it. She said "wow Toni is bold!" I saw the book and immediately felt angry. I'm not only mad on Emma's behalf, I'm upset that Toni would think so little of our parenting.   I also think even if this has nothing to do with our daughter, it doesn't make sense of Emma. Emma is stunning. I'm not just saying that as the person who loves her. I mean really she is gorgeous. I know some people who are good looking have hang ups about body image but Emma doesn't. Even if this gift was for Emma, it's still feels wrong.  I want to confront Toni. Emma told me it's completely up to me. She still is laughing about it. Most of her friends and family are mad on her behalf, like me. She says she can't be offended by anything Toni does. She appreciates that I'm on her side and supports my decision no matter what.	1643035485.0	sbns16	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbns16/wibta_if_i_confront_my_sister_on_her_christmas/	WIBTA if I confront my sister on her Christmas gift?
iz4q6gns	I put aside money when my children went to college in order to buy them their first house. This money was from an inheritance I had received.  The only caveat being that I had to wait a few years between taking the money out. So only one house could bought first.  My youngest was expecting a child with his wife so I bought his house in 2018 first. My oldest was not happy with this but I convinced him it was the better decision.  I can now take out the remaining money to give to my oldest. Well he's now asking me to buy a house for him in the same area as his brother.  But since 2018, house prices have quite literally doubled. The money I put aside can in no way pay for that.  And this has created a huge conflict in my family with my oldest being extremely angry at me. I've apologized but I didn't think the market would be so unaffordable. I offered to give him the entire amount to do as he wishes, as well as leave the difference between his brother's 2021 house value and the cash gift amount given to him from my estate in my will if the money is there.  My oldest took the money, bought a house in a different state and we now have a very tense relationship. I'm incredibly sad that what I thought would be a lovely gift has broken up the family. I feel even worse because this has messed up the relationship between my two sons.

dfpdbiwj	I (21F) work in a dog grooming salon with one coworker (22f), it’s a small and new business and we aren’t very busy.  Our boss recently decided to have his nephew (16m) come in on Saturday for “work experience” he basically explained that his nephew is going down a path he doesn’t like and he’s worried he’s getting mixed in with the wrong crowd, so he wanted him to come in to do some “work experience.”  The reason I use quotation marks is because there really isn’t enough for the kid to do for it to be real “work experience”. Since it’s a new shop we don’t have many customers in and most jobs you need to be qualified to do.  The first couple of times he came in, both my coworker and I, gave him the benefit of the doubt and explained there wasn’t much for him to do. At first I suggested he goes and hands out leaflets for the salon (as suggested by my boss) but when his nephew seemed anxious I told him he didn’t have to, so all he did really was good and wash towels.   More recently this kid started apparently “choosing” to come in. Our boss said he was asking to because he enjoys it. Which was confusing to me cause he barely did anything. So when he came in, we were chatting and I ended up asking him why he chose to come in when there’s such little to do, he explained that his Father was paying him as if it was a days work so he was coming in for easy money. Rightly or wrongly, this made me want him to do more work around the salon.  Unfortunately all there was to do were the things me and my coworker would be to busy to do (while handling dogs). majority of the time that was cleaning up mess from the dogs; slobber, piss, shit and all the other nastiness. It’s not a pleasant job just that’s all there was to do, (which I’d spared him from doing in the earlier days he came in)  The other jobs would come at the end of the day when we would do a deep clean of the salon, so I asked him to clean the bath, which includes pulling all the dog fur out of the drain- again not a nice job. He was reluctant to do it but I just joked saying it’s an easy job when you get past the texture- he did it and I said well done and to put the rubber matts back in properly. Out of no where my coworker told me I was being mean for making him do these jobs, then told the kid not to bother with the matts, which he didn’t.   I didn’t want the kid to do nothing all day, especially after knowing he was getting money. And even though the jobs are “gross” it’s nothing we refuse to do when working. But maybe I shouldn’t have made him do more after knowing he was getting money?

d1magvvd	My daughter is 21F and lives in another city for university. She’s here for the holidays for 2 weeks and since all her friends are still at their universities, she has no one to hangout with but she’s not bothered by that since she wanted to spend time with her family aka us.   Now problem is, all of us are sick (not covid just flu we got tested) and so we still stay in our rooms but 2 days ago we went to a family friend’s wedding which is out of city and daughter didn’t join. But other then that, we’ve been home. Daughter has been bored this entire week saying she’s watched over 50 episodes of her show and she’s tired and wants to do something else with us. I tried to spend time with her by sitting an hour or two with her but that’s it because i really can’t do anything else I’m just tired. However tonight, daughter came to me and said she wanted to drive to the store and get some snacks so she could watch a movie and asked if i could come with her. The store is 5 minutes away but I wasn’t up to it so I said no ask your brother (her brother is perfectly fine, no flu), a while later she came back saying he said no and asked if she could just drive by herself since it’s so close and shouldn’t be a big deal since she has a license and it’s only 6:30 pm. I still said no after which she got angry and said it’s not fair that we don’t spend any time with her and she’s been trapped at home because we’re sick and that it must not even be serious since we attended a wedding thats outside our city and yet I wont go to a store thats 5 minutes away.

i7i27u0n	I (21/f) have been friends with this girl (20/f) for a few years now. Let’s call her Rachel. Around two and a half years ago Rachel started dating her ex girlfriend (20/f). Shortly after they started dating, Rachel got diagnosed with a heart disease and as time has passed, the doctors started making the prognosis that her life expectancy is at around age 32 and that she surely won’t grow old.  Of course all of us were devastated, but we have supported Rachel the best we could eversince, but after around a year of dating, Rachel’s girlfriend broke up with her for other reasons.  Rachel was extremely heartbroken and said that she’ll probably never find love again because “no one would want to date a girl that will die at around age 30 anyways”. Of course I and other friends have encouraged her as much as possible that that doesn’t mean that she’ll have a bad life and that she can still make the most out of her time, even without a romantic partner.  Well two months ago Rachel met a girl (20/f) whom she instantly fell for and they started dating and were very happy. Let’s call her Jennifer. Of course I was extremely happy for her that she met someone even through she thought she never would, but one thing was still concerning to me. Because overtime it became pretty clear that Rachel has kept her disease a secret to Jennifer.  I had a talk with Rachel about it and told her that she has to tell Jennifer as she has a right to know about her short life expectancy before getting involved with her, but Rachel didn’t listen. She said that Jennifer would surely leave her if she found out about it and that she couldn’t risk their new found luck. After trying to convince Rachel for a while without any success, I decided that I needed to take matters into my own hands.  I told Jennifer about Rachel’s heart disease and her low life expectancy and she was shocked. She ended up breaking up because it was simply not the future she had planned for herself.  After finding out that I told her, Rachel was furious and threw a bunch of things at my head, saying that it’s my fault she broke up.  I can see why I might be TA since I mixed myself into their business, but I also feel like Jennifer had every right to know about Rachel’s health status before getting too attached to her, so AITA?	1643036144.0	sbo0bf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbo0bf/aita_for_informing_my_friends_girlfriend_about/	AITA for informing my friend’s girlfriend about her health issues?
5ev259r4	I'm going to keep this as short as I can.  My(23) SIL (17) and her fiance (21) are getting married. They had originally set a date in October. They moved it once to a week after my birthday in May, then again to on my birthday. They moved it so far up because they were raised in a "no sex until marriage" household and are dying to do the deed. I'm annoyed they were so desperate they even moved it to then without any thought but my birthday is actually on a Saturday this year so I have already made plans. WIBTA if I didn't go and just sent a card and a gift? I would've gone if I hadn't already made set plans, it's annoying she did it on my birthday but not the end of the world.	1643036377.0	sbo31o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbo31o/aita_for_not_going_to_sils_wedding/	AITA for not going to SILS wedding
6bz3hqaf	Sorry for the title I don't know how to easily explain this. I also don't post much to bear with me.   So I've always been a pretty straightforward kind of person. I think being truthful with feelings and information is no. 1 99% of the time and I keep that policy with my friends. For some context, my two friends and I have a standing weekly hangout. Last December during our winter break, one of my friends was out of town so I wasn't expecting them, but my other friend said they'd be able to come. The day comes and I'm sitting and waiting and they don't show up. I later text them asking where they had been and I found out that they had band practice beforehand and that they'd just gone out with them after. Ouch. I told them that's fine because I can't dictate what my friends do but (honesty incoming) that it really hurt that they didn't text to tell me that they wouldn't be hanging out. They said sorry and that was that.   Fast forward to just last week. I realized that I really hadn't seen or talked to them except for the weekly hangouts and I'll admit I was feeling super insecure. So I texted them basically "Hey this is a loaded question but are we still friends? I hardly see or talk to you and when we do hang out it feels like you never want to initially"  They didn't respond for hours (which did wonders for my anxiety) and when they finally responded they told me we could still be friends but that we need ground rules and boundaries. I said okay like what and they told me they needed me let them have other friends and hang out with them. I was confused but responded with an apology and (here's where the possible asshole behavior comes in) what I thought was a reiteration of my feelings from when they didn't text to tell me they wouldn't be able to hang out. All they said was that they didn't like it when I guilt tripped then like that.   Did I guilt trip them? Am I in the wrong here?  Tldr: I keep telling my friend how they've hurt me and they say I'm guilt tripping.	1643035703.0	sbnun4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbnun4/aita_for_apparently_guilt_tripping_my_friend/	AITA for apparently guilt tripping my friend?
3xfp3q3o	Last week I (23f) lost my great aunt to a brain aneurysm which resulted in a severe stroke leaving her brain dead. Due to Covid they only allowed my grandmother and her husband to see her. They had to FaceTime me into the room to say goodbye which was very traumatic in itself. This is my first time losing someone very close in my family and someone who I cared very deeply about.   Now, to AITA part, my bf (24) had to put down his cat, who had lived a good life but was suffering. The cat had arthritis in his hips, could barely walk, had tumors, and was barely using the bathroom. He honestly should’ve been put down months ago he was clearly struggling.   I have put down a pet before it is heartbreaking and sad but, I see it as if they are no longer in pain and suffering this is the better option. And boy this cat was SUFFERING it was awful to watch everyday.   My boyfriend has been crying since Saturday about the cat being put down but hasn’t asked me how I’m feeling about my aunts death. Meanwhile I’ve been having to help with funeral arrangements, be there for my mother and grandmother. And organize her memorials and tributes all while trying to grieve myself.   He has told me he doesn’t want me to think he is putting his cats death over my aunts but it really doesn’t seem that way. And keeping in mind he barely took care of his cat his mother whole heartedly loved and took care of the cat everyday. He did not.   Even worse he asks me why it seems I don’t care or aren’t soothing him enough about his cat dying… To be fair I really do not care that they had to put down the cat, he is in a much better place and no longer suffering so…AITA?	1643037278.0	sboetk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sboetk/aita_for_not_caring_about_my_bf_putting_down_his/	AITA for not caring about my bf putting down his cat?
5kdfvzdb	I (F27) have been married to my husband T(M32) for 5 years, he’s great and honestly my best friend. I also have an aunt(65) who has never been married, that I love dearly but she is very old fashioned like most women boomers in the Black community. She has made several hurtful comments to me about different choices that I/T made. For one I decided to keep my last name for my own reasons and T was fine with it. My aunt basically told me I was a bad wife and emasculated him by not taking his name. We also divide domestic labor a ton in our house, she also takes issue with that and thinks a woman should be the keeper of the home. She REALLY has an issue with the fact that we have decided to remain child free. To this she says I’m denying him his legacy/bloodline. All of these comments have hurt and annoyed me. She tries to paint me as such a terrible wife I’m tempted to ask her “where is your husband since you have so much to say?”	1643037006.0	sbobfv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbobfv/wibta_if_i_asked_my_aunt_where_is_her_husband_the/	WIBTA if I asked my aunt ‘where is her husband?’ The next time she berates me about my choices

My son and I have our own cabinet of snacks and foods that I buy, I’m starting to get pissed because my dad will eat my sons snacks. Some of them I’ve taken out since I’ve learned my son don’t eat them and put them in my dad snacks cupboard. I’ve told them not to before but they still do it and yell at me saying how it’s not that big of a deal and how my two year olds won’t eat all of them on his own.   I tend to throw away a bunch of snacks sometimes when it’s been a month or two of having them in the cupboard and not eating them or I give them to my dad for work.

1ghfr9dn	So the other day I took the train to London to compete in a bike race. Unfortunately I’m a student so I don’t own a car, but it is worth noting I booked a bike space on the train (which is free).  On the way back, I made sure to get there earlier so I would have plenty of time to put my bike in the designated space. I have taken different trains in the past and these have all had separate spaces at the end of some carriages to store your bike. However, this train did not offer this and there was no separate space to put a bike. This train company’s solution was for you to put your bike in the disabled area, which also holds 3 folding chairs in case of overflow in the carriage.   So I was instructed to put my bike there. As the train neared the departure time, more and more people came aboard until there were no seats left. I think 6 people were standing, although I did see at least a few single seats where people had put their bags. I felt guilty but I felt there wasn’t a lot I could do, so I just kept quiet and listened to music/scrolled through Reddit. At this point I was standing, but there was a seat directly next to my bike that no one had taken (despite them standing), so I decided to sit down. Soon after I could here the people standing muttering to themselves about how selfish I was. Then they asked me what stop I was getting off at so I told them I was going to be another 20 mins. I apologised and said there wasn’t a lot I could do and that I did everything I could do by booking a bike space and remaining standing until I realised no one wanted that seat. They continued to have a go at me and while I understand their point of view, I can’t see how it’s my fault, they got there late (one of them ran through the doors as it closed) and if anyone is to blame it’s the train company for not offering adequate facilities.

8tqwu3a8	I (21F) live with 3 other females all in their early 20s. We are in college and I’ve known all of them for 2-3 years. One of my roommates (I’ll call her S) has also been my best friend since coming to college, and unfortunately her boyfriend is ruining our friendship.  Since living with S for the past 2 years, her boyfriend has constantly shown up to our place unannounced. At first I tried not to let it bother me, but it just became increasingly annoying and I’ve finally reached a breaking point. He lives about 3 hours away and will literally drive down here out of nowhere and tell no one, not even her. The other week, he showed up while S wasn’t even there and just hung out at our place for 5 hours until she got back home. It made me feel like I had to stay in my room until everyone else came home. The only time I can ever remember him actually asking to come down to visit, my other 2 roommates told him it wasn’t the best time, but he came anyway. S and I have gotten into multiple arguments over this very thing and she always says she’ll tell him he needs to stop doing this but according to her he “won’t listen to me”. The rest of us always ask if it’s okay if we have guests over, so it just makes me feel like “what’s the point anymore.”  Not sure if I’m being irrational, I just wanted some other perspective on this.	1643037964.0	sbongo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbongo/aita_for_not_wanting_my_roommates_boyfriend/	AITA for not wanting my roommate’s boyfriend coming over unannounced?
hzcz6k3u	Throwaway for privacy reasons.  I’m 18+ years old. I like going for walks around my neighborhood because it gives me fresh air and a break from being inside the house all day, because sadly I don’t get to do a lot of stuff with people outside of work/school/etc. (not because of my parents).  My mom’s usually understanding and she isn’t super strict like other parents here, but one issue I have is that she can be kinda overprotective, which means said walks I like to take.  So my mom is usually very weary of me going on these walks, but in the past we had a few discussions which basically boiled down to her getting used to me going on these walks, especially since my dad is on board about it too, and I thought that was the end of it.  Despite these conversations we had, my mom’s still against the idea of me going on these walks/jogs for what she claims to be for my safety. I totally understand why she thinks that way because we have read and heard stories about people being kidnapped almost anywhere, but I still want to do this because I feel that it’s one of the few things I can do as a young adult in the house, without feeling like I have to ask my parents for. I also use this as a way to help prepare myself for when I’m out in public alone, to practice what I should do in case I notice any suspicious characters, if you know what I mean.  Despite my reasoning, my mom is still overprotective of me. She has sent me a lot of news articles about people getting kidnapped or assaulted while out alone and usually says “this is what can happen if you’re not careful” and I understand that, but I feel like things are going a bit far. I tell her that I’m always aware and watching when I’m out, and I even take pepper spray with me for extra measures, but it’s still not convincing enough for her. Whenever I get enough courage to let her know I want to go, she gets all upset and acts like I just told her that I wanted to jump out of a tree or something. Because of this I just say “never mind” and I try to let her “cool down” or whatever.  Eventually she says she’s trying to help me and that she doesn’t want something to happen to me etc and I still try to explain my reasoning but sometimes I feel like it falls on deaf ears. Eventually she gets over herself and gives me the “green light,” but it still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  I know she’s only trying to help me. But I’m an adult now (which she even says so herself but it’s usually for when she wants me to stop doing something) and yet here she is still hovering over me like I’m 16. I don’t know what else to do, and I feel like every time I try to talk about this sort of thing it just gets brushed off, or it’s “wrong.”  I even start to wonder if maybe I’m overreacting. My parents know more about the world than I do, maybe they really are trying to shield me from something that’s a lot worse than it looks. It’s really hard to tell.   So, AITA here?	1643038843.0	sboyr9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sboyr9/aita_for_wanting_to_branch_out/	AITA for wanting to “branch out?”
7wr3kp4h	I have been friends with this guy for a little over a year now. He knows that I carry around my sketchbook around everyday and he regularly tries to take a peak or snatch it away from me whenever i whip it out. There’s some stuff in there that are quite personal and sensitive that i don’t want anyone (especially him) to see, so i’ve told him SEVERAL TIMES no to do that.  However, one day while i was at my lunch break he thought it would be funny to go trough MY STUFF and look through THE ENTIRE THING. The worst part is that he didn’t even tell me afterwards and i had to find out by someone else telling me that he was going through my stuff while i was away. Naturally, I confronted him. Mind you that at the time I was PISSED, but i didn’t want to make a scene or escalate the situation so most of the “confrontation” was just me trying to get myself together and not cry in front of him. What pisses me off even more is that he just stood there, staring at the floor instead of immediately apologizing like a normal human would do. At this point i was like “okay, maybe i need to be the bigger person and ASK him for an apology.” I asked and he did so in the faintest voice ever, but I was so done with whole situation that i told him that i forgive him and pretended it never happened. Of course, he stopped trying to snoop around after this whole thing. But, truth is I still feel like he had invaded my privacy and i’ve felt uncomfortable around him ever since. Am I the Asshole?  P.S.  English isn’t my first language so i’m sorry if some parts didn’t make sense or has any mistakes.	1643038633.0	sbow02	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbow02/aita_for_still_holding_a_grudge_against_someone/	AITA for still holding a grudge against someone that has already apologized for their mistake?
drefcr39	I'll keep this concise. My Sister-In-Law, her Fiance and one of his family members have been living in a house belonging to my Mother-In-Law's estate for 8 years for free. The will named a few specific items to be directly given to my Wife and her Sister but everything else was to be split between the two.   Everything else of value in the estate has been sold or given up in order for the estate to continue supporting the house (Taxes, Utilities, Maintenance). We have met several times to work through the details of the house value and made an extremely fair offer to the Sister-In-Law to buy my wife's interest in the house (38% current market value). Sister-In-Law is unable to purchase the property and has asked for my wife to give her the property since she will be homeless otherwise. Sister-In-Law's argument is since my Wife and I have a house we should give our interest in the estate's house to her. Like most people we have a mortgage for our house and it is much smaller and cheaper than the estate's house (Worth approximately half, less than half the square footage, small residential lot versus several acres).  We instructed the lawyer to begin the eviction process on my Sister-In-Law (and anyone else at the house) so the estate can sell the property and finally close the estate from 2013.  One more detail that will likely change some minds: Sister-In-Law was in an accident last year that has left her unemployed and disabled with no timeline of when she might be able to work again.	1643039267.0	sbp4a0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbp4a0/aita_for_evicting_my_sisterinlaw/	AITA for evicting my Sister-In-Law?
2ac8qrv7	I (29M) am planning my wedding, which will be held this summer. We will have 60 seats, not one more. It rises complexity into planning who we should invite or not.  My father have never been good with money. Like, really not. Speding more than he can afford, staying unemployed while having to look out for 2 young childs (half-sisters to me) and so on. It obviously got him deep into debt.  Also, he left my mother when I was 3 yo, so she raised me alone. I've never been very close to him, and never will be because, while he's kind, he's a pathological liar and a very bad influence overall.  3 years ago, he asked me to help him to reimburse a few months of overdue rent. I lent him 1200$ while being crystal clear I wanted it to be paid back.  We're now 3 years later, I'm getting married soon and I never saw a dime of that money. He recently moved to another country next to where we live and earn much, much more than before (*basically because minimum wage is* ***very high*** *in this country*).  So I decided that his invitation to my wedding would be tied to him reimbursing his debt to me.  **TLDR**: Lent my father 1200$, want him to reimburse me to be invited to my wedding.

draez7kz	First things first I(14F) love my mom(49F), but we do argue very often. (I am not a native English speaker so keep in mind that grammar and spelling mistakes can happen)  A week ago I was sitting on the couch with my family and we were just watching some shows, then my mom suddenly comments that I should shave my legs (while I am young, my leg hairs are very visible and long). So I said why would I, because nobody ever commented on my leg hair other than my mom. She then said: "well, I can see them really clear, and people will think it's ugly", to which I said: "If they think it's ugly than they can f***k off, because I'm not changing for them."  Now I may not have realised that with that sentence I was also saying to her that she should f***k off, because she really hates when I don't shave my leghair (she always shaves her leghair, and I did too but I hated the feeling of prickly legs so I stopped) Now she's just ignoring me, and I think it's because I said that. My dad(49M) is okay with the fact I have leg hair, but he never says anything to my mom about it.  Another thing we fought about are when I wanted to shave my hair off, she asked me if I wanted to be a boy. I said no and I got angry at her, because that's not a nice thing to say, women also can have short hair, so I called her a hypocrite because she's okay with my brother (17M) having long hair. This time my dad sided with her and said I should stop making a big deal out of every little thing.  She always compares me to other people and she also does things that make me feel like the bad person I can understand if I am the AH here, but she does things like this often and I want to know if I'm in the wrong here, because I know I'm not a perfect person.	1643039653.0	sbp9jf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbp9jf/aita_for_fighting_with_my_mom/	AITA for fighting with my mom?
9j1595t9	 Last week, my (18F) childhood best friend S(18F) ended her lease in another province and wished to move back into her mom(43F)'s house. She was forced to move out by her BF(32M) a few months back, but had expressed little desire to return. Her mom had to impromptu clear her a space in their basement as they were painting the bedrooms, but all was good. Second day being there, S got into a fight with her mom about “what her plan was going forward” and hung up the phone in her mom’s face when she asked. Now, in the past, S and her mom have had troubles (mom abusive ex-bf causing a rift between them), but when I tried to convince her that her mom wasn’t as bad as she was saying, just trying to communicate and see if she still wants to live with BF, she was stuck in her mindset.    She started telling me how bad her mom is, that all she does is patronize her and try to ruin her life, and any time I even suggested that might not be the case (I’ve known her mom as long as I've known her and S is a very difficult person to navigate), she twisted what I said to make me sound silly or painted her mom in a bad light unrelated to the situation at hand. I kept talking about what her mom was saying (ex. “I don’t know what you’re going through”) and suggesting that she really wasn’t trying to cause harm. I also suggested giving her the benefit of the doubt when her she was housing S and her aggressive dog (at risk to her own 3 small dogs!). But S kept twisting my words (ex. saying I/her mom was telling her to get rid of the dog, saying her mom's ex-bf caused everything), and we were both getting fairly frustrated with our standstill. Here’s where IMBTA  I got very frustrated with my words being twisted over the discussion, to the point where I kept having to say statements like “you know that’s not what I meant,” “stay focussed,” “what about the rest of what I said?” Eventually, I was red in the face and my voice was raised while she had a more level tone but was dismissing everything, and I was practically pleading with her to get the correct meaning of what I was saying or to take it at face value. This is when S said to me “why are you so angry about it? It’s my life! You don’t get to have a say in it!”   I was shocked, seeing as I had been asking her not to twist my words and I felt that this was unrelated. In my retaliation, I said to her “if you didn’t want my say, why did you keep me around? BF gave you a really good excuse to get rid of me!” and she replied “okay” and hung up the phone on me as well.  I know it was a childish response, and we haven’t spoken for some days, but my GF and sister are telling me I was in the right but I still have my doubts.

iya9jy91	I moved into a new neighborhood this year, I'm renting a room in a share house with a fre housemates, and  the neighbors next door are a family. The other neighbors in the area are also families.   So I started hearing worrying shit from the one family next door, I'll call them the Joneses. Lots of screaming all the time from the parents, like way past what even an old school disciplinarian might think is acceptable.  I first asked some of the other neighbors if they'd heard what I'd heard, trying to figure out if it had been going on for long and if they were also concerned.   A lot of the neighbors were very 'bury their head in the sand' about it, some even going as far to say it was a private family matter and criticizing me for asking.   Anyway after a few weeks of this, my housemates and I were pretty worried. And one night we were drinking at home and heard the parents going off on their kids.   We decided to go intervene and knock on their door. Very much a drunk courage thing since we're a couple of small out of shape ladies lol.   But when we got there we rang the bell then we heard some really crazy screaming from inside and we all looked at each other, had a "oh fuck no" thought at the same time, and ran.   Then to our surprise things seemed calm and quiet in there for over a week. My housemates and I talked and realized maybe the neighbors knew someone could hear and they knew they shouldn't be doing it.   So we thought maybe our drunk idiot asses had accidentally done something useful, let the parents know that not everyone around was just gonna ignore it.   The next time we heard them yelling we wrote a note on a piece of paper saying "we can hear you, we will be calling the authorities if you continue being abusive"   And we ran over and stuck it on the door then rang the bell and ran.   Since then we haven't heard any more scary shit from their house and we're hoping it actually stopped for good, like they realized not everyone around was happy to treat it like "what goes on behind closed doors isn't your business"   But when we told some of our other friends about it, they thought we had been really cowardly to basically ding dong ditch the neighbors instead of actually stopping to talk.  I argued back saying we had to stay safe, and my friends thought that we still weren't going about it the right way.

ddourvba	This happened earlier summer. So I’m in a friend group of about 5 girls not including myself. We’re all either 18 or 19. It’s relevant to the story that only 3 of us are “skinny” and the other 3 are bigger girls. Now the other two skinny girls don’t have abs or anything and I’m pretty sure it’s just genetics bc they eat like pigs sometimes (me included lol) Recently I’ve gotten into working out. Not anything super major (I’m too scared to go to the gym). I’ve done a few of Chloe Tings challenges and it’s rewarded me with a body I’m actually proud of. I don’t quite have washboard abs but they’re definitely defined. My friend has a birthday in June and a pool so a lot of the times we like to swim for her birthday party/get together. I never told my friends that I was working out or that I had gotten abs since i didn’t think that was something you just tell people. This is where all hell breaks loose.  So we get there and give our birthday wishes. As we get ready to dive into the pool one of the skinny friends makes a comment on my abs. I told her that I had gotten into exercising and was very proud of my results. She praised me on it and started asking me what I did and what I ate, etc. I noticed the other girls were really quiet but I didn’t really question it because I was still answering my friends questions.  Later after we left my other skinny friend (I know this is a bad way to describe them but it’s easier than coming up w fake names) texted me telling me what an AH I was to “brag” about my body and that the other girls were uncomfortable and self conscious of their own bodies. They all thought that since it was my other friends (one of the bigger girls) birthday, I stole the spotlight from her. She said I should’ve worn something more conservative (granted I was wearing this really cute bikini). I explained that stealing the spotlight was never my intention and that i didn’t even bring up anything about my abs it was our other friend. Needless to say there was an argument  and ended with me saying that just bc some of our friends were insecure doesn’t mean that I need to cater to their insecurities and cover myself up.  So she spilled all that to the girls and they blew me off and ignored me. We’ve since hung out again but this is a sore topic that I don’t dare bring up. Thinking back maybe I was the AH for not covering up and being more considerate of my friend	1643040909.0	sbpqsc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpqsc/aita_for_bragging_about_my_body_and_not_covering/	AITA for “bragging” about my body and not covering up?
g2wahgr9	In Jackson Wyoming at an amazing cafe. Me and gf. Seven two seat tables. Super busy.  People waiting for tables. We order breakfast. My gf decided to stop eating and instead read the newspaper for a solid 25 mins without taking a bite. After an hour I said we should be polite and leave. She said she was having a lovely morning and she can stay and enjoy her morning. I said it’s not polite to stay that long. Big fight about this. People were taking food to go because no tables.

gkozva39	Here is the thing, my dad has been losing his hearing since the last decade, but he refuses to use his hearing aid because he says it bothers him too much. There is no human power that convinces him to do it, he just says no. This means you basically need to shout to him for him to understand you. This is tiring to both my vocal chords and my own hearing,  and makes speaking outside basically impossible because everyone would hear it.   Recently, I noticed that he has way more trouble hearing high pitched sounds and voices, and while I am a male (21M) ,my voice is in those higher tones. Taking this into account, I tried speaking with a the deepest voice I can, imagine a pretty bad imitation of Jame Earl Jones/Darth Vader, and amazingly enough, IT WORKS!   When I speak to him with this funny voice, in a normal volume, he perfectly hears me. But he HATES it. Because he thinks it's stupid and  disrespectful. And I get why he gets mad but it's way more convenient. Both he and my aunt (his sister) say I am an asshole for this, so ...

iyfb4kvn	Me (24M) and my girlfriend (23F) of two years went out to an asian restaurant yesterday. I’m a white guy, she’s asian, and she had been saying all before we went how I shouldn’t be afraid to try the real Chinese food that they have there, and I kept saying I was looking forward to it because I love trying new things, but every time I said that she just raised an eyebrow and went “we’ll see…”     Well we got there and the menu was in Mandarin with English subtitles and they had all kinds of things on it I’d never even imagined. It looked awesome. I ordered jellyfish tentacles over vinegar as an appetizer and she just went “okay, I get it, ha ha, ordering the weirdest thing on the menu just to prove me wrong.” And she like…wouldn’t believe me when I really enjoyed the dish. She tried some and just went “whoa, oh my god, there’s no way you like that” and I just went “well would you like to come take a seat inside my brain so you can tell for sure?” And she just rolled her eyes. I ordered the fried pork intestine, I’ve had tripe and I liked that so I figured this would be cool, and the waiter was trying to discourage me from ordering it because he didn’t think I would like it. As soon as he said that my girlfriend just pounced and was like “yeah no he wouldn’t like that, don’t order that, order something you would like, order fried rice or something” and I was like “No, I want to try fried pork intestine, and I’m ordering fried pork intestine. I am not here to try fried rice, you can get that anywhere. I’m here for something I can’t get anywhere else.” And the waiter just cautiously took down the order, and GF was like “well..you didn’t have to be like that.” I didn’t even raise my voice.       So I finally get the pork intestine, one of the chefs pokes his head out of the kitchen to watch me eat it, and it was incredible. I asked my GF if she wanted any, she made a weird face and said “no, obviously, you went and ordered the grossest thing possible just to make a point.” and accused me of being passive-aggressive. I ate it all and wished there was more and all the way home she was saying how I’m passive-aggressive and she can’t believe I did what I did, and when we got home I just said “Look, I can’t believe you’re upset that I ordered food from a place you took me to, and you’re even more upset that I liked it.” She said “If you’re gonna be like this about my culture, then you are never meeting my parents.” I mean, idk, maybe I was being passive-aggressive and just didn’t realize it, people can be passive-aggressive unconsciously right? I thought I was ordering what interested me and eating food I enjoyed, and I’m probably gonna go back to that place without her because the food was straight up fire, but maybe I should have ordered something “less asian” so it doesn’t look like I’m bragging about how I can handle asian food, idk. Sometimes I feel like she should just be with an asian guy so she can be with someone she believes.	1643041355.0	sbpwyv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpwyv/aita_for_ordering_fried_pork_intestine_at_a/	AITA for ordering fried pork intestine at a Chinese restaurant my GF took me to?

iz6qhzl7	My(29F) BF (27M) has bipolar disorder due to C-PTSD. His PTSD occurred 12 years ago due to an earthquake happened in his birth town while they were visiting (Van, Turkey) and he still has flashbacks and he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 4 years ago due to a deadly manic episode that made him end in a high-level mental health institute. His episodes are really subsided but when he is in mania, he spends without a control and I have seen him spent 200k Euros in 2 weeks. Luckily his parents are rich but they really despise their son because he is "sick and damned(due to him being bisexual)" and he is not "a man can hold a family". Luckily he lives in a different country(Germany,where we live) since he is in high school and they only see him occasionally but they give him all the money he wants(he also has a share in their family company and it is also a good constant support) so he won't come close to them. It is a weird relationship to be honest,they are basically saying "We will give all the money you want,just stay out of our life."   We are dating for 2.5 years and our relationship has been nothing but wonderful but when he asked my hand for marriage, honestly I got scared. I know how much he can spend and I know how far his mania can go so I know it is something that makes me terrified. I don't come from a low income family but we are not rich either, I can't spent 200k euros in two weeks. I said I would marry you but I want to be your custodian.I can not handle this kind of financial insecurity and if we ever plan to have kids,they need a constant support moneywise and I would be the financial manager of the house.I can not handle any kind of extravagant spendings and financial insecurities.He accepted and we have contacted with a lawyer for this process.The agreement we have come is he will have 10.000 euro of spending money but if he has to go higher, he will have to ask me to go higher and he can not buy anything more than 1.500 euro in one bill. Also,I will take over all of his share and investment accounts and I will be the one to talk with his financial adivsor behalf of him.   His parents said "Now he is your problem now" to me and they said they will happily oblige to this but our friend group said I was emasculating him and making him look like a 13 year old teenager and now I have doubts about the whole process.AITA?	1643041289.0	sbpw2e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpw2e/aita_for_putting_the_condition_of_me_being_his/	AITA for putting the condition of me being his custodian for us to get married?
iz6g5w65	I (34M) regularly snore and it can wake up my wife once or twice a night if she's not wearing earplugs. If she wears earplugs to sleep it's fine, but she doesn't like to do this because she says she cannot hear if our toddler (2.5M) has woken up or needs help at night. (FWIW he has never needed help at night, except for once when he got his leg stuck in the crib and definitely yelled loud enough to wake both of us up immediately, earplugs or not.)  I recently had surgery to help fix my snoring, but I am not yet fully recovered from it (takes 2 weeks) and it's actually made the snoring worse as I'm really congested while I heal from the surgery. As I have been recovering, my wife has been really annoyed with my sniffling, shooting me annoyed looks and putting in earplugs when we're just reading in bed. The other night before bed she seemed really annoyed and I asked her what was up and she unloaded on me about how she can't be empathetic about my sniffling and snoring while I'm recovering because it's disruptive to her sleep, and how she's frustrated that I'm so hard to sleep with.  I pretty much lost it at this and told my wife that her being frustrated at me for this was unacceptable and that she was being rude and insensitive. I generally feel like crap right now (super congested and generally tired), and I got this surgery in order to fix my snoring in the first place at my wife's urging, and now after I got the surgery she's annoyed at me for something that I can't control, which was done (at least partially) for her benefit in the first place. She seems to think that this is a reasonable thing to be frustrated about and I should be doing more to help her sleep better, or should just not sniffle while I'm around her while I'm recovering. I really can’t believe not just the lack of patience but the apparent disgust with how i sound while I am trying to recover from a surgery that I got in the first place to try to make this problem improve.  Am I the asshole for blowing up at my wife and telling her she is rude and insensitive over her reaction to my snoring after surgery?	1643041398.0	sbpxk7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbpxk7/aita_for_telling_my_wife_32f_she_is_rude_and/	AITA for telling my wife (32F) she is rude and insensitive about my snoring after surgery?
3741d31p	So… This needs some explanation… I haven’t actually said anything to him yet, but I was raised in a bad household, so I don’t know what’s morally correct most of the time. So I’m here to check myself before I wreck myself.  Come summer, my Boyfriend (22 FtM) and I (23 F) are going to be moving in together. We have a great deal set up in in a state away from both our families (we both come from abusive households), and we’re really excited to actually be in a healthy household. I legit wanna marry this man, I just wanna live with him for a year before that.  Here’s what I’m struggling with… I’m worried about what’s going to happen when the Holidays come around… I am iffy on his mother and brother coming over, but can handle them. The problem is his dad. His dad has NPD, but to me this is no excuse, as I also have a personality disorder (BPD) and I’m not like this. This man in the past has physically abused my bf, and after he couldn’t due to a car accident, he continued to gaslight and manipulate him, constantly misgendering him, and making him feel terrible about his body. This is just what I’ve been told, he says worse stuff has happened, he just doesn’t want to talk about it… Due to this, I am not comfortable with his dad coming over at all… But he’s talked about having his family over for holidays, and I don’t know if I’d be the asshole for saying he can’t have his father over… I dont know, would I be the asshole for this? I worry for his safety, but I don’t wanna be a manipulative asshole…  TLDR: I don’t want my boyfriend’s abusive father coming over, WIBTA for telling my BF this?	1643041590.0	sbq03i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbq03i/wibta_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_cant_have_his/	WIBTA for telling my boyfriend he can’t have his father over for the holidays?
bwdn4riw	I live near a coffee shop that operates from a cart. They are a tiny shop with usually one person on but sometimes two.   Their cart is on the property of a restaurant, and I’m not a fan of the restaurant but the cart coffee is honestly some of the best I’ve ever tasted.   They run from 8-3 or so but it usually suits me to come around 2:50-3, but occasionally much, much earlier. Today I came just at 3 and saw the barista was still serving so I hopped in the queue, with a group of women following behind me. As she started steaming the person in front of me’s drink, she announced to the queue that they could order the coffee from the restaurant because the cafe was no longer serving past 3. Bear in mind it’s 3:01 ish and I had probably been in the queue right at 3 if not 30 seconds before.   Let me preface by saying the restaurant coffee is just not good. They say it’s the same but it’s made by the waitstaff (not baristas) and it really isn’t what I’m there for. I also am very health conscious and was mindful of going into a restaurant during a pandemic just to order a coffee. The women behind me must not mind because they went into the restaurant but I figured I’d ask for my usual. The barista turned around to finish serving the person ahead of me and didn’t even look at me. Bear in mind I know her since I come here a lot. She knows my usual, always smiles and chats and I’ve even asked her for some treats as she was locking up once and she said she had wrapped them up for the night a while ago but was extremely apologetic and remembers to offer me treats every time.   When the person left she finally looked at me. I ordered my usual and she repeated “I’ll just ask you if you could order inside since I’ve gotta close up out here.” I asked if she’d make an exception since I’m covid conscious and she said just this once but seemed… off. I thanked her again for serving me and she said no worries, but as she was closing up, I was sitting in their outdoor area on my laptop and she would not look or smile at me as she usually does and was barely looking my direction even though it was like 3:05 by the time she made my order — 2 minutes later than if I hadn’t ordered.   I know what people say about going to a place at closing time but I was in the queue just in time. I think she would’ve happily made the exception for me if it weren’t for the group behind me, and only asked us all to go because there were 3 or 4 of them. And I’m just wondering if I’m missing something because she acted happy to serve me one minute but was then colder than usual.    TLDR: I asked a familiar barista if she’d serve me past close (2 minutes) because the alternative meant I’d have to go inside during a pandemic and order worse coffee. I was in the queue in the nick of time and at first she resisted but after a big “please” relented, but then seemed much colder than usual while closing as I sat nearby on my laptop.	1643041648.0	sbq0v4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbq0v4/aita_for_just_liking_my_coffee_the_way_i_like_it/	AITA for just liking my coffee the way I like it?
38jtixlf	My(18m) brother(18m) (both white btw) keeps using slurs when in my room and just out and about. He won't say them around the people it effects, and states that "We're the only people in the room, or chill out". I've tried to explain that he can't just use these words whenever he pleases and that they hold awful meanings. He still fails to see what's wrong, so my dilemma is if I cut him off from the computer he can't draw or practice, and it's not like he depends on this for money as we live at our parents, but I want him to see that his words have consequences.

iz3kiitp	My brother and SIL got engaged August 2020 and set a wedding date of 1/21/22. When they got engaged, COVID was rampant, which is why they chose 2022, in hopes that it would have subsided. Also, they live in WI, where January is cold and snowy, adding to COVID, cold and flu season. My SIL asked me to be a bridesmaid and I agreed - even though I live in MI. I began dating a guy mid-2021 and was allowed a plus 1, so we RSVP'd and picked our meals. He went out and got a nice suit. We were excited-booked our hotels, split the cost of each, (one for when we got into town and then one where the wedding was being held). Our bridesmaid dresses she picked out ran about $300 total, after the dress, shipping and alterations cost. I work as a paralegal for my local county - I'm not making huge money, and with bills and student loans, I pretty much live paycheck-to-paycheck, and my mother knows this. I saved all year for this wedding from tips working at a bar on the weekends, but we weren't able to open until June 2021, so I had about 6 months of savings ready. Important - my mom and I don't get along the best, I'm the black sheep of my mom's side of the family (parents divorced, this is important for later). My mom already was on my case because the cost of things for the wedding kept increasing (hair, makeup, shoes, jewelry, etc) so I decided to do my own hair, makeup, borrow shoes and jewelry from my friend to keep my costs within my budget. I couldn't make it to the bridal shower or the bachelorette party (in Chicago, where the minimum cost was $465 per girl) but I did send her gifts at the shower and money for drinks during her party. About 1.5 weeks before the wedding, my boyfriend gets REALLY sick. He ends up going to the hospital 2x with an infection, gets antibiotics, they help, but not enough. I let my mom and SIL know that he's not going to make it to the wedding. My mother demands that I pay for his rehearsal dinner and the wedding dinner because he wasn't coming anymore - never ONCE asks how he's doing, hope he gets better, nothing. I told her no because it's not like he just decided to not come, he's SICK. My mom also told my dad to pay for his mother's meal because she also couldn't make it (SHE WAS GETTING A PACEMAKER!) and for my aunt and uncle who ended up staying behind to take care of her. My SIL had mentioned earlier in the week that other people had also notified her that they were not coming anymore for whatever reasons. After the wedding when again my mom demanded I pay her, I finally flipped and told her she needs to send a bill to every single person then who didn't make it, not just me and my dad's family. She told me my brother and SIL could choose to do that if they wanted to, but my dad and I had to pay back because we are family and it was "embarrassing" to have 4 open seats at our family table. I told her I'm not paying unless everyone who wasn't able to make it also has to pay.

ijgbbj8b	Posted before here - gist is I started a lot of successful businesses and helped others do the same. As a result, I'm influential in multiple industries in my home state and several others. I also run a recruitment agency which is huge in my state as well as being used for my own internal recruiting.  Mark (not his real name) is a guy who used to bully me in high school. I have OCD, and he would mess with me to try and get me to have some kind of breakdown. I'm also straight, but I had a bicurious phase filled with him calling me homophobic slurs.  He's recently returned to my state. I'm not sure why, odds are it's COVID related like everything is these days. He knows vaguely that I run businesses but I'm not sure he realises how much I'm involved in and how much of the recruitment in my state is done through my agency, or even that I run it.  I've had a few versions of Mark's resume come across my desk (tailored to separate fields) recently - for context I get a weekly report of all new candidates with particular people (such as those with job history gaps, which Mark had because each tailored resume had the work experience in the other fields removed) flagged for my personal approval. Helps us maintain the top spot as best recruitment agency so everyone keeps on using us.  This is how I know he's returned to my state by the way, I'm not up to date with my former classmates otherwise. He's never apologised to me, and last I checked he grew up to be a pretty average dude who makes jabs at left-wing political figures on Facebook but isn't a conspiracy theorist or anything.  I've got an email in my drafts right now which essentially says "bin this guy's resume if it comes past us (recruitment agency) again" as well as a less professional one to all my business owner friends which says "this is the guy I told you about from high school, do not hire him at any cost". I'm wondering if I should hit send. If I do not want him to have a decent job in my state, he probably won't.  I'm worried about being the asshole because moving back to your hometown alone generally signifies something's already gone wrong, and I'm not sure if disrupting his potential to make a living is the right thing to do in that case. I also feel like what he did to me in high school isn't all that bad, I was never traumatised or super torn up about it, just very irritated and angry.  However, I kinda just don't want him to stay in the state for too long because I can't stand the idea of him being here and maybe preventing him from working will drive him out. I also have a professional reputation on the line in that if he's the same person he was in high school, I don't want him to fill any positions for my client companies because I feel like he'll do a bad job and cause stress in the workplace.

iz6jyb0x	I run a tennis clinic and I pay the county to rent a tennis court during a specific time (business use permit). (The only way to rent courts is for business use, you don’t have to pay for recreational use but you can’t reserve them for that.) The courts are technically supposed to be numbered but there are no signs indicating which court corresponds to which number. My permit states that I get “court 5,” but again, no actual way to tell what is court 5. I’ve been renting this court for years and have always used a specific court bc it’s the one on the end next to the entrance. I always use this one bc: 1) it’s furthest from the other courts so less chance of kids getting hit by stray balls; and 2) kids and parents don’t have to walk behind or interrupt other matches to come in and out. When I got there about 15 before my clinic I saw there were people using that court. No problem, happens all the time, I just let them know that I have that court rented starting in 15 min and then wait for them to wrap up until my time begins. These people started arguing with me, saying there’s no way to rent courts here. I showed them my permit, then they started saying this is actually “court 1,” and that my permit is for the other court on the far end (also occupied by people). By this time, my class had started showing up so I told them that if they didn’t leave and stop yelling (they were cursing), I would call the police. They did eventually leave but they emailed the county. Was I the AH for kicking them off the court? Technically, they could have been right in that there’s no way to tell which court is which. The county sided with me by saying the paid permit holder has priority but didn’t clarify the court numbers. I’ve seen those guys a few times since then, and I can hear them complaining about me to other people very loudly.	1643042734.0	sbqfb8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqfb8/aita_for_forcing_people_to_stop_using_a_tennis/	AITA for forcing people to stop using a tennis court bc I had paid to rent one of the courts?
4c4xf9b5	So I(F19) have been wanting to move out of my parents house for a while now. I work full time and have a decent bit of money saved up for expenses. I wanted to move to New York for multiple reasons, one of which being I would get an apartment with my best friend so I wouldn't be alone and would have someone who already knows their way around the area.  My parents have expressed that they don't think I should move out for a few more years because they don't think I'm mature enough. They've threatened to take my car, which is in their name but I'm paying for, if I leave.  They've expressed a lot of controlling and abusive behavior the past couple of years and I really just want to get away from them. I'm not even their first child to move to another state, except I most likely wouldn't cut contact like my sister did.  I had planned to tell them and threaten to cut contact if they don't at least help me figure out how to move my bank accounts and other stuff like that. I'm completely fine if they take my car because they bought it, I'm just paying them back for it; I just would want what I've already payed them back minus the money needed to fix the bumper(I backed into a pole a year ago and knocked it out of place but nothing even worth being concerned about).  I just want to get away from my hometown because there are too many bad memories and I'm young enough for a fresh start.	1643042586.0	sbqdca	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqdca/wibta_for_moving_to_new_york_against_my_parents/	WIBTA for moving to New York against my parents wishes?
g2buz8ki	The big day is in May and my fiance and I already decided on the guest list. It's going to be a smaller wedding and we only have married or long term partners (like 1+ year) getting plus ones.   My (28f) sister (23f) is dating a new guy.. Lets call him D (30m). D is a nice guy but I'd be lying if I said I liked him. Hes a walking red flag and this is my sister's first real relationship so she doesn't see or care enough to do something about it.   As the wedding day gets closer, my sister (who is also my maid of honor) has basically done nothing to help. I've had to ask one of my bridesmaids to step up and help me with the Bachelorette party, the bridal shower, etc because my sister has been with her boyfriend. She didn't even come to try on dresses with me because D was having a few friends over for some fight.   The other day my sister told me that D was going to match the groomsmen for the wedding... Like she gave him a swatch of her dress so he could get a tie the same color and is getting the same color suit, vest and pocket square. I was a little taken back and was like "well he's not invited so I don't know why he needs all of that"  My sister immediately (bc I think she knew I wasn't going to be for it) started screaming about how I wasn't being fair, how I just want her to be bored and lonely for the rest of her life, I hate her happiness and a bunch of other stuff. I told her they've only been together for 2 months and she's literally only known him for like 4 months maybe. She said it doesn't matter and she's not coming to my wedding if he can't come.  My sister has a WHOLE table for her friends(8), they're flying in from all over the country and I let her invite them so she would have something to do at my wedding because a lot of my friends are from college and what not.  So D was over this weekend and I had to come home for my makeup trial (that my sister agreed to come with originally but didn't end up bc she and D wanted to try some new restaurant) and he was basically like "Your parents are paying for most so techinally you don't have any say over the guest list, see you in May"  My fiance flipped out and told him he was absolutely not coming especially after that and my sister and him got in to it. We left and I called my parents who told me that they hate everything going on but this was my wedding not hers so I needed to do what makes me happy.  A few of my bridesmaids are on my side but one in particular said that I was TA for even having that rule in the first place but it's not like I'm the first to have it, right? I feel like a lot of people do that but I always imagined having my sister stand next to me when I get married. The thought of her missing it over something I can change is what's killing me.   So AITA for not inviting my sisters new bf to my wedding?  Tl;Dr- my wedding has only long term couples getting plus ones.

d94zzq01	Im just looking for a bit of input and advice here  So to summarise I currently pay £550 a month child maintenance towards a child of my own and a step daughter that my ex had before we got together.  6 months after we split up she decided to move to Leeds (250 miles away from where I live with her new partner)  I have no issue with paying what I am paying for the children, I earn decent money and try to provide the best I can. I also singlehanded have to fund trips to see the children as well as hotels to spend a weekend with them.  As the COVID regs have changed she can no longer work from home and now she is demanding a further £130 a month towards childcare. I cannot afford to do so on top of my current maintenance and what I pay in travel/weekend expenses with them.  i really need some advice on this. Am I wrong for saying no?  thanks	1643042893.0	sbqhgp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqhgp/aita_for_not_paying_for_more_child_maintenance/	AITA for not paying for more child maintenance than I can afford
9qdvf5bw	First time posting and in mobile so sorry for the format.   I want to know if I WBTA if I did not attend my sister in law's baby shower.   My sister in law announced she was pregnant in late July, I have struggled with infertility but was happy for her.   Late August me and my boyfriend had found out we were expecting and we were over the moon excited.  Unfortunately in October we were told our baby had no heart beat and I had a D&C.  Now my sister in law lives 2 hours away from us and the rest of my boyfriend's family. And the baby shower is being held the 2 hours away. My boyfriend's mother and his other sister do not drive.   I feel going to the baby shower will absolutely tear me apart knowing that I should also be planning my baby shower and getting ready for my baby. I just don't think it's something I can emotionally handle. But the thing is, if I don't go my MIL and other SIL will not be able to go if I do not, due to not driving.   TLDR; WIBTA for not going to my SILs baby shower after having a miscarriage which also means my MIL and other SIL cant go to the baby shower?	1643043146.0	sbqky6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqky6/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_my_sils_baby_shower_and/	WIBTA if I didn't go to my SILs baby shower and now my MIL/SIL can't go
awmh3wrs	I haven’t decided either way, but I am already feeling kind of like an asshole and I figured I would get some outside views.  Just received an invite to my cousins wedding , and I don’t really want to go.   A little background, he is my younger cousin and growing up I would visit often, send cards and letter and call him regularly, and he would visit me.   We drifted apart as we got older, which is fine.  What made me kind of finally let go of the friendship part of it was when his sister got married and he said, “It’s like getting the brother I never had” and it stung a little. I had always felt like he was a younger brother to me and it was a little bit of a shock finding out that he didn’t feel the same.  Now back to the present, I’m not holding a grudge or anything, we just haven’t talked (except maybe a couple random texts on holidays) over the last several years.   I know it will cause a ripple in the family if I dont go, but I would have to kennel my dogs, drive a little over 4 hours one way to get there to be around people who havent been a part of my life in years, spend the night and drive back the next day.   I am already getting stressed about it.  Thoughts?	1643043314.0	sbqnbr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqnbr/wibtah_wedding_invite/	WIBTAH wedding invite
qvhqzdf	Aita for unfriending a friend of 9 years? We met in high school when I was a freshman, she was a junior. She had a very outgoing and fun/scary personality. She was the person I always wanted to be. 4 months into our friendship, I came out of the closet as Bi. The reason I came out was because I realized I had feelings for her. Major feelings. I was upfront about it to her and she said she had feelings for me too. But she had a BF at the time, so if they breakup, we can be together. I held onto that hope for weeks, then months, then years. It's not like she was still with that one guy. She kept getting with someone new and always had an excuse but convinced me to keep waiting. I was madly in love with her for 5 years. 6 years into our friendship, I moved in with her and her husband. I finally realized it was never going to happen between us but I still wanted to be friends and I really tried for as long as I could. Her husband is toxic and over the years since she left for college, she became really toxic too. Today, I don't even recognize her anymore. She's clearly an alcoholic and a sex addict. She LOVED to rub it in my face that she was willing to sleep with any other girl in the world that's not me. She's always known how I felt so it hurt when she did that. Whenever she and her husband get into a fight, if I'm around, she bullies me and treats me like a target. If shes having a bad day, then so am I. Not long after I moved in, I met a guy, we started dating and fell in love. She did not like him. Even though he's treated me better than any other guy I've been with, she made it very clear she had a problem with him. I realized it's because I'm no longer held under her thumb that runs to her at her Beck and call. I was his. After 8 months of living with her, I couldn't take it anymore and I moved in with my now husband. She invited me to parties every few months but every time I tried to make plans, she blew me off. Every time I invited her over, she blew me off. And the few times we did spend time together, she would fight with her husband and treat me like garbage or like I wasn't there. And if she didn't get something she wanted, she would throw a temper tantrum, lock herself in her room and go as far as threaten to hurt herself.   Here's why I feel like an asshole. She has cancer. Stage 4 Osteosarcoma. She is a rare high functioning cancer patient. I can tell she's in a ton of pain all the time, she needs a wheel chair most of the time and everyday, something would pop out of place. She says she's had it since she was 13 and she holds it over our heads saying she could die any day. She's 25 now.  Honestly, for the last 3 years, the only reason I've even talked to her is because of this. I can't take feeling the horrible way she makes me feel though. Am I the asshole?	1643043322.0	sbqnfi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqnfi/aita_for_unfriending_a_friend_of_9_years/	AITA for unfriending a friend of 9 years?
9novqt4p	Backstory: Roommate and I have lived together peaceably for 8 years..Through many relationships for each of us. We recently decided to try a go of it with a brand new bf of his.(🚩🚩)..Had some bumps but seemed to be going good at 1st.  Turns out that said relationship obviously did not work out. Roommates then boyfriend decides to decides to take off and move out (all his stuff is still here) 4 days before Christmas and not pay rent. Lease is now broken and we are scrambling to look for a place.Now ex boyfriend is sleeping here 2 days a week minimum.I am able work with that. What I can't work with is: WHY does roommate and ex bf think it is ok for ex bf to stay after roommate gets up and leaves for work? It is not MY guest to have here. I rarely get alone time and really appreciate it before work.Now it is becoming an *issue* between 2 people that have lived well together..Even other boyfriends that were guests left when they were supposed to. I know I don't like or care for the roommates ex bf.However I was raised to be polite to a guest in my home.  AITA: For expecting ex bf of roommate to go when he goes to work? And roommate needs to make it clear to his guest? Otherwise this "guest" will be sleeping ALL damm day!!  I expect him to be a good guest and leave when the person you are visiting is no longer there..(Ex bf live 20 min away at parents place).   I have tried talking  To my roommate that this is pushing my boundaries. And that I do not feel comfortable having his ex sleeping in the bed while I'm home. When ex bf left it got aggressive and he pushed me.Trying very hard to keep it chill. But feel my boundaries are 100% disrespected.	1643043585.0	sbqr65	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqr65/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_have_his_guestsex/	AITA for asking my roommate to have his "guests"(ex bf and ex roommate) leave when he does?
5i1r9a44	Am i the ashole for not wanting to eat with my dads part of the family? My grandad recently died, of course I am attending the funeral. But I’m not really close with that part of the family. Just about a year ago I cut all contact with my dad, since I don’t want anything to do with him, or that side of the family. After the funeral they want to go to my late grandads house and eat pizza (which my late grandad hated)  Personally I think I’m not, since I have valid reasons for not wanting to have any contact with my dad or his side of the family.	1643044053.0	sbqy0k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqy0k/aita_for_not_wanting_to_eat_with_my_dad_and_his/	AITA for not wanting to eat with my dad and his part of the family after my grandads funeral
8hpgypjv	Sorry for the awkward text, but I am in a really emotional state of mind right now.  So I dated this girl online for a month and we never met IRL due to a distance of 2000km. We Facetimed each day from the morning hours until we fell asleep together in the evening. We talked about (and enjoyed) intimacy online and we called us a couple. We counted the days to meet… We we’re both quite happy. Until one day where she has sent me a screenshot from Instagram where a random dude asked her for sex on instagram.  She joked with the guy and rejected the guy in the screenshot, but I didn’t feel well about it and asked her why she has sent me the screenshot and why she responded to the dude at all. Her mind swapped 180, she said I’m insecure and I want to control her, she saw a “huge red flag” and that she doesn’t know if she is the right girl for me and that she isn’t my therapist if I have issues. I didn’t want to fight and I responded that I’m not insecure and that I’m sorry and I wanted to go on like before. From that moment I felt that something’s off for her even though she said everything is fine. Her enthusiasm was gone.  After that she kept making excuses why she can’t come over and I confronted her. She basically said that she wants an open relationship and that we’re not comfortable. I accused her of playing games with me because she never told me about that before.  She responded that, well, we’re not compatible, but that we could stay friends. And basically that she can’t become jealous and that she open relationships before.  We continued with small talk like nothing happened after some days of pause and today I’ve sent her a picture which I’ve sent to all of my friends - me with a funny costume and 2 girls to my side in my arms without further context and a caption that my weekend was funny. I reflected beforehand if it’s problematic to send this specific picture to her due to what happened. I thought well, we are friends, her potential bf sleeps with others, she said she can’t get jealous, so it should be alright.  She accused me of being toxic, of gaslighting her, of wanting to make her jealous. She said she can’t be made jealous, that her bfs sleep with others, and that I had no success making her jealous because she doesn’t want anything from me. I said that I accepted that we aren’t compatible for a relationship and that I thought we’re just friends and that my intentions with the picture weren’t to make her jealous and that I didn’t think I even could, basically just what she told me some weeks before. After further escalation I blocked her and I didn’t feel well.  AITA for sending that picture? Should I have known that she could get upset? Or did she just search for reasons to fight?	1643043726.0	sbqt8u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqt8u/aita_for_sending_a_picture_showing_me_with_2/	AITA for sending a picture showing me with 2 other girls to my ex?
iz974iyi	My friend (30f) got engaged about two years ago. She asked me and our other high school friend to be in her wedding party. For nearly two years we have helped her plan a wide variety of different wedding plans. Nothing ever stuck. When she would talk to her fiancé, the plans would change. (He proposed but doesn’t believe in marriage as his parents are divorced, so he kept putting up road blocks with the plans). Some of the versions of the wedding included just a small group of us going to a cocktail jazz bar where we would all pay our own way. Money isn’t an issue for them as they have high paying jobs and a house and lake home and regularly go on expensive vacations.   We found out recently that they decided they wanted to just elope at a light house by their lake house, and not have any friends there. Me and the friend were upset that we planned 20 versions of the wedding and now she didn’t even want any of us there. We got over that, but now our friend is asking us to still be “involved” in the planning of her elopement and wants to have a party with friends later that we would help organize. As well as a shower and bachelorette party. AITA for not wanting to help after two years of this back and forth? I don’t feel comfortable throwing her an after wedding party, shower and bachelorette when she didn’t want any of us there for the wedding but just wants our gifts and time.   What should I do?	1643043968.0	sbqwt9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbqwt9/aita_for_not_helping_my_friend_plan_her_elopement/	AITA for not helping my friend plan her elopement?
d0d8qz4g	I (M33) live in a building with 25 units. We all share laundry facilities, 2 washer/dryer sets in the basement. This is the perfect number of machines for the building and I have never had issues with finding an available machine. My issue is the black socks I keep finding mixed in with my laundry. It’s the same sock, or at least the same style, every time. It’s not mine because it looks like it’s for a petit woman.  About a dozen times the last few months I’ve had to run one of these socks downstairs after bringing my laundry up. At this point, I am sick of it. I have the sock in my apartment after doing my laundry last night, and I’m considering tossing it.   I think IWBTA because returning the sock would be the neighborly thing to do, and it’s what I would like if someone else found my clothes in their laundry.   However, this keeps happening. With the same person. It seems they don’t really care about the socks.   I have started checking the machines for the socks before I use them, but I don’t always remember to do so because this has never been a problem anywhere else I lived. I do, however, check the machines when I’m done using them to make sure I haven’t left anything, a habit which my neighbor apparently doesn’t bother with.   I’m seriously thinking of not returning the sock this time. What do you think, Reddit?	1643044518.0	sbr4o9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbr4o9/wibta_if_i_just_threw_out_the_sock_this_time/	WIBTA if I just threw out the sock this time?
6y1k7zgy	Writing from my phone on a throwaway as I really don't need my friends and family seeing this post. Also English is not my first language so excuse any typos.  So my partner is quite the prankster. Nothing to serious and usually everyone laughs in the end. However today I felt they went too far.  I was on my way to the bathroom with my airpods in my ears as I've been very into a pod lately. Out of nowhere they jump out of a closet scaring me to death. I got so scared that I accidentally peed myself and it got on the floor etc. (I had to go quite badly as I just got home after an hour commuting) I exploded in anger and embarrassment as they stood there laughing their ass off. So I yelled that they had to clean up the hallway as I refused to do so and needed a shower.  They got quite annoyed and said it was just a prank and it wasn't their fault that I had the bladder control of a toddler.   In the end they did clean it up but they have been snappy and in a bad mood since then, saying I massively overreacted.  I told my closest friend about this and they thought I overreacted as well and shouldn't expect others to clean up my urine.  I don't believe I am the asshole but the fact that my friend also seems to think I overreacted is making me doubt.	1643044851.0	sbr9a1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbr9a1/aita_for_demanding_my_partner_to_clean_up_my_urine/	AITA for demanding my partner to clean up my urine?
ce8awxtz	My husband (23 M) and I (23 F) are expecting our first baby at the end of June and due to Covid, and the fact that I don't want a super large gathering of people for the gender reveal, I had two gender reveals planned. One for my group of friends, which was put together by my best friend, and one for my family that's being put together by my sister in law. I just had the gender reveal for my friends, and the one dory family is in March. When I told my mother that I'm having to reveals, she got very upset with me, told me it was stupid and I shouldn't know the gender before she does. I told her that's how I want to do it because I HATE large gatherings, even if it's all the people I know. She then proceeded to tell me that she'll be pissed during the reveal because I'll already know. And now she's expecting me to tell her. But I'm not going to. So AITA for wanting to tell her that she's going to have to wait until March just like the rest of the family and if she's just going to be pissy about it during the party, then she doesn't need to come? She's always tried to make everything about her and I'm honestly done with it.	1643044922.0	sbra7e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbra7e/aita_for_not_telling_my_mother_about_the_gender/	AITA for not telling my mother about the gender of my baby?
rgd8x	This is a small disagreement between my partner and I. It's not a big deal but still wanted to ask. It started when we were at her grandparents house for the day after Xmas. Her grandfather showed us his new rv. At some point in the convo I just asked "how much did you get it for?" He answered I think like 8 grand and we moved on to other stuff about it. She had told me later in the car it's rude to ask how much someone got something for. She didn't give an answer for why when I asked other than it's how she raised. I mean idk if you got a new a car and I ask how much and the person states. "I don't want to say" cool idc I'll move on.   I've done this when friends have gotten apartments and just asked how much in rent they got it for and such. I've never had anyone tell me they don't want to say but if someone did I would not care and would not push.   Again this is not some huge argument and has nothing to do with our relationship as whole. But just wanted to see if I was wrong to ask. So AITA for asking people how much they got something for?	1643045210.0	sbre7k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbre7k/aita_for_asking_how_much_someone_got_something_for/	AITA for asking how much someone got something for
iz7u5rdk	Every time my son comes back from staying with his dad he always has something of his dad’s that he shouldn’t have. Be it a watch, a book, a pen, etc. He puts the items in his bag and brings them to my house even though I’ve told him multiple times he isn’t supposed to do that. I always make him return the items on his next visit and it honestly never seemed like a big deal to me since he doesn’t do it anywhere else and it’s usually because he wants something to remember his dad by.  On his last visit, my son somehow managed to take his phone. I have no idea how since my ex is glued to that thing and it rings nonstop. I got into contact with him as soon as I noticed but that was a few days after he was dropped off home.  My ex was furious when he got here and he made our son cry badly when he told him off. I had to tell him to leave him alone which just made him angry at me. He was pissed that I never told him our son had a “stealing” habit and apparently him missing important calls was my fault because I hadn’t checked his bag which I should've done according to my ex since I knew he liked to take things from his dad.  I never mentioned it to him because he was taking small things and I always made him return them. Obviously, the phone was different which is why I told him on this occasion.

16bhodk7	 Tried to do an update but wasn’t sure if that worked. I can link the other post, but basically my mother had not paid the mortgage for a year and has owed the bank over 10k and asked me to give her that money. I’m moving at the end of next month. She tried to redo the modification and she has claimed to have not gotten it and has now been hounding me to put my own name on the house and take out a loan. Which is not happening either. I don’t know what other action she can take to save her house but I’m not having her do anything to pull my credit down or keep me with her. It’s very strange how each week that gets closer to the moving date that she tries to do anything to keep me here. Is there anything else she can do without trying to drag me into it? I have been arguing with her for the last 15 minutes after finding out that the loan would be 125k. Also being told I’m condemning her to being stuck with my step father.	1643045493.0	sbri9m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbri9m/aita_for_not_giving_my_mother_money_to_save_her/	AITA for not giving my mother money to save her rental home
iz8oxkgk	For context I am a coder (27F) and am working from home. Usually my work hrs last 9am-7pm but today ran late 8:30 pm which is dinner time at home. As usual I wake up first have a shower etc, do my house work, make breakfast for us and get ready for work. Mom(56) wakes up later as she's retired and has breakfast, reads, watches tv, cooks lunch. I'm still working and as my meetings are crazy today I tell her I won't be able to make it for lunch and to eat without me. My work ends at 8:30 and she starts her usual triade of nagging about all the work that I have left for her and that I need to be able to handle doing house work and office work simultaneously. That I am not the only person who is working and I should be able to do the work without any drama as she has been making sacrifices for me for the past 27 years and keeps asking me what are my expectations of her and that even at this age ? I ignore this as this is usual and I am not in the mood of getting into another argument after the day I've had. But she ignores it and keeps yelling at me that I should be talking to her, laughing with her after office and not ignore her by being on my phone. That I should stop harassing her as she has been keeping quiet for so long. I can't move out right now due to covid but I will be as soon as they call u back to working in office.	1643045564.0	sbrj8o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbrj8o/aita_for_ignoring_my_moms_remarks/	AITA For ignoring my mom's remarks ?
iy4nrebf	Throwaway account because my girlfriends uses Reddit. For context, my girlfriend LOVES TikTok and I personally hate it. I don’t think there’s any good content on it. The content is always so low effort and there’s always rap music over it ( which is always bad). She loves to show me them but I never laugh because they’re just not funny. She gets mad at me when I don’t laugh and I just tell her I don’t think it’s funny but she insists I should at least give her a fake laugh. I tell her I don’t want to give her a fake laugh because I’m not actually laughing at it and I don’t enjoy watching what she shows me. The ones that I dislike the most are the ones about proposals and engagements, it infuriates me. She always looks at me when she shows me them and I just straight face. Sometimes I wish I liked them so I could bond with her more, but I just don’t find them enjoyable.

izawnxk2	I (28F) have been dating my fiancé Ryan (36M) for 3 years, we have been living together for 1 year and are engaged for 8 months. I am currently 6 months pregnant. Ryan has a 6 year old son James from his previous marriage and he and his ex share custody for James. So James stays with his father (and now me since I moved in) for 1 week, then spends a week with his mother and her husband and so on.   James is a sweet little boy and we have a wonderful relationship. He knows that I’m not his mother and I will never try to take her place but so far living together has worked quite well. So last Saturday I was home with James while Ryan was at work and James was taking a nap in his room while I was watching a movie in our bedroom. James came to me and asked if he could climb to bed with me as he had had a nightmare and was afraid to stay alone in his room. I said sure, he climbed on his fathers side of the bed and fell asleep 5 minutes later. Ryan came home 1 hour later and found us both asleep on the bed with the two dogs and thought it was adorable so he took a picture.   Fast forward a couple of days, James’s mom comes to pick him up from our house and asks him to go to the car so she can speak with us. She proceeds to tell us how inappropriate it was for me to let a young boy in the bed and cuddle with him while he was sleeping (which we didn’t!) when none of his parents were home. Apparently Ryan’s sister showed her the photo thinking she would be happy that her son and I had a nice relationship. She also said that she and her husband find how touchy I am with James very inappropriate and that they’ll even consider applying for full custody. I don’t know if they will but I’m literally shaking as I’m writing these. James is obsessed with my baby bump, he’s generally a very cuddly child but lately he wants to put his little head on my belly for hours and listen to his baby sister. I love kids and I would never refuse to hug my soon-to-be stepson. It never crossed my child that this could be considered inappropriate. I used to teach and my students would hug me all the time and none of their parents seemed to mind.   The rest of the family is on our side but I wanted an unbiased opinion. So AITA for letting my stepson into our bed and occasionally hugging him and being affectionate with him?	1643046363.0	sbruba	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbruba/aita_for_letting_a_6_year_old_boy_sleep_in_my_bed/	AITA for letting a 6 year old boy sleep in my bed?

eozg6fkg	So, I (22f) just had my son and my MIL (59f) wants me and my newborn son to spend the night at her house when he comes home from the NICU for the first few nights. I haven’t said anything yet, because I’m not sure what to do. In the last few months, she has rescued a puppy who, even though is very sweet, is also very rambunctious. I love this dog, but it tries to jump up on your shoulders, and will try to get on top of you if you’re sitting on the couch. Again, I love this dog, it’s a very sweet dog.. but it’s too energetic, especially for a NICU baby coming home for the first time. I’ve tried hinting at MIL that if we were to come over, I’d only be comfortable bringing my son if the dog is outside until we leave. At the end of the day, I know my MIL enough to know that even if I flat out tell her I’m not comfortable bringing my son over while the dog is inside, she will do whatever she wants. We’ve also told her she is more than welcome to come to our house whenever she wants and we will even make dinner plans for her to come over, but she will always have an excuse at last second not to come.

However, a couple of weks ago, I had to ask her to leave the bridal party.   The dress I selected for my bridesmaids is very summery: pink, strapless, and knee-length. However, a few years ago, my sister converted to a very conservative church, and her new church has very strict modesty rules that do not allow her to show her arms, legs, or any of her chest or back.   We argued over the bridesmaid dress, with her offering to wear leggings under the dress and have the top altered or wear a cardigan. I said no, as this would look very strange in my bridal party photos, and since she refused to wear the original dress, I asked her to leave the bridal party.   My sister has been really upset, and now she feels like she shouldn't come to the wedding at all. But at the same time, I feel like her duty as a bridesmaid is to wear what I want her to, so I had the right to ask her to leave the party.

658y6v39	I (M18) plan to move in with my girlfriend (F21) this year after I graduate high school to escape from my abusive mother, I plan on going to college where she lives. Now we've had this plan set in place for a couple of years now that I'd be moving in with her. She lives with her parents, who are much better than my mother, and they've known of this plan from the start. They actually encouraged me to move there because they know of my situation, and they're welcoming me with open arms.  &#x200B;  Now, here's where I'm just dumbfounded. So I was under the impression that I would NOT be paying rent. And that I could live there for free. That they would help me out with whatever I need. This is what I was TOLD all along. I have a stable part time job right now while still in high school. I plan on staying with this job, until I move there and have to find a new job there. Now I do have money in savings (2k), and I've only had this job since Nov. 2021. I'm not wreckless with my money, unlike my gf is. I am getting kicked off my moms health insurance when I move, therefore I need to look for health insurance I'd have to start paying monthly. I'd be paying my own phone bill of course, food, and whatever else. Once again, I thought this was a perfect opportunity to save up money when I live with my girlfriend because I wouldn't be paying rent. So me and her would be able to move out of her parents more quickly.  &#x200B;  Her parents have now proposed me with paying rent. Out of nowhere, with *no* reasoning. But it's all very confusing and nobody is telling me information really. All I know is that it's probably going to be a few hundred dollars, I don't even get my own room though, I'd be staying in my girlfriends room. And now I'm a bit worried that they're going to make me also pay for food, and other bills. It's not like they NEED some sort of financial support help paying their rent from another person. They can easily do it on their own, they're upper middle class. So I'm just quite confused as to what's even going on. There's *no* clear plan, I've tried to ask but nobody is telling me anything. All I know is that all of a sudden they thought of the idea to make a contract for me so I can "rent a room" even though I'm not getting my own room, I'd be in my girlfriends room. Basically will have none of my belongings because they have nowhere to go in her house, probably putting everything into storage, sadly. And I also have to figure out college and paying for that.  &#x200B;  My girlfriend doesn't pay rent, bills, food, absolutely nothing. Neither does her sister (F19). In a way I do understand why they don't have to pay, I mean they are their children after all, and I am not. But I'm just lost as to why I was told one thing, and now I'm being told something else.  &#x200B;  So AITA for feeling the way I do? My gf has NO idea why they decided to propose this plan to me, she's just as confused as I am. My gf said if she had a child, she wouldn't make their partner pay rent.	1643047451.0	sbs9xf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbs9xf/aita_for_kinda_getting_pissed_at_my_girlfriends/	AITA for kinda getting pissed at my girlfriends (F21) parents for their sudden proposal of a plan?
hwhyeaas	I (24F) have a sister (21F) who got pregnant at 19 off of a one night stand. She lives out of state, so I hardly see her. Every couple of months I will go and visit and her house is absolutely disgusting. Dirty diapers on the floor, laundry piled up everywhere, trash overflowing, moldy food sitting around, etc.   The house isn't one that a child should be living in. Along with that, there are no child barriers anywhere and I constantly see her kid going through areas of the house that should be off limits. Along with all of this, her child is noticeably underweight for their age group and is always wearing filthy clothing.  I have spoken to her about all of my concerns, yet she chooses to ignore them. I know for a fact atleast half of my family will disown me if I do this, but I plan on calling child protective services on her anyways. To my knowledge, none of our family members would take the child, including my husband and I.

izamqv0u	  My husband (30) and I (30) got married 2 weeks ago, We decided on a child free wedding due to venue choice, food choice, alcohol, location etc...   we included this rule in every invitation, Including the one my husband's "bestie" Leo (35) who is a widower with 4 kids. Leo complained to my husband about the rule but that is that.   At the wedding my husband said he was worried his friend Leo may not come since "I" refused to let him bring his kids, But about almost an hour into the wedding, We start hearing noise from a distance.  we look closely and see Leo standing there with his 4 kids dressed nicely. he was arguing with the staff about the kids not being allowed. I felt horrible because the staff was drilling that this an adult only wedding and the kids needed to leave but Leo kept arguing and went as far as yell out my husband's name telling him to come tell the staff off since it's "his" wedding. I was so upset and embarrassed but I kept my composure and went over to talk to Leo.   I told him to either get the kids somewhere else and come back or just leave. he acted offended saying this is his best friend's wedding and he was invited to it. I said I was sorry but the rule is followed by everybody, and everybody should respect that. He argued about how he wasn't just a random guest but was family but I said it still applies. I insisted he make his choice but he doubled down talking about how he couldn't find babysitter and how he shouldn't have to miss his best friend's wedding. I had the staff escort him and his kids out after he kept pushing which led to some of my husband's friends to complain saying Leo has special circumstances because he's a widower and it's essentially my fault for not providing babysitting options for guests.   wedding went on after that, but my husband was angry. he said this is his best friend that I just caused to miss his wedding. he said Leo stopped answering his calls (til today) and respond to his messages because of what I did. now my husband believes that I have just ruined his relationship with his friend when I could've just made an exception for him and the kids since they were there already.

31b1dmjj	I frequently travel back and forth from my childhood house to my college apartment, because my roommates bother me and I like being at home. Recently, I’ve been bringing back toilet paper every time I’ve come back since I like to keep my own stash and don’t like to use my other roommates’ stash, which was getting low. This past week I went home for a week since my classes were online, and lo and behold I come back to no toilet paper. Fuckers didn’t even have the decency to throw away the bag the toilet paper came in.   So I’ve decided to call them out. Still thinking about how to phrase it, but would I be the asshole for calling them out? Like I said one of my roommates allows my other roommates to use his, but I’ve never partaken in this sharing and I’ve never said anyone can use mine. Furthermore, my stash was in my cabinet with all of my stuff, and they had to move my things around to get to it. I’m just annoyed because they knew their stash was low, didn’t say anything about it, went through my stuff to take mine, and didn’t even have the decency to throw out the bag the toilet paper came in.

iz9svkzi	My daughter, aged twelve, told me she was a girl at two years old (a week after her second birthday). I kind of assumed she was playing pretend, but after a year of it incessantly, I realised it was something more. By the time she was 3.5 she had fully transitioned (in every way she could at that age) and we havent looked back since.  My cousin recently got married. His wife and her family did not know us when my daughter was younger, and I presume my cousin never thought to mention it.   Anyway, we were at their house - she has two daughters from a previous marriage, and her younger sisters spend a lot of time there, so the girls were playing. My daughter excused herself to the bathroom, and I guess my cousins stepdaughter followed her up?  Anyway, about two minutes later, we hear my daughter yell before the littler one runs downstairs and announces to the whole room that my daughter has a penis.   I obviously run straight up to my daughter, who's in tears. Essentially she was desperate and hadnt locked the door. Littler one barged in and saw her. My daughter pees sitting down and the toilet faces the door, so it was kind of obvious.  Cousins wife comes up after me, asks me what was going on. I explain her daughter had barged into the bathroom when my daughter was peeing, and she asked me if my daughter was secretly a boy. Which, obviously, upset my daughter more. We left without me answering any of their questions.   It was a day of cuddles following that, with my phone turned off.   My cousin showed up to my door and said his wife had kicked him out after he stated he wouldnt share my daughters private information.   I thanked him, and decided to deal with the situation. My daughter had given permission to tell them, but I worked on a sort of protective force first. Called my two older sisters, one of which is married to a trans woman, to come over and stay with my baby while I dealt with everything. She had a good night with them.  Anyway, the incident had reached a lot of people, and I had an influx of angry people, saying I'd decieved them, and now they couldn't trust me in case I lied about anything else.  Essentially I made a public post explaining that my daughter is transgender, came out at a young age, and that I didnt lie to anyone. She's a girl, regardless of what genitals she has.   No one took it particularly well, besides the people who already knew.   Now I'm not sure if keeping it secret was the best way to go about things, seeing how negatively its affected everything. I feel bad for my daughter, and the family this has negatively affected.   I will not apologise for not telling them, I dont feel like an apology is owed. But I still dont know if I was necessarily in the right for keeping in secret.

6k4d8hyi	i'll try to make this short because i typed it up already and i accidentally exited out but in 2014 i got into a car accident where the car flipped 3 times down a ditch while i was passenger. i fractured my collarbone pretty bad but luckily thats all it was.   i moved out of my mom house in 2015 because me and her boyfriend never got along so i decided to move out for the better. i moved in with my homie after that. after about a year and a half he asked me if i ever received my settlement check from the accident and i told him no.   so one day i overheard my grandma on the phone with my mom and she said "why would you spend his money like that".... so i took it upon myself to research where my check was. i called the company and they basically told me that they sent the check out a whole year ago. it was 2016 and they basically were saying they sent it in 2015.   so i asked how if i never received it. the lady basically told me that my mom came wit some boy that looked like me in a way and picked up the check. my mom was also being petty after i moved out and wouldnt give me any of my documents (passport, id, social security card, etc) so i had no identification for a while which made it hard for me to get a job.. so it makes sense on how she even got my check and was able to cash it out...   i was told so many times i should take her to court but at the time she was pregnant with my little sister who is now 5 years old. i didn't want my mom to go to prison over 14,000 but it really sucks i could've did something with that. is there anyway for me to get that from her without her going to jail or is it too late and i should just take the loss?   thank you in advanced for all responses!	1643048554.0	sbspby	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbspby/aita_if_i_take_legal_action_against_my_mom_for/	AITA if i take legal action against my mom for stealing $14,600 from me 5 years ago?
28n4bi5z	My fiancé and I (33m, 28f) want to elope, and only want the mandatory 2 witnesses present. We took a long time to decide who to ask, and asked John and Alyssa (33m, 32f) in July last year. The basic reasons: childhood friend of my fiancé, had been the most welcoming and enthusiastic of our relationship in the group, we all had our independent friendships with one another, closer in age to us and more flexibility than our runner up choices for witnesses, and my fiancé’s words “I’ve never met someone who loves and is as devoted to his wife as John is.”   Well John knocked up his mistress.   John and Alyssa are currently in the process of divorcing and selling their house, John now has a baby he never wanted.   Since Alyssa moved back to her parents, hours away, and Johns busy new life, fiancé and I assumed they wouldn’t be our witnesses anymore. Alyssa wanted a clean break from Johns world (so fiancé and I) which was gut wrenching but fair. And Johns been MIA for a few months because divorce and an unplanned baby will do that to you.   Sunday, John called my fiancé, and had a good vent, life isn’t so hot for him right now. Then he mentioned our elopement and asked for the date so his mistress could get a dress for it. My fiancé said that we’ll be asking other people to sign as John was MIA, and is obviously still underwater with his responsibilities, and Alyssa is gone.   John said, “that’s ok! It’s just a few hours and that’s why the mistress was getting a dress- she’s the second witness!”  Fiancé explained that it was John AND Alyssa we wanted, and their marriage looked so solid and loving and it’s that energy we wanted for our day, and we’ve never met the mistress. John sounded hurt, and ended the call soon after.  I know, logically, that 1) what John did has no bearing on my future marriage, 2) I don’t know what goes on in the private lives of anyone I’d choose as a witness.   But it feels so *wrong* to have John signing my marriage certificate. I’m not that superstitious but the idea of John and his mistress holding their affair baby, sign my marriage certificate seems repugnant to me. Like why even bother if those 2 are signing? Even without the affair baby, had fiancé and I known about the affair John never would have been asked as marriage witness.   I’m also insulted that John thought we’d substitute Alyssa for the mistress, we really liked Alyssa, there’s genuine sadness that Alyssa is gone, she wasn’t simply Johns SO, interchangeable with the next woman. That’s not the vibe I want.   my fiancé and I aren’t going to change our minds about choosing someone other than John but, my fiancé is doubting what we did and if we were justified beyond “my wedding my rules”. I’m not: this comes down to moral principles, and having John and the mistress sign my marriage certificate may was well render it worthless in my eyes.   But, Johns hurt, the mistress probably is too, my fiancé wonders what his friendship with John will become.

hfrpdtis	Background: I’ve been married for 15 years come September. I sometimes let my best friends, usually, rant to me about my husband. They also know him pretty well.   My husband gets upset because I don’t defend him or cut them off to shut them up.  Defense: The reason being is I’m usually asking for advice or an opinion on an event that’s occurred, so when that happens I just let it happen.   I admit I have found it easier and interesting to know their perspective. I’m highly empathetic so a lot of the time I can see from their perspective but I don’t, usually, feel the same. It’s seldom that I do.  Question:  I just wanted to know if I’m the asshole for not defending him against others all the time.

77vnn9ft	Ok so I (16M) am known as the "technology smart" kid cause I know how to do basic shit like reset the wifi router or send an email from a phone and my mom (50F) is someone who's always asking for my help, I always help her and have been doing so for 3-5 years now  From that time now however I've noticed that she is very, well plain stupid when it comes to asking for help, she's very hard headed and will yell at you if you correct her about anything, even shit she doesn't know about, because of this slowly over time I've gotten used to me telling her in a growing stern matter to not correct me or cut me off when asking for information on how I can help her or even just explaining to her what she did wrong   But today she had an outbursts which really pissed me off, both as someone helping her and as her son  I was in my bed doing nothing when she came into my room, sat in my bed and said she needed help, she explained that her cousin (who I've never fucking heard about) had an online school and made my mom a "counselor" for the Washington DC area, this is utter nonsense to me and sounded like a scam  to me, that aside she told me it "wasn't important" when I asked her what her job was and what the school was for, she then told me that he sent her and I quote "information that he wants me to download but I don't know how" so I'm confused on what information she could be referring to, but assumed it was "student" information, she showed me her whatsapp conversation with him and from what I saw he sent her no links for anything to download, rather it was a Twitter, Facebook and Instagram link for a video which he posted for his "online school"  While looking at this I asked my mom   "what do you want me to download, theres nothing to download?"   And she said  "No no it's something he wants me to upload-"  As she said this she got closer to me and smelled my breath saying  "Is that your breath? Have you not brushed your teeth yet? It smell awfull"  As she said this I didn't say anything but told her   "What do you need my help with?"  As I was just plain stumped on what the fuck she wanted me to "download"  As she usually does she got up and said  "Sch just leave it I'll do it myself"  And all of a sudden she turned around at me and started speaking increasingly loudly, talking about how I don't help her and how she helps me all the time taking me places (which is plain untrue, she rarely takes me anywhere I want, I uber) and now one knee in my bed with her hand ready for a slap she says  "You have no idea how hard I'm holding back slapping you"  Which just straight up pissed me off  As she then said   "You're in your room always just on your damn phone"  She slapped the phone from my hand and continued her whining until she left my room, I felt bad for her since I knew the shit she got herself into by her cousin but also knew I did nothing wrong, I simply questioned what she wanted my help for and she stormed on me, so AITA for not helping her upload a video online?	1643049096.0	sbswrl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbswrl/aita_for_not_helping_my_mom_post_a_video_online/	AITA for not helping my mom post a video online?
b4ftq4sp	   My boyfriend and i have been dating for a year and i have only met his parents one time and it was in passing. 3 or 4 months ago i made a big deal about it and told him that i needed to meet them and somewhat get to know them. I made it very clear to him that this was very important to me and that it bothered me that i didnt see them more often.  background knowledge, I live on my own with my 2 roommates away from my parents and he lives with his parents. We only go to my house and he says that it works better because he doesn't like being around his parents because they make him nervous. I told him I wanted to spend more time at his house because then I would be able see them. My boyfriend has a history of being late as well and the day before I was supposed to go to his parents house we had a discussion about how if he is late he is wasting my time because I have things I would rather be doing than sitting and waiting for him. I told him its disrespectful and that my time is just as important as his. He apologized and said that he wouldnt waste my time anymore and that he didnt realize how disrespectful this behavior was.  So come last weekend and this weekend, I finally put my foot down a month ago and told him that if he didnt take me and was late coming to my house I would just go to his. He responded saying he would rather arrange something and I agreed. A month later this is arranged, last weekend I was supposed to go and he didnt check with his parents that it would still be okay if I came until I left work. I left work an hour early and told him I would be trying to do so in order to have more time with him and his parents. An hour after I get home he checks that it's okay for me to go and then tells me that his uncle has covid and is in their basement which obviously means I cant go. My issue with this was not that I could not go rather that he waited until after I left work to ask if it was still okay seeing as how I was using my time to see him. This weekend he didnt even bother asking until 4 hours after he told me he would come get me in the next 2 hours. He guaranteed me on friday that i'd be able to go over to his house but never checked with his parents. Come saturday i finish work at 2 and he says he has to drive somewhere an hour away. He drives there comes back and then checks if I can go to his house and is sent to do another task. I waited for 3 hours until I told him I was not coming over at any point today and that he should do his tasks. Now he asks me to come on sunday which I already told him would not work because i was working for 9 hours.  Now I'm mad at him and not really talking to him until I cool down but I'm not sure if I'm in the right to be so upset because i know things happen in life but it feels like a totally avoidable issue.  \-pissed off girlfriend	1643049006.0	sbsvgi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbsvgi/aita_for_being_mad_about_my_boyfriend_wasting_my/	AITA for being mad about my boyfriend wasting my time

7w3af3e1	So a couple months ago one of my younger friends got a lizard back who wasn't eating, she hadn't taken any of my suggestions on rehabilitation, and left for vacation and asked me to board it.  I work in dog boarding, and i didn't ask for money, as it wasn't supposed to be more than 4 days, and lizards don't need much, food water and light. And in boarding that'd be $200. Well a few days into boarding I text her and lay out every reason I think he needs the vet. She refused to pay for it, and asked me to instead. When I said no, her response was "well I guess she's gonna die with me" and from that point on I cut contact. And started actually rehabbing the Lil guy.  Que the threatening messages "imma flip shit if I don't get my lizards back" ect. So I blocked her. A few new accounts and texting family and friends of mine, I decide to reply. Now she's paying a discounted price for my services, and I'm keeping one of the lizards she boarded with me, that I gave her. Am I the asshole?  The way I see it, she didn't care about the lizard, just that it was a piece of her past relationship that she doesn't wanna let go, and would make this thing suffer.	1643049469.0	sbt1xa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbt1xa/aita_if_i_took_someones_lizard_who_was_starving/	AITA if I took someone's lizard who was starving
iz872ddd	So, I (M25) live with my Girlfriend (26) and have been a couple for over 7 years and it's been amazing. One nagging thing though, is she is very overbearing regarding alcohol.   She claims she doesn't want to be controlling, but every time I go to get a beer I'm always worried I'll be met with rolled eyes, "how many have you had tonight?" Or a big lecture on how bad alcohol is. It often leads to arguments where I argue it's my choice. And no I don't drink in any sort of excess, it's just every now and then.   Recently, I decided to buy myself some 0% beers to have in. Felt like giving it a try, cutting down beer is a good thing to try right? And maybe we could find some comprise. I didnt for a moment think she'd have the same problem with non alcoholic beer. At around 4:45 PM today I'm feeling thirsty, I know I have one nice and cold in the fridge so I go to get one.  She goes mental. "What are you doing? It's not even 5 yet"  I try to reassure and say it's a non alcoholic beer.  She still argues "but it's not even 5 yet!"  I replied "seriously?!" In admittedly a very frustrated tone. Which didnt go down well, with her storming out saying "fine do what you fucking want."  I was sort of stunned not knowing what to do. I didnt drink the beer in the end. Havent spoken to her since it happened, she went into work this evening so left shortly before anything got resolved.  5PM is earlier than I would normally go for a beer yes. But as it's non alcoholic I didnt see the issue.	1643049301.0	sbszl6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbszl6/aita_for_getting_a_nonalcoholic_beer_at_5pm/	AITA for getting a non-alcoholic beer at 5PM
837u98qp	 A couple of months ago, I (M20) was talking to my sister’s boyfriend (M26) and he asked if I had seen Succession on HBO. I said I hadn’t because I don’t have the streaming platform. He told me that him and his parents have an account and I’m welcome to log in and watch the show. He sent me the password, and I noticed they had a “guest” profile so I used that.   A couple of weeks ago, they broke up. I’m not exactly sure what happened but Im pretty sure it involved cheating. All I know is that it was pretty brutal. But, I haven’t finished the show yet, and would really like to. So I figured I could use the account until I got kicked off or something.   Yesterday my sister came over for the first time since they broke, and the show was paused in the living room. I quickly X’d it out when she wasn’t looking cause I’m pretty sure she’d be upset. She told the family we should break off all contact with him because of what happened. It seems like a little thing I could do which is spend the couple bucks for my own account. But I also don’t really have a reason to besides please my sister.   I do still want to finish the show though.

72j00b34	recently my sister (F 21) has moved back into my parents house, and into part of my room (im F 16). She is sleeping in my room, but it is sectioned into two parts, and the part she is sleeping in has the door, so i have to walk through that section to get to my room.   Along with my sister she brought her to animals, a cat (who is has horrible matting and who she has barely taken care of) and her dog ( a little yappy bratty thing which will bark at anything). She also has a really bad attitude about everything, and doesnt really have any regard for other people. She will play videos on her phone with her volume up around the house. ( Theres a reason headphones exist.)      The real complaint is her attitude. She is just always complaining about everything, and then when you complain about something she is doing she gets all bitchy. (for instance as im writing this she is listening to something with the volume up.) I have not gotten a good nights sleep since she has moved in, as her dog makes a ton of noise ( if its not barking its chewing at itself). She also smokes, and multiple times i have had to withstand stale cigarette smoke smell because she will go smoke then come back into my room. She has no regard for other people, but then expects other people to treat her like an angel.   AITA for not being nice to my sister and getting annoyed, when she acts like this.	1643049385.0	sbt0rx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbt0rx/aita_for_not_being_super_nice_to_my_sister/	AITA for not being super nice to my sister.
2tju420y	My (30F) boyfriend (now ex) "Ben" (28M) and I had a huge fight a few weeks ago, and I am just not able to forgive him for what transpired.    Ben and I have been dating for 7-8 months, with the last 3-4 months being on and off because I was unhappy with him for being too possessive (I keep trying to end it but find it tough to enforce for the reason I'll outline in the next paragraph). He thinks all my close male pals want to hook up with me and keeps pressuring me to go NC with them, even though I've been friends with most of them for 12-13 years and nothing romantic has ever happened between me and any of them, and really never will. While I haven't given in to his absurd demands, I've been thinking about ending it with Ben since his controlling behaviour has become a recurring issue between us.    Here's where it gets complicated, Ben's mum developed thyroid cancer early in November, and she's undergoing chemo (from what I understood, the prognosis is very good and the cancer is not growing). I wanted to be supportive and not abandon Ben in a challenging time, especially because he has previous trauma from losing another family member to cancer. So I stick around and get back together with him even though I really feel as if I'm under an obligation to do it.    While all this was going on, my pup (11 year old GSD) developed a debilitating mystery illness that progressed very rapidly and the vet told us that he was not long for this world. Two weeks ago, we put our dog to sleep because he was completely unable to walk or eat and was finding it physically painful to breathe. Having brought up my pup since he was a 2 month old baby, this was very distressing for me and I have been in a horrible place emotionally and mentally ever since. When I told Ben about putting my pup to sleep, he scoffed at my grief and exasperatedly said that "I need to get over it. It's just a dog, not a human being" and that "I didn't see him (Ben) moping about his mother's cancer diagnosis."    Dunno what it was, but something in me broke that day and I dumped Ben and blocked him on my phone. I told him that it was not the misery Olympics and that his response was wildly inappropriate when my grief was so fresh. In spite of multiple requests from him, I am refusing to get over this and get back with Ben, and he thinks I'm being "too sensitive" and need to be more supportive of him in his time of need.

bctqcpar	I hope this makes sense I tried to cut out all the fluff.   I (32f) have young children. I was a SAHM but recently started a business. Business is going great and my kids love going to preschool. It’s a win/win.   Because I have young kids and work primarily from home I am very, very rarely out in public by myself. Like never. I literally do not remember the last time I sat down at a cafe by myself but I loved sitting in coffee shops to study in college.   Today I had to swing by my kid’s preschool to sign some forms on the way home I passed a very popular breakfast place and decided I would treat myself to some quality alone time.   I ordered at the register, found a seat and to my absolute delight I had a book and AirPods in my purse. I was pumped.   My drink came and the server (20ishF) asked if I was all by myself. I said I was, thanked her and popped my airpod back in my ear.   5 minutes later she’s back with my food and sits down with me. I obviously looked confused and she happily chirps “I just can’t stand the thought of anyone eating alone so I took my break so I could join you!” My brain stalled. I was trying to think of a proper white lie, had a brought my laptop I would have told her I had to work. Anyway- she catches on and asked “Well, as long as that’s ok with your of course!” I stammered out something along the lines of that it was lovely of her to think of me but I was alone on purpose and could use a recharge. Without a word she b-lined out to the parking lot. It’s freezing here and she wasn’t wearing a coat, she just bounced.  I understandably felt awkward as fuck so I ate quickly and left. On my way out I heard someone in the back yell “Where’s Lauren?!?”  I feel like shit. My mom says the girl probably liked my accent and I look friendly so I should have given the girl my time as it wouldn’t have cost my anything to be nice. My friends and husband say I was polite and didn’t do anything wrong.

izce6bnz	 So I (26M) am having an issue and need a judgement. My friends and I are massive football fans. This upcoming weekend we are being offered playoff tickets by a friend from HS named Ashley. Ashley’s family is well connected and had extra box tickets. Ashley is one of my very best friends but we have been drifting lately so I am excited to see her. My girlfriend is Lexi (25F) and she is amazing, but her and Ashley don’t get along. I’ve asked why and tried to bring them around each other but they don’t mesh. They hardly interact or even engage each other. Lexi told me about 6 months ago that she is uncomfortable with me spending time with Ashley alone and that she didn’t really “vibe” with her. I didn’t really understand because me and Ashley have only been friends but I didn’t fight her on it. Ashley found out and we haven’t been hanging out as much since.   So Lexi and I live together. I work full time and Lexi goes to school while working part time. No chance I would ever be able to afford playoff box tickets on our current budget. Ashley has offered things to me and Lexi before, but Lexi always makes us turn them down. Things like concert tickets and camping trips. Saying she doesn’t feel comfortable “owing” Ashley something. I don’t understand the issue with it. Because of this I know I won’t be able to accept the tickets if Lexi knows where I got them. I talked to Ashley about the issue and she doesn’t understand the issue and will even look into getting Lexi a ticket too. I said even if she can’t get one that I will be there. I really want to go to this game with my friends and it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity. But I don’t wanna put my GF in a uncomfortable situation. Which is why I think I should just go and say one of my friends got the tickets thru work or something. I don’t want to hurt Lexie’s feelings but I also think this whole thing is ridiculous. And neither of them admit to there being an issue between them.

izbhdgj2	I (15f) have recently (in the past year) been in contact with my biological dad, (40m) my mum (42f) hadn't spoken to him since I was born just about, and still hasn't really. I love seeing him and his family, he has a wife and three kids, so I have 2 stepsisters and a half-brother. My my mum got married when I was 6, so I have a stepdad and 2 stepsisters in my own home too.  I love calling my other side of the family and we're all going to meet in person at some point soon (I've met dad and stepmum but not siblings), but my mum always tries to tell me about how my dad is going to make me feel "stuck in the middle" and that he's trying to communicate through me, which isn't true, I just relay everything he says to her because she asks me to. I'm getting a paternity test at some point and my mum wants to get the really expensive one but make my biological dad pay for it, and I didn't think that was fair, as he has bought one that you do at home and mail away, and he said we'd do it together so we have peace of mind that it's not messed with. My mum keeps saying that he might mess with it and that's why she wants the expensive one, but he has no motive to mess with it because he wants me to meet the kids and everything, and we're already pretty close, so if anyone had a motive it would be my mum, so that she never had to think about him again (she wouldn't though as she is adamant that she never cheated on him and I do believe her, but she has tried to keep me from getting a paternity test for 15 years) One day I got mad and said "HE doesn't make me feel stuck in the middle, YOU do, you're always telling me he's a bad person and acting like you're protecting me from him by saying he's so terrible, but HE just says that you guys are grown up and should respect each other, and he won't say anything bad against you, but you sit and tell me that he's going to mess with the paternity test!"

88xjde72	My boyfriend and I live in Florida and recently he purchased a house for us. He gets paid very well so we were able to get a 3000 sq ft home with plenty of space for family and friends to come visit us. My best friend will come see me maybe once a month or twice a month and it’s always when she has her 5yo daughter. Which is no problem I love her kid but she is REALLY bad. Like doesn’t listen, if she doesn’t get her way she throws a fit and screams until my friend gives in. She will kick or hit when she’s angry and my friend does not discipline her to any extant. Just shrugs it off.  My friend is currently separated from her husband but already had a new boyfriend. The child is not allowed to be around the boyfriend bc of stipulations in custody agreement with her husband that she is separated from. Well her boyfriends lease ends at the end of the month. He is moving in with her. She asked me if she could come see me weekly or bi weekly when she has her daughter so that way she can abide by the custody agreement. She rarely talks to me when she doesn’t have her daughter. She will be with her boyfriend and it’s next to impossible to get her to respond. If she’s with the daughter she will text me several times in a row. Thing is, I’m 7 months pregnant. Her daughter completely stresses me out at this point. They are always sick too. What happens when I have the baby and I’m gonna be over stimulated and learning how to be a mother. How do I tell her no. AITA for not wanting her over here?

h2722b41	So my boyfriend of 3 years dad has health issues. Cancer being one of them. He was recently diagnosed with Parkinson’s as well. It’s been a difficult journey. I have been very supportive.  His dad lives about 4 hours away from him in one direction.  I live about 4 hours away in another direction.   We know his time with him is limited, we just don’t know how limited.   Through the years we have had many cancelled plans and special events, many last minute due to his Dad’s health and I’ve mostly been fine with that. I’ve supported and encouraged him to go by his dad whenever there is a health crisis. As well as to take trips there to visit and for holidays etc instead of spending time with me.   He always says he’s going to make things up to me when there is a last minute cancellation but that never actually happens. I do sometimes get upset since I put a lot of effort and thought into seeing him and have to rearrange things as I also live 4 hours away. I go to him since he works 6 days a week usually, he also lives in a major city and doesn’t own a vehicle since it’s not necessary and cost prohibitive. Where I live in a rural area and own vehicles. I also own my business and have more flexibility with my schedule.   2 weeks ago my dog died very suddenly and unexpectedly. I’m one of those people who loves my dogs like my kids. So it was devastating. He wasn’t able to come and be there for me due to work. But he asked if he could take me out of town next weekend on a road trip.  I was super excited about it and really grateful and moved that he would do something so sweet and thoughtful. We made all kinds of plans he rented a car.   A few days before he calls and says his dad asked him to come to a Parkinson’s boxing class he’s taking so he was going to spend the weekend with him and do that instead of taking me out of town. I of course was hurt and sad.  He told me we’d reschedule for the next weekend, but I knew we wouldn’t.  (This was confirmed when he didn’t move his dentist appointment for that weekend, rent a car, book the hotel room etc). He says things at the moment meaning well but isn’t good with follow through.  So I of course ended up getting upset.  He told me it was really uncool to get upset with him for going by his dads.   But since it wasn’t a health crisis and I was going through a really difficult time I felt like it was a situation where he should have put me first, and visited his dad a different weekend instead of cancelling our trip.   AITA for getting upset?   I think I might be the asshole because his dad has serious health problems.	1643051158.0	sbtp60	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtp60/aita_for_getting_angry_with_my_boyfriend_for/	AITA for getting angry with my boyfriend for cancelling our trip to visit his dad?
971xdo9d	Brother in law: Nathan, Sister in law: Maggy, Girlfriend: Nathania (Not actual names)  Nathan & Maggy got married in 2017. Nathan & Maggy had been together since 2010/2011 (apparently they were on & off until they got serious) They were both in their early 20s then. Back to 2017, they married & all was well (as far as anyone knew) until the end of 2019 when Maggy was diagnosed with breast cancer (triple-negative). I don’t want to go into to many details about her treatment, however, she lost her hair & gain weight while heavily fighting then lost a lot of weight at the end right before she passed.  Maggy passed away in March 2021 after fighting for two years. I was devastated. Maggy was not just my sister-in-law. She was a best friend, a confidante, a true sister. We had a real connection & friendship to the point we had siblings dinner with all the siblings at least once a month/ every two months, where we all talked, & hung out.  When she passed I was truly taken back at how calm & happy Nathan appeared to be. He was smiling, laughing, joking with people. Anytime anyone asked how he was. He said he was good or something along those lines. Everyone left it alone since he had a hard two years & was obviously grieving the loss of his partner of ten years. Which I completely understand and sympathize with. I know a lot of people will put on a brave front & break down when alone.  Three months after Maggy's death Nathan asked my husband (his brother) if we would be okay with meeting his new girlfriend? I was completely shocked! How could he have a new girlfriend?! His wife just died. The person he was with for ten years died! I couldn’t believe it but no one wanted to say anything to him because of what he went through the last two years. To make a long story short, I think from what I’ve seen, she’s lovely but I’m feeling resentful at the both of them for dating.  When I see her all I think about is Maggy and I’m still processing her passing as it isn’t quite a year yet. I miss her every day and think of her often. I was going to let this go and continue to just ignore the situation and go hard on working on my grief but now my husband and I have found out he moved in with her after 6 months of dating and I’m becoming angrier about their relationship. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Would I be an asshole for keeping my distance and not seeing her?	1643051737.0	sbtx9b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtx9b/wibta_if_i_tell_my_brotherinlaw_i_dont_want_to_be/	WIBTA if I tell my brother-in-law I don’t want to be around his new girlfriend since I’m not over the death of his wife?
drrjkr07	Okay, so I am a biomedical student so exams are difficult, I met two girls from my course (D and L) early on and we became quite close in my opinion( we weren’t each other’s “main” friends but we did hang out and do things together). So we had one exam while I was out of town and they did this together and I did it by myself with no issues from anyone and they didn’t offer me support nor did I ask for it. I get extra time for my mental disability as work is harder for me than others.   A few months later it’s exam season and we had arranged to do the 3 exams together so we could ‘team up’. When the first exam came along we did it together and it was pretty clear that i was the only one with notes on everything, and I had stayed up for nights on end to 2am to revise (even with my disability). During this they said that they “definitely wouldn’t pass without my extra time” and “we had a massive advantage over other people” and “we have time to check answers so it’s okay”-and this bothered me but I thought not much of it. The same happened with the second exam with similar comments but I assumed they were being insensitive without meaning it, only they seemed even less prepared for this one.   Then one of the girls requested we do the third exam a day early (giving me less time to revise) due to a driving lesson and I agreed even though I wasn’t too comfortable with it. They said they had “split the work between them so they had covered everything” even though They knew I would have covered everything by myself. the night before the exam D said that she would have to do the exam early on in the day so I asked if it was possible to leave later as I was not comfortable with losing that much revision time. D said it was not. I then said I would simply do the exam by myself as I didn’t feel prepared and that I was sorry they couldn’t use my extra time- all of a sudden my phone is blowing up with texts and phone calls with solutions (eg-she’ll cancel her lesson, I can share my screen and answers with them, they’ll do anything to do it with me). At this point I felt used.  I simply said no don’t worry please don’t cancel anything I’ll just do it myself.   They haven’t spoken to me really since witch is unusual and give me very blunt replies when I’ve tried to contact- L hasn’t said a single word to me and it’s been a week.  Am I in the wrong for abandoning them in a time of need or am I correct in feeling this way?	1643051775.0	sbtxsy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtxsy/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_friends_in_an_exam/	AITA for refusing to help my friends in an exam
iz25kiyc	My BF (25M) and I (23F) have been together for 2 years. A month ago his mom moved very close to his apartment. I technically do not live with him but his roommate left for like 7-8 months and I just slowly started staying longer. Both of us work and study full time so it is very convenient.  I love cooking but unfortunately don’t have enough time to do it everyday so I meal prep. As you can imagine this requires a crap ton of pans and pots. I manage with two of each and I’ve purchased them personally for my BF’s apartment. Both pans are like 15$ each from a shop about an hour away.  A few weeks ago his mom stayed over for a few days and cooked with them. When she left, apparently she told my BF she really liked that one particular pot and wanted an identical one, so the doofus brought it over and gifted it to her the very next day without telling me.  I spent an hour trying to find it and never bothered to ask him because he cannot boil an egg right and never goes in the kitchen as I cook fully for both of us.  I found out eventually and got extremely annoyed. I bit my tongue and told him I found this disrespectful and he said he could not understand what the issue was, I had another one. I was gonna let it go, considering it a honest mistake, when he mentioned his mom knew it was my pan and not a new one. She also knew he didn’t ask me.She is a retired chef and she was in that crappy kitchen! She knew I only had those two! I was even telling her I need more when she was over!  I said it sucked she accepted it under those conditions. He said if it was such a big deal he would call and have her return it. I felt awkward and said no because honestly it feels wrong to take it back once it’s hers. My BF said if I really thought I was right, I’d take it back and said I was cranky. I got pissed off again at his faulty logic and am currently still sulking over this. AITA?  No one in this story is financially unstable.

2ytv2p2h	I (30/f) grew up in a small town and became friends with “Abby” (31/f) when we were 16 and 17, we were extremely close even after I moved a state away. We don’t see each other often unless I am visiting my hometown, but I always make time to see her when I do and we text/talk regularly. I truly have a lot of love for and consider her basically a sister. The problem is that she has to bring her husband with her everywhere she goes and he makes me extremely uncomfortable. He has gotten their credit cards cancelled many times after giving the information to cam girls online as young as 18 and has admitted to being mostly attracted to girls in that age range despite being in his 30s. They have almost gotten divorced several times, but she always ends up staying despite his gross and immature behavior. He’s also an addict and behaves uncontrollably at times. I once invited her and her child to come stay with us for a week so that the girls could meet and her and I could catch up, but when she got here, she had a a total meltdown and wanted him to come stay as well, I told her I didn’t feel comfortable because of how unstable he is and so the trip was cut short so she could go home to be with him. This year, I took vacation time off to take my daughter on a birthday trip, but due to COVID decided it was too risky as she is too young for the vaccination. As an alternative, we decided to have her birthday party at my parents house so that it was still a trip, but not such a risk and could easily involve her cousins and a select few close friends and their kids. The party is 10 minutes from where “Abby” lives, but I don’t want to invite her because I don’t want her husband around the kids. I feel conflicted, but firmly will not be around him.

ajawqkke	I had a baby not long ago and the expectation is that we go over to my grandfathers place to introduce them to each other. He is my only living grandparent and the only living great grandparent of my daughter. She is also his only great grandchild so far.  &#x200B;  My grandfather and I haven't talked to each other in 2 years. Not a family holiday, not a birthday text, nothing. The last time we talked was when I invited him to my university graduation ceremony and he declined my invitation, because I didn't invite my alcoholic father (his son), who has treated me horribly as a child. My grandfather told me that he doesn't care why I'm not inviting my father, that's just between him and me, but he is not coming if his son is not invited. That was it and he didn't come to my wedding either.  &#x200B;  My fear is basically that if I take my daughter over to him, he will also invite his son. I absolutely don't want to meet my father ever again, I haven't talked to him in over 2 years too and I refuse to ever let him meet my daughter.  I'm also a bit bitter about how my grandfather sided with my father over me, despite me never making him choose. I don't see why he couldn't have had a good relationship with both of us and why me cutting contact with my father had to result in my grandfather cutting contact with me.  &#x200B;  My family, mostly my mother and my cousin (who has an extremely close relationship with our grandfather) says that I'm robbing both my grandfather and both my daughter by not allowing them to meet and I should be "the bigger person" especially since we have no idea how long my grandfather will still live.  &#x200B;  AITA?	1643052221.0	sbu3w0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbu3w0/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_baby_to_meet_my/	AITA for not wanting to take my baby to meet my grandfather?
13gmjn	Help me settle this argument. My wife insists we cook pasta with bottled water. She says our tap water makes the pasta taste bad. Our water isn’t filtered, but it isn’t bad water either; you can barely taste the minerals or chlorine.   I told her that she could walk into any fine restaurant and if she asked if they used tap water or bottled water, they would probably all laugh their asses off behind her back.   It’s somewhat trivial, but I believe it’s things like this that she keeps tweaking in our 27 years of marriage that just make life more wasteful and complex.

fvd51ysk	I (15F) have recently travelled to another country with my two siblings, (4M) and (12F). Now due to my dad's job in another country we travelled here and my mom received a report of having mild covid on the day of the flight. So my father was in India for a holiday and since we were coming he quickly found a place to live with us for a while without checking it out much. It's an alright place, good and clean enough but has one bathroom which we all of share and I'm fine with it.   But there's no bin except one in the washroom which I use to throw the sanitary pads. Now my dad gets embarrassed at girl stuff like bras, underwear or pads which I completely understand and he's fully supportive. But what I do is leave like collect them for one day and then throw them at nightime or the following morning and the process repeats.  The thing is my dad gets annoyed at me not throwing it, and I understand this pov but it's not like I have a newspaper or I can't use so many bags to throw. So I put it with the rest of trash so it can be thrown away but he got annoyed for not throwing it. Saying I was shameless and he's a person who gets angry and speaks what's on his mind that time then apologize sometimes according to the situation. So I told this told my mom and she said it was okay, understood my point saying okay get a newspaper and throw it out tomorrow.   I felt bad that I should've gotten a newspaper but we don't have shops near by and don't know the way much around here. Also the bins are near us so it made me feel more bad about it that I could thrown it earlier but I forgot. Today I saw he had a few newspaper pages but he had already dirtied them and used them. Plus he didn't go to the supermarket since he was tired so couldn't get stuff. Then since we have online school, homework, and me and my sister take care of our brother so I usually don't remember after all that. I kinda felt weird like it's just sanitary periods but we are from an Asian family where it's a little consertive regarding men's Information on girl stuff.  Finally for example another incident, my sister is currently hosting an event that contains music enough to wake my brother up. And right now my brother had a tantrum so he woke up and my dad was telling her why did this girl do this show? I told her not to do it. I told her to go play it in the other room, he will wake up but she didn't listen. It's annoying and now look he's woken up. He's an amazing dad and has made a lot of sacrifices towards the whole family so I understand his behaviour and leave it as it is cause I cannot question it. Me and my dad don't agree on some stuff like his behaviour when he gets angry, I don't like what he says and does when he's angry so I tend to think about everything he's done for us, what a good dad he is, gets everything for us without us asking and I try to move on, stay calm and just be patient and endure but a few things just annoy me so am I the AITA?	1643051892.0	sbtzdg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbtzdg/aita_for_not_throwing_my_sanitary_pads/	AITA for not throwing my sanitary pads?
izeiyqqy	I (32F) live with my bf (29m).  He is really into the tabletop gaming world, and most of his friends are too.  Now, I like pretty much all of his friends, so it's not an issue with them as people.  My bf has 3 gaming tables in the basement.  The routine used to be that he would have a group of guys over one evening during the week to play, and every Saturday (if we don't already have something else planned) he spends pretty much all day playing with his friends at a store in town that specializes in these types of games.  I'm fine with that.  Apparently, the store has been having some heating issues or something, so since it's uncomfortable to spend all day there, he was inviting his friends to the house to play all day on Saturday.  I was fine with it originally, but that was because I thought it was temporary until the store fixed the heat.  Well, it's been a few months now, and they still come over all day on Saturday.  They're all nice guys, but they get very loud in the basement.  I feel like I can't have the relaxing Saturdays that I used to because they're so noisy and I'm uncomfortable.  I don't know if I can't say anything to my bf since technically it's his house, I just live with him.  WIBTA to ask him to change back to the old schedule?  I don't want to be a party pooper for him.	1643052777.0	sbuboy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbuboy/wibta_for_asking_my_bf_to_stop_having_friends/	WIBTA for asking my bf to stop having friends over so much?
4d8kgjte	Hello all, this isn’t a massive issue at the moment but my roommate has started to make a few comments about the times I wake up.  A bit of backstory. I (20f) am going to college in the US to play football (soccer). I am sharing a dorm room with my friend and teammate Sally (18f). It’s currently off season for us but I’ve been wanting to improve my fitness and strength so I can get better scholarships at my next school (I’m a sophomore in a juco). This means I’ve been going to the gym more often and going on runs.  Onto the problem. The coach from the men’s program was holding some optional 6am sessions at the  college gym complex for his team and mentioned that if any of us girls would like to join we were welcome to. So I did. I would set an alarm and get up at 5:30 to have enough time to get dressed and drive there. I tried to be quiet for Sally’s sake and not switch on any lights or stuff but obviously the alarm is quite loud and she is a light sleeper. I did this about 4 times that week, pretty much every time it was offered.  The thing is Sally has been making a few passive aggressive comments about not being able to fall back to sleep after I get up. I’ve apologised and made sure to let her know if I was planning on getting up early the night before but she’s been getting more and more frustrated.  So guys, I was just wondering if I am the asshole for getting up early in the morning (and consequently waking my roommate up) to go workout?	1643052934.0	sbudzx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbudzx/aita_for_waking_up_at_530_even_though_i_have_a/	AITA for waking up at 5:30 even though I have a roommate?
7ukue4qr	I’ll be traveling soon with a weekend layover near a bunch of my relatives, one family on my dad's side and all of my mom's relatives. My immediate family and I live very far away from these relatives, so we don't even see them once a year. I'm only going to see the family on my dad's side because its been the longest since I've seen them and there are many families from my mom's side and I only have so much time.  Unfortunately, the relatives on my moms side will get very insulted if they heard I was nearby and don’t see them. Even if I were going to see them, I would have to visit everyone, otherwise the people I didn’t see would get insulted. This has happened multiple times before where someone has gone to visit only one or two of them, and the others got very insulted. Like, really really offended, lots of drama, grown adults crying cause they didn’t feel loved, it wasn’t pretty.  Initially, when I made the plans, I tried to have a longer layover so I could see everyone. But for various reasons it didn’t work out. **Now its definitely too late to change these plans.**  So, my mom doesn’t want anyone to know I’ll be in the area. Even tho its just me traveling alone, she'll get dragged in the drama. She’s trying to sit me down and talk about how we're going to lie so we don’t have different stories. We have to have a good lie cause they know about my travel plans, just not about the weekend layover near them, so if they start asking details, even casually, like when are you leaving, how was the flight, etc, we have to have a consistent story.  I don't think we'll be able to keep up the lie and I'm a bit uncomfortable with it. Initially, I was thinking we should try to only tell parts of the truth and then change topics if it comes up, but now I’m thinking we should just tell them everything. If they find out later, they will be way more insulted. If I just tell them now, they will still be insulted but at least I can tell them the reasons why I couldn’t which will make it less personal, and they might be more understanding. Also, I would totally defend my mom and say it was completely my decision and they shouldn't blame her at all.  But, my mom thinks they will have the same (bad) reaction whether we tell them now or if they find out later, and we have to lie so they don’t get insulted. **A white lie to not hurt their feelings**. We would avoid talking about it at all, with the white lie story as backup, that my layover is just 3 hours or something like that.  Personally, I love my mom's relatives but I think this is starting to approach middle school drama pettiness. They are adults and should understand I can’t see everyone every time I pass by. If they don’t and are insulted, it’s not my fault cause I am not doing anything insulting.  So WIBTA if I tell them the truth, possibly hurting their feelings and throwing my mom under the bus? Or is this the appropriate time for a white lie (that might be discovered anyway)?	1643053205.0	sbui0j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbui0j/wibta_for_telling_my_relatives_im_not_seeing_them/	WIBTA for telling my relatives I’m not seeing them when I’ll be in the area?
eayrhriy	My partner and his female friend are both into the same music. I like some of their music but usually listen to a different genre.   I moved states to be with my partner so I barely have any friends and if those two go together, I’ll just be sitting in bed by myself knitting some wool for hours (not literally, but I’ll be very bored).   Should I be invited or should I just let them two go together?   They’ve known each other for years but have only recently started getting close. This girl is his best friends (who is also female) younger sister.  I’ve met up with this girl once but have seen her only a handful of times.   My partner spent the whole day with her the other day and said that they get along really well (they got brunch together and then met up with other friends to go bowling and rock climbing).  I feel like I might be the asshole as I feel like I might be impeding on their relationship.	1643053449.0	sbulir	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbulir/wibta_if_i_ask_for_an_invite_to_go_to_a_concert/	WIBTA if I ask for an invite to go to a concert with my partner and his female friend?
izbt36m7	Hello friends, disclaimer that I am on a throwaway as my partner and family know my main handle.   So, I have a rather weird situation where I am trying to decide if I would be TA if I didn't attend my(F25) brother's (M34) wedding. My brother Jim is getting married to the love of his life Kim in June this year. The wedding has been postponed due to Covid and is in a different country.  Jim and I have had a difficult relationship over the past few years, to name a few events: in summer 2019 he tried to convince me that I had bipolar because I flipped out when he and my parents smashed my laptop because I was chatting to my partner. He has not attempted to maintain a relationship with adult me, mainly texting me when he wants something and treating me like a child. This all went nuts in January 2020, when, after asking me and my sister Kylie (F22) to be bridesmaids, he then told Kylie that she wasn't going to be a bridesmaid because they couldn't have me 'making a scene' at the wedding based on his diagnosis. (I see a therapist and can confirm this is nonsense - my therapist has diagnosed otherwise). Kylie was distraught as Jim and Kim had previously asked us over a family dinner (remembered by grandma who is sharp as a tack) and to top it all off, he told us that neither of us could bring our partners who we have both been with for 4 years because the list was 'getting way to big for Kim's liking'.   I went NC with him from January 2020, made easier by him falling out with my parents over the removal of Kylie from the wedding party. This came as a result of a multitude of issues, but the relationship is really damaged and they are NC.  In November Jim asked me to go for a drink. After letting him say his part in which he apologised for how he had acted previously, things have been much better and I feel as though we are on our way to healing things. He met my partner Gary and despite the fuss over my +1 he loves him. I still haven't seen Kim for over two years.  Now onto the issue: Jim sent me a text today saying 'can I confirm you are coming to my wedding on June x'. I have not received an invite, which I know were sent out last year, my parents are not invited, and there is no mention of Gary.   I am conflicted because although I love and appreciate him and the relationship, I am not willing to hurt my parents and I am not willing to compromise that I will not be able to bring my partner. I am not fussed on being a bridesmaid, but the above points are making me feel as though I have to stand my ground out of principle and not go if he is not willing to accept my boundaries.   I know this has been long winded, but I'm hoping the wonderful Reddit community will tell me straight. So, WIBTA if I don't go to my brother's wedding?  TLDR: Had a rocky relationship with my brother. Rebuilding a relationship with him, and been invited to his wedding where my parents and partner are not invited.

6xfqm7ye	     I (25f) and my husband(25m) have decided to not have children despite actually liking babies. We just have other  goals in life at the moment. Maybe we'll change our minds in the future, maybe not. Personally, I used to babysit alot for family and friends in during my teen years and worked as a teacher's aide for six years in an Elementary school. Like I said, I really like kids and know how to work with them, i just don't think I want to be a mom at the moment.      Anyway, since we are childless right now, we have adopted A LOT of pets from rescue shelters. We really love animals and are pets are our furbabies. We tend to get some critics from family for our lifestyle (we're latinos) but we usually don't care. My husband works fulltime and I currently take care of the animals and keep the house in order.       Very recently, my SIL ( 30f) has offered to me a "job" to babysit her toddler. She has two kids (2m) (9f) with the oldest going to school. They live in México since her boyfriend (40m) got deported for drunk-driving. They have had many struggles due to her having to cross the border every morning and him only working at delivering food in México.       She wants me to babysit M-S, 8-5pm taking care of her kid. In the past I would have said yes immedietly, but now I have a house and pets to take care of, not to mention I like my childless routine. If I said yes, it would be more as a favor for her than anything else. I tried to compromise, offering to say yes if they were willing to bring their kid to my house so I could keep doing light chores while babysitting. They said no, stating that my house is not childproof and I have stairs, which I completely understand. Instead, they want to pick me up early to drop me off at their house. We don't live that far away. I know I could do it, and I know I could help her saying yes. However, the whole point of choosing not to have kids is to not have to care for one, not to mention I'm very comfortable with my routine right now.    WIBTA if I say no. I know i'll be selfish, but just how selfish?	1643053001.0	sbueyg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbueyg/aita_i_dont_want_to_babysit_my_sils_toddler/	AITA I Don't Want to Babysit my SIL's toddler.
dbytb929	Background:  27 year old  Female  Moved out of mom’s house at 17  Moved back in the begging of the pandemic at 25   During the pandemic, I had went through a bad break up and was in a financial crisis. I decided to move back to my mothers house to pay lower rent and save up for a home.   As of date, I saved over $30,000 for a down payment on a house which I plan to use in the next 7-8 months.   My family is aware of this and knows I get paid well so now they all come to me to borrow money.   Just in the last 2 months, I had over 10 requests to loan money. These requests largely come from my mother and the rest from my sisters.   In the beginning I was okay with it and received my money back. Now, it’s getting to a point that they only text me when they need to borrow money.   One time my mom even offered to loan my money to her boyfriend without even asking me. The first time I let it slide, the second time I said absolutely not.   My mom gambled her boyfriends car savings of $4,000 and asked to borrow $4000 which she paid back, but still.  My sister asked to borrow $800 for her phone bill. She came with a sob story of how she couldn’t even pay her rent so I let her borrow $200. I then find out a couple days later she could afford to buy custom press on nails for $100 from my friend.   I had let my other sister borrow $100, which she returned to my mom. My mom let me know and I had asked her to leave it under my mattress since I wasn’t going to be home for 3 weeks. When I come back home to let her borrow another $1000 to pay back a loan she had borrowed from her brother, I found out she had took my $100 to pay for parking.  I say all of this because I finally lashed out on her. Her car was repossessed yesterday because she was late on her bill. Now, she has to pay for the towing & late payments. She was telling me about this, and I knew she was going to ask me to borrow money. I quickly interrupted her and said “nope don’t even ask”. I said why doesn’t your boyfriend pay for this, he sleeps here and does nothing. I feel bad because I said this infront of my cousin and his girlfriend.   I help my mom pay rent, she even charges me more than she charged my uncle when he lived here. I pay for the internet, whenever she asks for small lump sums of money I try to give it to her. Now, I just feel used, not just by her but by everyone around me.  Anyways, am I the asshole for lashing out on her? I did apologize	1643054778.0	sbv4n9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbv4n9/aita_for_lashing_out/	AITA for lashing out?

a6sqqnr5	So I'm a 24F and I was babysitting a friend of mine's 3 children.   Recently I've been needing more and more dental work done and I quickly realized that I needed another job. I told my friend that I was gonna apply to the school and see what happened.   2 weeks went by and I had no answer from the school, which I had chopped up to me not getting the job. So I was still babysitting for my friend.   Well I tell my friend that I haven't heard anything so nothing is most likely going to come of it. Then she tells me that me giving her a head up that I was looking for another job gave her anxiety, that she said she found a new sitter, and my last day is this Friday.   I feel bad (and very pissed off) that I even mentioned anything to her, because if I didn't, maybe I'd still be employed. Now I'm going to be without a job and without any money at all.

4ckwjss9	Hi. In three weeks time my fiancé’s cousin is having their delayed wedding. We received an invite to the wedding pre covid and when covid hit they had a small wedding for immediate family only. This “late wedding” is for everybody who couldn’t come to the first one when the covid restrictions were in place.   The family have been making plans for us all to get a big air bnb and minibus for the new event in three weeks time. Today my fiancé got a text from the groom to say that I wasn’t invited due to numbers and may be invited if somebody drops out.   The couple I have known for the almost 10 years I’ve been with my fiancé and we get on well. They’re always at the family parties we have for Christmas, birthdays, bonfire night, the football etc so safe to say I’m quite upset that everybody who is at these parties are all going but me.   I think fiancé should go to the wedding because it’s family. This evening we found out his sister won’t be able to go as she’s working away so there’s my spot back, but I don’t want to go now that everybody knows I was uninvited because it’s awkward and upsetting.   My fiancé’s dad thinks that I and/or my fiancé shouldn’t just not go out of principle now. I keep telling my fiancé that he should go but I don’t think I’m doing a good job of hiding how upset I am. Mainly because I moved away from my whole family 10 years ago and now I’m feeling rejected by this one.   So AITA for not wanting to go? Am I making a bigger deal out of this than necessary?	1643055158.0	sbv9x0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbv9x0/aita_for_not_going_to_a_wedding_i_was_invited_to/	AITA for not going to a wedding I was invited to, then uninvited, then invited to again?
izdi5veo	I'm 22F and my sister's 19F. I have my driver's license and a car but she doesn't, so she's always asking me to drive her everywhere. And sometimes I'll agree to it, but most of the time I don't. I'm not anyone's personal driver and she's more than old enough to take her driving test and get her own license, so I don't really feel bad about it.  The thing is, my sister also loves to drink. And by that I mean she'll drink to the point where she's literally crawling on the floor, puking everywhere and laughing and crying at the same time. She's fully aware of how hysterical she gets whenever she drinks, knows she'll end up drinking herself nearly to death if she goes to a party where there's alcohol, but just doesn't give a shit. Our parents tried talking some sense into her, but apparently they're just 'being overbearing', 'overreacting' and 'making a huge deal out of nothing'.  A few days ago she asked me to drive her to one of her friends' parties. I asked her if there was gonna be any alcohol involved and she said yes, so I told her to find someone else to give her a ride because there was no way in hell I'd be dealing with her drunkness again. She told me none of her friends had their licenses yet, so I told her to either take a taxi or not go to the party at all. Either way, I made it clear that I wasn't gonna be driving her anywhere.  She eventually found someone else to give her a ride and did end up going to the party. However, I got a call from her at around midnight and surprise surprise, she was as drunk as ever. She begged me to come pick her up and drive her home and started yelling and freaking out as soon as I told her no. I hung up, she called me a few more times to scream at me and later ended up getting a ride home from someone else at the party.  Our parents weren't at home that night, but when they got back today and found out about this whole mess, they immediately blamed me. We got in a fight and they said I was selfish, irresponsible, cruel and so on for refusing to drive my sister back home. However, my sister is an adult who made her own choice to attend that party. She knew how she gets when she's drunk and knew I wouldn't be driving her home, but still made the choice to go there and get wasted despite everything. I honestly don't believe I made an AH move here, but I'd like to hear some more opinions on this. Was it really so messed up of me to refuse to give her that ride?	1643055030.0	sbv83c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbv83c/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_drunk_sister_home/	AITA for refusing to drive my drunk sister home after a party?
izebcrys	Throwaway account for obvious reasons. Also this is written on mobile so if there are any formatting issues, my bad.   It’s not an extravagant story but I’ll do my best to explain thoroughly. I (25F) live with my parents (50s and working) and younger sister (20, in school and not working).  Anyway, my parents were paying for a Netflix subscription for a while and everyone in the house used it. It was the base package (at the time, I’m not sure if things have changed since then) that came with two screens and didn’t offer the 4K services. Since I have the smart TV and was also logged in at my boyfriend’s house (he has the one that’s a few upgrades from my own), I asked if I could upgrade to the higher package for four screens and the 4K services and in exchange, I would pay for the bill monthly (it’s still under my mum’s email). My parents agreed and here we are now.   I have an older half sister (“Ashley”, 30F) that is married, has a toddler and lives in her husband’s (“Ken”, 32M) rented condo. Things have been rocky since she brought him home a few years ago unexpectedly, announcing that she was pregnant and they were getting married beforehand. Ashley had never mentioned she was seeing anyone so it was quite a surprise, but we accepted Ken and tried out best to get to know him. He’s super reserved but they came over a few times. Things only became a problem as of a few months ago and Ashley basically disowned us. I won’t go into details because honestly I’m still confused myself but yea, we don’t talk anymore.  Here’s my problem: my mom came into my room a while back and asked who had access to the account because she got an email from Netflix saying someone had logged in during the early hours of the morning. After listing the household and my boyfriend, we figured it was probably Ashley. It wouldn’t be all that surprising considering they have a young kid, but even if it wasn’t them, I realized that she still has access to the account that I pay for and she doesn’t even talk to us anymore. I said out loud I should change the password but my mom told me to let it go. I can’t forgive her after what she put our parents through. She called them shitty names the last time she came over and they haven’t seen their grandchild in like, six months. She’s been NC for months and hasn’t even said why. Ken is no help.   WIBTA if I changed the password?   Why I might be the AH: She’s my sister after all and I’m pretty sure they don’t have cable because they’re trying to cut back on spending to buy a house so they watch TV from a laptop connected to a projector. I think I would feel bad all things considered.	1643054623.0	sbv2gm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbv2gm/wibta_if_i_changed_the_netflix_password/	WIBTA if I changed the Netflix password?
b4237lhq	Am I the asshole for wanting to be treated fairly at work? Up until now I've worked in food production and at times it can get hectic. But i manage to make it work, I even made it easier to handle because that how good of a job I do. Well not anymore, there's this other co worker that works with me and I have trained her and taught her the short cuts to make her job as easy as mine. Well she doesn't follow them and blames me for having it more easier than her. She comes in drunk and my department manager and lead approves of this behavior. She goes on breaks consistently and she wants everything handed to her while I have to break my back, quite literally, to cover her mistakes, so that managers don't complain to me, and that she gets a much easier shift than me. So I'm intentionally making her job ten times harder because I know the tricks of the trade so to speak. I don't make as much of the product I used to, barely prepare her while still be technically prepared for her shift. I even turned down offer for help with my work because I want her to have a difficult time coming in before me. This all started when one of my lead threw me under the bus for a mistake this drunk co worker did and I had to deal with it. So I'm intentionally making her work ten times more difficult for her because she doesn't do shit for me when I come in, why should I do the same for her?

This Xmas, NY I refused contact, my milestone b/day is very soon. In the past they have denied all incidents (I’m lying about it all). I will not continue this toxicity  1 As he lay dying LH asked them to pay for our kids’ education. They reneged. I cashed in savings, remortgaged & did it alone. I offered for them to come to the grads. Kids refused. MIL&FIL blame me  2 We were in our dream home thanks to a $50k lien from MIL&FIL. 8 mths after LH died they wanted the $. I couldn’t afford it: all the expenses on ½ the income & the increased mortgage was impossible. Legally theirs & I told them if they took it kids would guess why we went to a smaller house. To MIL “of all the $ you tried to take from me, this was the most painful: the lien was to BOTH of us & as soon as LH died it was like the kids & I didn’t matter at all” Long pause. “We never asked for $ back. You’re lying again” In front of #2!  3 Until #2 turned 18, we brought flowers & cards thanking them for the gift of LH every Mom & Dad’s Day, etc. I was bad for stopping. Explanation for no acknowledgement for raising kids alone “You don’t deserve it” Those cruel words echoed in me for years  4 “Look at this fab bracelet FIL bought, I’m so lucky to have a husband” “Our anniv, was so great, look at all these gifts” SIL: “we decided you were probably stepping out on LH” (waaay out of L field!)  5 My Xmas & bday gifts came from the $ Store (I *love* the $ Store but the diff was glaring, kids shamed)  6 Me “LH asked you to help me with the kids & you never lifted a finger” MIL “He didn’t ask us to help **you** with the kids, he just asked to help **with** the kids” Me “Who the F do you think he meant if not me?” MIL “I forgot; he didn’t say ‘help with the kids’ he said, ‘help the kids’ so that’s why we gave #2 a box of groceries when he moved out” Me “7 YEARS after LH died, you gave #2 groceries?  Unbelievable”  7 Me “What did I do to deserve how you treat me?” MIL “6 years ago I sent you turkey leftovers & you never thanked me”  8 Me “You have never said or done anything nice for me, or even offer me condolences” FIL “You are right, I was wrong & I completely apologize” MIL didn’t need to say anything nice b/c 4 years earlier I had said it was tough being an only parent & she agreed  Epilogue \~I forgive them for all they did for my sake; I’m indifferent with occasional contempt & pity \~LH would be so ashamed of them \~I can’t even wrap my head around their thought process.

izfxklyd	A couple days ago we started getting rats in the walls/ceiling. They're very active in the middle of the night and they've woken all of us up. My husband is working on getting them out and said it should take a week for them to start to leave.  Last night, they were especially bad around my daughter's (15f) room and she took some Advil PM to help her sleep at around 10:30. They woke her up at around 3 or 4 and she says she doesn't know if she took them again but she slept until 10 minutes before she was supposed to leave. She was extremely groggy when she woke up but I thought she was just tired from the rats.  Then I got a call from her 1st period, 2nd period, 3rd period, and 4th period teachers telling me that she fell asleep in class and asking if she was okay because this is very unusual for her. Then during her lunch period, I got a call from the nurse, who said she wasn't feeling well and I need to pick her up.  I checked the Advil and it looks like 2 doses were taken so I grounded my daughter for 2 weeks because she was careless enough to take 2 doses and because she had fallen asleep in every class before I picked her up.   She is furious and says that she wouldn't have taken them twice if we would've hired someone to take care of the rats. She told her dad and he is furious that we haven't hired anyone to take care of the rats and that I grounded my daughter for her mistake. He picked her up a couple hours ago and my daughter said she doesn't want to talk to me so I wanted to know if I was the asshole	1643055832.0	sbvj7f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvj7f/aita_for_grounding_my_daughter/	AITA for grounding my daughter
cz9h05bh	 I met this guy named Jay during a party with some mutual friends. We hit it off pretty well and kept in contact for a few months after the party. He was in my state for the party, but lives quite a ways away in a state I’d never been to but always wanted to visit.   As time went on we got pretty close, and we planned a trip for me to visit him in his state on my birthday. We’d be staying at a hotel he chose right in the heart of a really popular and gorgeous travel destination in his state. He said we’d split the cost and everything would be cool. I was super stoked and couldn’t wait.  A few weeks before the trip I asked him what exactly the hotel was and decided to read the reviews for it, and I was shocked by how overwhelmingly negative the reviews were. Almost every review mentioned that the rooms were filthy, and 3 or 4 reviews mentioned bed bugs.   Now, I’m not a snob when it comes to hotels. Hot water and a clean bed are really all I care about. It’s not like I wanted to sleep in some luxury resort, just a clean place that I could enjoy with peace of mind on my birthday. I know that reviews can be biased, but this wasn’t just 1 or 2 angry people. It was a lot.   I was pretty solidly freaked out after reading the reviews, so I consulted with some friends on what I should do.  They all said I should be honest - one friend suggested that I could book the replacement and cover it 100% to cover the inconvenience of Jay having to cancel his booking, and I thought that was fair.  So I brought it up to Jay. Initially he waved it off, but offered to switch to another hotel if it really bothered me. The hotel he offered as a backup was just as bad, if not worse when I looked it up. I told him if he could cancel his reservation altogether I’d handle the replacement hotel and pay for it 100%. After a few hours of fighting with his booking company, he was able to do it and I handled the new hotel. I apologized profusely for him having to deal with that and told him to not worry at all about the replacement I paid for.  Y’all, it all but ruined the trip. When I flew to visit him, he was like a completely different person the entire time I was there. I cried because our friendship was pretty much ruined. After I flew back we haven’t said a word to each other since.  Talking to some mutual friends after the trip, apparently he was insanely upset by the whole fiasco and it completely put him off with me. I just don’t think I was in the wrong for wanting a nice place to spend my birthday (especially after spending so much to come out there in the first place).   So, AITA for wanting a different hotel to stay at?	1643055702.0	sbvhfq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvhfq/aita_for_wanting_to_change_the_hotel_i_stayed_at/	AITA for wanting to change the hotel I stayed at for my birthday?
evl5a7q1	Ok based on the title most people will probably say no. But I live with my sister and our two dogs on the second floor. The guy in question lives on the third floor. This man I have only interacted with 3 times. First when my sister and I were walking our dogs and he commented on my dogs loud bark(he’s a hound). Second when he brought my sister and I dog treats to our door and he said “ I thought I’d bring these to you guys considering your dog is always here”. My sister told me that’s what he said, as I was in the bathroom. So I went up to his apartment and knocked asking if my dog was actually bothering him and that was the end of it after he said no no don’t worry about it. Third was when I was home alone and took our two dogs outside to use the bathroom after work, and this made me uncomfortable a little, he just came out onto his balcony and yelled down “how you doing”. Literally only came out to say that and then went back in after I responded. Then today he came up to the door after my sister left for work and asked me out. Now I don’t get asked out often, I’m not hot or anything I’m average I would say, so I immediately got awkward and confused. Also I was in the middle of a zoom class so I really only answered the door cause I thought it was someone coming to fix my outlet. I said “I mean I’m really busy, I literally have a class going on right now”. He said “well you can say no….” I said well just not right now like I’m very busy with school at the moment and I’m only 21 so I don’t know if that affects your decision” He handled it so well and just said no it’s fine have a good one. I feel bad though, I hope I’m NTA but AITA for turning him down.	1643056122.0	sbvn8f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvn8f/aita_for_saying_no_to_a_date/	AITA for saying no to a date
euyhweiq	No need for a throwaway because I’ll accept whatever judgement I get.  I was stuck in traffic (bumper to bumper) earlier today. I like all kinds of music and my boyfriend has recently introduced me to Bad Bunny.   I had my windows down (it was a lovely day) with one of his songs playing. To say I was feeling myself is an understatement. It was a full on concert for me. Dancing and trying to sing along the best I could (I don’t speak Spanish at all but I mean.. MUSIC!!)   A man in the car next to me starts trying to talk to me in Spanish (catcalling? carcalling? who knows??!) Obviously I have no idea what he’s saying, but I wouldn’t of acknowledged him either way. Anyway I think he gets a better look at me and realizes I am a Caucasian woman from the mountains of Caucasus and starts yelling about how I’m trying to pass myself off as a Latina to get attention and should be ashamed, how white woman are trying to trick men.   Without missing a beat with the song and while dancing (still because we were not letting him kill the vibe) I put my middle finger up to his direction without looking at him. He then starts yelling about having children in the car and how dare I.   Traffic slowly started to clear (I mean this all happened within a minuteishhh so) and I felt bad that I put my middle finger up to a car with children in it. If I would of paid attention and looked at the car I probably would of seen the kid or kids.  Was my reaction in asshole territory? Especially since my middle finger was seen by children (I AM SORRY INNOCENT BABIES 😵‍💫)	1643056490.0	sbvs4p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvs4p/aita_for_giving_the_middle_finger_to_a_car_with_a/	AITA for giving the middle finger to a car with a child in it?
izg8dys1	My husband and I have a 8-month old son.  For months he has struggled with a congestion and breathing issue that we have been to the doctor for multiple times, including a couple trips to urgent care and the ER.  Up until about a month ago we had not gotten a solid diagnosis from anyone and it's been incredibly frustrating.  Then we finally went to see an allergy specialist and they did some tests and it turns out our son has pet allergies.  Now, all of my in-laws have pets.  Some have cats, some have dogs, but literally all of them have pets.  And when we thought back to all the times our son's symptoms were at their worse, it lined up with either visiting my in-laws or them coming to see us.   So, my husband and I talked with our in-laws and told them that if they want to come visit us then they need to make sure they wear clean clothes or bring a change of clothes with them so that there is little to no dander or hair on them, and to clean their cars before they visit because they all take their pets in their cars.  We also asked that if we come visit them, they thoroughly clean their homes, preferably professionally.    Since then, none of them have invited us over.  We used to see them about every 2 weeks, but now it's silence.  Last week my MIL shared pictures of my BIL and his family over at their house with their kids and their dog.  I told my husband how it made me feel left out and how it feels like they are picking their pets and a little convenience over us.  He said he would talk to them about it.  He talked with his brother and mom and told them how it made us feel left out and they were receptive to it.  He also asked invited them over for dinner this past weekend which they agreed to.    But when I sent a text out to them last week reminding them of the rules regarding extra clothes and cleaning their cars, both MIL and BIL suddenly changed their tune and both of them said they wouldn't be able to make it.    I called BIL's wife, who I am close with, to talk to her about it.  She told me that they are both really busy and they just don't have the time to do all the things I want them to do in order to visit.  I told her it doesn't take that long to throw some extra clothes together and to clean their car.  She said they don't want to be the cause of another allergic reaction in our son and it's just easier if they don't try to risk it.    Which to me felt like a total cop-out.  Like, you don't have 30 minutes to make sure your car is clean?  I told my husband about it and he called his brother again.  I guess BIL took offence and told my husband that we are the ones who put the rules in place and we should be happy with them respectfully declining an invitation instead of breaking those rules and risking my son's health.  My husband told him that they are picking convenience over family and BIL just told him, "Welcome to becoming a parent. No one is going to want to protect your kid as much as you do, get used to it."	1643056518.0	sbvsjq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvsjq/aita_for_enforcing_strict_rules_on_my_inlaws_for/	AITA For enforcing strict rules on my in-laws for them to see my son

e9hkd5mr	So I (40F) live with my mom, my sister, and my sisters kid,since I make the most money out of us I go and buy groceries and food and all that. I have two sons (12M) and (7M) my oldest goes to school with my cousins child (13M) who we’ll call “J” So due to his moms work schedule I take him back to my house and eventually (around 5PM) he’ll get picked up and go home. Now J doesn’t eat school food and is always hungry and I don’t want him eating our food all the time so his mom started to send him with food. No issue right? Well that was wrong when she ran out of food to send him and he went back to eating all of our food again. So I put my foot down back in November and said from now own he’s not gonna eat our food and needs to bring his own. J said this was unfair and he can’t decide that. I told him I don’t care he needs to tell his mom. Whenever he comes now he doesn’t eat and looks miserable and very hungry. I know he eats at home so why can’t he bring the food here? It just doesn’t make sense to me and I want to know  So, am I the asshole?	1643056581.0	sbvtd6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbvtd6/aita_for_not_feeding_my_cosuins_child/	AITA for not feeding my cosuins child
d0icyrym	English is not first language.  Bear with me.  My wife (F,33) and I (M,40) got married almost 5 years ago.  Now due to reasons when we got married no one from wife's side came to wedding.  NBD or so I thought.  We keep a pretty low profile, minimum social medias and are focusing on our family.  We have 1 month old twin boys so very busy.   My wife keeps in touch with extended family via facebook.  So I posted vid of her holding our boys to her facebook. It was supposed to just go to MIL and siblings.  It ended up going to all of her friends list.  Her inbox was bombarded with messages from "family"  "Uncle and I were blindsided and so upset that you didn't tell us you were pregnant. You never said you were dating anyone" From an aunt my wife last saw at age 6.  Similar messages from people to them calling out my In-Laws for not telling them the good news.  My MIL called and accused me of starting drama within the family for no reason.  I told her Not my problem. These people not in our lives why we tell them anything?   My MIL insists my wife apologize to her relatives.

I had an argument with my mum that I couldn’t come down and celebrate her actual 50th due to having compulsory university classes that require 100% attendance. I suggested I come to her house the weekend before (as the weekend after is BF’s birthday) and that we have a fun weekend together. She lost her shit and said that it was her 50th and it was a major event that I couldn’t make time for and that id clearly like to spend my time with my boyfriend and celebrate his birthday instead.

9xogk8pl	 So I (23F) have never really been close with my dad. My mom and him had me when they were young (18 and 21) and divorced when I was 1. They had joint custody until I was about 5 when my dad tried to kidnap me (something he still does not admit to) and my mom moved to Boston to get away from him. I did not speak to him again till I was 12. In the mean time I moved in with my grandparents due to my moms drug issues which had been going on since before I was born. When I was 12 we got back in touch because I reached out and saw each other about once a year. He always gets really emotional when we talk and cries which makes me feel bad like I’m the bad guy for not reaching out to him and it’s my fault we’re not close. Over the last few years I’ve started to resent him and I only talk when he calls on Christmas and birthdays. I don’t go to see him even though I visit my grandparents all the time and they live in the same town now. I try to avoid him at all costs because I don’t know how to resolve this resentment I have against him. He’s really nice and my whole family wants me to make up with him. I’m sure he doesn’t even know that I’m mad at him. I just keep thinking that he’s the parent it was his responsibility to be in my life and he chose not to. Plus he left me in the care of a drug addict and didn’t care. I don’t know what I should do. Every couple months he’ll send me random messages like “I love you!” And I don’t know how to respond because he’s not in my life and I don’t really know him. He recently called me (which he never does not on Christmas or my birthday) and I didn’t answer.

g99ygw4n	Me and her have been best friend for 14 years. We moved into together and I’ve had it with her dog. She party’s a lot. Im a mom so I can’t anymore. I use to take out her dog for her and feed him cause sometimes she helps me with my daughter. I’m getting tired of it because she didn’t even ask she just expected it. She has made it clear she doesn’t want him alone in the dark. She doesn’t want him in her room cause she has carpet and the living room tile. He mostly sleeps on my couch I paid for even though she hasn’t taken him to the groomers for over a year and pees and poops on the floorall the time and occasionally my room. He tries to cover the poop by putting my couch pillows or trash over it so he won’t get in trouble. I even stop filing his dog bowl and leaving the mess for her. I start feeling bad cause my daughter can’t play with poop and pee everywhere. Then I start seeing her dogs bones cause she goes weeks without feeding him and long period without buying dog food so I gave him leftovers and he even became more aggressive. Whenever I tell her she becomes better for about a day or 2 then stops. I start putting him in her room to destroy that instead and just giving him food but she gets pissed at me and starts an argument about how she pays rent to so he can go anywhere in the house. Every suggestion she turns down because she says she loves her dog. My sister who loves her dog keeps asking to take him. I really want to drop him off and not look back especially because she’ll be gone for days at a time anyways. I feel bad because I also know she’s had him since he was small and her ex took care of all the hard work so maybe she’s not use to it but it’s been a year. I don’t know how much more of arguing over this dog I can take.	1643057389.0	sbw49i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbw49i/aita_for_asking_roommate_to_give_away_her_dog/	AITA for asking roommate to give away her dog
14mxo5	 I (30F) am getting married to my fiancé (32M) in November of this year. He proposed in December 2021 and we’ve been together for almost 2 years now.   So, a little bout my dad. He and my mother had two other kids—my older brother (38) and my older sister (35). Throughout my parents’ marriage my dad repeatedly abused my mom verbally, physically, and emotionally. My siblings were in the home at this time and witnessed it all, but I was too young to remember. He was an alcoholic. My mom didn’t have the courage or resources to divorce him and leave until I was about 2-3 y/o. My mom moved in with my grandma (her mom) and us kids and that’s where I spent my life until I turned 14 and my grandma passed away. During that time, I didn’t see my dad a lot. Sometimes he would call or make plans, but he would never show up for them.   In the last year, he moved four hours away from us and I didn’t find out until he called after moving and told me he had moved. Now I been with my fiancé for two years and am engaged to be married and my dad has never even met my fiancé and never made the effort. I think we’ve FaceTimed once but the signal was awful and the only thing my dad had to say was some weird, vague Bible Belt alpha dad threat like, “you better take care of her”. I have become very close with my fiancé’s family and my mom has been very involved. When I announced that we had gotten engaged, he didn’t say anything until about a week later, and then it was through a Facebook comment. Recently we decided on the wedding venue and the thing that really sold it to me was that I won’t have to be walked down the aisle by my father because the bride comes out of the bridal suite onto a small balcony, around and down a set of stairs. There will only be room enough for me to walk down alone, and I love that idea.  Over the last year I’ve toyed with the idea of cutting ties with him completely, but each time I consider it, I’m overcome with guilt. I keep thinking how he’s 61 now and not really on his way into old age in great health (he still drinks a fifth of liquor nightly with his girlfriend) and I keep wondering who will take care of him when he’s old. Then I think about how he, even now, will get smashed and call my mom and leave abusive voicemails or abusive text messages for her to read. She showed them to me once and I was just stunned. Stunned and pissed, but still guilty. Ashamed, I guess, because this is such a big time in my life and traditionally a father would be a part of it. I feel guilty too because my fiancé won’t really have a father in law experience like with a traditional family.   I’m just taking on a lot of guilt even though this is supposed to be the happiest time of my life.   TL;DR my dad has never made an effort to be a father to me or be a part of my life. I don’t want him to walk me down the aisle at my wedding and am considering not even inviting him.   TIA anyone/everyone. Sorry if this is jumbled—it’s a lot to get out.	1643057633.0	sbw7is	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbw7is/wibta_if_i_dont_include_my_father_in_my_wedding/	WIBTA if I don’t include my father in my wedding, or don’t invite him at all, after he’s been absent for most of my life and has never met my fiancé?
i29k3tjf	My eight year old son plays football for our school district. There are 2 teams per grade, there is a draft in attempt to make teams as equal as possible. Coaches are parent volunteers.    This upcoming season will be my sons third year participating, so he is 'locked' into his team. His coach has two older sons who went through the program, so Coach is very confident and set in his ways. My son doesn't have a present father, so his coach has really looked out for him. He pushes him hard and put him in positions that typically only the coaches kids get to play (yes it's unfair). Coach isn't very personable or easy to talk to, but he has taught my son a lot and my son likes the boys on his team. The problem is... The other coach for his grade is the guy I'm dating.   Boyfriend is pushing hard for my son to be on his team this July, and called the appropriate people to find out the steps to make the switch. My son does not want to switch. Many of the parents know we are seeing each other, so part of his desire to have my son switch is for appearances (even if he won't admit it). Another part is because my son is a really good player. His reason to me is so he can take my son to practice and we can ride together to away games.   Both coaches are solid coaches (though I do think current coach pushes the boys harder), I would be content either way. My son does not want to switch so I'm not going to force him, even if it ends my relationship.

I just stop everything I just keep getting good grades till college, but know that I am in college I just let myself go, I don't drink, smoke or anything else. Since I'm in my last semester i started to notice some changes in my personality and traits, so thanks to covid I had to go back to my house from college and it felt awful, I never question Ed anything to my parents but yesterday my mom started to yell at me for something insignificant that i say to her, so my father heard everything and proceed to also yell at me saying "Me and your mom are the only one that can scream at you what ever we want, you are being disrespectful" and i lost it... I started to cry and tell them all the things they did to me, how they make me feel in the past and how they make me feel know, i break in front everyone... My siblings in the other hand we're telling me about how selfish and ungrateful daughter I am, they proceed to tell me how just a piece of garbage I am to said all that awful thing to them...

I asked her 4 separate times & she practically brushed me off every time. Then when I went ahead with everyone’s vote & picked up orders she got hysterical saying I did that on purpose to “count her out” when I asked her multiple times & she never answered. I even bought her something with my own money in case she was having a bad day, but I felt like I was being lashed out on for no reason. She literally went OFF on me in our break area & everyone sat in silence confused as she was yelling at me.

4cn4ffc0	This all happened a few days ago. It just occurred to me to post here. I(17f) had a meeting a few days ago in which my guidance counselor and parents were all present. It was an online meeting using Zoom. The purpose of the meeting was to help make sure I’m ready for college. Throughout the meeting, my guidance counselor would ask me questions, and my mom would immediately answer on my behalf. She’s done this my whole life, and it made sense when I was a small, soft-spoken child, but I feel like now that I’m 17 and heading off to college it’s kind of inappropriate and I should answer for myself. I didn’t stop her during the meeting though for fear of embarrassing her. Embarrassing my mother is the number one way to get lashed out at.  Later that night, I approached my mom and asked to talk to her. I said “in the future, could you try not to talk over me like you did at the meeting? I think I should advocate for myself at this point.” She immediately got defensive and said I was accusing her of things. I told her I wasn’t accusing her of anything, I just didn’t like being spoken for. All I was asking was for her to not do it again. She said “I won’t do it again and I didn’t do it in the past. I didn’t speak over you. I’m sorry you feel that way.”  Admittedly, I was kind of pissed at this point. I told her that ‘I’m sorry you feel that way’ isn’t an apology, just deflection. She said “I don’t know why you’re being so hypercritical of me! I try hard for you!” I called her manipulative because in the moment I felt that it was a manipulative thing to say. She looked at me with intense anger in her eyes, but then turned to my dad. “(Dad’s name), did we talk over her?” At first my dad pretended not to know what we were talking about, despite having been right next to us the whole time, but then he agreed with my mom and said that they gave me chances to speak, which I really don’t feel that they did, but my memory might not be that trustworthy. My mom started saying how it was a zoom call, and “how can you even tell who’s turn it is to talk on those things anyway?” I felt myself getting angry and had already said some regrettable things, so I decided to remove myself. I said “ok” and stayed away from my parents for the rest of the night.   I felt small and pathetic in that meeting when my mom answered for me. I don’t need to be relying on her at this point in my life, especially for something as simple as answering personal questions. I regret calling her manipulative and deflecting her apology, but I haven’t apologized and don’t want to.

e7lkvlga	 So, 4 years ago I was on Tinder, and I met this guy who was going through a divorce. We became friends, it wasn’t sexual. He needed a friend, and it turned out so did I. I was unemployed and he urged me to start working for this company. I did. I work in behavioral homes.   Fast forward a year & some, and I’m working at this house that’s co-managed with a house that his ex works at. I’ve worked with her, we avoided talking about her ex. She knew I knew him, because our old manager had told her. Of course I don’t know what exactly she told her. Everything seemed fine, though. We worked well together & were friendly.   Well, fast forward again and we are looking at events from 6 months ago. He had lived in apartments near my neighborhood and was looking to buy a home. He bought a home down the street from me in my neighborhood. Because the have a kid together, For financial reasons his ex-wife lived with him. I’m the chatty friendly sort, and thinking it’d be nice (and less awkward since I literally drive past the house at least 3 times a day) I messaged her a welcome to my neighborhood, since I’d had her # for work reasons. It was a “hi, welcome to the neighborhood! If you ever need anything let me know” type text.  Well, I get a text 15 minutes later from him & he’s freaking out that I texted her. I apologized & told him I was just trying to be friendly since I’d see her all the time & we were neighbors. He wouldn’t accept the apology and told me to leave them alone or he’d call the cops. He kept sending messages like that until I eventually blocked him-it seemed really really over the top to me.  So now we are at today. Since someone has covid, if we work that house we get double our salary while the person is quarantined. I was promised hours at this house, but my supervisor asked if I would give them up to this woman. I sent my supervisor this text:  “I’d really really prefer to keep those hours. I live in a 1 income household where the only way to make a livable salary is to burn myself out when I can, so I’m not trying to be a witch, but I was really looking forward to the treat of making a little extra without stressing myself out.”  She let me keep the hours. I won’t lie-some of the feelings I had were resentment that I’m trying to be friendly, her & her ex freaked out. He had been my friend for 4 years.   Am I the asshole for welcoming of her to the neighborhood or keeping the hours?	1643058468.0	sbwixv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwixv/aita_for_welcoming_a_neighbor_into_my/	AITA for welcoming a neighbor into my neighborhood who’s ex husband and I were friends and more…
izd13wry	I (30F) have been a non-meat eater for over half my life. I've always acknowledged that it's my personal choice & I would never tell someone else what they can/can't eat, including meat. I've always gone with friends/family to 'regular' restaurants, despite my often limited options; I chose my lifestyle but I'd like to make them happy.  When I started seeing my bf (30M) about 2 years ago, I made him aware I was vegan & even told him that I had loosely considered only dating other vegans/vegetarians going forward; it would make everything related to good easier as I've had some conflict in past relationships with them treating me like a burden. However, I put that thought aside because I cared about him a lot more than a new potential deal-breaker of mine.  He's always tried vegan food I make at home & has even said he liked it & has since then eaten those specific meals with me. We've gone out a few times to 'regular' places geared primarily to omnivores, but I'm always happy to go to make him happy & to spend time out with him. My lack of options sucks sometimes but I know it's my choice & it's not important in the scheme of things.   Recently I had an interest in trying a strictly vegan place that has a lot of food I can't often get elsewhere. I showed him the menu ahead of time since I didn't want to ask him to go somewhere he wouldn't eat anything. He said sure, he'd be happy to try there if I wanted to.  Once there I ordered & asked what he'd like. He told me he doesn't like food pretending to be something it's not (fake meat/chik'n etc) despite eating/supposedly liking it at my house. He said he'd just grab a burger from down the street once I was done eating. I was sad & said I would've rather gone alone if I knew that was going to happen.  We talked today & he said if I wanted to go somewhere that had nothing he'd eat he could just order food from another place & bring it with us. I refused, saying it's rude/tacky & mostly not permitted to bring outside food. He disagreed & said he'd never seen that be a problem. I admitted I'd be very embarrassed to do that & would rather just go alone. He finally said no, fine, he'd just go wherever I wanted to go. I said that going forward I'll feel like I'm twisting his arm asking him to try somewhere unless I find something there I know he'll eat.  He begrudgingly said again he'd do what I want so I'm happy. I feel like I shouldn't bother inviting him if I want to try somewhere since I'll know he'll tell me it's not his preference but that he'll just do it. He says he wants to be more supportive than anyone has been in my life but I feel bad & like I'm forcing him to eat something he doesn't want. I worry there will be tension now if I suggest somewhere I'd like to go.   AITA expecting him, if he agrees to go to a vegan place, to try the food without assuming he'll hate it & then have him remind me that he's just going to make me happy?	1643058459.0	sbwitu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwitu/aita_expecting_bf_to_eat_vegan_food/	AITA expecting bf to eat vegan food
hpzetgoy	The two coworkers who sit on the either side of me are having non work related conversations for half an hour at a time while I am sat between them trying to speak to clients on the phone. This happens every day. I can’t hear the person I’m speaking to properly and they can probably also hear what Karen next to me is having for lunch. This has only been going on since last week when one of them moved into our area of the office. I have asked them to stop and been ignored, today I could not hear the person I was speaking to and had to put them on hold to ask my coworkers to shut the f up.   I should add we are unprecedentedly busy and that one of these people has our manager picking up some of their work because they’re so ‘busy’ but they’re spending so much time talking and doing no work. Karen has also threatened one of the execs with handing her notice in if we don’t get more staff as we’re overworked yet she isn’t pulling her weight.   I got fed up and went to sit in another department and we had a productive day. Now the two coworkers who kept talking over me have complained that I was rude and my manager wants to know why I have moved.

7kfmk2sw	It snowed early this morning. We live on a cobbled street, with the majority of our neighbours being at least 30 years older than husband and I (41F and 42M). At the end of our street, 7 houses down (5 before theirs empty - holiday homes) are the only neighbours close to our age. I assume parents are in their early 50s and their son is in his early 20s, mobile, physically active etc. Anyway at the other end of our street is a small minimarket which is a bit of a hub for the older people.   This afternoon, we decided, along with our kids to clear the path from our house to the market, ensuring that each house on the way had a safe path to the shop. This was roughly 250m of path cleaning, and took us quite a while with our eager 9&7 year old, tackling padded down snow that was slowly becoming ice. After finishing, we were all absolutely shattered - husband by now is wearing a heat patch, kids are fast asleep extra early and I'm self medicating my back pain with snow-chilled wine.   We went indoors and made hot drinks. There was a knock on the door....answered the door to the 50-something old spitting feather that we didn't clear the path to her house. Her son needed to get to his car, parked near the minimarket and had to risk his neck getting to the path we fixed. I kindly informed her, they were more than welcome to borrow our spades. She screamed, seeing as we made paths for all the other neighbours (all 70+ old) and we should have had done the same to them. I apologised, saying i didn't realise that they were physically unable to do it themselves which infuriated the woman more for insinuating that they were a derogatory term. I told her to piss off. Husband says we're NTA, but MIL insists that we are.	1643058621.0	sbwkyq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbwkyq/aita_for_not_clearing_a_path_for_my_neighbour/	AITA for not clearing a path for my neighbour after it snowed?
izhgtrdb	Trying to keep this short -  I am a married 36 year old woman with no plans to have kids. I recently had an issue with a coworker where our boss emailed her/I to ask if one of us could cover an evening call (it's a 9-5 job but we occasionally have evening calls due to collaborators in different time zones). The coworker asked me to do it because her son had a soccer game, but I said that I can't do it because I had a volleyball game. She said that I should do it because the soccer game is for her kid and my volleyball game is just for me. I said that respectfully my outside-of-work commitments are not less important than hers because I don't have children, and that she should take the call because I had taken the last two. She scoffed at me, and I know that other people around the office have been gossiping about me since and saying that it was super messed up that I made her miss her kid's soccer game.  I think that it's incredibly important to support working mothers. I am always more than happy to accommodate the schedules of the mothers I work with when it doesn't cause a significant inconvenience to me - for example, some coworkers leave early to pick up their kids (our company is great about that), and I'm happy to work project schedules around that. I also would have taken that call if I hadn't had a conflict as long as it wasn't a pattern of me taking significantly more evening calls.  I talked to a friend about this (who is a mother), and she said that I should have just done it because people who don't have kids really should have more empathy for working parents and we don't understand how hard it is. I said respectfully that I do understand that working mothers have much more stressful lives than I do, which is why I decided not to be a mother. I also said that I can have respect and empathy for working mothers and also value my time/ choices equally. She similarly scoffed and said that I don't understand.

40unwz4l	I, (31F) started dating my boyfriend in 2019, so we have been together for awhile now. I have a son from a separate relationship who is now 5 years old. My son, boyfriend and I all live together.  My boyfriend asked me if I would like to move from CA to UT so we could afford to purchase a home and live a more comfortable life. So after sitting with that for awhile, I agreed and we went ahead and purchased a home in September 2021 in Utah.  We won’t be moving to the house until next summer but we just fell in love with it and couldn’t risk it selling. Well, when I told my mom and dad, my mom wasn’t completely thrilled. However, she expressed her support and has continued to do so since we informed her of our decision.   Here’s where I might be the asshole, when I informed my brother and his wife about our move, we were met with a forced “congratulations” through clenched teeth. Which was weird but people are entitled to their reactions and feelings.  Since then, all I have been getting met with is passive aggressive comments at family gatherings. They don’t bring up Utah and when it is brought up, they make it known they want no part of the conversation. When I asked my mom about the tension in the air recently, she told me something interesting.  She said “He’s upset that you didn’t ask for his opinion about moving to Utah and thinks that you’re breaking up the family.” (I was born and raised in CA)   I told her that I wasn’t aware I had to run my life plans by him, and told her about the awkward exchange we had when I had informed him of our move. I got the hint that my mom would like it if I reached out to my brother and had a conversation with him about this…but with how they’re acting and how they responded initially, I don’t see the point? It’s a done deal, and why would I confide in someone who has already made their opinion so clear?  I know everyone has a right to feel how they feel, and yes before as a young woman I would look to my brother and sister in law for some advice and their opinions, but just because you give someone advice, mean they have to take it. So I feel having the conversation is a moot point because it seems that no matter what I decide to do, if it’s not what they would do, they’d still be acting this way. I am not ungrateful for my brother and SIL previous help, but I didn’t think taking their advice meant I couldn’t think for myself.  My sister in law is basically his echo and shadow, she treats me based on however my brother feels towards me. I can tell when things are amiss when she’s very nice and friendly towards me when we’re alone, but if my brother is around, she’s withdrawn and rude.   I don’t think it is my responsibility to come to them to discuss this issue. They’re the ones with the issue, and it’s theirs until they tell me about it. And even then, I don’t think I’d care.

exlwt810	I’m starting off with some context here. My bio mom shared custody of me with my grandparents (her parents) but I spent my entire life being raised by my grandparents.  I (21f) just recently got engaged. After sharing the news with my parents, I shared the news with my bio mom, who I thought would be excited for me. She turned around and told be that she was not supportive of my fiancée (21m) and I getting married. I then asked her why, but told her I would take her off the list if she felt she didn’t want to be there. She refused to tell me why, repeatedly stating that she had already told me her reasons (she hasn’t) and that I was just in love with the idea of having a wedding. (Note: my fiancée and I have been together since 2018) She then stated that she still wanted an invitation because she can “support me without supporting the marriage.” I really don’t want to give her an invitation anymore because I only want people there that are happy for us, and love and support us as it’s our day.

4j2vl8rh	To preface, I (F21) am currently in a sorority but I don’t live in the sorority house. I, like a good older sister does, sometimes purchase alcohol for younger girls in the house at their request. Usually I’m pretty good at being discreet and bring it to their rooms, but as of recently my class schedule is very busy.  One of the girls in the house asked me to get her a few bottles of specific stuff and would venmo me to compensate, and of course I obliged. I left the stuff in a bag, kind of off to the side in one of the common spaces where people get their mail.   I texted her a photo of the bag as soon as I dropped it off. She went to grab it about an hour and a half later and the bag was gone. I texted our house mom to check the security footage for someone taking a bag (in case the alcohol was stolen), to which she replied she dumped it since alcohol isn’t allowed in the house (she personally doesn’t care but it’s policy).   I didn’t think it would be a deal since I assumed she was home but I guess not. Neither of us are in trouble or anything but it was a pretty expensive amount of alcohol.

egek66oi	So I have one designated parking spot. My apartment number is labeled in front of it and there is a sign directly in front of it that says “Violators will be towed at owners expense.” There are multiple of these signs and assigned spot parking throughout the lot, but not all of the spaces are assigned. It is not a traditional apartment building, but rather groups of townhomes lined up with one long parking lot in front of them. The building next to me is not connected to me, and is owned by a different management company, however our parking lot is “one” lot, if that makes sense. It is snowing here, so there are no distinct “lines” anymore, but like I said there is the numbered sign.  Lately there have been two strange vehicles parking in our lot, both in my spot and around it. Each time this happens, I am forced to park in a different spot other than my assigned spot. Street parking is not an option here. I text my landlord when this happens, not in an effort to get the offender towed, but so I myself do not become the subject of a towing due to having to park elsewhere because someone is in my spot.   Today, the owner of one of the cars met me as I got out of my car and asked who the landlord of my building was. She explained that her car had been towed twice now, and she couldn’t afford to get it out. I pointed out the “violators will be towed sign.” She said that her landlord (who I then learned was different from my own, as I thought my landlord managed all of those buildings) told her the entire lot was open parking. I explained to her that it is not, and the designed number signs correspond to my buildings apartment. Her building does not have numbers for their apartments, but the one on the other side of me does. Its confusing, I know. I talked with her for a bit and told her that she should explain to her rental company the miscommunication, and ask that they pay the tow bill, since she was under the impression her car was authorized to be there.   I feel like I might be TA because I did go directly to contacting my landlord, who I knew would go straight to towing. I could have tried to knock on doors to figure out who’s car it was, but I didn’t because of freezing temperatures here and I just generally didn’t want to knock on strangers’ doors (I have lived here only a short time).

My mom is a narcissist and extremely self absorbed and my dad isn’t there for me at all. Him and my mom were together for 8 years prior to my birth and then after they broke up my dad married another women, essentially creating another family and forgetting about me.  At first he was off and on seeing me once every weekend, then it turned to weeks, months, and then I would barely receive text messages. And when I would it would be passive aggressive comments about how I should come see him and how I’m old enough to take the bus and train.   I got tired of it eventually and stopped talking to him until a few days ago. I sent him a long paragraph saying that I’m done waiting for him to be the father I wish he could be and to stop talking to me as if I chose to get pregnant at 19 and then blocked him.

ibz5t8nk	Basically, there was this guy that I met on a dating app. I told him that I didn't want to date anyone, and I just wanted to have friends. He said he was cool with that, and we talked for a while. I met him on the app in October. He wished me a merry Christmas and a happy new year and everything, and I told him that we should meet now. He agreed. We set a date, but at the last minute, he couldn't make it. I was fine with that. He then said that the next day, we could meet. I told him, "Okay, cool! Let me know what time!" He never responded and only like two weeks later did I ever hear anything back from him and all he said was, "Hey, what's up?" on Saturday at 9 PM. I think we've made plans to meet like 2 or 3 times before, but he always has canceled last minute on me.  I like... am very crystal clear with my friends and I absolutely dislike it when people make plans and then they don't follow through with them.

7i127bg2	I (Italian, 27m) have a gf (French, 27f). We live together far from home.  Past week, my dad and his gf came to visit and dad’s gf cooked some classic Italian dishes.  Before leaving, she left us some pasta sauces that she made for later. More specifically, she left a bit of Pesto (classical Italian pasta sauce).   One night, my gf didn’t want to cook and I would have arrived later home so I said I would cook myself a bit of pasta with the pesto left from my dad’s gf.   She immediately made me notice that it was not respectful from my side to not even consider if she wanted to have pesto as well (not that night, maybe another time) and what I said as a lack of respect because I didn’t consider her.   I justified saying that for me this sauce has nothing special since it’s made from ingredients we can easily find where we live and we could make it again ourselves so no big deal. But even if I don’t agree with her point, I still respect her point of view (she can’t eat it whenever she wants and making it on our own takes time) so I didn’t eat it that night. I closed the discussion with a “let’s agree to disagree”.   She insisted in explaining that in similar situations (we had couple of situations where I spontaneously did something without asking for her consent because I was not thinking it was necessary such as leaving keys on her books (she thinks the book cover could have been ruined) or opening a bottle of wine (she wanted to save it for another occasion) we had at home) I should understand by myself that something it’s important for her and I should ask her opinion before deciding what to do.   I, again, understand and respect her point of view in those situations but I refuse to accept the problem it’s me not understanding what’s worth asking her opinion or not. So I explained that she should calm down and not yelling at me each time I do something “wrong” and also that she should accept we have not the same values scale, especially when it comes to decisions around very simple topics. The discussion continued but shifted on me being blamed because I don’t respect her.   She later explained her reaction comes from people not respecting her during her past so she reacts in the wrong way.  I still do not accept this as an excuse. I find this would limit my freedom of living and it’s annoying to ask for what I think are stupid things. On top of it, I would still not know, next time, if something I do would bother her for another not obvious reason.  She still pretends I have to ask her opinion.   Now she still pretends I stop deciding without including her and I refuse to ask her opinion on things I think I can decide on my own.  PS: I understand on my own that something like family holidays destination or purchasing a new car are decisions that requires her opinion.

itbhmz4p	A week ago, we went out to celebrate the boyfriend's birthday with BFF, his brothers and my sister with her husband and her dad (45M). During the night out, my sister's dad got really drunk and rude towards the boyfriend and his brother's who came out with us. Whenever he's drunk, he likes to call people   For the past 2 months, my sister's (21F) best friend (19F) and her boyfriend (24M) have been living with me (22M) and my husband (23M).   A week ago, we went out to celebrate BFF's boyfriend's birthday. Our group included me, BFF, her boyfriend, his brothers, my sister with her husband **and** dad (45M). For context, my sister's dad was not invited and decided to come to the club with us for unknown reasons. During the night, my sister's dad got very drunk and become very rowdy and rude towards the boyfriend and his brothers. Calling them names or slurs when speaking towards, and grabbing them by the neck to talk to them.   BFF kept telling my sister that she needed to tell her dad that he needed to stop acting the way he was because he was upsetting the boyfriend and his brothers, but my sister never spoke up against her dad. Eventually, the dad grabbed the back of boyfriend's brothers neck again who told him in return to "stop f\*cking touching me". This caused my sister's dad to demand if the brother "had a problem". We ended up moving to a different part of the building because tension was threatening to explode.   We all ended up exiting the club and going out by our cars, where BFF told my sister that she was no longer going to be friends with her due to her ruining the night. (This was the first birthday she was celebrating with her boyfriend). My sister, who has history of emotional/behavior issues while also being drunk, did not take this lightly. She ended up having an episode and melt-down for almost an hour, and it took me and her husband forcing her into their car for her to leave.   Now, my sister believes she is in the right for the situation because they were drunk and shouldn't be held accountable for what happened, and she shouldn't be responsible for her dads actions. Her dad also believes he was justified in how he acted because the boyfriend and his brothers were being disrespectful to him for how they spoke to him. The BFF and her boyfriend believe they are in the right because they asked my sister to say something to her dad about the way he was acting and she never did.   AITA for continuing to let the EX-BFF and her boyfriend live with me? I have yet to choose a side and have not given any opinion on what went down. My family has not really spoken with me since the incident, but they have not specified if it was because of the fact I had still had them living with me. I'm not sure if this makes me a bad brother.	1643060529.0	sbxd1f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxd1f/aita_for_letting_my_sisters_exbff_still_live_with/	AITA for letting my sister's EX-BFF still live with me?
gcogjc1o	I f(14) go to a public middle school. I came to this school as someone who wasn’t really wanting to be friends but as I got closer in the year I made a few close friends. Im fine with not having friends as-well. Quarantine came, and in 7th grade I become really anti social, It made it hard for me to be able to just speak when I wanted to. 8th grade (current) I practically was labeled “quiet girl”  this year, the trimester I have requirements are 2 RA’s (related arts) classes in which I have gym. I’m usually a nice girl and I try to help everyone a lot. I helped this person who isn’t exactly like everyone else but I won’t call them special needs M(13/14, we are going to call him Jacob) I gave Jacob a piece of paper and ever since Jacob has been greeting me and I’ve been greeting them. It’s been fine. Until I took a RA with him. I being a very awkward person wasn’t exactly looking for new friends and I was happy with where I was. And he on the other hand I guess wasn’t satisfied. One day in our class we had to be in groups and ironically enough I was put into a category with him. Our other assiagned partner basically abandoned us leaving us only to work together. As the class is finishing up he asks me how was my weekend. Me wanting to be polite I told him it was fine. I then asked him how was his as a kind peer gesture. And he then told me how he liked to sow. I told him I was kinda interested in sowing so I wouldn’t seem completely uninterested. Because i wasn’t I did sorta like sowing but I wasn’t interested in talking about it now, with him. He then is like “wanna be friends??? We should be friends” he didn’t even give me time to answer and it honestly made  me feel uncomfortable. Now he always tells me hi every single second in the day. He now even just walks up to me in the middle of the conversation with my friends to just talk about things I’m very uninterested in. I feel so terrible that this is how I feel and I feel even worse that I feel uncomfortable with whatever relationship he’s trying to create. I now even find myself trying to avoid him because of how uncomfortable i feel with this. I told my friend about it and how much it makes me feel uncomfortable. I honestly just wanted to be nice. Now it feels like I’m being harassed. I don’t want to be associated with him at all he gives me a very weird vibe and I actually just want to try to stay away from him.

9kzr4dvq	I (24 F) have been looking for CNA jobs for the past few weeks. I got two job offers, however, the training takes place around the times my mother will have her appointments in early February. I quit my previous job back in August, and ever since I have been taking my mom to her appointments, hospital visits, and the same applies to my aunt (my mom's older sister because my mom is her financial power of attorney). I asked my mom last year before the holidays if I could start applying for jobs since I didn't have much money left. She told me to wait till next year because her health and my aunt's health were declining. The holidays have passed and I'm now officially broke and don't have enough to go back to school.   2022 came and I was told to wait till February or March to start applying, but offers that I have been looking for specifically have started to finally pop up after months of looking. I live in a small town so CNA jobs that provide paying for school and training were things I needed and I haven't seen in months. I feel like the AH because I know these appointments coming up are very important to her and I do want to help any way I can. I even considered doing night shifts once my training is up.  Tl;dr - I applied to jobs but they will stop my mom from visiting her doctor's appointments.	1643060754.0	sbxgcq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxgcq/wibta_if_i_24_f_accepted_job_offers_but_hinder_my/	WIBTA if I (24 F) accepted job offers but hinder my mom from going to the doctor?
iyh8dryi	A couple of weeks ago, my niece “Amy” (26f) messaged me saying that she had left her abusive husband so she and her son “Andy” (9m) didn’t have anyplace to live.  I then offered to take them in, help her get Andy enrolled in school, help her finish her GED, and help her find a good job. She was enthusiastic about this as a fresh start. I made it clear that I couldn’t allow smoking at all in my house because I have severe asthma and had ended up in the ER previously when a guest smoked, even though they went outside to do it, because the smoke that came in through the door when the guest came back inside was enough to trigger an asthma attack (more than once!). Amy agreed not to smoke and asked me to buy her nicotine patches, which I did.  I paid for Amy and Andy’s plane tickets to where I am, arranged transportation to the airport, and flew to the airport to meet them so I could be supportive, since neither of them had ever flown before.   Within two hours of her arrival at my house I was being barraged by requests from her, from her mother (my sister), and from my sister-in-law to let her smoke. The barrage continued for two full days, with added requests to go to a dispensary so she could get marijuana, to the ER so she could get prescription painkillers, and to take her someplace where she could “hang out.”  When the barrage stopped I discovered her with bags packed preparing to sneak out of the house and walk to the nearest town (14 miles away) at night with Andy. I told her this didn’t seem like a good decision, and she responded that she always makes good decisions for her and Andy.  Frustrated, I responded that I was pretty sure that using and cooking meth, which had resulted in CPS taking Andy from her for more than a year, hadn’t been a good decision. Andy then exclaimed that I was wrong, she had been in school when he was living away from her. I told him that unfortunately that wasn’t true.   Shortly afterwards, I got a call from my sister’s boyfriend saying that he had bought them plane tickets home because it turns out Andy is a ward of the state—and she had fled with him a week before a hearing.  I took her to the airport in time for their flight and wished them safe travels.  The day of the hearing I got a call from Andy’s caseworker wanting to understand the sequence of events. I answered her questions honestly, including describing the requests to go to a marijuana dispensary and to the ER for prescription painkillers for a sore tooth, which was no longer sore when I countered with an offer to take her to an emergency dentist instead.  In her court hearing later that day, she was drug tested at the request of CPS. She was furiously irate, and my sister (who is an alcoholic) declared to the rest of the family that I am dead to her.

3ux7ocp6	Some context,  I moved from the South to the Midwest in 2020 after graduation for a job. At the time, my mom was living alone and widowed four years prior, and was battling a methadone addiction.   In late 2021, she had a COVID-related medical emergency that she never quite recovered. I drove down a couple of times and even had to readmit her after the hospital discharged her in no position to take care of herself. She eventually recovered somewhat and I convinced her to sell her house, as she had no liquid assets and was completely broke and needed some amount of money more than the $1800 she was getting from my dad’s life insurance. She agreed and used what she got to move into a small, more appropriate apartment. She told me she had a friend of hers coming by every once in a while to help her on her bad days that she assured me were infrequent. It turns out, she had someone she met at the methadone clinic living with her, and this person has a reputation for being bad news in the admittedly gossipy crowd of fellow methadone addicts.   Anyway, my mom passed away two weeks ago after taking too much Valium before going to sleep. Still in shock about that. But the issue is, she paid three months of rent in advance, so this addict friend of hers thought she would be able to live in the apartment until February (presumably bringing over her friends, one of which I saw the last time I visited the apartment). I took the precious items, my mom’s leftover prescriptions, and family heirlooms from her apartment and left her keys with the apartment manager. This would’ve been Saturday morning, the day after her memorial.   Today, I get a call saying the apartment staff are forcibly ejecting her from the premises. My mom’s apartment was a safe haven for her where she didn’t have to live with her abusive ex-boyfriend, so according to her, she has nowhere left to go. And now I’m conflicted because she had planned the next three months around my mother being alive and well, that didn’t happen.  Don’t do drugs, y’all. The opioid epidemic is real.	1643061102.0	sbxl4l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxl4l/aita_for_kicking_the_drug_addict_my_mom_had/	AITA for kicking the drug addict my mom had looking after her out after she died?
izikjxht	So my family recently had get together where each person would bring a dish. My sister hasn't cooked before, (her words not mine) but she wanted to try new things. So we meet up at my mom's and we sat our dishes down, and began chatting. Since my sister doesn't really con i was intrested in how she made the mashed potatos, so i asked what recipe she used and she said she boiled potato chips and added butter and cream. I was surprised as I had never heard of mashed potatos made this way, but I didn't say anything because maybe they were good. Once we sat down and started eating I tried the mashed potatoes and they were bad. (This is where i might be TA) After dinner I pulled my sister aside and told her that I thought they were disgusting, but I could give her some recipes and we could try to make them together sometime. She then got really mad and threw water at me and stormed out.

6jcfn0ob	I (22f) and my (22m) best friend Kevin have been friends for 8 years off and on and about a month ago he asked me to come work with him and I had reservations about it but applied anyway and got the job. Well before I took the job I asked him that the girl his coworkers were trying to set me up with wouldn’t be a problem well he reassured me it wouldn’t be. Well after a few shifts she starts talking to him and I didn’t like the way he acted around her and so I asked her what her intentions were with my best friend and she said none of your business and I said you will hurt him and she said in all the right ways. And then anouther time she came up to us working and I said back off and then she came up to us and said wanna kiss and he got all flustered and after five min she pulls out a Hershey kiss and I didn’t find it funny and then later that day I went to throw away my trash and talk to my friend and she was back there talking about getting canvases with him witch is something I do with him and I said no we can do that together and he told me to calm down and she started saying he dosent love you he will never date you etc and I said his mom will never approve of you and then hugged him to show he does love me and then she asked him if he wanted to get the manager involved and say I was harassing him at work and I said don’t and a higher up told me to go get some fresh air and told her to go home and I did and when I went to come back in she was walking out with her and I said you were supposed to go home snd went after him to his car on break to appolgize and he drove off like a crazy person with my hand still on the door handle. after dropping me off at home that day he stopped talking to  me and blocked my number. then he told the gm what happened and I got fired. He now blames me for him having to quit. He also would drive off with people so was alone in tears at break.

1ti9vlkz	Context: before our baby was born my husband and I had a household income of about 120k a year, I work for a company and he works for his parents business. Before the baby was born we agreed to pay his mom $800/month to watch the baby as child care. Before which my MIL was working part time working minimum wage making about $800 a month (which is where we got the $800 figure).   Fast forward to a year later my husband takes a substantial pay cut at his job because his dad cannot / refuses to pay him a higher wage. Pushing our household income to more like $80k/year. It was a substantial pay cut for my husband. I found a daycare by my work that charges $600/month for full time day care, plus if we do this option we can deduct the child care expenses on our taxes. I brought this up to my husband and he said I would be the asshole for switching daycares to save $2,400 a year… I say it’s not personal we just aren’t making the same money we used to.   My MIL would be crushed as she loves watching my kiddo. Additional info: my MIL/FIL own a totally successful business and didn’t need my MILs income. I was honestly shocked at the $800 a month price tag. My parents, who live in another state, said they would watch her for free if they could.   I dont want to be a total monster in law. And my husband says it’s not fair to do because his mother quit her job to watch the kiddo.  But $2,400 is a lot of money.

hzo1aocu	so my (25F) friend (24F) has been dating this guy (24M) for about a year. I’ll call my friend Sally and her boyfriend Greg. Sally owns her own house, and a few months into their relationship Greg moved in. Greg has trouble holding down a job and doesn’t help a lot with bills or other expenses.   Their relationship seemed really great at first, he was romantic and Sally often told me she could see spending her life with him. But over the last 6 months or so it has been pretty bad. Greg doesn’t help with any housework, he spends all of his time at home playing video games, and when he does leave the house it’s to go out with his friends. Sally has told me they haven’t gone on a date or even had dinner together in months. He hardly even talks to her when they’re home together.   She has given him like 3-4 “ultimatums” that if he didn’t put more effort into their relationship/help around the house she was done with him. Every single time she backs out and stays with him despite him not changing at all. And I hear about all of it. I get paragraphs and paragraphs about how shitty of a boyfriend he is and how this time it’s different and she’s done with him. I’ve told Sally more than once that I support that decision as I think she deserves someone who actually wants to spend time with her.   But it’s gotten old, ya know? It’s always the same complaints and I’m always the shoulder she cries on about it and I’m always the one she asks for advice. But she doesn’t take my advice and she always goes back to her unhappy situation. Yesterday she came over for lunch and immediately launched into a rant about how this time she’s serious and she’s gonna ask him to move out. I told her I hope she is serious, as I really don’t want to keep hearing about her relationship issues if she’s not. She got really offended and left my house, later sending me an angry text that I should be a more supportive friend.   I feel like I’ve been very supportive and even now I don’t think I’m in the wrong, but maybe I should be more sensitive about it.

eddpezpy	My sister and brother in law (BIL), who I am extremely close with, had my baby nephew two weeks ago. Baby was in NICU for a week and a half following an anticipated surgery. Baby healed really well, but what followed was a weeklong nightmare of additional surprise “issues” that doctors kept looking into. It put a lot of stress but luckily everything else was clear and he came home 6 days ago. The night they arrived, my sister asked me to come over.   I showed up with a suitcase and was planning to stay for a week. But I left on the fourth day.  I was trying to help as much as I could with things like preparing bottles, laundry, trying to get my sister to nap which means watching the newborn as he sleeps (my sister refuses to sleep without someone watching him, even though we have technology to help track his breathing) etc. But nothing I did seemed to be enough or right — I was in the wrong for going to bed at night (I begged her to assign shifts so we could all get sleep and she wouldn’t), too slow in getting bottles warmed, would ask me to fetch items and I’d grab the wrong things, etc.   On top of it, her and my BIL kept (and keep) fighting. Like, screaming with the newborn in arms. My sister kept complaining that she has no help, but wouldn’t allow my BIL to pick up his own son or change a diaper. She says that he has no idea what he’s doing and can’t trust him with the baby, rather than just working on it with him. She also doesn’t let him take naps and when he does, says he’s a deadbeat father. So, she kept turning to me over those four days to help with the baby instead.   On the fourth day, I said to her that I think the fighting needs to stop and that she should ask my BIL to help with the baby so he has bonding time / learns how to do the things, while I can deal with household errands. This caused her to blow up at me and say I am causing issues between her and BIL by being there, that they will be fine once I leave, and that I need to stop lecturing if I want to help.   So, I packed up and left despite the fact that for months I said I’d help, know she’s extremely stressed out, and my BIL is at his wits end. However, I feel gaslighted, disrespected and taken advantage of. I put a lot of time and energy into supporting her. We are now not speaking and I know that when we do, she will say I’m making it about me, playing victim when she’s the real victim, and that of course she has no one but herself.   AITA for leaving?  More background context here:  - I’m in my early 30s and she’s 8 years older than me. We lost my mom 15 years ago and my dad doesn’t live in the same state. Don’t have other family. She is very sensitive and relies on me a lot emotionally. It’s definitely toxic. - My sister verbally abuses my BIL infront of me all the time. I constantly tell her to stop doing it infront of me and she doesn’t. She calls me a “snowflake” instead.	1643061697.0	sbxth8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxth8/aita_for_leaving_my_sister_after_promising_to/	AITA for leaving my sister after promising to help take care of newborn?

30qqkbhs	Hello!  Background: I am heavily involved in animal rescue. I foster and run the volunteer program for my rescue, every Sunday morning I go and do outreach in the community and care for dogs left on chains (fresh straw, water, food, cuddles, health checks), and I am now starting on a few different TNR projects which has been a dream of mine for so long.   Now for the actual story: I have a friend who is up for a big promotion at work, but due to the nature of the position and the company’s concerns with community involvement, the promotion has a volunteer hour requirement/preference. The person applying for it has to have completed x amount of hours to be considered for the position (I’ve never heard of this before but I guess it’s a thing).  My friend, let’s call her A, told me she listed me as a reference for the promotion and I was dumbfounded/shocked because she has never volunteered with me.  She said she didn’t have a lot of volunteer experience, so she put me down saying she volunteers for my rescue, does outreach with me, and assists on TNR projects (which is amazing because I haven’t even done TNR yet).  I didn’t really know what to say to her, and I’ve gotten an email from her company wanting to set up a quick phone call to discuss A’s contribution to the organization. She didn’t even list the organizations correctly; she put it all under my rescue org when really there are 2 other orgs involved that I can’t speak on behalf of.  I told her this made me extremely uncomfortable and she knows I’m never a person to lie.  She got extremely defensive and started telling me I’m a horrible friend for even considering not having her back and supporting her getting a promotion. She doesn’t see any of this as that big of a deal because she’s “sure she’ll volunteer there eventually.”   My problem is (besides lying) if they ask her in the interview about it, she’s knows nothing about animal rescue. If they find out she is lying, it will fall back on me for lying on behalf of my organization. I value the rescues reputation a lot. And the activities she mentioned aren’t even things my rescue does.  She’s now blowing up my phone saying if I don’t respond to her company, she can’t get an interview. And then if I do respond and tell the truth, she says she’s worried they may just fire her all together. She went on this long rant about how if she loses her job she’ll be homeless and it’s all my fault and how can I live with myself etc…  She even involved her husband who has been texting me trying to pressure me into lying. They both thing I’m being a dramatic AH who won’t just help out a friend. A’s texts range from pitiful begging to personal attacks.  This whole situation has made me sick, and even if it makes me a horrible friend, I really don’t think I can use my position in rescue to lie for her.

izir4aqx	Using a throwaway and it's a complicated story, bare with me!  So a few years ago, I (28F) met my boyfriend (29) while studying abroad in Germany. He is originally from China but has completed his degree and now works full time in Germany. I'm from the UK, which becomes relevant to this. We've been together since April 2017 and managed to do long distance pretty well.  He currently works for a large car company, and his language skills are part of the reason why he is on a salary of nearly 50,000 euros (he translates for both English and German branches into Mandarin). I currently work for a large fashion retailer in the UK that has branches across Europe, but have just been offered training to move into a management position, which would push my salary up to £32,000.  Here's my dilemma. BF is wanting to get more serious and wants to talk about marriage, kids etc... Which is great because I can see a future with him including those. Two weeks ago, he was offered a job in the UK, in my part of the country, for more money (roughly £57,000). Now I think this is the best move for him for two reasons: one, his contract in Germany only has 4 months left and after that he needs to find something new, and two, his family are all scattered across Europe. I mean his entire family. His parents are in Spain, siblings and nephews are in France and Italy, and his grandparents are split between Spain and the UK. He has absolutely no links left in China, and for him to return there, his salary would drop by quite a lot as there are also a lot of people there who can do his job, it's not as in demand as it is here. He is wanting to move back to China this year, and for me to move there next year after I finish my management training. Apart from the language barrier, the training I would do is very specific and probably couldn't be transferred to a new company. So I would end up jobless and dependant on him, his salary would be cut in half, and realistically we would have to live in a main city where the rent is ridiculously high. If he was to take the job offer in the UK, he would be moving into my rented house, be close to his entire family and be in a well paying job. He is accusing me of being insensitive though and saying it's horrible that I won't even consider moving to China. I understand that it's his home country and for him to accept the job here he would have to give up his citizenship (from what I understand you can't be a Chinese citizen and have dual citizenship), but logically the UK seems like the right choice.  IDK, maybe I am being an asshole and I guess I need you all to tell me...	1643062128.0	sbxzh4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxzh4/aita_for_not_considering_a_move_to_china_for_my/	AITA for not considering a move to China for my boyfriend?

6gthchur	 To be fair, my wedding will be after their wedding, but just before their honeymoon.     My friends got engaged back on 2020 before I met them, even before I met my current boyfriend. They started out as friends of my boyfriend but the bride and I became really close. So close that i am in the wedding and I've also helped with planning it.     My boyfriend and I have been talking about getting married since December. I told them about our plans and they were happy and excited for us. We planned on going to the court house next year during summer, but since we want move and buy a house, I moved up our date.     Because of this, I asked the bride if they had honeymoon plan yet, and she said no. So I moved ahead and made a plan for my wedding since their wedding would over and it's the only time that works out for my guests that are traveling. They have since made honeymoon plans and its just a few days after our wedding. No big deal.     When they shared their honeymoon plans, I told them about our plans to marry, about how I basically already have everything done (the venue, the restaurant, the dress and decorations) but they didn't seem too excited for us. They played it off but a few days later I asked her what was up. She said they felt uncomfortable with it being so close to their wedding and for it being very similar to theirs (decorations, dress, colors and venue are similar). She said they love us and will do what they can to support us but they do feel as though their twos are being stepped on.     I spoke to my boyfriend and he said he doesn't see the need for the rush either, but that if this is what I want, he supports me. So am I the asshole??	1643060616.0	sbxeag	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbxeag/aita_for_having_my_wedding_around_my_friends/	AITA for having my wedding around my friends wedding?
cetyc5ai	For some context, I go to school 45 minutes early everyday to spend time with the dogs. One of the teachers breeds dogs on the side and brings his dogs in. He has set rules for the dogs, such as no picking them up. ( They are all labs). The teacher knows me very well and trusts me to take care of the dogs. Everyone is allowed to pet and hang out with the dogs, but I'm one of the only people asked to care for the dogs( mainly just letting them out or moving them into his office).   This afternoon I walked in to the classroom and saw two people sitting on the floor with the dogs. I know both of them and one of them is quite annoying. I sat down on the floor with the dogs as per usual, and the annoying kid " Alex" picks up the puppy. I asked him politely to put the dog down because it violates the rules. He said he knew better because he has a dog at home. I told him because I work the dogs daily and have lots of training experience that I'm better equiped to handle them, which I think was kinda an asshole move on my part.   I was also mildly disciplining the puppy as she needs the occasional reminder not to chew on hands. Alex brushed off everytime I disciplined the dog and would encourage bad behavior. I eventually lost my temper a little and said to his face " I don't like you, please leave." I think I was kinda in the wrong but at the same time I was getting really frustrated with him, and he kept breaking the rules. He didn't end up leaving until class started. This isn't my first run in with Alex and always thinks he knows better than the teacher.

ibuhr335	Ok, this happened like years ago but I'm still getting shit for it. I feel like I was right in this situation but I lost a friendship over it so I figured I'd see what people think.  &#x200B;  I used to be friends with Sam and Cassie \[Both 30\]. Sam and Cassie have a dog, Tank \[5 M\]. Tank is a german shepherd.  &#x200B;  Tank is a well trained dog. We live in a not-very-safe rural area, so I totally understand the need for a guard dog. Tank and i got along well, he's polite to everybody who comes over.  &#x200B;  However, Tank also has animal aggression, and dog aggression towards smaller dogs. He also has a bite record in our state because one time he got out and bit somebody walking past Sam and Cassie's house (not on their property). It wasnt a serious bite but it got him a record.  &#x200B;  Sometimes Sam and Cassie let Tank off-leash to hunt small animals. They're proud of how good he is at it. Tank seems to like it. In the time I have known them he has hunted multiple moles, rats, squirrels, possums, birds, and snakes. This isn't a trained hunting-dog thing either, they just let him loose. Grated the people who own the land OK'd it because the creatures are vermin in their opinion. He's also not good with small dogs, one time he got off-leash and ran at somebody walking their small dog. Sam panicked and had to chase Tank down, and told me later that he would have torn the little dog apart if he'd managed to get to it. They came over to my house one time and brought Tank, and told me to lock up my cats.  &#x200B;  A few years ago now, Sam and Cassie found a kitten outside their home. They took the kitten to the vet to get scanned for a chip and it had no chip. The kitten was friendly and cute and they decided they would keep it. They said they were doing a good thing, it was better than leaving kitten outside to die.  &#x200B;  They made no effort to keep the kitten and Tank apart. They said Tank was actually being nice to the kitten and seemed to "understand" that it was "different" from the animals he's attacked.  &#x200B;  I told them I appreciated that they were trying to do a good thing but this was dangerous. Tank had gone after small pets in the past. I love Tank but he's a dog and he doesn't magically "get" that the kitten is "different". I told them they needed to take kitten to an animal shelter, or I could foster him and get him adopted out (I volunteered at a cat shelter at the time so I had connections). They told me I was being irrational and they were saving the kitten and it was better off with them.  &#x200B;  The argument kind of ended with a stalemate and now we don't talk.   &#x200B;  Was I the asshole? I feel like I may have been because I kept harping on them for it. I get that they know their dog better than I do, so maybe I insulted them that way?	1643062850.0	sby9la	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sby9la/aita_for_telling_my_friends_that_they_need_to/	AITA for telling my friends that they need to take their kitten to a shelter because I don't trust their dog?
izhi67l4	I \[20m\] still have the same four friends that I’ve had since I was 11 \[Robbie, Tim, James, David\] Robbie and Tim even go to the same university as me, and James works nearby.   Despite knowing them for nearly half my life, over the past two or so years I’ve started to feel as if I am being pushed to the outside. Currently,  James and his wife are expecting their 1st child together. David and his partner already have a 18 month old and Robbie and his fiancee  had a baby this summer.   Whenever I see them, we’re cramped in someone’s flat/house, either entertaining children or condemned to silence so they don’t wake. We never go out, they never come to mine as they don’t like my roommates, and we never do anything new. Tim doesn’t mind as much as he is the eldest of 7 so he is used to small children, but i feel trapped, watching people on social media my age having the time of their lives while I feel bored.   David is the friend that I see the least of as he and his partner live in another town. Since his son was born, his partner and I have had multiple arguments about having me babysit for free while they go away. Recently, this same topic has come up between myself and Robbie’s fiancee. She claimed I was ‘utterly useless’ and that if I don’t want to help I should get new friends because that is how things are now. I said I agreed with her, I do need new friends, and went home.  My friends are angry with me for saying something like that and for ‘storming off’. Honestly, since she said it, I can’t help thinking that maybe I do need new friends. Tim told me that that would be a dick move since this is likely just a rough patch that will smoothen out over the coming years and I should just apologise.   I feel guilty because I know they’re stressed but I also can’t help but think they could compromise with me. I know babysitters are expensive but I’m not asking for every weekend, even once in a blue moon would be nice. I feel I’ve been insensitive as idk what they’re going through, but I also feel I’m at the end of my tether.

iz6qytul	I work odd shifts.  Most are 12 hours.  I did the 9p-9a this week.  I came home exhausted, and I grabbed myself some wine after work and was going to go to bed.   My roommate’s boyfriend said I was a pathetic alcoholic for drinking that early in the day. He’s been at our place more than the five times overnight allowed in a  month.  I reminded him of this, and he got angry.  He yelled at me some more about being an alcoholic and he was going to tell my landlord about it.   I told my landlord who lives in the main house how he’s been over all the time and is super hostile to me.    She told my roommate every day he’s over stays the five days a month is $150 a night.  My roommate is getting mad, but her boyfriend should have minded his own business.  My roommate, feels like now she has to move out because he’s mad at me.  He was staying almost half the time in our shared house.	1643063337.0	sbyga9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbyga9/aita_for_telling_my_landlord_about_my_roommates/	AITA for telling my landlord about my roommate’s boyfriend being rude?
89zokc9n	My (21F) and my boyfriend, James (30M) moved in together a few months ago, we’re expecting a baby in June.  James’ mother, Anne (50’s F) is a nice enough woman. For Christmas she gave us a “painting” she made, which was just sharpie poem on a canvas. She told us we “need” to put it in the nursery. I put it in the basement as it’s not really something I want to hang on the wall, I appreciate the thought, but here’s where the problems start.  We got a kitten in December, her name is Pickles. Every time Anne comes over she calls said kitten “Sophia” and I correct her, to which she tells me “Pickles isn’t a real name” also whenever referring to my disabled cat, calls him broken. This really pisses me off, as my cat is not “broken” I ask her to not call him that and she laughs it off with “oh sorry”  Cut to last night, she showed up unannounced (she does this more than my parents who live two blocks away) with one of James’ nephews. For note a few weeks ago my lizards basking bulb shattered so I’ve been waiting until payday to get a new one. Anne hears this and insists she’ll find us one, I explained multiple times that it needs to be a UVB bulb, that I couldn’t use an LED or regular lightbulb as she suggested, Well what does Anne bring over last night? A green light LED bulb. I put it in the hood and turned it on. It hurt my eyes pretty bad. I told her thank you but I can’t use coloured lights, as it is damaging to my lizards eyes, to which she says “It’s eyes will adjust, one of the teachers at my school always used coloured bulbs for hers and it was fine.. it died though but it was old” and then she went back to asking me to “bring the broken cat”  Anytime the baby comes into conversation she says “I hope it’s a girl, I only have boys” every single time. I’m worried she will try to “out-mother” me once our child is born, especially if it’s a girl.

6bedbhe2	AITA for not thanking my boyfriend first  So I (22F) got home from work and I noticed my boyfriend (24M) had left his crocs in front of the door again. He does this every day and it’s not a big deal but I trip over them every time I come and go, so when I got in I said hi and “could you please start putting your crocs to the side because I keep tripping over them.” He sighed and said he was going to greet me warmly but now he won’t now. I got confused and said I asked nicely, it was just cus I keep tripping and forgetting to mention it. I should mention he is not very affectionate so it bummed me out to know I missed out on affection because I chose to ask for him to put his crocs in a better spot, but I didn’t mention it because he already knows I would feel this way and I just wanted to have a good night after work.   Two minutes later we go into the office and there is a poster he had ordered for me for Christmas that had just come in, from my favorite artist. He told me prior that he had ordered it and I had said thank you endless times. I got excited to see it and opened it, and it was in a tube so it was rolled up and I was struggling to spread it out and see it. I wanted to take a picture too, so I asked excitedly if he could hold down the corner of the poster so I could look at it and then take a picture. He said no and that I should just go to a store and buy a frame. I said I was just excited and wanted his help so I could see it really quickly and that it would only take a second. He then tried to put a coaster on the corner to which I said no, please don’t because those get dirty and I don’t wanna risk ruining the poster. I then asked again if he could just hold it for two seconds, and he looked at me and told me I’m a brat.  I told him I don’t understand why this has to turn into a thing, and that I was just really excited and I’d hope he would understand. He told me again I’m disrespectful because I didn’t even say thank you yet. Maybe three minutes had passed in this entire interaction. I told him I am very grateful I’m just excited, and I had said thank you so many times before and was just excited and didn’t mean to not say thank you immediately.  He asked me multiple times if I understand how disrespectful I was and I would say “I understand that you would think me not saying thank you immediately is disrespectful, but I don’t understand why else you would think that” but he would keep cutting me off by again asking “do you understand how you’re being disrespectful”. Since I wouldn’t give him a yes or no answer, he walked out and shut the door.   I know this is what everyone says but we have a great relationship otherwise but I feel like small things like this come up and it feels like I’m always the one blamed and it ruins a lot of things for me, and maybe I am the problem.

izjqze2o	I am trying to see if I am the asshole in this situation? A few  months ago I bought an Astroworld ticket from a friend. He only made me  pay $300 for the ticket to the festival. The guy I bought it from had  something come up on the weekend of the festival and was no longer able  to attend. He and his friends were posting everywhere trying to get  someone to buy the ticket from him so he would not waste his money.  Finally, they had texted me about it very last minute, and impulsively I  agreed. It seemed like it could be fun and that I would enjoy it. The  Airbnb that we would be staying at was already paid for by the guy I  bought the ticket from and the other friends going. I had asked from the  beginning if I had to pay anything for the Airbnb and put up money for  it and all of them told me no and that I did not have to worry about it  and that all I had to purchase from him was the ticket itself. Soon the  weekend of the festival came, and we went and y'all know how Astroworld  2021 ended. Everyone that attended the festival and bought a ticket got  full refunds. However, since I bought it from someone and not through  the festival website, I did not get the refund directly to my bank  account. I then texted the guy I bought the ticket from asking to get my  full refund of $300 back. He then went on to say it was fair of him to  only give me half of what I paid ($150) back. The reasoning's behind  this was because the festival got cut in half and went from a 2 day  event to a 1 day event. Another reason was because I never had to pay  for the Airbnb and this was his reimbursement for it. However, they had  told me I did not have to pay for the Airbnb from the start? Is it  logical that I am now getting that taken from me? I had also not  realized that Astroworld would be as crazy and intense as it got, and  that people would get their lives taken and the event get cut short. The  guy I bought the ticket from is saying it isn't logical that I get my  full trip paid for out of his pocket now. I do agree that my trip  shouldn't be paid for out of his pocket. However, he got his full refund  and if he wanted me to pay him for the Airbnb, shouldn't he have told  me this from the start? Am I overreacting to this situation? Should I get my full $300 back or only half of what I paid him for the ticket. Please let me know if I am the asshole in this situation.	1643062844.0	sby9io	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sby9io/aita_for_wanting_to_get_my_full_refund_back/	AITA for wanting to get my full refund back?
2zzi91lg	So I was crossing the road and this guy was coming already in the middle of crossing. In order to extend the light signal, I went to the left and pressed it. I guess it must have narrowed my distance from him and he started cursing like "Why can't you cross it on your side, what's wrong with you". I ignored it and kept on walking but he didn't stop till I was atleast 15, 20 feet away. I look back and he was stopped and cussing. I got upset and showed him middle finger. He came running towards me and chasing me. I started running and went inside my apartment building.

9e3xef9e	I am getting married this year, and today one of my bridesmaids posted on social media that she is pregnant.   My initial reaction was excitement and happiness for her; however it felt like a punch in the gut that I found out via social media and not from her directly before she posted. She’s in my wedding, and one of my best friends. I thought we were close enough to warrant being told before a general announcement was made to the public.   Don’t get me wrong, I’m super happy for her! And so so so excited to welcome the child into the world! But my feelings have been hurt.   I want to say something to her about it and let her know my feelings have been hurt, but I also don’t want to make this about me. I just thought I was more important to her? She’s felt kinda distant for a while now, so idk if I’m just reading into things and she’s overwhelmed with the first trimester, or if there is something more going on in the background of our friendship that she hasn’t told me about.

68r85ge9	Long post but I will try and keep it as short as I can.  We met, we fell in love, we had a great relationship, he would come to mine on the way back from work and cook me dinner, I would run him a bath and make it cosy. We helped each other with boring tasks; building furniture, shopping, boring old stuff that people do when they love each other.  We had stupid accents that we only did around each other, it was a relationship that I could see forever.   We decided to buy a house together, I work in a care home and don't earn a great deal, he works a 'better' job and earns significantly more. We found a house and I told him that I could not afford to split it, so we decided 60/40. I had concerns and he assured me it would be okay. So we did it, it was great. Until my daughter decided she was going to start rebelling, I won't lie, she was very, very difficult. He started becoming resentful. He then decided we needed a new roof, and new windows, and everything I cannot afford for simply looking after care home residents, I said if he wanted my share he had to wait. He couldn't wait, he did it, and in his happiness of getting these new things he told me it was okay.   But then he began to resent me. He threw it back in my face at every moment. I became depressed and started shutting myself away. My daughter went to her fathers after what I can only call a traumatising year of her behavior and my depressed inability to help her.   I felt for him, he's not her dad and had no reason to put up with what he did for so long, but he did, and I feel so guilty. He's clearly depressed now. So am i He deals with it by tearing into me at any opportunity, and I deal wiith it by shutting myself away. But me shutting myself away then creates another reason for him to rip me apart. I'm lazy.. I'm useless..   We know we are better off apart but he feels that my 40% share, minus his deposit, is me sponging off him. Bearing in mind i did the majority of the work in the home, all of which he has insulted and said is shit, but he forked out more cash, so therefor my time is null and void.   He may have paid for the windows but.. He is keeping the windows... I will be sofa surfing for a while, the house was valued £260 - £320k we have £200k left on the mortgage, I own 40%, he owns 60%.I'm taking 10k for my share. He thinks this is too much. I'm a sponger. Am I just being selfish for not signing the paper and taking the 10k and living on a sofa for a while? It's not the money for me, it's my home.	1643064409.0	sbyuyp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbyuyp/aita_for_sponging_off_my_bf/	AITA for sponging off my bf?
iwlt51sv	I came early to school today and sat in one of the seats in the social area. This girl comes up to me and says, “can you move, me and my friendship group sit here.”   I had no idea they sit in that exact spot but there were so many other seats and tables available, and this spot didn’t have their names written on it, and we’re allowed to sit anywhere which is why I didn’t understand the entitled behaviour. I got there first so i felt like it wasn’t fair for her to tell me to move. Am I wrong to be feeling this way?   If I was aware that that’s their usual spot I wouldn’t sit there in the first place.  I shouldn’t have taken it personally but I have. I really shouldn’t be offended but the way she said it was so condescending. Almost like the whole place belongs to her and her friends, and everyone else is a peasant. I did move as I didn’t want to start a fight, but I feel like I should’ve stood up for myself.  I don’t get a good vibe off their friendship group and just feel really anxious thinking back to the incident. I’m socially awkward so I think knowing this definitely made her feel like she could get her way no matter what. AITA for sitting in someone’s regular spot?

45f7f1pf	Basically title. I listed an item for sale, and a (gentleman), showed intense interest from the start. So much interest, that he said “I’m willing to put down earnest money, to hold them for me” to which I agreed, and said if he wired me 100 dollars I’d mark the listing as inactive. He agreed and sent me the money. He said he’d still like to come see them, so he did, and left me hanging for 2-3 days while the listing was inactive. What do you know, come this morning, he bails, and asks for his 100 dollars back, to which I refuse and he threatens to contact the platform mods. I informed him he wasted my time, and that I gave up potential buyers and profits waiting for him to nail down a time to pick them up. I said that when money is put down, it is assumed that the price was agreed upon and the intent is to buy, and that money serves as collateral to me if he did exactly what he did. So, tell me, am I the asshole for refusing to return his “earnest money?”	1643063022.0	sbybxd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbybxd/aita_for_not_returning_earnest_money_put_down_for/	AITA for not returning “earnest money” put down for an online transaction that the buyer bailed on?
ef6qbh3o	Friday my mom calls me telling me that she would like for me to plan to travel 5 hours away to go visit her and my grandpa as she will be taking a flight up to go see him. He's really sick and bedridden.  He hasnt been in my life much. Ive only met him 3 times. He sends me a bday card with some cash every year. We talk, but nothing too deep because we dont have much to talk about. I mean... he's decent, but he has made MANY mistakes in his life. He also believes in a lot of conspiracies, extreme political opinions, and at times is blatantly racist... thus why I dont reach out more. Getting him and me to talk/do things together feels forced as well.  Basically, he was a horrible father to my mom. Never showing up to things, being in her life, doing things with her, all while he was cheating on my grandma and had a whole other family... who he was showing up for, and doing things for, and providing a happy life for his new daughter in that family... all while my mom and grandma had no idea. He just never was home and always claimed it was work and he would be randomly deployed (military) to remote areas in the world with little to no notice. Later they would find out about the other family and other miscellaneous misdeeds he committed. My grandpa hasn't called me... ever. Every time we talk its me calling him or messaging him. He didn't ask for me to come down and see him it's my mom asking.  My grandma and mom moved on and kicked him out of their lives, which wasn't hard to do since he didn't care at all, and they found my grandpa that I grew up knowing. My grandpa (we will call Dave) and I were really close. There is no one I looked up to more than Dave.  I didn't even know this other grandpa existed till I was about 15-16 years old when he called me out of the blue and told me he was my grandpa which confused tf outta me since I had zero clue about him. We met and talked with my mom and he told her how he was trying to right his wrongs and admitted he did wrong by her.  My mom told me there was no pressure and that I don't have to come down and see him since we werent really close, but this may very well be the last time I get to see him. I was thinking that it may not be her playing with me, and it's genuine, until I accidently sent her a package instead of me and now she's saying "if you want it I guess you gotta go to (state)"  AITA here? I feel like I kind of am, but I feel like a video call is better overall and my mom is using this as an excuse. My car also isn't super reliable and the weather has kinda sucked. Idk family is over rated to me. My gf tells me I am not being an asshole and it would be better for me to just video call, but I still feel guilty... idk because I think I am supposed to feel guilty?  TL;DR: grandpa I've never been close to is potentially going to pass away soon and my mom wants me to travel with no back up plans/finances to see him when I feel a heart felt video call will be more appropriate.	1643063170.0	sbydzc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbydzc/aita_for_not_traveling_to_see_my_potentially/	AITA for not traveling to see my potentially dying grandpa?
cdki11n6	I (20F) don't live at home. I moved out a couple of months ago because of my lack of privacy. My younger brother(17M) and I grew up in a very stable and loving foster home. We were put into this family the same day he was born because there was alcohol in my mothers system so, he wouldn't know any different.  My brother struggles with FASD. Due to it he struggles with addiction and making his own decisions. Overall he's a super sweet and smart kid. He does well in school (when he's actually there and tries) and he's very active. Ever since he was 13 he fell in with the wrong crowd and started smoking weed and drinking. He's constantly high and goes out almost every single night to smoke and drink with his high school drop out friends. We live in a very cold climate and lately he will wander home black out drunk and pass out in bed at 4AM. He will take bong rips upstairs in his bedroom and smoke cigarettes in his room. He disrespects my parents wishes to stop smoking inside and will laugh at them every single time he makes them cry. He refuses to go to school and steals from everyone in the house. We suspect he is selling. The other day my mom found him sleeping in his vomit in his room after he was out all night. My siblings and I don't feel safe at home and don't like living in a house that constantly smells like weed. We had to install locks on our liquor cabinet and wine fridge. The other day it was accidentally left opened my my brother cleaned the whole thing out with his friends. My parents own a home in one of those fancy upper middle class neighbourhoods. We were all raised with very good values and always got what we needed and wanted in life. Especially my younger brother. My mother refuses to put him in any sort of program but even if she did he probably wouldn't even show up or try. She's threatened to kick him out but never will because 'that her baby'. Mother works hard for him. She fights for him to not get kicked out of school and opens up opportunities for him to get help with finding jobs and help with school work. Only for all of it to get thrown back in her face by him and disrespecting her more. He once told her it was her fault he doesn't have a job because she reminds him he needs to make a resume. My mom defended my brother from going to jail when he was under investigation. My mom works hard. She cares a lot. but due to this she's starting to lose her other children. I moved out because of this and my other older brother is starting to threaten to. My mom is already devastated that I left but I already sacrificed thousands of dollars of things to my brothers stealing habit. I never got any of it back.

izktangf	My sister went on social media saying my wedding venue is a plantation and the event will have antebellum elements to it. This could not be further from the truth. She hasn't just posted on her social media, she sent emails and texts about it too. My girlfriend and me are getting so many questions and some friends and family were upset thinking she was right about our venue.  Our actual venue is my girlfriend's grandparents farm. Not a former plantation house but an actual farm. It's never been a plantation. She had no family here until after WW2 and her family never had money or slaves before they left Greece. I have no idea where my sister got her ludicrous idea but it's done real damage. It wasn't one off hand comment she actively and repeatedly said it.

bb1vlykj	Title sounds odd and the thing is quite dumb but...     My boyfriend's sister had a baby girl in September, she's the first grandchild and currently they're still living in the same house with my bf. We're all crazy about her, she's so cute and I love to spend time with her, same as everyone in the house. My boyfriend really loves the baby, like already having an album with 200 photos of her in her phone lol. And every time he sends pictures or videos I do enjoy them and tell him how cute she is.  Saturday night we were eating, and talking about the baby, and my boyfriend said something like "I know I might only think this because she's my niece, but she's a really cute baby". I said "yeaah" and kept eating, he seemed confused then said "like I've seen other babies and they're not as cute as her", to what I said "Yeah, well those baby's families also think they're more beautiful than other babies". Which seemed to offended him? or confused him at least, like he was expecting me to contradict him or tell him that he was right and his niece is cuter than other kids, with might be true, but then again, maybe there are other babies who are cuter, idk I don't see the point of comparing them and I know it's a true thing that you look at the babies/kids(even adults) you love with rose colored glasses, plus I do think she's a cute baby, I just didn't go over the top in this particularly situation, and since he was aware that he thinks this way because she's family, I didn't think of disagreeing with him.     Well he called me rude for "implying she's not cute" (then show me some photos lol) and told me when we have our own I won't like people saying they're not cute. I explained myself and it didn't escalate but I still feel weird about it. AITA?

fvg1dont	My boyfriend (23M) and I (20, almost 21 F) have been together for almost 3 years. He is in the Navy & has been deployed since June of 2021. He comes home soon, & I initially planned to take the whole week off to spend time together. I work 3 jobs. Im a college student and need all of the money I can get. My boyfriend and I have been going through a bit of a rough patch, where he is uninterested in doing many things he used to and doesnt follow through with promises. Several weeks ago i asked if we could go to disneyland for valentines day, if i funded the entire outing, he said no & that it was too many people and that disneyland is boring (he has never been). I accepted this and asked to go out somewhere else in stead. He complained about things being too expensive, and how he didnt want to go out where there were people, so i stopped asking about going out on dates that I wanted to do, since he seemed uninterested. I later asked if theres anything he would like to do together, and he he said no. I asked again later to make sure, same answer. I have made numerous efforts to give the opportunity for him to say if he wants us to do anything really special, but he hasnt. I have planned many activities that he would like for the week even if i dont, bc i want him to be happy. Because he is in the military, when he takes leave he still gets paid. I dont get paid for taking time off, as i dont have a lot of PTO saved, and i used it all up recently after coming down with covid and being out of work for over a week. Taking a week off is a huge blow to my income, so i decided to work at my colunteer cafe since i get a bonus for merchandise sales, and it was only two days of work for a shorter shift, 5 hours each. My other jobs are 8hrs+ per shift, so i decided to take those off for the week. I also invited him to come to the cafe as a guest so he can experience it since he hasnt been to it before. My boyfriend is now upset i decided to work, saying its OUR time together. He said “youre working doing OUR time?”, and i expressed that I am taking several days off, but couldnt afford to have 0 income, and that if hes upset we can talk about it and find a resolution.  I dont feel its unfair for me to decide to work when i am going to fund our activities such as horseback riding, dinners, etc,  and he expressed how he wants some days to not do anything. While I understand why he wants our time together, I just cant afford it. I cant afford to take a week off and fund our activities, it just isnt feasible. I also am planning to take time off in april or may as well to spend my own money to go to texas with him to visit his family, as he expressed he wants me to go. Time off isnt a thing i can just do with no supplemental income, and he doesnt always understand that. But, I understand wby he may be upset. We havent seen eachother in a long time and can understand why he may be disappointed or bothered.

78ue4k0b	Ok, so in my karate studio, I’m sometimes late, but only ever by a minute or 2 and I actually haven’t been late to any of my classes for a long time, at least maybe 4 months. But today, I got caught up on reorganizing my room, and I was in a bit of a rush. My mom always takes a while to get ready since she always wants to change her clothes so her “dirty” clothes don’t get all over the house. So I’m waiting in the car for like a minute or 2, and we leave with 5 minutes and an 8 minute drive. Now if I’m like 3 minutes late, then I’ll go in and do class, since the instructor likes to go on after each class so usually the next class just starts, but when we get to a part where we have to cross the road, but there’s a semi truck so my mom said that we should just drive up ahead and take the u turn at the stoplight. By the time we get there, we’re 8 minutes late, and I don’t want to do class because I was 8 minutes late and my studio always had a stickler for late people, so I was going to wait till the next class afterwards and help out that class instead. But my mom said that I should just go in because her car clock was “inaccurate” (by 30 seconds) and that it’s just 7 minutes. Except being late is a big deal to me, but my mom didn’t understand and wanted me to go to class, but I wanted to wait till the next class. Eventually we just pulled aside and here I am typing this out. So I’m wondering, AITA?	1643065370.0	sbz81m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbz81m/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_karate_class/	AITA for not wanting to attend karate class
gu057jm1	Hi Reddit, Am I the asshole for not wanting to hold money during a Divorce? I (20 F) have always had a rough relationship with my mom (53 F) but over the past years we’ve bonded a lot because of my abusive father (her husband). This past Christmas she informed me that she was leaving him and needed to move out everything she owned in secret. I didn’t even think to not help her and took seven days off of my part time job to help her move everything out. This experience was very stressful and traumatic for me because we were moving in the middle of the day and didn’t know if my father would come home from work early or not. Now, she’s decided to start the divorce process and doesn’t want my father to have any money (or as little as possible) because he’s an addict and broke. She’s asked me to hold her money (about $4000 in savings) until after the divorce is over. I told her I don’t feel comfortable with the idea because I’m not sure if that’s legal. She kept pushing and asking me to just hold it and say it’s for something else, but every time I have a horrible gut feeling. She sarcastically tells me thank you, that she’ll find someone else, and that she won’t ever ask for help again. I feel awful about it, but I’m trying to learn to enforce boundaries and not do things i don’t feel comfortable doing.

izkog4a5	Throwaway account, I'm on mobile, yadda   TLDR: My mom works 2 full time jobs and my siblings suck. She needs a break, so I (15f) want to take her on a trip. But also, it may not be fair to my siblings.  My mom works 16 hour days, 5 days a week +weekends. She works her ass off to keep my family afloat and comfortable and I'm so grateful for it. She loves to travel and hasn't taken a fun trip in years, and she hasn't taken a trip without the responsibility of several children in decades. I currently live with my mom, 2 sisters (20s) and niece (4). Taking them all on a trip is damn near impossible, because they would both need time off of work, and we simply don't have the money. I have been working a part time job while going to school, and have saved up a decent amount of cash. I can more than afford to take my mom on a trip, and I really want to because she really deserves it.  I can't afford to take all of them. Also, they're assholes and give my mom hell every day, and do absolutely nothing to help around the house. Like I said, she needs a break.

izk919r2	My gf (f29) and I (m36) have what I would call a mouse problem. Today my girlfriend called me she encountered a dead mouse underneath our kitchen table; I was at work, she is currently at home as she still studies and has to wait for a spot for her scientific internship. I told her I would remove the mouse when I got home (she is severely grossed out by mice and often asks me to kill them or remove them when they are deceased) she has only handled a dead mouse once (while I was away for a few days). It is not something I mind doing, some people are just grossed out by certain things; glad I can help out.     As I came home. I sat down a bit and we decided we would cook (I did the cutting and preparing of the ingredients and she would cook the meal; tortillas with pulled shiitake with glaced BBQ sauce). I would wrap my hand in a plastic bag and remove the mouse after dinner (It wasn't an issue I was just home from work and wanted to eat before setting my mind to the task at hand).     After I did all the cutting of the ingredients I walked to the kitchen with plates of cut ingredients as my gf told me what she needed. As I walked to her I could see the mouse twitching from the corner of my eye. So I told my gf: wtf I think the mouse might still be alive! She refused to believe me as it had been presumed dead for many hours while I was at work. After I swore I saw the mouse move, she also noticed a twitch as I was trying to trigger the mouse by sweeping air towards it with my foot.     I then proceeded to release the mouse from it's misery by giving it a few solid wacks with an empty coke bottle to the head. After doing so I gave the shiitake, that were being glaced with BBQ sauce, a quick stir (with a long wooden spoon thats in the pan) because we had both been observing this mouse for quite some time at this point. My gf then proceeded to give me a few plates to store in our cabinet (dishwasher had finished); I told her I feel a bit dirty because of the whole mouse thing and wacking it, I know it's not rational because I have not touched it but let me wash my hands quickly I'll do it immediately after.     So I quickly pit down the two stacked playes and proceed to walk to the sink (which is 2 meters away) and wash my hands with soap. At this point my girlfriend is irritated and says: Ohhh you feel so grossed out...but at the same time you use your hands to stir our food (she was not grossed out by my hands but felt like I'm making excuses I think; it was very clear I didn't touch the mouse). To which I responded: it's not a rational feeling I'm almost certainly not actually dirty, but I just started to feel grossed out and do not want to touch the plates (it would make me associate the plates with what just happened with the mouse) I just quickly stirred our food and then this feeling started to creep up on me.      She then responds with one of those non verbal type of "yeah right" hisses and is obviously annoyed. At this point I'm getting kind of sad because I was trying to make the best out of the situation, I did not try to dodge doing something, I just wanted 10 secs to wash my hands to feel a bit better (even if it wasn't rational). I start replaying the scenario in my head and to me the way she is treating me isn't fair so I tell her: I don't like the way you are talking to me, you should stop treating me like this (situations like this occur pretty frequently; where she will get mad at me for doing something in a different way than she would have or a different order etc.)     Atm she is extremely mad. She is telling me that I am bossing her around by saying I don't like it when she talks to me this and that way and she will just say nothing. She is giving me the silent treatment.

h8akfatw	I (28nb) have been struggling with a neighbor for years that let's their cats out at all hours of the day and night. Cat #1 got pregnant more than once before she chased off or landlady's cat and the neighbor was told to give the cat up. I'm the residents volunteer for the local shelter so my landlady told me to take the cat in.   Cat #2 was the offspring of the first, she got pregnant more than once and again my landlady told me to take the cat to the shelter when the owner wouldn't get her fixed. This has been really awkward because I work at the same place as this neighbor's oldest daughter.   Cat #3 is urinating on my back deck since late December. She's set of a chain reaction of ferals and neighbor cats alike urinating on my deck. I was told by landlady that cat #3 is pregnant. Seeing a trend?   I have a very territorial indoor cat, and he's so stressed out that he bit my chill cat. The wound absessd, and that cost me a lot at the vet to get it clean and give my cat antibiotics. Now my stressed out cat has a prescription for mood stabilizers to give us time for a more permanent solution to the urination problem.  The part where I'm the A-hole is when I was complaining to a co-worker about my cat problem, but in my anger I did not redact the names of my neighbor, and I said insensitive things about how I didn't understand why his daughter couldn't take care of her cat. I didn't redact her name, and she confronted me, cussing me out for taking smack about her without knowing the whole side to the story.  That sobered my anger up real quick, and while I tried to apologize she kept going off. After 10 minutes of yelling at me a co-worker told us to take this elsewhere. I rushed out and finished my shift. I was so shaken up, but I know I was in the wrong for what I said.  I owe her and her father an apology, which I've written separate ones for each person and plan to deliver in person with a secondary verbal apology. I also do not plan to interact with either person from that point on, unless absolutely necessary. If I have issues with cat #3 in the future I'll report them to my landlady.  Am I still the A-hole for being mad about this situation?	1643066586.0	sbznqs	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbznqs/aita_for_getting_angry_at_my_neighbors_cat_for/	AITA For getting angry at my neighbor's cat for urinating on my deck.
9i7gs	Fristly, I just wanted to preface this by saying I didn't necessarily *want* to skip it. And I feel bad about not being there. I have a really unorthodox sleep schedule that has me going to sleep around 6-7 am and waking up around 4:30 pm.  On Christmas Eve 2021, my grandmother asked me if I was coming to a family breakfast the next day at 7 am. This was the absolute first time I had heard about this and was under the assumption we weren't getting together for Christmas this year because my Aunt (who usually hosts a Christmas dinner) had to work Christmas. We had plans to do a New Years Eve/Christmas hybrid event. I suppose that they decided to do a breakfast instead since she didn't have to work until later in the afternoon.  I said that I probably wouldn't be able to go because I wouldn't be able to get any sleep beforehand and I can't adjust my sleep schedule with less than 12 hours of notice. More than that the event would last until noon or so which would leave me really out of it and sleep deprived. I also usually cannot sleep if I am exposed to the daylight like that and I would have probably been awake all day. When I'm awake that long I lose my appetite and have painful stomach problems.   It's not fun and I just didn't want to have a negative Christmas experience. But it was at the cost of pissing off my family.

2xudlii3	I (24 F) went home for Christmas break and things were tense with my roommate (19 F) when I left. She had her boyfriend practically living in our shared living room and she rarely ever cleaned up after herself. Whenever I bring up an issue with her she would just laugh it off or act like she understood only to do the same behavior again ie: Please don't use my frying pan without asking and please clean it out afterward, only for her to use it the next day and leave it dirty on the stove for the next two days until I cleaned it.  The real issue however is this: I came home from break without texting her, but it was clear this was the day that out of town students would be back, and I was returning with our third roommate (21 F).  When we opened the front gate it was like a bomb went off. Moldy pots and dishes on the front patio, clothes and trash all throughout the living room and dinning room, the sink was filled to the brim with moldy dishes and including our dishes we had asked her not to use, my bathroom that I pay extra for had become her boyfriends bathroom and was full of his stuff and my towels were sopping wet on the floor, her boyfriend had moved in and his stuff was everywhere in the living room, pretty much it was a disaster zone and me and the third roommate were just like fuck this lets go get food and deal with this later. We decided to schedule a sit down roommate talk and tell her that she needed to respect our belongings and that if her boyfriend is going to be living in our living room he has to pay rent, but before we could get any of this started she came into my room and declared, "You really hurt me by not warning me you were coming back, I felt blindsided and you made me feel like a bad roommate and a slob."  Here's the thing, I feel gobsmacked a little. I thought it was in my right to show up to my apartment whenever I please, and I feel like she's just mad she got caught in the act for trashing our house, breaking our roommate agreements, and disrespecting our belongings. IS THIS A JUSTIFIED THOUGHT!?!?! IDK  And her phrasing really bothers me, that I made her feel like a bad roommate by coming back to my apartment to see she broke our agreements, and that I blindsided her? I felt blind sided because I couldn't shower or make dinner when I got home.   I did apologize for not texting that I was coming home, but she isn't done yet and wants to have a sit down talk to talk about her issues. Should I push it and tell her that what she did over break was un acceptable? Am I wrong to assume she was she just upset about being caught in the act?  Like she thinks that I was being a dick by coming back to my house without giving her time to fix it, but is that me being a dick????? I've never had roommate issues like this either so I just don't know how to go about it or if I am making it worse.	1643066628.0	sbzoae	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sbzoae/aita_for_coming_back_to_my_apartment_without/	AITA for coming back to my apartment without telling my roommate
eiwbuakt	(No names used are real)  I (14m) and all of my friends (all 14f) are in a groupchat together. We have gotten into fights before but we always made up and everything was fine after but today it escalated to the point where I was shaking.   It started when one of my friends 'Hannah' added someone none of us knew to the gc. Half of us were taken back by this but the other half liked her and they all got on really well. Today a few of my friends and I were hanging out.   We discussed not line this new girl and apologised to get but removed her. We didn't feel comfortable with someone we didn't know being in the group. This sparked an argument but we didn't care and went back to our conversation.    Later I found a tik tok and sent it to the gc my friend Hannah didn't like this and then said the video was sexualising minors when there were no minors in it. I believe she did this to mock me considering I've said it before. I said it was to far due to history then she said it was just a home and I overreacted. One of my others friends 'Samantha' agreed. We argued to the point where I was on the verge of tears.   I repeatedly asked my friends to stop and they would say why and keep in saying things like 'I'm glad I'm acting like a d#^k it's what you like!' Or '*s$^*s on you in triumph*' yk really hurtful stuff. I removed Samantha from the gc and my friend told me I overreacted and was being way too controlling I caved and said they won.

We Both have vacation days planned in on our work schedule and we even made sure to have somebody to take care of his cat.   Around that same time my sister (27f ) found her place in the Islamic culture and believe system (disclaimer I have noting against this believe system and hope she is very happy).  Around December she got in an relationship with a guy (26 m) that is also in this believe system. Last week my mom told me they are getting married and want to do it before April because then the Ramadan begins.   Yesterday my mom told me the wedding day is in the middel of my vacation that has been planned way before this guy was even in the picture. I immediately told my mom I would not attend the wedding and will not be cancelling or rescheduling this vacation.

My mum is out fitting a carpet for my nan, my dad is there too and no one is at home. I have a question where I need help as it's writing a story and I asked if I could do it tomorrow when someone is home to help me (I have other work I can do in the meantime) and my mum was saying that I was trying to get out of it and that I have to do it, we went back and forth for a few minutes and I said again that I need help cause I'm struggling and she basically said I need to get on with it and that if I was doind it at school the entire assignment should take 1h45m and I'm only doing three however the one I'm on should take up 45min and unlike the people at school I haven't got a teacher to go through it and help me plan.  I started getting upset and just told her I'd figure it out myself and hung up on her cause nothing was changing and she needed to get back to laying carpets and I need to attempt my work. I also didn't want to say something that would hurt her.  I am now banned from my game console because I hung up and I did message her explaining why I hung  up and said sorry.

gp2sjtkr	(edit: mom works 14:00 to 22:00 and not 7:00)  My (14F), mom (35F) started working again and her work is training her to be prepared. She’s at work 14:00-22:00 so my dad (37) ends up taking care of us. Whenever my mom leaves for work, she cooks a meal for us that we usually just reheat when we are hungry.  My dad has his colleague coming here to discuss work and sometimes he ends up eating here, which we don’t mind.  What I do mind is my dad not washing the dishes after they’re done, colleague will say that he’ll wash them and my dad would be “no, you shouldn’t, you’re a guest, bla bla”   I always end up the one behind the sink because I cannot stand dirty dishes, and I can’t always do since I have online classes.   Today my mom was in a hurry so she didn’t have time to cook, she asked my dad to cook our meal, and it was an easy meal, the ingredients were set he just needed to dice vegetables and boil water, etc.   At 1 pm, my brother (10M) came in my room telling me that he was hungry, I asked him “where’s dad?” and he said that dad was talking to colleague. My dad does not listen to me so I texted my mom that he hasn’t cooked any food. About 20 mins later I hear him in the kitchen preparing the food and telling my brother to eat.   I left my room at 3:30 to eat and when I was about to reheat the food I saw the sink full of dirty dishes,dad said me he was going to do them after I eat and I said ok.  That was 3 hours ago. My dad handles work calls all day yet still has a lot of time to play games and watch movies. My mom always ends up washing the dishes when she gets home and I tell her to not wash them since she’s had a long day and to just let dad do it but she insists.   My dad still has not washed the dishes and I am tempted to wash them because I know mom would end up being the one to do them.   WIBTA?

e99kbo7z	So it's lunch time and I'm (15m) hanging out with my friends and we are generally being pretty silly. My 2 friends let's call them Jaden and Ross. Jadens relgion teacher comes to us and we start making jokes but eventually the conversation switches to death and if your scared of death. For some context I'm an atheist in a private school. The school is very accepting though of lots of people. I say that dying will be scary because of pain but death itself isn't as you don't experience it. The only scary part would be what's after if there is anything at all. I start trying to make this argument and get cut off a few times by my friends while the teacher wants to hear me out. I start listing things that other religions have said happens after death like reincarnation or heaven and hell and there's a possibility nothing happens. The teacher says that's bullshit and I should just pick one. I say what do you mean that's bullshit? He than says people like that are so noncommittal in life and death. I say we'll I'm an atheist so I don't believe in any afterlife and think nothing happens. At this point and also before in the conversation I got really annoyed. "My friend said How are you arguing with a religion teacher about relgion"? "He went to college". I said I don't care angrily. The teacher said if I didn't care then there's no point in having the discussion. He walked away. My friends told me I messed up. I said that no Jaden telling me I couldn't have an opinion because he has authority was wrong. Ross said it's not because he's in an authority figure it's because he's more educated.

enlkkha5	Basically I’m (F18) in the middle of graduating. In this last school year the whole course has to write a 15-page essay about a certain topic (deadline is October This year). I’m in biology class and the main themes to choose from are ecology and anthropology. I’ve decided to go with anthropology and after weeks of researching for a specific topic I finally had a question to write about:  “Does asthma have potential to be fully healed in the future?”  A few months ago, in the middle of October, I told it to the associated teacher (f~35) and she AGREED. I repeat - she agreed, saying the question was good to use. I explained it to her multiple times on how I want to write and form it (we meet once a week and basically talked about it over and over again) and like I said she didn’t mind it.  Now this is where the problem starts. After researching, talking to doctors about their opinions and starting to already write my essay, she asks the class to write an expose for her to look over. Weeks after that - we’re now on the 13th January of 2022 - she walks up to me and says that she talked to her boyfriend about it and wants me to change my topic because it’s more of a doctoral thesis and she thinks it’s too difficult to write. I told her no it’s fine I already started writing months ago and I don’t think it’s that difficult since I’m already on page 7 and it went all smoothly so far. We then start to have an argument about it not being suitable and me needing to write about something else. She said she’ll grade it bad if I don’t change it no matter the content. I got angry and argued that she should’ve told me this sooner, not just coming back after 3 months after Agreeing to it and telling me to start again. I told her that she’s incapable of making decisions, this is my graduation year and my graduation essay and I don’t need an unreliable teacher who goes to her boyfriend for help even tho it’s her job and not his. If she wants me to start again then she should give me the three months back. I did end up being a little childish and ignoring her for the rest of the class but I don’t regret saying what I said. My friends said I’m overreacting and should just start anew.

6j3ch1be	  WIBTA if I reported my ex partner to work for stealing equipment?   My ex partner is an electrician. We work for the same company he used to steal things, fancy screw driver sets, volt testing equipment, everything. He used to tell me it was fine, that everyone stole stuff.  It wasn’t a good relationship so I didn’t think it was worth the argument saying anything to him about it and just stayed quiet and I know that this was wrong of me to do.   My ex has now started up an electrical business him self to do on his days off. I know that he will completely by using all of the equipment that he stole from the company he works for. He’s to cheep to buy his own stuff when he steal the best quality things from work.   Here is where I think I might be TA, i want to anonymously report him to work about the stealing. It would probably affect his job, I just think that now he’s actually going to be profiting it makes it so much worse he steals.   For context before people think I’m bitter he’s making money, it’s one of the huge reasons I left him. He would make me give him half of my pay to he could save for us, his house was given to him by his parents, his car bought by his parents. Any time he needed something he would ask them to buy it first. I hated this. I’m not that kind of person, I like to work for my things be able to buy my own things. With them everything came with stings. I also hated that he took half of my money each month for “savings” that when I left he wouldn’t give me a penny back. I paid half of the household bills to there wasn’t a reason to keep my money.

Before I sign the contract this April, currently I'm applying to different companies to see if I can get any other better offers. But my friends, which are enrolled in the same scholarship, seems to think that I am being ungrateful for the bank's offer as the bank already gave us a full scholarship since the first semester in addition to giving us pocket money equals to the minimum wage. The full time offer would pay us roughly double the minimum wage a month, in addition to that I could get an extended scholarship as well because of my high GPA, as well as other benefits of working for a bank.  So I was talking to my friends to just try and get them to maybe try applying to other companies as well and rationalize why I'm trying to apply to other companies, most of them flatly refused.  One of my friends said that they want to give back to the bank by working there first as a way of thanking them for giving us the scholarship, and most human resource department would hate to see an applicant that's not grateful to their former employer, so if I would to refuse the bank's offer I could be seen unfavorably and ungrateful. I could see this as a valid reason but why would one of the biggest bank in my country even care if a regular employee refuse an offer, they could as easily replace me.  Another friend of mine said that we're already in such a privilidged position why would I want to search for for more and that I was just being greedy. A person that's too greedy for more will have to sacrifice something, they said and, as I've mentioned to my friends that why would one of the biggest bank in the country care if some regular employee refuse an offer, they said that I'm sacrificing my conscience for greed. This is what made me kinda pissed off, yes our current position is really privilidged and it's a position that would be really good for normal university students, but why am I just the asshole just because I'm trying to see other offers, it's not like I've refused the offer completely, I've still got 'till april to take the offer.  My reasoning for applying for other jobs is just to see if I could get better offers and explore the job market as a whole, if I could get offers from a more tech oriented company even if it pays less then why not take it, so that I could learn more. The more structured nature of a bank would hinder my career progression also imo. I haven't refused the offer from the bank as it still stands until April.   For background, I'm not the US, I'm in a third world country that would consider having a job that pays double the minimum wage when I haven't even graduated is really good. My major is Computer Science and I'm applying to more tech oriented companies in comparison to the bank.	1643115441.0	scd4cw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scd4cw/aita_for_looking_for_other_jobs_before_accepting/	AITA for looking for other jobs before accepting my current's company offer

So they might reduce her salary or worst   I feel bad about that I didn't want to create troubles for her but in same time I was afraid to keep it for me and get in trouble for not following orders   So reddit AITA?	1643115448.0	scd4fc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scd4fc/aita_for_reporting_a_coworker_and_potentially/	AITA for reporting a coworker and potentially cause issues to her
83nhl60w	I (F39) have a bit of a rocky relationship with my mother (77). I am her only and youngest daughter and we have been quite close until a couple years ago when it started to feel that everything I was doing in my life was wrong in her eyes. I actually have a nice life - I have a good husband, two kids (F20 and M5), job that I love and get to do from home and a passion that keeps my life intresting. We also have a nice house, no loans and are finacially well off. So I just started to share less and that also kind of killed our conversations and we drifted apart.  My dad is no longer with us and she is living alone in my hometown, his two sons, who are older than me, also live there and help her out when she needs. I live an hour away and since we do have a.  This year, due to covid, she announced that she will have a telephone birthday party. So congratutlations are accepted only by calls and she doesn't expect or want anyone to show up. I ordered flower and candy delivery for her birthday because I know she would love that.  On the day we waited with the kids for the delivery time and tried to make a video call to congratulate her. She didn't pick up so my daugter calls her to pick up the videocall (I was still videocalling on my phone). She picks up the call and informs us that the ones that truly care for her still came to her birthday and she had made food and cake and it didn't matter that she told us she doesn't want us over we still should love her enough to go. Since it was too late go now, we left it at that, made the video call later and there she said that she was very happy with the flowers and didn/t mention anything about us not coming.  A few weeks later she hasn't mentioned anything to me but when my daughter went to visit her, she starts crying and telling how I am just waiting for her to d... and that I don't love her and that everyone she tells that her only daughter didn't come for her birthday is really surprised since she's been nothing but a good mom to me. I do not argue there - I didn't have a bad childhood and I was supported by my parents when I had my first child at only 19... But I still get the feeling that I was set up to fail here. So, AITA that I did as I was told and didn't show up for my moms birthday?	1643115703.0	scd7la	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scd7la/aita_for_not_attending_my_mothers_birthday_party/	AITA for not attending my mothers birthday party?
8mq9hgf6	Quick back story. All names have been changed for anon reasons.  My friend (hannah) went to a rodeo and met (bri) and (cole) and their 6 month old baby (kyle) we all became close friends.  My friend hannah moved out and into her own home just before she had her baby, which was fine. Now theres been some smack talk behind peoples backs. So now theres tension in that area of life. As i dont deal well with females in general. So that is part of my irritation as I don't even speak about them what so ever.  Anyway, said friend bri, got asked to leave hannahs house (due to other issues) anyway, so i said she could stay for a week or so. But i couldnt house her for longer then that, and she had to supply her own food and necessary items as I am a single mum and am just scraping by myself, i have a 9 week old baby st the moment plus a 3 year old and a 7 year old.  And anyway, i left for the weekend, and i come home to, all of my babies bottles, teets, dummies gone. She said she took them to her mums place and didnt bring them back, so now my son has none of those things.  She never asked me either, even though i also stated my kids stuff was off limits. And i found out that same day that her and her partner has eaten all of my kids food. Which was 2 weeks worth. And they were only in my home for 3 days by themselves. So now my kids are hungry during the day and I want to tell her I can't help her anymore. But i hate conflict and I just dont know what to do. She has said she will replace it all. I asked when, she said when she gets paid which is in 7 days. So my kids and I go without food for 7 days. Like honestly. Can i just kick her out? Or am i the ass hole?	1643115705.0	scd7mb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scd7mb/aita_for_wanting_to_kick_my_f19_friend_out/	AITA for wanting to kick my (F19) friend out
vn16k8v	So my mum (53f) loves having people over/throwing parties. I (18f) am not the biggest fan of this. My autism coupled with my extreme social anxiety makes me hate large gatherings. I understand that it is something my mother enjoys and I usually just deal with it. When she has people over (often around 10-20 ppl, happens every fortnight or so.) I go out at the start of the night to greet everyone and chat with them for 5-10 mins before I go back into my bedroom. If they are having a meal for dinner (instead of snacks) I will go outside to eat with them as well and go back into my room once dinner is finished. I then go back out at the end of the night and see everyone off (which can take up to an hour). I should mention that the guests usually don’t leave until 1 am (or around that time), so I am always exhausted by the end of it. Recently, my mother has asked me if I could stay out with them all night, i agreed but said that if I didn’t like it, then next time I would do what I usually do. So when she had her next party, I stayed out with them, and it has horrible. I was so uncomfortable and it was incredibly triggering. I asked my mum repeatedly if i could go inside as I was having sensory overload, she said no. And even without that happening it was still bad. I was surrounded with people who were at least 20 years older than me and who were all drunk. The next morning I told my mum that next time she had people over, I would be staying inside. She got very upset and said that after everything that she’s done for me, that I could at least do this for her. I was torn. My mother is my number one supporter and I do not want to make her disappointed, but I also know that I need to take care of myself. I told her this, and again, she got very upset and said that I was being selfish and that it’s just one little thing she’s asking me to do (although to me it is a very big thing). I feel like shit now. I hate that I’ve let her down but I can’t help but feel that I am just taking care of my own needs. My father has been silent throughout the whole ordeal. AITA?

j07a2pp0	My (F) coworker/supervisor from another area where I work(nightshift) has this habit of assuming everyone she meets is her friend. She is the supervisor of her area, so I(M) have had moments in the past (when Im sent to help her area out) with her were she will ask something out of me because "We're friends right?" This annoys the hell out of me and Ive told her I find her very annoying. That friends are not something I make on a wim. I take the friends I choose very personally.   She got really upset about it for awhile and me and her talked about it and I said I would try to work on being more social or at least good coworkers. We have talked on and off but nothing substantial to call us friends. Im not a very social person and I prefer to be left alone to work in my area. She has come up and mentioned that I never talk to her and shes the only one who does.   This annoys me further. I do not feel like I am obligated to talk to her if I dont want to. I still dont consider her a "friend" and she tends to annoy me very easily at this point.   Me = Me  (F) = Coworker/supervisor  So tonight she comes up to me and says  (F)"hey you never talked to me back there all night I was really bored."  Me : "I dont have to if I dont want to and I dont"  (F) :  "I thought you were going to be more nice to me."  Me : "Well I dont have to talk if I dont want to."  (F) "Ok so we're like best buds at this point right?"  Me :"No"  (F) : "Not at all?"  (Her talking about being best buds really aggravated me)  Me : No because thats just how it is  (F) : why not, you dont feel like we're anything?  Me : Nope I dont feel anything, im very neutral about about this relationship. In fact I really dont care. I feel nothing. Just absolutely nothing about it.  She gasped and stared at me for a moment. Then told me it sounded like I needed a hug and just left. I was dumbfounded.

izr1ro4k	My father(55M) started seeing "Kelly"(25F) recently. Kelly and I attended high school, but never socialized. My parents divorced a year ago and I(25F) found out from social media. My father has been trying to get my brother(23M) and I(25F) to invite Kelly to our activities. He will ask us what we are doing and then ask if Kelly can be invited. Example, we were celebrating my friend's birthday dinner and my father dropped Kelly off at my apartment and insisted that I take her with me. The dinner was very awkward, but my friends did their best and were very nice to Kelly. Kelly spent the entire dinner complaining about having to be there and kept asking if we could leave.   My friends booked a nice weekend for a weekend getaway and had everything planned. We booked a room big enough for 4 people. My father reaches out to me asking what I was doing this weekend and I told him that I was going to visit a friend. My friends posts a picture of us on social media and my father texts me asking why I didn't invite Kelly on the trip. I text back saying maybe because none of us wanted her to come.   I tried to reach out to my father to apologize, but he won't answer any of my texts or calls. Kelly has texted me saying that I hurt her feelings and my father's.

j09k4dfh	I (32F) was over at my mom's (69F) this morning.  She brought up a news story that we both saw about a toddler who used his mom's phone to order $1,800 worth of furniture and the mom didn't realize it until the furniture started arriving.  Then a go fund me page was started for them that ended up raising $25,000.  There was a picture of the toddler sitting on the boxes in their entry way in the news story.  My mom started going on and on about different things.  Like, "I was going to say that I hope this is a good lesson for the mother about just handing her phone off to her kid, but she got an extra $23,000 out of it." And, then going on about the fact that $25,000 had been raised to begin with. "I mean, it was just $1,800.  And look at the picture, they have a nice house, they don't need that money."  I just said something about how we don't know their financial situation, and just because they look like they have a nice house doesn't mean they couldn't use the money.  And we don't even know if they plan on keeping the extra money, maybe they plan on giving it to charity or something.  Note that I didn't raise my voice, or say it in an angry way, I was just talking.  My mom just kind of stared at me, then started going on about how she's sorry she even brought it up, and that obviously I have some very strong opinions about this and acting all offended.  Was I in the wrong for kind of subtly calling her out?  AITA?  ETA:  A lot of people are asking in depth questions about the news story or questioning it's validity.  I have no idea if it's true.

aldi64n	I (21F) have been struggling with my mental health really badly for the fast few years, so I don't have any career plans or proper education and have just been jobbing.   I'm good at it, I've mostly worked retail and received a lot of positive feedback about how hard I work and good at my job I am. Still I feel the need to leave jobs after like 7-8 month at most. I start to feel trapped and bored and I just need change.  I quit my last job 4 month ago and meant to get a new one immediately, but since I'm a disorganized mentally ill mess I've put it off until now. I've run out of money, I need a job like RIGHT NOW.  Here's the thing. My mom asked me to travel for 2 months with her in May. That's 3 months from now. She will take care of most of the cost, but I still need a few hundred dollars + survive the time until then so I definitely need money.  I love my mom and since I've isolated myself from everyone else in my life she's the only actually important person I have left in my life. And this is really important to her. So I want to do it.  But that means I need to get a job right now and quit in 3 months. I feel terrible for doing this. I know how understaffed most of these service jobs are and how much it sucks when people quit like that.  I have an interview for a waitress job in a retirement home tommorow and I'm panicking.  This is such a shitty thing to do and I know it. Going in there and acting like I'm the perfect reliable responsible employee in the interview, knowing that I'll leave them hanging so soon.  I can't tell if I'm being a truly horrible person right now or if it's maybe kind of okay to be selfish and do what I need to. Idk please help         Edit: Thank you guys!! I feel kind of disconnected from society and what's and acceptable thing to do and what is not. it's so helpful to hear someone else's opinions on this.  I just got another possible interview as a cashier for a grocery store chain, so maybe I'll go for that instead since I'll feel a less bad. It doesn't feel a high stakes as residents of the retirement home possibly getting attached to me or smth.	1643116736.0	scdjz0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdjz0/aita_for_starting_a_job_fully_intending_to_quit/	AITA for starting a job, fully intending to quit in 3 months
j09rh4o9	I have a stepdaughter “Rose” and a bio daughter “Lily” Lily’s dad is in the picture and Roses mom is somewhat in the picture but unfortunately is an addict and has some mental health issues and will not be at the wedding and could only see her occasionally with supervision growing up.  Rose never really accepted me and that’s ok, we didn’t push her. I don’t dislike Rose or anything but there isn’t much of a relationship. Rose and Lily dislike each other but are civil. Lily got married a year ago and my husband and I gave her a certain amount of money and her dad gave her the same. We had the same amount set aside for Rose so that does mean Rose would get half of what Lily got. Also Rose knows what Lily got in total because it was brought up in front of her, which I know was a mistake but she stayed with us for like a week waiting for her house to be ready and it seemed weird to kick her out of the room.  Anyway we told Rose recently what we’d be contributing and she made a face. My husband said that he knows it’s half of what Lily got but Lily’s dad paid the other half. Rose said it was fine and then a couple minutes later said we could keep it. My husband told her no she could take it and if she wants to pay she can pay what it doesn’t cover. Rose got annoyed and said she doesn’t want it and leave her alone.  Rose will not talk about it and is mostly ignoring us. Rose said she’s paying for it herself but i heard from someone the grooms mothers paying now and said she’d top what Lily got. Last time we saw Rose my husband tried to talk about it again but her fiancé snapped at us to leave her alone and he makes enough money to buy whatever she wants.  My husband is beside himself and asked if I’d consider doubling the money to make it even. I said no. We could do it but it would be a huge amount to us and more than I’m willing to spend. It does suck but at the end of the day life isn’t fair and Rose and Lily have two different situations. My husband is annoyed and says I’m being cold, but he gets that it is our money and I’m standing firm on no.	1643116748.0	scdk55	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdk55/aita_for_refusing_to_double_my_stepdaughters/	AITA for refusing to double my stepdaughters wedding budget to make it even to my daughters?
51lbx4t3	Who said friends shouldn't work together. Oh, right everyone.  Emily wasn't feeling well and thought she might have covid. She went out on a Thursday and tested positive at home Friday. Now her being out for 2 days already threw a wrench into the normal work flow and I *theoretically* should have worked Saturday to help prepare for Monday. Emily is usually the first person in our department in the morning so I messaged her on Monday telling her that if she came in to delegate some stuff to me that ill help take care of the overload. Her response back to me was "I already told (our boss) I wasn't coming back till the blah blah date, thanks for checking in on me." That made me feel bad, and slightly guilty that i hadnt checked in on her, and the more i thought about it the harder it became to check in and see how she was doing, and before i knew it it was already the weekend (the adhd brain is really stupid sometimes). Fast forward to this morning and its my first day I've seen her since she went out. She was back in office yesterday, I was just at a secondary location.  Just trying to break the werid silence I said welcome back and gave her a compliment on her hair- to which she literally scoffed at me said thanks and put her music on.  Welp... So AITA for not checking in and seeing how she's feeling/doing?   *Editors thoughts *I don't want to be bothered when I'm not at work, same goes for sick days and vacation days. So I left her be. Doing her sick thing. I figured she'd say something if she wasn't feeling better.  Having adhd brain is rough sometimes. Could I bring myself after that one text encounter to ask her how she was doing. No. It felt like what if she thinks I'm just asking cuz of work now. Maybe she thinks I'm just saying it because she called me out on it. And then ya know instead of doing the thing, I'll just think and obsess about it for a week. 	1643117623.0	scdusd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdusd/aita_if_i_didnt_check_in_on_a_sick_friendcoworker/	AITA if I didn't check in on a sick friend/coworker

The doctors all shower before they go home and the other day one of the surgeons approached me and asked me to steal the clothes of the woman who was showering. I said absolutely not.  He said he’d have me put them back and he just wanted to do something to them. I said no and he continued to pressure me. I ended up calling him a creep. He got super offended and said I’m sick.   My boss/the woman’s fiancé walked in at that moment and the other guy immediately whined to him that I was being uptight, not a team player, and that I called him a creep which was deeply offensive.  My boss said as her future husband and my boss he was giving me permission to grab her clothes but I still refused. My boss rolled his eyes and said oh well they’d try again tomorrow when the fun nurse was working. He then made a joke that I’m probably judging him but he is her fiancé and feels like he should get the final say.

9svgkbod	Little bit of backstory, about 2½ months back I had to move out of my apartment where I lived alone for about 5½ years and moved in with some close friends to help with both party's finances (thanks Covid) and since moving we've had quite a few snowfalls. I'm a nice guy, I like to help out and pitch in and do what I can so when it snows I usually try to go out and shovel, but something about the whole scenario has really be rubbing me the wrong way, which is that I have shovelled by far the most this year and I don't even use the driveway because I don't currently have a vehicle and don't drive. I'd say out of the 5 people that live in the property (a couple in the bottom duplex and myself and my two friends who are also a couple in the top) I've shovelled about 6 times this year, my friend about 2 times, and my friend's girlfriend and the couple downstairs never shovel or if they do the guy will shovel out his own vehicle and usually leave the rest untouched even though both my friend and I dig him out and do the entire driveway whenever we shovel (I don't have to ask if he's TA I already know). Anyway, circling back around, when you live in Canada and a snowfall is typically a foot of snow or more, you get a little sick of shovelling, especially when it has zero benefit to yourself and goes thankless for the other people who don't seem to want to do it themselves. And lo and behold, I woke up this morning and there's another fresh foot on the ground and nobody else is jumping to shovel, so... AITA if I don't shovel the driveway today and bring up that I think it's a little backwards that the person who shovels the most is the person who doesn't use the driveway?   Some side info if it helps, the driveway is pretty large and we only have one shovel so unfortunately the whole "I'm about to go shovel, wanna help?" approach is off the table. There are a total of 3 cars we park daily, the guy downstairs' car, my friend's car and his girlfriend's. Neither of the girls seem to want to shovel and never do and I'd agree that they probably never would have to if the two other men in the house decided to get on a rotation with me but at this point and with their prior unwillingness to shovel that seems unlikely. At this point in my mind the only other person in the house who gets a free pass is the girl downstairs who also does not drive because I wouldn't expect someone who doesn't drive to clear a path for other people's cars especially on a regular basis (somewhat biased in this respect I will admit). Also worth noting that all 5 people pay an equal amount of rent.	1643117912.0	scdy9k	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scdy9k/aita_for_being_sick_of_shovelling_the_driveway/	AITA for being sick of shovelling the driveway when I don't even drive?
dxxzx9d5	So I am a widow, I lost my husband in Sept 2018 when our oldest was only 3. I started dating my best friend and moved in with him shortly after my oldest turned 5.   We had the Daddy Daughter Dance this last weekend and while taking pictures I pulled out a picture of her Daddy to get a couple picture with not only her but also my BF.  He is upset that it seems like everything always revolves around my husband. That we don't love him as much as we do my husband.   AITA for wanting my daughter and son to remember their father. For making sure we include him in one way or another...  Edit: My BF was not only my best friend but my husband's as well at the time of his death.   Yes, we live as a family. We are coparents in every way. We have a child together as well.   This is an ongoing issue when it comes my deceased husband.

84m982j0	I'm currently taking a degree part time and joined a new organisation recently. They told me that our working hours are 9am-6pm from Monday to Friday but we might need to come in on the weekends occasionally.  As it would require 1.5 hrs of travelling time, I only accepted the offer when the contract shows that my hours are from 9am-6pm. They are also aware that I am taking my degree and it usually ends at 11pm.  However, they started asking me to come in early (as early as 730am) to implement some measure (standing 1 metre away etc) due to the requirements set by the government during this period. Additionally they told me that I need to work 2 full shifts and 2 half shifts (for each mth) on the weekend as well.  I am exhausted after 5 days of waking up at 500am to leave the house by 545am. I don't think I can handle waking up early in the weekends as well as there are classes too...  I feel guilty to leave as they were very welcoming and treated me really nice the entire time I was there. But I don't think I can manage with only 4 hours of sleep since I have reports to complete and deadlines to meet for my degree too.  I told my friend on my decision to tender my resignation tomorrow but she said that I wasted the company resources just because I couldn't sleep lesser. This made me hesitate to hand in the letter.

7a3ej9nj	I (50F) have a tumultuous relationship with my mother (75F). We’re both AARP members, but to hear us argue, you’d think we were a rebellious teenager and a domineering parent from an 80s teen drama. I would love to say this is all her fault, but it’s not. I get spun up and lose my temper, and it just turns into a repeating cycle of us pissing each other off. I know she’s the mother so she’s entitled to more deference. But at my age, I’m tired of being spoken to like a disobedient child. I have a good job, live independently, never got in trouble, helped when mom had health issues. I’m not perfect, but to hear mom call it, you’d think I never made a good decision in my life.  Recently, mom asked/demanded that we make time to meet in person so we can’t “try to discuss things calmly.” Lately, every one of our phone conversations ends in raised voices, so I really don’t want to have the same thing happen in person.  Both of us get along better with my younger siblings (35M and 47F) than each other, and they’re good at telling us when we go too far. So I told mom I would meet with her, but only if my brother or sister was present to keep both of us from going off the rails.  She. Effing. LOST IT. Started screaming that she didn’t need a chaperone to talk to her own daughter and I shouldn’t need one to talk respectfully to my mother. She also said it was selfish for me to expect my brother or sister to give up their precious time just because I can’t handle talking to my mom.  I told her that I wanted one of them there because I do have issues talking to her, and also because both mom and I think that the other is only giving them half the story to make us look good. If someone else is there, they can see things firsthand instead of through my bias or mom’s.  Mom isn’t buying it, and is demanding that I meet her by myself so we can talk “calmly, respectfully, and openly” without anyone else there. I don’t want to meet her alone because I’m afraid we’ll get in another argument. But I don’t want to stop talking to her either, and I don’t see how having one of my siblings there will hurt.  WIBTA if I refuse to meet mom in person unless one of my siblings is present?	1643118304.0	sce2z3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sce2z3/aita_for_wanting_a_sibling_present_the_next_time/	AITA for wanting a sibling present the next time I meet my mom in person?
ah3lk0sx	First time poster, so please bear with me.  Context: I lost my job during peak of Covid and instead of sitting around I started my own freelancing business. I also happen to have 16 years of experience in my field and have a good reputation, particularly in a specific field. I work globally and  people are quite happy to work with me because I go beyond freelance and actually take ownership and accountability of my work.  Issue: I have been working with someone (Mr. A), and have managed a few projects for him. This is in my area of expertise. Both Mr. A and Ms K (end client) are fairly junior in comparison.  In our latest project together I continuously advised them against the way the project was being managed. Mr. A almost was non existent in this project.  Now that the project is over Ms. K's seniors have raised a lot of questions on the project. Meaning if I want to salvage, then I would need to start from scratch and would need to rewrite all the documents (it would be the 3rd time).  I am really pissed off, and am now losing money on this project. If I don't work then I am definitely going to lose out on my feed ($ 9000). But I am willing to walk away from it because it is no longer worth my time or mental peace.  Now I might be the Asshole because, Mr. A is in no position to do my work. He also had a bad performance Review recently and could most likely end up out of a job because of this mess.  So wise people of reddit am I the Asshole to not want to save his job to save my mental peace (and to some extent because of my professional pride). Let me know.

j09u3as9	We bought our new house last year. When we first viewed the house, we noticed bikes and children's toys in the driveway and on the side yard. At our final walkthrough before we signed the final documents and got the keys, we noticed kids in the driveway coloring with sidewalk chalk and riding scooters and bikes. We introduced ourselves to the kids and asked where they lived, they pointed at the house next door. After the walkthrough, my SO and myself went to the house the kids pointed out and introduced ourselves to the parents and let them know we were buying the house and would be moving in, we also mentioned that with the trucks coming and us moving things in and out, it was not safe to have the kids in the driveway.  All was fine when we moved in, the kids didn't play in the driveway, but they were still leaving toys and digging in the side yard. We went over and asked the neighbors to please have the kids clean the toys up and stop digging in the yard. The mother said that Mr. and Mrs. X (previous owners) always let the kids try and dig for fossils in the yard and laughed. We said that we were not Mr. and Mrs. X and that we did not want the kids digging or playing in our yard. Then they started up with the bikes in the driveway again. We have cameras facing the front of the house and saw that they would ride in the driveway and the yard, and they were also starting to draw again with the chalk. We again went over to the neighbors house and let them know we did not want the kids playing in our driveway, our yard or drawing on it with chalk. The neighbor again said that Mr. and Mrs. X always let them do it, and again we explained that we were not Mr. and Mrs. X and we did not want them to do this. We also followed this up with a letter to the neighbors and informed that the kids were not allowed to play, dig or draw on our property and sent it certified mail.  Fast forward to Sunday. My SO is in the house and I am in the garage cutting wood for some projects.  I pulled my truck out of the garage so that I could work. About 20 minutes in, I hear the neighbors kids laughing in the driveway so I went out to see what they were doing. They were riding bikes on the driveway. I told them to please not ride their bikes on the driveway and go on home. Not five minutes after I said that I heard the kids again, and then heard a scream. One of the kids rode his bike straight into the truck. The neighbor came out screaming at me accusing me of causing this, the other kid told her that wasn't true and that Kid rode right into the car. My SO came out to see what the commotion was and the neighbor started screaming at SO that we would regret this.  Last night, the father came to our house and said that we are responsible for the medical bills from Kid getting hurt. I told him we are not responsible and that his kids should not even be in our yard.

j09mp1wt	I (nb29) sublet a room to Daisy (f27).   Daisy's partner Tom (m36) regularly stays over. The house is pretty old and you can hear a lot of what's going on in the othe rooms. I always go to bed on 10pm, but Daisy prefers to stay up until midnight or 1am. We have agreed that until 11pm, Daisy can be loud, but afterwards, sleep is priority. So no music, no loud talking etc.  &#x200B;  Last week, Tom was staying over. I had to work a long shift the next day, so I went to bed on 9pm. Because of our agreement, I tolerated them ebing loud until 11pm. But when Tom started to loudly talk on the phone (speakers on) and walk up and down the house at 11:45, my patience was tested for the first time. I kindly asked him to use headphones and to either have his phone talk outside or in the kitchen. About an hour later, they started to play a video game with speakers on. For a secorn time, I had to get up and ask them to use headphones. My final moment of annoyance was when around 2:30am, they were playing some sort of game where Tom was pushing Daisy around on the office chair, and she smashed into my sleeping room door. Tom opened my door, turned on my lights and shouting "ooooooh, the choo-choo train crashed into your room, hahahaah!" i just slammed the door in front of his face. After this incident, they realized themselves that it was too much and went to sleep.  &#x200B;  The next day, when I came home, Tom was still here. I was extremely tired and annoyed, I had to work 10 hours on only 4 hors of sleep. He approached me and began with "about last night-" There I cut him off. "You listen to me. We have an agreement that after 11pm, it has to be quiet. You know that. Either you stop being so annoying and loud at night, or you won't be staying over anymore. The same goes for Daisy." Then I left for my room. I know that I was loud and angry, but I'm sure I didn't yell.   According to Daisy, Tom cried the whole evening because he felt so attacked and frightened by my reaction. She calls me a a-hole on my reaction because I knew that Tom is highly sensitive and highly empathetic and he can't stand people talking to him \*without respect\*. I don't see why I should apologize. IF he's that sensitive, he should have empathy with me being annoyed af at their childish behavior. I think it is common sense as an adult to not be loud when somebody else is trying to sleep. At least after I asked him to not have his loud phone call, he should have known that it's time to be quiet.	1643119511.0	scei7d	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scei7d/aita_for_not_apologizing_for_my_overrreaction_to/	AITA for not apologizing for my overrreaction to nocturnal noise?
j0a1znru	Hello everyone,   First English isn't my first language so im sorry for any grammar mistakes, or repetition.   I (F21) got a brother (M19) and our parents (M57 and F54) separated in 2016.  They were together for nearly 18y when they slipt up and I was around 16. It was pretty friendly at the beginning but then my mom learned some things (cheating mostly but I don't have all the details) and they went NC except with lawyers or by mail. It was pretty hard on me and my brother but we managed pretty well.   Now, they have seen each other one time, at one of my brother's school gala, about a year ago, and they were civil. Otherwise they haven't seen or talk with each others ever since (even for birthdays, family reunion...), and I'm pretty okay with it because I've seen how much my dad hurted my mom in the past.  Now for the last three to four years, my dad have had health issues mostly with his arteries, and have needed surgery with general anaesthesia. He told me and my brother, and put me as the person to call in case of struggle during the surgery, and his girlfriend as the person to call post op. Everything went great. And of course I'd told my mom. When she learnt that all went well, she mailed him, by saying that he was protected because the day of his operation is pretty symbolic to them. My dad was pretty bothered when he learned that my mom knew about his surgery. And I argued that in the worst scenario, she would have to take care of her two children grieving, and it was important enough that she should know about it. My dad then answered that she won't have to take care of us because we would inherit from him. I told him that I wasn't thinking about money and that she had the right to know. And he argued back that it was his health and his right to choose who needed to know.   Well, he has again another problem with his arteries, and need a surgery, probably next week. He told me but not my brother and has ask me not to tell my mom. I told him that my limit was that if he had surgery I would tell her, even if the surgery is smaller and less risky. He ask again saying that he has no link to her and she doesn't need to know. I answered that he has children with her and that is the biggest link possible. He then said that he doesn't want his parents to know (they are pretty old, and my grandma is depressed, we don't want them to worry) and the less people know, the less chances my grands parents are to find out. My mother only spoke with them for birthday and/or when they do something great for me and my brothers to thank them. Also last time she didn't told them because she isn't part of this side of the family and she knows better than to meddle.   My dad told me that if I stayed on my position, he wouldn't tell me if he has surgery, and I told him to not do that in any case. So WIBTAH if I told my mom, my dad is gonna have surgery ? I'm pretty sure my mom has a right to know, but maybe I'm biased.  Ps: I don't need medical advise, my dad is treated by specialists dw  Edit : my parents aren't divorced as they were never married. It's pretty common were I live as we're not as religious as in the u.s	1643119573.0	sceizk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sceizk/wibtah_if_i_told_my_mom_my_dad_is_gonna_have/	WIBTAH if I told my mom, my dad is gonna have surgery ?
gfxj0	Hi, I (31F) had a busy day at work (working remotly all pandemic). My husband (31M) took our car to cleaner. Yesterday, we agreed that since I need to go to office I will take train. Today morning I discover that all my day is booked with meetings. When I was going to grab some coffee (around noon) my husband annouced that he told cleaners that I pick up car at 2pm. I was angry because I hear this first time, I told him that he can pick it himself and went to meetings.

ix58m256	I personally find this whole situation ridiculous. I work as a grocery store cashier and some girl comes in with her friend to buy a few items. They tried to use Apple Pay. Idk if it was the app or a glitch on our end but it wouldn’t go through for some reason. The friend then tried to use her debit card but it kept not reading it. I jokingly asked if they were having money troubles. I didn’t mean anything by it; I was just trying to break the tension. The friend goes on this long rant about how she “ain’t never had no money troubles in her entire life!” Their card finally goes through and the main girl tells me that I have mouth troubles. I ask her what she means and she screams at me that I shouldn’t imply that the customers are poor. I tell her to lighten up and that it was just a joke. She tells me I shouldn’t joke about things like that before storming off with her friend.

j0b2b0hb	Yesterday I got a message from my best friend M's friend telling me to come to M's house as M was dealing with an emergency. When I went there, I came to know that she was dumped by her boyfriend who is also my brother. They were in relationship with each other for last 7 years.  For background, M is insanely rich and is now a co-owner of her family business with her father. M then told us that she had a pretty big fight with my brother after she brought up a prenup just a week before their wedding. She stated that she was worried about her assets as her reasoning to him. My brother was always a butt of joke among her other friends and her family that he is just after her money and how she can get another man who is better than him easily, and now her stating it openly must be heartbreaking for him, so he broke off the wedding.   After M's narration, her friends started consoling her that how she she must have dodged a bullet and how trash got himself out of her life. I got mad at them because the person they were bashing and assuming is my brother. I told M that her friends bashing my brother wouldn't do anything as she knows him better and if he was after her money, he would have asked for it by now instead of taking loans and paying it back alone even after her offer to help and how even after prenup, 2 year of their marriage would have given him more alimony than his combined salary for a decade. I told her that prenup wasn't the issue but the timing and her communication for need of it was and I am free so we can go next week for a long ride to calm her mind to which she said she would think about it after which I left. But now her friends are telling me it was rude to say those things to M and I could have just left instead of making her feel like crap as she was crying a lot after my leaving.

fxljzz97	I, (24 F), and my partner, (26 M), got engaged. He didn't ask for my dad's permission because I haven't talked to him in over a year, and my fiance didn't want my dad to try to 'ruin' the surprise, or ruin the day for me by my dad contacting me. This is important, because my dad's side of the family had no forewarning before the proposal.  My relationship with my dad’s side of the family is messy. From my perspective, my parents got divorced because my dad would do crazy things to my mom, me, and my siblings. (he would do things like lock us outside the house because he was mad, control what we could/couldn't eat and put us on diets even though we were active and healthy, control how long we could have running water on in the shower- even though he was in a great place financially). I lived with my mom throughout most of my young adult life, but tried on and off to have a relationship with my dad. When I was younger, my dad would use money to try to control me and hold it over my head if I didn't talk to him; my mom didn't make as much money, so there was pressure to continue a relationship with him.  From my dads perspective, my mom is a narcissist who he suspects cheated on him. He would tell me these things when I was young, I think to make an effort for me to "change sides." I think what really happened is him and my mom were getting older, and wanted to settle down and have kids because they felt like they had no other choice and it was a bad match.  Since my finance and I started dating, 5 years ago, I have had very little contact with my dad. My last blow out involved my dad sending me 25+ texts on Christmas Day 2020 because I didn't call him early enough. He was drunk and when I called him, I put him on speaker phone so my boyfriend could hear what he is like when he was a blow out - since then I have gone no contact. My dad has not, to my knowledge, tried to contact me.  My grandma, uncles, aunts, cousins, etc. on my dads side of the family don't make any effort to reach out to me either. Part of me wants to have a relationship with my grandmother, but I just don't know if thats possible at this point.  So, with this background, I decided I wan't going to call them to notify them of my engagement immediately. A few days after the engagement I posted it on social media. None of my dads side of the family have contacted me to congratulate me. Because my mom still has a relationship with the ex-wife of my dads brother (my uncle), my mom told me my uncle knows in engaged; I don't know who else knows I'm engaged.  My mom thinks I should send a text to my dad, or at least call my grandma. My MOH sister (20 F) (who is still in contact with my dad, only because he gives her money) won't really give me an opinion, and I don't want to involve her. My friends have basically said F your dads side of the family, if they want to congratulate you they will contact you. I have still not contacted anyone on my dads side and its been a few days, AITA?	1643120427.0	scetq0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scetq0/aita_for_not_telling_my_dads_side_of_the_family/	AITA for not telling my dads side of the family I'm engaged?

If I plug in earphones into my device there is a good chance I will not hear what she is saying and she will be mad I could not hear it.

j0ajf2vc	Growing up I (33F) was constantly experimenting and pushing boundaries fashion wise. I've since settled on basic goth wear (mostly just "regular" black clothes). It just helps me feel more confident and at ease.  My family , though they've come to accept it, has always found my fashion sense a bit ridiculous. My dad, who was a very traditional Latinx guy and could be quite macho and controlling in other ways, never once harped on it, though. He understood my need for self expression and got me a Tasmanian devil tie as a gift during my teen punk phase.  I could never remember how to tie it, so I always went to him and had him do it for me, which he always seemed happy to do. We had a rough relationship and I think he enjoyed the few occasions he got to do proper fatherly stuff with me.  He's since passed and I kept the tie, as he was the last person to knot it and it reminds me of how kind and understanding he could be when a lot of our other memories arent so great.  It's been hanging in my closet untouched for close to a decade now, or was.   I've recently had my partner (also 33, NB) over for an extended visit and while I was away they decided it would be fun to rifle through my closet, found the tie, thought it was weird it was kept knotted and said it was lopsided, so they took it upon themselves to untie it and smooth it out.   I was livid. Especially because I'd told them the story before. I didn't want to say anything I would regret, so I just asked them to please leave, they had just ruined my dead dad's handiwork. They said it was super manipulative of me to use dad as a punishment and that they would because I'd stooped so low.   I've had a good cry and relaxed now, but they're still sending me texts guilting me about it. I'll admit I wasn't thinking clearly - AITA?  Edit: they knew it was the tie. It's the only one in my closet. Their justification was that "they'd be bothered knowing there's something lopsided when they could fix it and my dad is still dead and they're not, so their feelings should matter more". They don't have OCD or anything that would make this a pressing need, which is why I was so furious. They did have permission to use my clothes/go through my closet which is something a lot of commenters are focusing on. That's not the problem for me, I'd expressly said they could, so that has me wondering if I'm wrong here as well	1643120731.0	scexsm	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scexsm/aita_i_blew_up_over_a_tie_being_untied/	AITA - I blew up over a tie being untied
3u0556rj	I(23f) have just moved in to my own apartment. I haven’t lived here for long and the apartment is next to my parents house. This is probably among the many reasons why my mom decided it would be best for her to move in with me when we both tested positive for covid a few days ago. the first day it was fine, and i thought this might actually be good. however me and my mom always have a bit of tension between us, and i usually find a lot of the things she do a bit annoying. The next day it’s starting, she’s making room for her work computer on my desk where i like to play video games, leaving no space for me to use it. she didn’t use it, and it was just occupying the space for a whole day. I talked with her about it that night, and the next morning she moved it in to the kitchen and set up on my kitchen table, which i think is better and i’m totally fine with that. later that same day i was trying to watch an episode of this show i really like when she decides to sit down and start asking questions and throw critique at anything she sees in the show. it got to the point where i felt like she ruind the episode, that i had been waiting excitedly to release, and just turned it off. i said we could find something else to watch together. we looked around but after i suggested what felt like hundreds of shows and a lot of time scrolling she just wouldn’t stop talking about this one show i originally said i did not want to watch. I gave up and let her watch her show and just sat in my room on my phone for a bit. i watched some with her as we ate dinner, but didn’t like the show and decided to go hang out in my room again. after 6 hours of her watching this show I was a bit agitated and disappointed. I was kind off letting it get to me and just felt like it was unfair how she got to watch this show for 6 hours and i didn’t even get to watch an episode of the show i like. i am now 4 days in to my isolation, my mom is on day 3. the days have been following my moms schedule. an alarm for waking up in the morning, i stay quiet when she’s on the phone/has zoom-meetings for work, we eat when she’s done, we go to bed when she needs to go to bed. i really love being by myself and now i feel like i have nowhere to go. yesterday i told her, and she said she understood. this morning however, she kept asking me how are you/are you mad and at one point it, of course, really made me mad. at this point she texted my dad “hey. going to the cabin. if i don’t go out daughter will go crazy.” she then tells me in a mad voice how she has to leave, how she thinks it’s so rude of me to make her leave like this, and how “after everything she’s done for me” she thought letting her stay with me for 6 days was the least i could give back to her. this really hurt me, i don’t really ever ask for anything, and in my opinion the things she “has done for me” are things she should expect having to do when she became a parent. if you get a child it IS your job to feed them and put a roof  over their head.

99dcnljl	I (14m) at the start of high school took an offer of 5 bucks for twerking for literally 0.5 seconds and it was all jokes. Secretly I REALIZED this girl Rebecca (fake name) recorded me then sent it to some ppl, I asked her to delete it and to tell the ppl she sent to delete it, she agrees and that’s the end of it. Or it would if this post wasn’t here. Basically she didn’t delete it and I never knew about it until the start of January, where in class a different girl showed me the video and I asked again, this happened for 20ish days. After asking and asking I knew she wouldn’t delete it, and I’m very uncomfortable with a zoom in of my ass all over the place. the small town I live in has 2 high schools, and some friends from the OTHER High school had the video, and I REALIZED that spread a LOT. Currently as I’m typing this I’ve started ignoring Rebecca but idk when she will realize it’s bad, but she also sends the videos behind my back. When I found out today again, I was just not in the mood because my friend even told me that It was sent in a group chat without me, and behind my back and I’m just not in the mood. I have a credit recovery day today and I can’t focus cuz that stupid video, and my family will see the drop in my grade from a 90 to who knows what. And who knows what will happen if my family sees the VIDEO (I’m arab).

hor2xay7	I(f18) found out today through social media that my best friend ‘Aaron’(m18) is getting married to ‘Amy’(f19).  Here’s the backstory:  This past February-August, I became really close to Aaron and I was in love with him. He was someone I trusted more than anyone, and vice versa.  So throughout the summer, I would have Aaron over at my house along with friends. We invited Amy a few times, but stopped inviting her often because of how clearly uncomfortable Aaron was becoming around her. I remained friends with Amy as she was like an older sister to me.  Fast forward to the end of the summer, when we have to go off to college. Aaron was going to California for a few weeks to visit family and then to college in Utah.  My mom and I were already going to California for Disneyland, so we asked him if it was ok if we could see him while he’s there, he said of course. The day we come, he’s throwing a family gathering and invites us. My mom and I agree and a few hours later we show up at his house.   We go inside and there is Amy, sitting on the couch. We were surprised to see her there. The entire time there though, she never spoke to me and would get visibly unhappy whenever I was around her.   Later I found out from Aaron’s sister that Amy had showed up in California, and started imposing on all the extended family time that was set up for Aaron. Aaron had also told his sister that he was getting really fed up with how Amy was acting and the fact that she never left him alone.  Aaron stopped communicating with us and his family when he was about 3 weeks into college. Then in September I found out him and Amy got got together. Everyone was shocked.   Aaron told us that they had gotten really close because Amy was the only person he knew in Utah. We then found out the reason he’s not talking to any of us at all because of Amy. She didn’t want him talking to “outside influences”, especially me.  Today, he announced they’re getting married. When he asked me if I was happy for him, I told him my honest feelings.   This is where I might be the asshole.   I told him logistically it wasn’t smart to get married at 18, especially when they’ve been dating for a little over 4 months. After, I yelled* at him and said that I don’t support the uniting of people when someone who I knew to be caring, was marrying someone who’s manipulating him and bringing out the worst sides in him, especially when she made him super uncomfortable before.  He then replied with this, “Well she’s the one who asked me to propose to her.”  I feel like ITA because I let my romantic feelings and my opinions get in the way of this marriage, and it’s caused a rift in Aaron’s family. His dad said he won’t talk to his wife until she sees who their son is becoming with Amy around. His mom says she’s happy he’s finally getting married because she wants grandchildren, and that Amy is a good person for this. This has also caused a rift with our mutuals, making them not talk to Aaron.   So, AITA?  *edit for yelled: this was all over text messaging because I’m currently in France going abroad. I yelled at him by capitalizing some of my words like THIS.  **hii another edit because I was just informed this by Aaron’s sister. Amy has apparently been really wanted children for a while, which is was Aaron’s mom is really fond of Amy. Amy’s been asking for children from Aaron for about 2 months now, but he doesn’t want to have children unmarried.	1643121759.0	scfabq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scfabq/aita_being_brutally_honest_about_my_feelings/	AITA being brutally honest about my feelings about my friend’s engagement?
iqhmp	So my housemate and I have previously sad down and set down a bunch of rules, one of them being quiet hours (11pm to 8am). Since I have a sleeping issue (which is one of the reasons I strongly insisted that we have quiet hours set down) --- I cant stay asleep for prolonged period of time and I usually wake up around 6-7am (but we set the quiet hours til 8am since we agreed that just because I am awake that does not mean Im allowed to make noise, and we set down upon a time that a reasonably-functioning person would wake up for school/work).   I have always been a person who likes to exercise in the morning (it is a part of my culture to 'dance when the rooster sings') --- given the quiet hours agreement I would wait until it is 8 to start exercising. This is where the problem comes, previously Ive mainly been doing strength and flexibility trainings such as stretches and different dumbbell reps --- but recently Ive been wanting to do more cardio exercise (running specifically) but I am reluctant to risk going outside for running. And my housemate has been complaining that my running was too loud. I told him that since it is past quiet hours I am supposedly allowed to make noises --- but he insisted that I either stop running or we have to ammend the quiet hours --- which for me is quite a nuisance since it partially disturbs my lifestyle and not to mention that I have a 13 hour timezone difference with my home country and my mother sleeps at 10pm, if we move the quiet hours any further away it would mean that I cannot talk with my mother.

dfpdbiwj	Honestly, this was out of character for me. I’m normally reserved and wouldn’t even consider talking to strangers. But it seems like I’ve started a habit of thinking out loud.   My twin brother (21m) and I (21f) headed down to our closest super market to grab some food, and on the way inside, some little kid ran out in front of us, nearly making us trip over him and very quickly ripped a toy out of some plastic box and angrily threw the box onto the floor. Without even thinking I gasped and just said in a serious tone “you shouldn’t litter” - nothing too dramatic, it’s not like I shouted at them.  The mother then yelled at me angrily “I’ll tell him that!!”  I didn’t respond and just kept walking through the entrance.   My brother was shocked (trust me, so was I) and teased me about it the whole shop. When we got home he started tell our mother, which I begged him not to thinking my mum wouldn’t approve because she is a teacher for young children. But to my surprise my Mum actually said she thinks I did the right thing, because “kids learn better when strangers will tell them off” and she “would have been thankful if someone said that to her kids”   I still think I was kind of an asshole but idk I also don’t think anything bad could come from it.  What do you guys think?	1643122460.0	scfj0i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scfj0i/aita_for_scolding_a_strangers_child/	AITA for scolding a strangers child?
hp3zbuh8	Edit at bottom for Q&A  I (30F) dated a friend of my sisters when I was in high school, around age 15 or so. We dated maybe 2 months. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things. During the relationship he gave me a sketchbook of his. Hes a very talented artist and it was something we bonded over. The relationship ended and life went on.  I have had absolutely no contact with him at all since high school and I've long since moved from our hometown. Recently my sister reached out to me and asked if I still had the sketch book. I do. She said he wants it back. I find it very annoying that he couldnt ask me directly but also I havent heard from him in almost 20 years and now he wants me to return a gift he gave me. Doing so would require a good bit of effort on my part. I would have to ship it to him. I asked if he would cover shipping and naturally, no, he will not.   So he wants me to give back a gift, cant be pressed to speak to me directly, and refuses to help me in any way with returning it. It's a hard no for me. My sister thinks I'm being an asshole because it's his art but if it was that important to him he would help with shipping at least. I would be more respectful I think if he had asked me himself. She thinks I'm being petty because the relationship ended in drama but it was 2 months of my life 20 years ago my beef is how this is coming up now. It's very irritating.  **Edit to answer questions:   I did ask him to pay the shipping. He refused.   I kept it because it's good art and I love art. I enjoy the book.   I can give it to my sister but we dont see each other too often.  I cannot pay the shipping because I'm a house wife. No job no money.   I'm not keeping it from him out of spite but I'm not gonna bend over backwards and also burden my husband over something he cant even ask me directly for.  Finally for those saying "shipping is so cheap it only costs x amount" ok so why cant he pay?? Like if it's cheap why can't he cough it up? Why does he get to demand that **I** pay to give him back a gift he gave me 15 years ago?? If shipping is sooooo cheap where is the shipping coverage from him? Hm? He didnt have the balls to make the demand directly.   He wants it. He can pay or he cant wait till it's a convenient time for me.   My decision: Its not worth the drama so I'll give it to my sister whenever I see her again unless he decides to pay shipping in which case he can have it back immediately.  Thank you for all the responses I got including the YTA votes. It helped me make my decision. Keeping it at this point just doesnt feel good so I'll make a copy and return the orginal but I will not use my money to do so. He can pay or wait until I visit my hometown again. Simple as that. I really appreciate all the feedback I got. I'll ask kindly not to downvote YTA votes unless they are rude. I wanted feedback and I got it.

eihuol4n	I’ve been struggling to figure out who’s the A-hole in this scenario for a while now. I (F18) went to a party my guy friend set up for my boyfriend, everyone had planned to sleepover after which I was not aware of until I was already at the party. When I found out, I let my mum know through text that I wanted to sleep over and if she could bring some stuff over, or if I could get a ride to pick up some stuff. She refused both offers and said I needed to come home to have a talk with my dad. I’ve previously had a talk with my dad regarding parties, alcohol, and men (especially drunk men) so assumed this is the talk he wanted to have and was confused as we had already discussed it. My mum refused to explain even after I tried reasoning with her, she just kept demanding I come home. I would have been happy to come home, chat, and go back to the party but she wanted me to stay home. She ended up ignoring my texts as I refused to come back home and so I stayed the night anyway.   The next morning my dad talked to me about how worried and exhausted they were. They barely slept because I hadn’t come home and he seemed genuinely upset and scared for me when talking about it. I felt so bad that they felt this way but at the same time I realised I am an adult so I should be able to make my own decisions. My parents acknowledge I’m an adult yet treated me like a child in this situation. Since alcohol was involved he was worried for my safety despite it only being a party of 6 people who I know pretty well with the exception of one guy who I hadn’t talked to much but was friends with everyone else. I understand I don’t know a lot about this sort of stuff (only started drinking when I turned 18 as that’s the legal drinking age here) but I also hated being treated like that.

clc86j5d	One of my best friends is having her wedding ceremony/reception this spring. She had a small covid wedding in fall 2020 (on the date that her wedding was supposed to be) and rescheduled everything for this spring. She got engaged in 2019 and set the original date the same year. I (27F) am a bridesmaid in the wedding.   My husband (28M) and I were planning to attend the wedding. We’re both close to the couple and have traveled with them and get together with them frequently. However, we just received an invite from his parents to attend his brothers graduation from grad school this spring/the grad party the same day. Of course, it falls on the same day as the wedding. My husband and I agreed that we would still go to the wedding as we knew about it first (and I’m in the wedding) and let his parents know we would celebrate with his brother later.   My in-laws replied saying that my husband must attend the graduation/party. I put my foot down and brought up the fact that his brother said that he couldn’t attend my husbands graduation because he had finals (graduation was on a Friday) but then posted himself partying all day on social media (he was at school a half hour away from my husband). The wedding and the graduation locations are about a 5 hour drive apart so it would tough to attend both in the same day. This has caused quite the rift and I’m feeling bad about it.

itbhmz4p	My husband (23M) and I (22 TRANS M) have recently agreed that we were ready to start make our family bigger. Due to my hormone therapy and other pre-existing fertility issues, I have a very slim chance of being able to conceive my own baby. We knew surrogacy or adoption would be our main options.   My younger sister "C" (21F) was very quick to offer to be my surrogate when I told her of my plans to start a family. I thanked her but told her me and my husband were still discussing our options.   C has a history of liking to be the center of attention in our family. Her first child was the first grandchild for her parents (we share the same mom only), and got very upset when our stepbrother on our moms side had twins and was receiving more attention than her daughter. She was also the first sibling to get married when she was 19, and had made a comment then that she "beat me to it" because me and my husband had only been dating for several years at the time.   While she has been very supportive of me being transgender and my transition, I'm worried that she's only wanting to be a surrogate for the attention she would get for doing so. While she could be simply attempting to do the possibly most selfless thing a person could do for another, I'm worried that their is selfish motives behind it and C will hold it over me that she birthed my child.

98c2bkn3	I have a thoroughbred horse that I've owned since he was 11 months old. I've had him out on loan to a number of different people since he was 7 after I blew a disc out in my back and couldn't cope with his stable care.   He's been with a friend ("Dave") for about 2 years now and last year I agreed that Dave could buy him from me. We agreed on a very low price and Dave said he would send the money in installments. However, since July last year, I've had nothing but excuses as to why Dave can't pay.   At this point, horse still belongs to me until the final payment has been made, but I have no idea where he is or how he's doing. Trying to get updates from Dave is like pulling teeth! I'm worried about my horse, and I have enough money at the minute to pay back the little I've already received for him. I have a fabulous yard where the horses all live out 24/7, so stable care isn't an issue any longer.

idihe7w2	I (31F) live in the UK. I bought my house 2 years ago.  My house is in a row of blocks of two houses (semi-detached), with a shared wall on one side and a garage with a gap next to the property line on the other.  My neighbours (M and F 65ish) when they bought their house, took down their garage and extended their house towards the property line. They now have a gap of about 70cm/28inches between their property and the property line.  I have the garage and a 3m/9ft10inches gap towards the property line (I have a little veg garden there). I also have a 2m/6ft5inches tall fence with a gate that separates the front and back gardens.  I’ve talked to my neighbours several times, as we both have been having work done on our houses. No arguments, all very pleasant.   I got woken up yesterday (Monday) morning by men asking me to move my car off my driveway (they seemed really annoyed). I was surprised as I had no idea who they were.  When they told me that they were landscapers. I told them they had the wrong house and it was my neighbours having their garden done. He then told me (very slowly like I was an idiot) the only way to do that was to take down the wall on the property line (we jointly own) and my fence so they could get a digger/excavator and equipment into my neighbours backyard. They said they would put the wall and fence back up when the job was done. I told them I never agreed to that and they didn’t have my permission to move my fence.  The landscapers were outside for a few hours, blocking my driveway with their van/trailer, talking on the phone and just staring at my house. They left at around midday. I called my brother to come round as I expected a confrontation with my neighbours. At around 5, they came home. I heard slamming car doors and then banging on my door like they were the police.  I will admit they were calm/not shouting. They said they are going to charge me for the days cost of the landscapers. The landscapers will be back tomorrow and I better have my car off the driveway. They are adamant I agreed to everything already and I’m being an asshole by changing my mind now.  I agree that we talked about their garden plans, we have also talked about my kitchen reno and what colour they painted their front door. They never said anything to me about taking down the wall or my fence. I have 2 large dogs (bullmastiffs) I would never have agreed to it, I need an enclosed garden for them.  I left a note on my fence saying I put a camera up and to not touch my fence. Looking at the camera playback the landscapers arrived this morning, took a photo of my note and left again, they didn’t knock on my door.  AITA for not allowing the landscapers to access my neighbours garden through mine?  My mum thinks I’ve started an argument for no reason and I should have just let them take the wall and fence down to keep peace.	1643124645.0	scgb35	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scgb35/aita_for_not_allowing_my_neighbours_landscapers/	AITA for not allowing my neighbours landscapers to access their garden through mine
bh5ax29q	I’ll be quick. My (17F) best friend (16F) had an Instagram story up. It said something about wanting to hang out with people this summer but not knowing who to hang with. There was a tiny bit of text next to it, I couldn’t read. She was sitting right next to me at the time I saw it. I took a screenshot to zoom in on the small bit of text so I could read it. She ripped my phone out of my hands and deleted the screenshot, and accused me of snooping. I said that it was on her story, and therefore not snooping. She said that she put it small because she wanted to type it out but didn’t want people to read it. She said she was going to delete the story now, but I read the tiny bit of text before she could (without telling her I read it). It said something along the lines of “it makes me realize that the people I call friends are just acquaintances that I open up to too much.”  AITA?

j0ehfnbr	  I'm a hobbyist baker but my full time job is engineering consulting. There's more money in the engineering side; when I want to pick up extra hours of work, I'm gonna do engineering work.  But I genuinely like making cakes for friends or for events as a surprise! But I don't always, sometimes I'm just too busy to make one, it's just something I do if I happen to have a free day before a get together.  I like making them as surprises because if I screw them up, there's no pressure to bring something.   But as of recently a bunch of people, have asked me if I can make cakes for different events. And I started just saying no, because I don't have the time. Plus I don't know if I could do designs other people make justice, I really just make whatever I'm feeling and kinda wing it.   But people got so annoyed by that, saying stuff like 'but you made a cake for (other person)" or "I'm not asking for anything hard!"   So I started saying that for special requests, I'm making cakes for commission, and that I can send them my pricing structure if they're still interested.   My pricing structure is really structured around what it would cost to make it worth it to me, to spend a day making a cake instead of spending it on my main job... So my rates are:  Customer pays the cost of ingredients.  A base hourly rate of $150 (Minimum 3 hours)  If the "deadline" is in under 48 hours my hourly rate is $250  Soo... After I set my commission rates, most people will be like "nevermind" when I mention a commission at all, before I even get into prices. With only two exceptions.  My aunt Jess who I'm not really close to came up to me at Christmas and asked me if I could make a cake for her friend's party. I said I'm only doing commission work right now but I could send my pricing breakdown. She said sure then she got really rude saying that my cakes were nowhere near that good to charge that much and that she could get better at the bakery.   I said that she should go to the bakery then, they would have something nice!  She got frustrated with me and said she didn't want a chain store bought cake, and I said there were some non chain bakeries in the nearby city. She said I was missing the point and that my prices were absurd and nobody would pay that. I said that was okay, I had enough business through my main job.  Next my cousin asked me if I could make a cake for her kids birthday party, and I said that I'm only taking commissions. She said that my prices were horrible, for a kids party? I said that kids would like a grocery store cake just as much, I was sure the party would be great whatever cake she got! She said she didn't want a grocery one, she wanted one of my custom designs. I said that seemed like overkill for a kid's party. She said that nothing but the price was overkill and that I was taking advantage.

j0b21nae	 I'm going to try and keep this short.  So in May my mother had told me then 11yr old son that he should put peroxide straight on his teeth with a qtip to whiten them. Kids were home virtual learning so my son asked my bf to open the peroxide bottle for him. Bf asked him why and son told him. Well BF told him that was stupid to do and to wait for me. Well son told my mother what bf had said. My mother and BF hate each other, have since the day we got together 8 yrs ago. My mother messaged me that BF has no say as he's not sons father and he should not be talking about her that way. I said I'd look into what happened as I was at work. I read up on it and seen it can weaken the enamel and told son not to do it without me and we would mix in baking soda or when he's 12 I would order safe whitening kits. I'm not a big fan on pointing out flaws on my son as I don't want him to be self conscience nor do I want him to have self esteem issues. I find 2 little spots on teeth to be a non issue at his age.  My mother stopped talking to me. I sent her a happy mothers day wish and that went unresponsive, and the following week on her bday I sent her a bday wish and all I got was "thanks". So I thought I would just leave her be as she goes through periods of silent treatments with her family. I figured it was just "my turn". This went on until November when she yelled at my son on the phone when I was in the restaurant picking up food. I came back to the car and son was sobbing. He told me that she yelled at him and he didn't want to go to her house for the weekend. He tried to get his father to call her to tell her but his father was working so I sent her an email. She emailed back that she didn't appreciate how he spoke to her (I mean, he's 12 so there is a bit of an attitude right now). She thinks we should sit down and discuss the issue of me not handing the peroxide thing properly as she thinks this is showing him how to negatively have a relationship with her. I told her that I wasn't ready to sit and talk to her and I don't appreciate the silent treatments anymore (I'm 40ishF and its been like this my whole life). She replied that was insane to say and it was taking a "breather" not silent treatment.  During the time of her not speaking to me, I had heard she was talking crap about me behind my back. That I should have been laid off at our work and not her (she said this to my son and my ex-husband) as well as calling me "Ms-know-it-all" and other things to both my son and ex-husband. She also hates my bf so much that she ignores his and his sons existence but expects his family to accept us (they do and treat us as part of the family).

7qveasa9	we both are highschool kids. I'm mid-size(like size 14-16) and he's got a pretty average figure. we've been friends for a yearish now and he's a pretty conservative guy, which is fine.   today in class he made a comment how he was a daddy and I made the comment "no dude, you're a Twink". I've made the joke about him being a Twink because he's a young boy and we joke about him being gay. I made the joke a few times before and he didn't really have a outward reaction that hinted he didn't want to be called that. If he asked me to stop or if I picked up the hint he wanted me to stop I would have.   (His humor is pretty dark, like when we were in a class talking about German inventions, he said "oh like the gas chamber?". which is why I didn't think he had a problem with it. )  After I made the joke about him being a Twink he responded "oh but if I call you fat, I would be the bad guy". and that did upset me, because Ive struggled with my weight for literally all my life. I don't know his story so I won't make assumptions about that. what makes me more upset is like, is that really how he sees me? he said his comeback not as a joke. and idk I feel like I am the asshole. after the situation, he was talking about how he's the good guy in the situation and he's just misunderstood.

74j1riqd	My Dad (44), Mom (42), and I (19) are in a bit of a predicament.  You see, my Dad was in the Army for 14 years when I was a kid, so he has PTSD and tends to overreact to some things. It all came to a head back in October 2020. The next day he took the things he wanted, grabbed his dog, and left.  Leading up to this, I had already distanced myself from my Dad in the house from all the arguing he would do with Mom. He insists that she's a narcissist, and that she deserves whatever he says when they argue, and I've been trying to figure out if he's right for years but Mom has been nothing but kind to me so I don't see it.  My dad has been living out of his truck since he left, but back in April(ish) he started talking to another woman and he moved in with her and her two kids. All while Mom was trying to get marriage counseling with Dad and trying to convince him to come back home since they were still married.  We found out about the other woman earlier this month, and I reached out to her to offer to talk about my Dad. I got this really condescending text back talking bad about my Mom so I haven't been interested in talking with her since. Dad spent two hours trying to convince me to talk to her a few days ago and accused me of judging someone before I have even met them. I got tired of it and Dad told me not to talk to him until I learn some respect.  Am I the asshole?  Edit: one of the commenters said that this would benefit from examples of my parents' behaviour so I'll do my best to remain within community guidelines.  Some of the things that trigger my Dad are... Well it's actually hard to say because it can be anything. Forgetting to turn lights off when you leave your bedroom or before you go to bed, fireworks, even if you say something as a joke. If my Dad takes it the wrong way it can make the rest of a meal go silent for the rest of the time we're sitting there. Usually I have to be the bigger person and apologise for something I didn't do, and at this point I hardly apologise for anything at all unless I feel bad about something I said or if I just want my Dad to go away.  My mom is not without her faults. Sometimes she starts a fight or gets upset about something I did and I say something hurtful back, but unlike with my Dad I usually go back after we've had time to cool off and we make up later. She's a respiratory therapist and has been travelling since early 2020 when the pandemic hit. Usually she's working 4 to 6 days a week, and sometimes she takes out her frustration on me since she's been very stressed. She usually apologises first when that happens. It leaves her with not a lot of time at home so when Dad gets upset with something she said he'll blow up her phone at work or at 2 am before she has to get ready for work at 5 am.	1643125715.0	scgpdh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scgpdh/aita_for_not_talking_to_my_dad/	AITA For Not Talking to my Dad
j0d9isu6	I (34M) am a social media professional and do a lot of work helping influencers increase their followers organically. I've grown accounts from scratch to 1M+ and manage several accounts which have multiple millions of followers. Most of them are women.  So, the other week an old friend from college asked me if I could help out his friend, let's call her Jay (21F) who was having trouble growing her following. He told me J has about 10,000 followers which is not bad but her follows and engagement were dropping.   I took a look and one of my major recommendations to her was to stop posting so many photos with her boyfriend (20M). I backed this up with data showing that engagement whenever she posted him was much much lower. In my experience this happens a lot, for obvious reasons. I told her unless she was with some similar social media personality she should keep her relationship status private. I thought she really had potential and so I also offered her my management services for no payment upfront, instead asking a percentage of any income she makes (this isn't unusual).  Then yesterday I got a call from her boyfriend shouting and screaming at me about how I just wanted to bang his girlfriend and I was trying to break them up and so on, which is not true, I've never even met her. Now J is really really hot but I have a long term gf I love so wtf? I told him it was ridiculous, hung up and blocked him, then emailed J and told her what happened and I would prefer not to work with her any more to avoid hassle. This made things worse apparently, she broke up with him and now my old friend is mad at me saying I shouldn't have made any such recommendation.

j0a4etsd	I (24f) love my (57f) Mom more than anything. I want to make this clear early on. We have a great relationship in a lot of ways and she is an extremely supportive parent. She raised me and my siblings as a single mother and she has always been there for me and is always willing to fight for me. The trouble is she can make me feel horrible about my body.  To give some backstory, my mom suffered from anorexia from the age of 12 until her mid-twenties and she has struggled with body image ever since. She extremely regiments her diet, counts every calorie, and exercises regularly. I have absolutely no problem with this, although I do worry that she puts too much emphasis on being a particular weight.  Since I was a child I have been overweight. I was badly bullied in school and would go as far as to say I was tormented for my weight.  I've always got the impression that my mom was embarrassed to have an overweight daughter. Growing up my mom would put me on diets and count my calories. She would always tell me that I had such a pretty face and could I imagine how much attention I would get when I was thinner?  At 18 I was my biggest and my mom outright told me I was fat and this really upset me. She told me I had to sort myself out so I lost 50lbs in 4 months. I was then at my smallest and I noticed a shift in how my mom was treating me. The trouble was, she didn't want me to stop there, saying I needed to lose 25lbs more.  I got into a very happy and healthy relationship at 21 so (as I'm sure some of you can relate to) I gained like 20lbs back. When I visited my mom she would look through old pictures of me and say things like "Look how skinny you were!" about my pictures from my lowest weight, almost longingly. This made me feel like absolute crap.  This past Christmas, I finally snapped at her. I have never felt comfortable confronting her because she's usually so good to me about everything else but it got to the point where I was considering starving myself, making myself throw up, or other extreme measures.  I said that she needed to stop trying to regiment my body and she was the reason I had such a bad relationship with food. I also said that she was probably the reason that I had an eating disorder. I worded everything really badly and I was very harsh, but I felt like it was the final straw. My mom began crying and said that she was only trying her best to keep everyone healthy. She told me I was too harsh on her and she now felt horrible about herself. We haven't spoken about it since.  My sisters both think that while I was valid in what I was saying, I was way too harsh in how I delivered the message and that mom is just insecure in herself and that's why she projects onto me, so I should just have brushed her comments off. I do feel really bad about what I said because there were definitely other factors that fed into my ED, but my mom is also a part of it.

a506avbc	A group of friends and I decided to book an Airbnb in Mexico for a music festival in August 2022. We booked an Airbnb that could sleep 8 people but we only had 6 of us committed at the time making it $456/person.  A few weeks later, 2 more friends asked to join us and we agreed which brought the price of the Airbnb down to $342 a person. I started to get cold feet because the last time we attended it was really expensive and exhausting. I informed everyone before music festival tickets were released that I was hesitant about going and may want to opt out this year. They were all kind and understanding. A week later, one of our other friends also told the group they may drop out. Is it rude of me and this friend to ask if the 2 new people can buy us out of the Airbnb? When we bought the Airbnb, we booked it for a group of 6 for $456/person but now those friends are claiming that they never intended to pay that much and don’t want to pay the extra $114 to reimburse us.	1643126222.0	scgw3e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scgw3e/aita_for_requesting_to_be_reimbursed_for_group/	AITA for requesting to be reimbursed for group vacation after backing out?
53vr7q1c	I’m losing my mind here and I’m incredibly frustrated so please excuse any spelling or formatting errors.   I (21F) live in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate M (22M). We moved in back in June because we were both starting at the same college. We had known each other for years and worked together for about a year prior to the decision to move in together.   We moved in and I provided most of the furniture because he didn’t have much. He brought a table and a couch and I brought the tv, bookshelf that the tv sits on, I’m being a coffee table home today. I also brought almost all of the dishes and the pots and pans. He came with maybe 2 coffee mugs and I’ve provided everything else. The only thing he contributed to the kitchen was the microwave. I want to say that I’m in no way upset by that, this just means that when we move out I’ll have considerably less stuff that I have to buy for my own home.   When things first started out we were each washing our own dishes, but I felt bad because he would wash his right after use and I would let mine gather for a couple days because I didn’t see a need to wash dishes 2 times a day every day. So we switched to a deal where I would wash the dishes and he would clean the bathroom. That lasted for a couple of months and then one day I asked him to clean the bathroom because the tub was gnarley and he said he’d do it. A week later the tub was still disgusting and the bathroom wasn’t clean so I told him either he cleans the bathroom today or I do and he’s got dish duty. I really thought that would get it done because I did the dishes like 3 times a week and the bathroom only had to be cleaned every 2 weeks at most but it didn’t and I cleaned the bathroom. I also washed all of the dishes that were in the sink prior to that discussion so that he’d be starting with a clean slate. We have since switched roles but every single time M does the dishes I have to check them as I’m putting them away to make sure they are clean. And every time there’s at least 5 dishes that are still dirty. We’ve talked about it so many times about how I’m so frustrated that he can’t just clean them in the first place and his response is always ‘well clearly sometimes things are going to be overlooked if I’m washing by hand’ and every time I respond with ‘how many times did you grab a dirty dish when I did the dishes’  I’m so tired of this situation still going on and I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking about taking the dishes away and storing a couple in my room and if he wants dishes he can buy his own but I just don’t know what to do anymore.

j0ffduwe	 So, I (33F) have this friend Lucy (31F), who used to be really sweet, but she recently became a bit overbearing. She  is very motherly toward our friends group, spends a lot of time checking how we feel, and gives a lot of advice to help us, even if we don't ask for it. I find it a bit overbearing because I don't want to have a  serious chat about my personal thoughts every single time I go out. But I know she comes from a good place so I try to keep it to myself. The only thing that really bothers me is that she's constantly trying to "wake" us about moral values. If it was religious belief I think she could be described as a proselytist because she brings it up all the time, even if the timing is not appropriate at all.   Anyway, we have another friend, Cam (30F), who is currently going through a really hard time (she had a stillbirth 10 days ago and her husband is stuck abroad). We're all trying to help her recover and giving her moral support, Lucy included. She brought food, gave her a therapist number, offered to help with trying to get her husband back sooner... Cam was very thankful but also a bit uncomfortable, as her and Lucy are not that close. She said she needed space so Lucy stopped coming every day.  Two days ago we had a small get together at my place, there were 4 of us (our friend group is 8 people) including Cam. We did not invite Lucy because we knew she would not give Cam space.   Well, Lucy found out. She didn't say anything to Cam but she came to me, asking why we did not invite her. I tried to be gentle and told her I did not want too many people so Cam would not feel overwhelmed, etc.. But she said she was hurt that Cam did not consider her close after what  she did for her. I was already a bit pissed, and told her I could understand, but that Cam was not able to reassess her relationships right now and she should wait for her to get better if she wanted to sort it out. Lucy was having none of it and said Cam was ungrateful.     I was so shocked that all I managed to answer was "wow, I hope I'll never have to grieve while you're around". Lucy bursted into tears. I walked away but was told she kept telling she doesn't understand why people are "rejecting her'' when she's "just trying to be a good friend".   Now, I'm not proud of my answer but I also don't regret what I said because I think she's showing a tremendous lack of empathy for someone who just lost a baby, and for someone who always call people out when she think's their selfish, that's salty.   My friends are divided on the subject. They say they get why we did not invite her but that I was mean to Lucy.	1643126935.0	sch679	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sch679/aita_for_not_inviting_a_friend_who_wanted_to_help/	AITA for not inviting a friend who wanted to help ?
j05u51qm	I (22f) visited my best friend home yesterday. We were gushing about a guy she has been dating. He seems like a perfect gentleman and he really likes her. They have been going out for 2 months now and I think he is going to be very good for her. She is visibly happier and I pick up sketch vibe well and he seems great.   Her sister (16f) was with us and she said that he was probably abusive because and was just putting on an act. It upset my friend but she said she didn't feel that way and she had literally no reason to think he was abusive and controlling when we had all the evidence to the contrary.   She was very smug about it and then when my friend protested she said that she knew boys and she said she is going to be prove right when he turns out to be an asshole. She went on to say that she wishes that she was a lesbian and she didn't have to deal with men at all.   It hit a very sore not for me as I am bi and I was in a relationship with someone horrible who pretty much ruined two years of my life and fucked me up that I need therapy to undo it. I know my parents didn't believe me when I said she was controlling and abusive.   I snapped that she was really immature and naïve if she thought lesbian relationships can't turn ugly and controlling. I also said that she didn't have a lot of experience dating. She ended up leaving the room and is mad with my friend. My friend thinks I should have been calmer and not snapped at her.   I feel bad about it because she is a literal child and I called her immature. I also should have been an adult about it and explained it to her in a way she would have understood. She is also been a victim of bullying from a bunch of boys and I think I should have been more empathetic about it.	1643126936.0	sch683	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sch683/aita_for_calling_my_best_friends_sister_immature/	AITA for calling my best friend's sister immature and naïve?
iti3ty2a	(Me 15m) So my cousin (17m) died and when we went to the funeral I asked my aunt if I could have his roblox account because he is rich and because he is dead he doesn’t need it anymore. She got mad at me for saying that but I don’t understand why. He is dead so it doesn’t even matter because he won’t use that account anymore and I think that’s a waste of robux. My mom said that I’m grounded for 1 year and she took away my Xbox and my phone but I stole my phone so I could say this. I think that it is not fair that I can’t have his account.

j0f5jyat	Hi, long time lurker first time poster! Anyway, some background. My(18f) and my boyfriend(18m) live with my parents and my younger sister(15f). My parents want us to stay with them until we have to move several hours away for school in about a year and a half. They also don't want us to pay them rent because they want us to save money for school and moving. My boyfriend and I both work a weekend factory job, and spend Monday-Friday on campus all day. Because of this we pack 1-2 meals a day to take with us, as well as a few snacks.  When we're getting ready to do the grocery shopping, my mom will ask what kinds of foods we want for work and school. We give her meal ideas, and snacks we want for the next couple weeks. My sister will also give some ideas. These groceries are a huge thing for me and my boyfriend, because we barely spend time at home, so we have to pack food to last us the day, otherwise we have to be hungry or eat out, which we don't want to do.  Now onto the problem, when I ask my mom for specific foods, she buys them for us to have for work and school. The problem is, more than half the time we don't get to eat this stuff because my sister will get up in the middle of the night and eat the stuff we specifically asked to have for our lunches and snacks. Either that or she'll eat the stuff we don't pack that day when we're not home.  Now this severely annoys me and my boyfriend because my sister will ask for specific food and eat the stuff she wanted and ours. But anytime we talk to my mom about it, she refuses to listen to us saying she won't have us argue or complain over food. We don't mind that my sister snacks on some of the stuff we specifically request, it's just when she eats all of it, and we end up not being able to pack any of it for the week. It also causes an issue, because when putting away groceries before, I've asked about a certain thing my mom bought, and she says, "don't touch those, you're sister asked for those, and I bought them for her."  Well one day after this, my boyfriend and I mentioned buying some snacks and stuff ourselves that we wanted just for ourselves, because we didn't want my sister to eat it. My mom blew up on us and said that we can't be buying our own food and saying it's only for us. She told us that if we start buying our own things, then we won't be allowed to eat any of the food she buys for the family. She said it was an AH move wanting to buy ourselves a couple things for lunches, and not sharing with the rest of the family. I just don't see the issue with buying a few things for us here and there. It caused a huge fight, and now my mom won't talk to us about it.  I just don't know if we were really in the wrong for being upset about the food we wanted constantly being eaten. And is it really wrong of us to want to occasionally buy our own food on occasion and not have others eat it?  So reddit, AITA for being annoyed about my sister eating the food we ask for, and wanting to buy some of my own food?  Edit 1: to try and make things a little clearer.	1643128032.0	schl9r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/schl9r/aita_for_wanting_to_buy_some_of_my_own_food/	AITA for wanting to buy some of my own food?
id0ron11	I(44) adopted my daughter(17) and her younger brother(14) when they were just 6 and 3 years old(I met them when they were 5 and 2). I was dating their mother at the time and before we started dating their dad just abandoned them and he hasn’t been in their lives since but he did give up is parental rights. He’s never reached out in 12 years. Also, their mother and I are no longer together but we co-parent really well.  So my son and daughters bio-dad reached out to my daughter over Instagram and According to her, he looks exactly like her. She comes to My office one day and asks me if she can go and meet him because he asked to go out for lunch some time. I immediately think that this is some of the sketchiest shit I have ever heard. She asked her mom and she her mom said yes to letting her meet him but I have some issues with it. Her mother won’t even be there to go with her, she’s in Guatemala visiting family for the month.  I offered to let her meet him for lunch as long as I come with her and he can prove that he’s her real dad and not just some guy messaging her on social media claiming to be her dad. She got upset and said I was being overprotective and that I should just chill out and that it’s her decision. If she wants to meet him that’s her choice, she’s right about that but I have every right to be overprotective. This is my baby girl we’re talking about and is it wrong to not want her going to meet a strange man for lunch. Even if he is her actual dad, she hasn’t seen him in almost 13 years.   Obviously it hurts seeing her want to meet her real dad because no matter what you fear that he will be better than you. I know she sees me as her true father figure but it still scares the shit out of me just thinking about it. Am I an asshole for thinking that way?	1643128141.0	schmpe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/schmpe/aita_for_not_wanting_my_daughter_to_go_and_meet/	AITA for not wanting my daughter to go and meet her bio-dad?
7j82d75s	When i moved in with my girlfriend, she had a roommate and was cool with it.  A little background here.  The house they rented was a split foyer.  So when you walk in, you either go up or go down.  They split the rent 50/50 and each paid a few utilities.  My girlfriend had the basement which included 1 bedroom, a bathroom, and a living room.  The roommate had the upstairs which included 2 bedrooms (one for sleeping, one for an office)  a bathroom, and a livingroom.  Kitchen and laundry room were shared.  Skip forward to me moving in.  Before I moved in, nobody thought it would be a good idea to discuss how things were going to be divided, so my girlfriend and i decided to split her half of the rent, since we were sharing the basement, and i took over a few utilities.  After about a month or so of me living there, the roommate randomly approaches us and said that they arent paying 50% of the rent, we were splitting it 3 ways as if we had no say in the matter, and walked away.  I told her it wasn't up for debate because nothing was discussed up front, and told her that if she wanted to split the rent 3 ways, I was taking her 2nd bedroom.  She didnt take that kindly and started being a total bitch to my girlfriend.  After that I decided to come up with a few different ways to split the rent. 1) split by square footage, which would have dropped her rent about $50, because we had about the same total space. 2) Pay by bedroom, because she had 2 bedrooms to herself, I thought this would be fair. 3) split the rent 3 ways, but i get her 2nd bedroom and turn it into my gaming room.  She would not see reason to anything I came up with and decided the only fair way to split the rent was to split it 3 ways and we get to store some stuff in her 2nd bedroom.  This only lead to more arguments, and we eventually moved out at the end of the lease 2 months later.  She became completely petty about the whole situation and even tried to move out and stiff us with all the bills.  Am I the asshole here?  Edit: a little clarification.  Me moving in was ok'd by the roommate, but it was failed to communicate between the 3 of us how the bills were going to be handled.  The common areas that everyone is saying I'm neglecting are listed.  Kitchen was shared upstairs, and laundry was shared downstairs. And using the phrase "put in her place" wasn't meant to be derived in a sexist way, I meant it as she wasn't in a postion to be judge, jury, and exicutioner"	1643128279.0	schon1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/schon1/aitah_for_trying_to_put_my_roommate_in_her_place/	AITAH for trying to put my roommate in her place?
d5czazkc	Very quick story  I (16M) have had braces now for 4 years (Covid and other related issues) and throughout that time my orthodontist has been very nasty towards me and lied about how long I have left on my treatment   Today I went and he commented on my brushing being poor. Ik i haven’t been doing it as often as I should but I haven’t been in the right shape mentally and it slips my mind sometimes to go and brush my teeth. I tried to explain this to him and said I would improve but he laughed and this and started making nasty remarks about how I don’t forget to get changed or open my eyes in the morning and I couldn’t take it much longer and snapped at him. I said “I came to have a brace checked and not to be made to be an idiot’ ‘ I have had a rough past few weeks with various family and friend issues combined with the pressure of school’ He didn’t say anything and did what he needed to do. As I was leaving he muttered to keep the same time for my next appointment. At this point I began to wonder if I was maybe the a-hole and it hasn’t sat right with me all day so AITA? Edit:I feel i look like I can’t take criticism and so that’s why I think I may have been an a-hole Edit 2: Id like to make it clear that I did brush my teeth twice a day expect for the time between this appointment and the last (approximately 2 months). I haven’t always been like this	1643128679.0	schtzk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/schtzk/aita_for_getting_mad_at_my_orthodontist/	AITA for getting mad at my Orthodontist
j0ellhmp	Throwaway account due to work related AITA post. I'm also on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.  A brief background - I (33f) am a senior manager and preparing to take over from one of the directors and take on their role.   Three months ago, I accepted the resignation of one of my staff members (29m), wished them well and prepared their exit interviews with HR. I had been having problems with him for a 6 months period. I'd given him a payrise (2% increase to his salary), however he had claimed this was not enough and he was looking to at least go up by 10%.  I had previously told him to put together a case which showcased why he was entitled to more pay. I would review it and make a decision. Its worth noting that I do this with all my staff and we discuss formally pay related queries and this exercise allows me to see this from my staff's point of view.  Instead of doing as I asked, the staff member began posting reviews about the company and why we are bad to work for, including how we do not value colleagues and will not pay them for additional work (which is not true for my team).  As the colleague had raised other issues with HR, which he also commented on the reviews, we knew where this had come from. As this was supposed to be an anonymous review, we couldn't bring this up with him.  As he hadn't got a further pay rise on the back of his conversations with me, he decided it would be in his best interest to do minimal work, resulting in me taking on some of his workload along with another member of my staff, this was so profitability of the business didn't drop.  Now to the AH issues -  The day after I accepted the resignation of my staff member, I got a message on Facebook from his GF, telling me how much of an AH I was as I'd ruined their chances of buying a house as I'd accepted his resignation.  I clarified that I hadn't fired him, he had resigned of his own will.  It turns out, he had handed in his resignation, thinking I would have offered him more money to stay. He didn't have another job to go into.  He too, called me an AH, reported me to HR for not offering him extra money to keep him on. Of course HR did nothing of this. He worked his notice and left the company on his leave date.  Yesterday, I got a message,  asking if I would give him his job back. I explained why I wouldn't give him his job back and told him we were not currently recruiting for my team and made a comment that there were always jobs in the call centre he could apply for.  He called me an AH, told me I had ruined his life and he couldn't get another job.  I really don't see myself as the AH here, I'm attempting to ensure the company I work for isn't damaged, and the childish behaviour of "I'll hand in my notice so I get a payrise" really doesn't sit well with me. I'd rather my staff feel like they have earned what they get and feel like they're growing, not just getting handouts.

9pn2pfoe	Am I the asshole for yelling at my ex friend in public after he ruined a gift? I(F16) had known my ex friend(M16) for about 3 years and we used to be extremely close until he started talking about me behind my back. He would always tell people how much of a bitch I am, how unbearable it was to be around me, and how I was stupid because I’m not religious. I cut him off a few months ago but I ran into him last week when he was with my other friends.   I tried to be polite and asked him how he was and he said he was moving to the other side of the country. I told him I was happy for him and that that was exciting, but he just looked at me shocked. He told me he was surprised that I wasn’t begging him to stay like the rest of our mutual friends did, and I just laughed it off thinking he was being by funny. He then tried to grab a card out of my hand, the card being a long hand written letter/gift for my boyfriend. He grabbed the card from me and threw it to one of his friends who crumpled it, stepped on it, and ran off with it.   I got super pissed and started yelling at him when his friend came back around the corner with the letter, totally crumpled with shoe marks on it. I snatched the card and started walking away but yelled at him, “and you wonder why i’m not begging you to stay”. I haven’t seen or talked to him since, but one of our mutual friends contacted me telling me I was being an asshole and that I hurt his feelings by saying that. She told me that I was being a bitch and that even though we aren’t friends, I could have at least been nice to him because he’s going through a hard time leaving his friends. She also told me that “your letter is replaceable, but a friend like him isn’t so you need to apologize”.   I feel like what I said is completely justified and that he deserved it, but need to know am I the asshole?	1643129358.0	sci3b6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sci3b6/aitah_for_yelling_at_my_ex_friend_in_public_after/	AITAH for yelling at my ex friend in public after he ruined a gift?
j0gaik8j	So, by way of scene setting - my (32F) wife (28F) and I live around the corner from my MIL/FIL. We see them often and we all get along great. Last week, my SIL (wife's sister) had surgery to repair a torn ACL and was due home from hospital Friday. We (FIL/MIL, wife, and I) planned to drop by together on Saturday to say hi and help her husband around the house so he could focus on taking care of her. Saturday afternoon my MIL texts me saying we should bring dinner when we go round so they don't have to cook. I agree fully and tell her my wife and I will be by later and we can decide what to bring them.   I arrived to in-laws before my wife and asked MIL what we were thinking for dinner, mentioning a takeaway might be easiest. My MIL told me not to be silly, and that she had food she planned to take them from a small party she hosted the previous Sunday night. She said it was perfect because she had made too much food and she could finally get rid of it. This is where potential AH moment #1 arises: I have NO issue with leftovers, but at this point the food she was referring to was 6 days old. Without thinking I said, "Isn't the point to make things easier for them? We should take them something fresh that will last an additional few days." My FIL jumped in here saying "takeaway curry did sound nice" (classic FIL comment, tbh). My MIL became slightly irritated and said again that she had made too much and wanted to get rid of it. I relented and just said OK, but maintained I thought it was somewhat impolite. I also informed her that I was personally not interested in eating the leftovers and would find something else to eat and she was perfectly fine with that.   We arrived to BIL/SIL's and my MIL went to reheat the leftovers and this is where potential AH moment #2 arises: My BIL noticed I was putting in a deliveroo order to arrive to my/wife's house for when we got home (since, again, I was not interested in the leftovers) and asked if I would put in an order for him as well. Eventually SIL caught on and asked me to order for her too. When my MIL realised this, she became extremely upset, saying I had not only wasted food but undermined her. I apologised but reminded her I'd told her I planned to order food and she hadn't cared, and that I wasn't going to turn down my BIL and SIL when they were asking. She and my FIL left shortly after. It's Tuesday now and I've heard through my FIL that MIL "isn't as mad," but has been asking why I would "go out of my way to embarrass her." My wife, SIL, and FIL are all remaining completely neutral and my BIL (even though he ASKED me to order him food!) says I am TA. For additional context, it was not a cost consideration, as my MIL and FIL both still work and make 6 figure salaries. I am genuinely wondering, AITA???	1643129421.0	sci469	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sci469/aita_for_ordering_food/	AITA for ordering food?
8dpdh88o	So my parents [in their 50s] and I [20f] are at a bit of an impasse.  Essentially, I did a gap year and am now in my first year of university. All throughout the gap year I worked at a friend's business, doing twilight shift- usually clocking off at 11pm or midnight. My co-workers became my best friends.  Many of my co-workers have multiple jobs, one in the morning, and one doing late shifts with me. We all have different days off as well, so this means our only time to socialise as a group is after work. Slowly it became habit for us all to hang out after closing up, for a couple of hours, so I'd be coming home at 2 or 3am.  My parents began to take issue with this, or specifically my mum. My dad doesn't care but says I should just listen to what my mother says about the matter. Basically she became unhappy with my staying out late, and put a curfew on me, saying that I have to come home straight after work except on weekends- when I can stay out until 1am or occasionally 2am.  Now, it's not that I wake her up when I come in, I'm dead quiet coming in. Her issue is that she worries about me. She says she can't sleep properly / keeps waking up and checking I'm back, until I'm home.  I feel that I am an adult and should be allowed independence, especially given that my brother, who is 21, is allowed to stay out as long as he wants (though he is a bit of a shut in and doesn't go out much). My mum's answer to this is that I'm a girl so she worries about me more and it keeps her awake at night, and it's unfair & selfish to disrupt her sleep patterns like that. I genuinely don't want her to not be getting sleep but I find it very frustrating that this impinges on my social life. I've had to miss out on certain celebrations like friends' birthdays. Also, when I come in, if I try to make dinner or eat anything in the fridge, the noise wakes them up and it annoys them. So I can only eat dinner with my friends, or at 3pm before my shift and be starving.  My friends would always tell me not to worry about it when I had to leave early, and when I was upset about the curfew, they reassured me that my mum would probably chill out once I went to university.  My first term went great, and I came back and started again at my job. However my mum warned me straight away that the curfew was still in effect.  It was such a shame because I really love my friends and want to be able to spend more time with them. Every time I argue about the curfew though, my mum says I'm being unreasonable and shouts at me calling me selfish (she is the kind that always shouts in an argument, I am more of an angry-crier, and I get flustered and can't hold up my own argument).  Sorry for the long-winded post, I just wanted to give all the context. Am I being an asshole/selfish for asking that I'm allowed to stay out without a curfew?  EDIT: I offered to pay them rent, but they refused and said they'd rather have rules/control than have rent money.	1643129657.0	sci7cj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sci7cj/aita_for_asking_my_parents_not_to_put_a_curfew_on/	AITA for asking my parents not to put a curfew on me?
638ynkpc	My roommate, let's call him Hank, owns the house. When I moved in a few months ago, he told me to park my car in the driveway and his truck can handle sitting in the grass.  Well, my car needs work and the inspection expired 2 months ago. Since then, Hank has been nagging me about the car. 3 weeks ago, he told me I have 2 weeks to get it registered or sell it or he'll start charging me a storage fee.  Well, 1 week into that 2 week block, my brother offered to pay to get the car fixed up so my sister could use it. Hank is aware of this development and seemed chill with it when I brought it up. I'm taking the car back and forth to the mechanic while I order parts. But now Hank acts like he needs an update on every piece of work! He keeps nagging me about getting the registration updated.  When I yelled at him yesterday about what the problem is, I asked if it's a property value thing. All I got was "You've had an unregistered car in my driveway for 2 months!" And again a question about a timeline on the car. When I told him I just need a tail light replaced before taking it to get inspected, he accepted that answer.  But am I missing something??? Does a stupid registration sticker bring rainbows and unicorns? The car is gonna sit in the driveway with or without the renewed sticker until I get it to my sister either way! (I use a different car parked in the street, which Hank is fine with. And again, he offered the use of the driveway anyway, so it's not like it's an extra burden?) There's no concern about a ticket since the car is in the driveway. Now, I could see if Hank was gonna get the house appraised or something and he needs to car to be "legal". But otherwise, what the heck is the difference? Am I somehow taking advantage of him?	1643129805.0	sci9be	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sci9be/aita_for_yelling_at_my_roommate_because_he_keeps/	AITA for yelling at my roommate because he keeps nagging me about my car?
9gciulvh	So I’m a 15 year old trans man and my friend also 15 and non-binary says that I mansplain. I really don’t think I do but now I’m worried I do it unintentionally and if it’s determined I do mansplain I would appreciate some advice on how to avoid it thanks! So for context me and my friend are on our high school alpine ski racing team and are both really good skiers. Last week we were both at a race and it was my first and their second. When we were going up the lift to get a warm up run in I pointed out a beginner and said they were way back seat in their skiing (they were another racer Ik this because they were wearing a bib) my friend looked over and thought I was pointing at someone else and said “oh no they’re just pizza-ing to stop” I said “oh Ik they’re just doing that to stop I was pointing at someone else not them” then my friend and another girl we were riding up with said I was mansplaining and was confused and asked how I was mansplaining and they didn’t really explain instead my friend said “you mansplain a lot actually” now even more confused I was like “really? I don’t mean to can you please give me an example of a time I’ve done it?” And they mentioned that when we were in the car driving over that I had explained the race to them when they were the one who had been to one before when I hadn’t. Now I think they were referring when I mentioned that I was happy the coach was giving me two runs instead of only one because I’m jv and most other jv skiers only got 1 run because they were sharing a bib and my friend said that is a GS race so everyone gets two runs and I just explained to them what I explained above. It’s important to note that the race they were in was only varsity and there was no jv.   Sorry if this is a bit confusing I’m on mobile. So Reddit am I the mansplaining asshole? If you don’t think I have enough info just ask questions in the comments and I’ll do my best to answer them.	1643129961.0	scibbc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scibbc/aita_for_maybe_mansplaining/	AITA for maybe mansplaining?
560x046f	I babysit a one year old who just stood up on her own from the sitting position for the first time to my knowledge. I was videoing because my daughter was copying her putting her butt in the air with her hands on the ground and I thought it was so cute. All of a sudden the one year old stands up and takes two steps, which are her first independent steps that I know of.   I feel so bad because I witnessed her crawling for the first time but played it off when they told me she crawled at home that I’d never seen her do it before. Now I’ve seen her stand up and walk by herself for the first time as well and I’m not sure if I feel more guilty for witnessing it or for keeping it to myself.   I don’t want her to feel bad for not being with her child and missing these firsts, but since I got it on video I thought maybe she would want to see it.   So, WIBTA if I send her the video of her kid taking her first steps or WIBTA if I kept to myself and acted surprised when she tells me tomorrow morning that she started walking at home and I knew all along that she had already walked before?	1643130298.0	scifwd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scifwd/wibta_if_i_didnt_tell_the_mom_her_child_took/	WIBTA if I didn’t tell the mom her child took their first steps while in my care?
i5vg7hoh	It’s a long story, but I (naively) opened an account for a cell phone in my name for my long-term boyfriend. He has bad credit so it would’ve been a hassle for him. He transfers me the money for it, but it always takes some nagging.   We live together and he’s in college, but since the semester is remote, he went home to family (out of the country) since it made more sense. I’m paying the entirety of our rent, bills, etc.   I cancelled the account and paid the final bill ($420) since he won’t be able to use the phone when he’s abroad. The bill was higher than normal since the remaining balance on the phone had to be paid off.  That was almost 3 months ago. He’s constantly said he’s going to re-pay me but still hasn’t. He’s financially supported by his family, and says money is tight for them since they’re building a house. Mind you, they have enough money to send him abroad for school and pay thousands in  tuition/ living expenses.   Meanwhile, I have no family support, work two jobs, and am now carrying the burden of our rent and other bills all by myself since he’s not getting any money from his parents while at home. I’ve emphasized money is especially tight for me because of that.   The last straw was that he gave me a specific date he’d pay the phone bill by, and now it’s been a week since that deadline passed. We’re heading towards a break-up (for other reasons), and I don’t think he has an intention of paying the bill anytime soon, especially if we break-up.  **Now, I’ve told him if he doesn’t pay the bill in two weeks, I’m going to start selling some of the things he’s left in the apartment** (PS4, T.V., some designer clothing). He lost it when I told him that, and said I’m crazy and he'll take action against me if I do it (whatever that means).  Does that make me an asshole, or am I in the right?	1643130372.0	scigv8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scigv8/aita_for_threatening_to_sell_my_bfs_stuff_if_he/	AITA For Threatening To Sell My BF's Stuff If He Doesn't Repay Me?
j0d14yjg	My husband goes on a lot of business trips. The thing is, these trips are nothing like what you would expect from a business trip. They’re more like being on vacation and a lot of the times the people he goes to see are old friends of his/his family so things are super relaxed and casual.  He mentioned he was leaving for another trip tomorrow while we were having dinner with both our families. I joked that he was so lucky he got to go on so many vacations and we should trade places. Everybody laughed it off, including him.  When we got home, though, he was upset over what I said. He told me these trips were business and he wasn’t just leaving me home alone for fun. The situation escalated more than it needed to and he ended up still being upset with me when he left.

6ot8xs0c	This happened over the weekend but first the back story: I (30 female) grew up in a small town in South Africa along with 8 other friends( all between 29 - 33years old now) . 7 of us were really good friends. There were fields and even a small river and trees where we often played together. The 8th kid, a boy (lets call him Arno) didnt quite fit in with the rest of us. He didn't want to share, cried easily. Didnt want to play our games. He always lied to the adults about us. He often rated us out and he had this habit of calling his mom who would come find us and yell at us if we didn't want to play what ever game he wants to play. He kept falling on the ground and yelling when ever he lost a game. We told the adults we didnt want to play with him, however our parents and teachers didnt want to hear it and always forced us to take him with just so he could run and call his mom to yell at us. Soon we started running away and hiding and even being mean to him. We really wanted him not to like us so that he would leave us alone on his own. One of the boys (lets call him Theo) pushed Arno over. Theo also hid Arno's bike a few times so that we can drive off without Arno following us.... The past weekend we were all invited to a braai to catch up. One of the girls from our group has a younger sister who is now dating Arno... We didnt know and she brought him with. Arno started early to talk about how hard it was to always being bullied as  a kid and how bullying can cause long term damage and the suffering and pain he endured his entire childhood at our hands... So we all appologized. As the night progressed however  he just kept going on and on about the torture we put him through. At about 23:00 I just snapped. Its been hours and he was still going. So I told him 90% of the time it is terrible but in his case he deserved it. I recalled how he told his mom we broke his toy trucks (he broke them) and we all got hidings. I recalled how he threw a fit and knocked his head and he told his mom we threw a ball at him and we all got hidings... Anyway he stormed out and now my friend's sister is calling me an asshole and saying there is no excuse for bullying. The adults are mad at us saying we are big and we need to grow up. Everyone is kind of split and half of the people involve is saying I am the asshole for not letting it go. But I feel he needed to hear it. Am I the Asshole?	1643130808.0	scimlj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scimlj/aita_for_telling_a_guy_he_deserved_to_be_bullied/	AITA for telling a guy he deserved to be bullied.
253els7v	 Context: Me (m28) and my gf (f26) have been together for a year and 3 months, but we've been best friends for almost 7 years and she's the light of my life. She's the most charismatic, intelligent and empathic person I know (this are some of her many things I admire about her) but she was raised by a narcissistic parent and sometimes she has confidence issues. We live in México, so sorry for the language and if the amounts seem too low.  She's been working in logistics sales since I met her on college and she's really good at what she does, but for the last 6 months she landed a job in a logistic company but she hasn't been able to reach her goals on work, so her base salary is 475 usd a month.  She's constantly struggling to reach ends meet, and since I found a job that isn't 100% commission based I've been helping her here and there with some bills and debts that she has. She always tells me she's going to pay me next month but she never does and I'm okay with it, we are a team and we are working on moving in together. The reason she doesn't make end meet is because every time she gets paid suddenly her family wants to see her and go out to eat, shit like that, because the mom is pursuing a career being an influencer and she doesn't have any income.   The issue: Today she calls me and tells me that she got a loan for the bank for 4000 usd and she has 48 months, to pay for it, and tells me what she'll do with the money and what debts she will pay (she maxed out 2 credit cards which adds up tu 900 usd and owes some loved ones some money, like 100 usd each)she told me that with her commissions she will pay the loan easily, at the end of it she asked for my opinion, at the beginning I didn't wanted to tell her because it wasn't positive but she insisted.  This is the part where I might be the asshole, I told her it was the worst idea I've heard, where is she supposed to get the 120 usd a month if she's always struggling to reach end meet and after paying for groceries, going out with her family and paying the bills. She doesn't have a penny for the rest of the two weeks? Plus interests and fees, she doesn't have a way of paying for the loan and if she's counting on a variable source of income to pay the loan she's going to suffer even more.  After I told her. She says to me that i didn't have to make her less (what?) And make her feel stupid and that she's not good at her work (MAYOR WHAT?), that I'm always wearing her her down and making her feel stupid, even though its completely the opposite all the time, and that she doesn't want to speak to me anymore. So now she's giving me the cold shoulder for a couple of hours. So let me have it reddit, AITA?	1643131239.0	scisiv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scisiv/aita_for_telling_my_gf_shes_making_a_big_mistake/	AITA for telling my GF she's making a big mistake?
4flhwvhn	I (19M) have a quite difficult familiar relationship, specially with my parents. Both my father and my mother (39) never cared much about me and I was raised by my grandma and my great grandma (from my mom's side).  My mother keeps making terrible life decisions which always leads to disaster in our lives (like taking loans from the bank and not paying). 4 years ago, my mother decided that It would be a great Idea to move out of my grandma's house to marry a older Man (54) she just met and, brought me (then 15) along.   Thing is, she manipulated me and made me believe my grandma never cared about me and was just helping raising me because It was her duty, not because she loved me and I believed her.   Life was hard while I stayed there as she claimed we were in a hard situation and had to save money to pay the bills. She started selling MY things without my consent and spent the child support money my father paid to "buy food".  That annoyed me but I didn't want to be a problem so I didn't complain.   However, my mom and step father started to throw barbecue parties every weekend for their church and that pissed me off a lot.  I had to go to School with no lunch and winter wear because in theory we couldn't afford It.  Later that year, she got pregnant and I lost my shit. She wanted to ***start a Family*** with my step father, at this point It became clear they didn't Care about the money problems at all and were using me to their own gain.  I talked to my grandma a told her I couldn't keep living with my mother and Said I was Sorry for bothering her and promised to don't cause problems. She said she was worried and that my mom's story about she not loving me was BS and that she was also deceived.  I moved out my mother's house and came back to my grandma's house, where I am currently living while in college.   My grandma deals with my mother's problems and even gave them a house for her, step-father and brother to live in since they didn't pay the bills and lost their house.   This morning  my grandma told me she had to talk to me about something important: my mother needed money to pay for her new drivers license (In my country, they need to be revalidated and If they expire, you have up to TEN YEARS to put things in Order, otherwise you have to make a new one and it's expensive) my mother just didn't solve the situation and my grandma can't pay for It because of her own expenses to pay  so she asked me If I'm willing to help my mom.  Even tough I love my grandma and would burn the World down for her I straight up refused.I'm currently saving money for college, and have to perform two minor cirurgical procedures (which even tough are not serious/life threatening  may cause problems). I also need my own driving license.   Now my grandma is hearth broken and even tough she says otherwise, I know I pissed her off.  AITA for not wanting to  my grandma to support my mother?   Feel free to ask anything about the situation.	1643131301.0	scitel	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scitel/aita_for_not_helping_my_mom_out/	AITA for not helping my mom out?
suqz7l2	My entire life, my parents have made promises to pay for my wedding. As early as middle school, I remember my dad joking to his friends about when he can retire from his job because he has to save up for his two daughters' weddings. I tried to discuss budgets with them in February of 2020 while we were on vacation together and they reiterated that they'll pay for my wedding, full stop. I asked if I had a smaller wedding if I could have the remainder of the budget and they said, no, they'll pay for my wedding. I asked what my budget was and they said that we'd discuss it when the time came. In August of 2020 and onwards, I had been mentioning that my now-fiancé and I were discussing engagement because he was trying to see what the break-even point was for refinancing his townhouse. So they have had plenty of warning.  But when I got engaged last month and told them what the average cost of a wedding in my state is, it's apparently more than double what they spent on my sister's wedding. So they said they can only afford to spend on me what they spent on her.   A bit of background info: My parents paid for all of my sister's (public, in-state) college that wasn't covered by her small scholarships or my grandparents small contribution. I did not go to college, and my grandparents gave me the money (a few thousand) they had saved for my college. My parents didn't give me my college fund in any way, they just rolled it into their retirement. My sister got married 7+ years ago, literally days after her college graduation, in a rural area 3 hours west from where my parents lived in our hometown city, but it was where her husband's family is and where they settled. I was living a 5 hour plane ride away at the time. Over the next few years, Dad retired, I moved back home, and then I moved a 5 hours drive north. My mom then retired too and my parents moved 3 hours west to be near my sister when she started having her kids.  My parents can definitely afford to contribute more. They take a big vacation every year - cruises, road trips, theme parks for 10 days at a time. They've been commenting that they can't travel "this" year because they have to pay for a wedding, but they're already planning trips for 2023 & 2024.  So I told them that they've told me for years now that my sister got all expenses paid for through 22 years old, but I've been on my own financially since I was 18 because she “made different choices in life” (to go to college). Well, these were my choices in life: to marry a white collar man in a city in 2022 at 29, instead of a blue collar man in the country in 2015 at 22. Why is it equity for her (each receives according to their needs) but equality for me (they’ll only spend on my wedding what they spent on hers)? Based on that discussion, they upped their contribution somewhat, but my fiancé and I will still be responsible for about $10k. AITA for still being bitter every time I look at my wedding budget because it feels like favoritism to me?	1643132328.0	scj7no	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scj7no/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_pay_for_my_entire/	AITA for wanting my parents to pay for my entire wedding?
j0hp63lx	My(20m) mother has always been very emotionally unavailable towards me. I am the oldest and she had me at 15 so I think deep down she somewhat resents me because my birth changed all of her future plans, but she and my dad stuck it out and mostly I had a very normal childhood. I have 2 younger brothers 17 and 13, and my mother shows obvious favoritism towards my youngest brother(although she will deny it until she dies). When it comes to me and my brother(17) she doesn't hug us, rarely says I love you, and is just generally uninterested in our lives and accomplishments. She does provide for us as well as our dad so I try to be grateful.  I got with my gf 3 years ago when we were both in HS. When we graduated she went off to college and I took a gap year which turned into multiple due to the pandemic. We were pretty long distance all of last year, but this year she tries to make it back every other weekend, or I go to her, but mostly she comes to me so she can also see her family. When she visits she pretty much always stays with me at my parents place. My parents are fine with this because they see me and her as adults and as long as we're safe they don't mind. My mom likes my gf okay, she isn't overly excited when she comes over and used to say some shady things about her when she wasn't around, but after me and my dad talked to her about it she stopped. I have noticed however that my mother acts very strangely towards me and my brothers when my gf is staying over.  For example my girlfriend and I will be sitting in the living room watching tv and cuddling and my mom will come in and interrupt and start messing around "playfully" like ticking me and trying to hug on me while I am still cuddling with my gf. And then if she see us around the house she will come over and try and hug on me and kiss on me like she is just "playing around". Like I said, my mother never touches us really so this is extremely strange for her. Apparently she does the same to my brother(17), but only when my gf is around. My gf and brother(17) get along really well and will sometimes hang out and even my brother has noted our mothers strange behavior. I didn't honestly think she was behaving this way because of my gf until one day I mentioned her strange behavior to my gf and when I said my mother didn't do it when she wasn't there she said that perhaps it was because of her and honestly that's when things started to really click. Since then my mother's behavior really bothers me.  I won't lie, I've always wished my mother would be more affectionate especially after seeing how well she bonded with my youngest brother, but I feel like her behavior is manipulative. I talked to my dad about it because he knows how me and my other brother feel about our mothers lack of emotional availability, but he said I was just being ungrateful and that I shouldn't assume her behavior has ulterior motives and basically "isn't this what you've always wanted?"	1643132765.0	scjdsa	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjdsa/aita_for_assuming_my_mothers_behavior_has/	AITA for assuming my mother's behavior has ulterior motives when she acts affectionate towards me around my gf?
e11ftvgx	So my Dad (48M) is a good husband and a dad or at least better than a lot of other dads I know.  He is the type of person to not sit idle he likes to take all kinds of extra work and that leads him to be busy and his mind being occupied a lot. Recently He had some issues in his corporate job and also in this community that he was leading naturally he remained pissed all the time and would snap at my mom. Yesterday he was screaming at me because I told him to take out printouts for my project and he took the print of all the slides even though I told him not to and he got mad at me instead for wasting his money.  He does this quite often and get's mad when he's stressed and whines a lot about how much work he has and how it's so difficult and bcs we're family he can take out his anger on us. Yesterday was the last straw for me and I told him to go to therapy so that his stress is reduced. he got really mad at me for suggesting that (he thinks therapy is for the weak-minded I've told him he's wrong but his ego is too big to accept that) He told me that if "people" would mind their own business it would be good.  He is a good dad and he loves me a lot. His family is very toxic and his being very close to his brother who encourages him to do this plus the fighting increases his stress even more.	1643132891.0	scjfj8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjfj8/aita_for_telling_my_dad_to_go_to_therapy/	AITA for telling my dad to go to therapy?
49ltf79o	Obligatory on mobile so sorry for formatting. Title sounds bad. Let me explain. There’s no animal abuse or anything going on, I swear.   After covid hit, I was forced to move back in with my parents to save money. I’d had a dog for almost 5 years, starting before I ever moved out. He was my best friend. While living with my folks, I ended up getting pregnant so it’s now them, myself (24F), both of their dogs, my dog, and my son.   After my son was born, my dog started showing some signs of jealousy and he would use the bathroom inside from time to time. I always cleaned up after him and made sure to take him out as much as possible between taking care of my baby. Apparently, this wasn’t enough. My parents gave me an ultimatum: either the dog goes or I go (without my son.) I have nowhere to go, and I’ll be damned if they force custody of my son just because they don’t like my dog.   I tried and tried to get them to change their mind, going as far as leaving my poor dog shut up in my room for most of the day. It wasn’t enough. My dad gave me the weekend to get rid of him or “he would do it himself.” So, as devastated as I was, I found my poor pup a new home. Thankfully, I can still check on him and visit him from time to time. But it’s not the same.   Now, about their dogs. There’s one senior dog that’s mean, and he’s already snapped at my son twice, but my dad doesn’t believe me because he hasn’t seen it happen. This elderly dog still pees and poops in the house, but I always cleaned up after him as well, so they didn’t see it or blamed it on my dog. There’s another dog that lives outside and he doesn’t bother much but obviously needs to be fed every day.   After I had to rehome my dog, I told them I would no longer be responsible for their dogs. I wouldn’t feed, let out, or really have anything to do with these dogs, and if the senior dog snapped at my son again, whether they were there to witness it or not, I would be leaving and taking my son with me to a friend’s house until they got rid of the dog. Obviously, they blew up and tried to tell me it was still my responsibility to take care of their dogs.   Both of them work, I don’t at the moment because of no childcare, so I compromised and said I would make sure they were fed and walked while my parents were at work, but other than that, I release all responsibility for these dogs. They’re still pissed at me. AITA?	1643133234.0	scjk6w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjk6w/aita_for_refusing_to_take_care_of_my_parents_dogs/	AITA for refusing to take care of my parents’ dogs?

She's the total opposite, a social butterfly and literally the type of person who will tell you her whole life story the second you talk to her. She studies communication and has a this dream of being and influencer. Anyways, my sister has a tiktok account while I do not. I have temporal accounts sometimes but they are private, only use them to watch funny videos and never upload anything.  Yesterday my sister said something to me alone the lines of "Omg I'm so famous now, I almost hit 40k followers because of a video that went viral". I was like, that's cool! I searched her profile because I wanted to see the video. Turns out it was a video of her making fun of my dad's death. Our dad died in 2018 and I know it's been hard for the whole family, she copes with humor and I would have been reluctantly okay with it if she had not followed up with a video of her literally airing the whole situation and how he died in public. That video had like 200k likes.  I was so angry and uncomfortable because I hate it when she does that and think it's only her decision to make, it was a situation that affected me too and she knows I hate it when strangers know things like that. I was venting to a friend and I said "I don't know why she's such an attention whore". My friend then said I was being too mean and shouldn't call my sister names or be that mad just because I don't agree. I don't think I'm in the wrong here, it's not like I said it to her face or anything. But maybe I am wrong and I need to respect that her personality is just like that.

iy6uaw37	My (34 F) life is a mess. I was in the closet for a long time cause I got pregnant when I was 18 and was codependent on my ex. I never wanted kids with my ex but I couldn't just abort my son. I wasn't unhappy and I loved my ex but not like he loved me and I wasn't whole and two years ago after I realized I was falling for Emilia (46) at work I knew I had to end it. But coming out broke my family and that hurt my son. After I left my son hated seeing me and then stopped. I knew he'd come around he just needed time.  Things with Emilia got better and we got engaged and last year she had a health scare and we decided to just get married. My son still hadn't called me and I tried to get a message but his family blocked me. I didn't want to get married without my son there but I Emilia pointed out how scared she was. I chose us cause I didn't want to lose her too. We got married in a small restriction based ceremony and other than the day my son was born it was the best day of my life.  Things were going good and two weeks ago my son finally called and it was amazing. When my ex dropped him off I finally got my baby back. When he cried for not seeing me for so long getting to calm him and hold him was the best cause I got to be his mom again. He said he wanted to stay with me as much as possible. It was going so well he was so happy when I showed him the room we would turn into his. But then he saw my wedding portrait and broke down again apologizing for not being there for me. I got him to calm down again and told him we'd have a real ceremony on our anniversary and he'd be my star. I don't ever want him to feel guilty, he's just a boy.  He'll be coming over this week after his exams are done and we'll design his room. But I can't get how sad he was about my wedding out of my head. I told Emilia and her sisters I felt I was wrong for not waiting for my son. It started an argument because they all said I was wrong to bring it up and should just forget it cause I'm acting like an angry cyclops. It's become a point of conflict between us since the weekend. So Reddit, you've helped others decide if they were wrong, AITA on this one?	1643133626.0	scjpmx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjpmx/aita_for_telling_my_wife_my_son_should_have_been/	AITA for telling my wife my son should have been at our wedding?
7ucdbslk	AITA for refusing to let SK get out of school for a trip with a friend and friend’s mom?  Background: SK, 13, has been friends with another kid since kindergarten, and they met through their mothers. I’m the stepparent in this situation, but for reasons, I do most of the day-to-day parenting.   Anyway, SK asked if she could go on a trip that would see her out of school for two days. This trip is to a city 6 hours away with her friend and friend’s mom. She has not seen friend for some time, as friend has been in and out of mental health facilities, and sometimes is sent to live with her father in another state. A couple of months ago, she talked my SK into posting so concerning things on TikTok about her mental health in an attempt to get my SO and I to commit her so the two could be in the juvenile psych ward together. My SK is in no way mentally ill, although she is in therapy because her birth mom and her household is homophobic and SK is, well, gay. I’ve never met this other kid, but she has not given me any reason to think she’s a good friend.   I have also never met the mom, but what little I know of her is that she lost her professional license for theft, although apparently she has claimed it was all her bf at the time’s fault. Also, she is friends with SK’s biomom, and anything SK tells her, she tells BM, and then SK gets an earful from BM. And SO is not a fan of the mom, either.  AITA for refusing to let SK take 2 days off school to go on a trip with these two people? She is upset with me for saying no.	1643133643.0	scjpzl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjpzl/aita_for_refusing_my_sk_the_chance_to_see_her/	AITA for refusing my SK the chance to see her friend?
h2qd94dt	So one of my online friends of 5 years and I decided to finally meet in person. I decided that I was going to drive to her, which would have been a 5 hour drive and required me to cross the border (I'm from Canada). We planned on meeting up in a major city near where she lives. We planned the trip for over a month and booked our airbnb and tickets to museums. I had even booked the time off. We were both super excited to finally meet and I was really looking forward to this trip.   Now. One of my friends (who I only met a few months before - we'll call her Maya) created a group chat where it was just me, her, and some other new friend of hers  (we'll call her Emily) which I had not yet met in person. Maya said she would love for us to go on a girls' trip and asked when we should visit (X city I'm visiting). I told her that I'm going in a month, and that I'd invite them, but this is a special trip I planned alone with a friend. That's when Emily piped up and asked if they could ''hitch a ride'' with me and do their own thing. I was a bit taken aback by her basically inviting herself when I hadn't even met her in person. They offered to chip in for gas. I was very hesitant, just because I wasn't expecting guests at all and I did not feel like having people with me on the 5 hour journey there and back. I really was looking forward to a solo roadtrip. But then the both of them kept pushing, mostly Maya, promising that they'd leave my friend and I alone and we can just part ways when we get there. They said it will be cheaper for me if I bring them along since they'll help with gas. I honestly would have preferred to go alone even if I do have to pay for all the gas myself. I just didn't understand why they couldn't go with Emily's car since she had a car herself, but I ultimately agreed to drive them. I figured I was being an asshole, because there really is no logical reason to not drive them there if I'm already going there anyway and they promised not to interfere with my trip with my friend.   But as the date of the trip approached, Emily once again asked me to confirm if I'm still 100% going and suggested we all rent a cottage and have a ''girls trip''. I had already explained to them both that this is most definitely not a trip that they are included in, that I was simply going to drive them there. I ended up coming up with the perfect excuse - I explained that coming into Canada, we all need to provide proof of a negative PCR test, which can sometimes take days for people to receive their tests and I cannot risk being held back if they receive delayed results because I have to get home on time for work. I suggested that they can still go with Emily's car. Emily suddenly was no longer interested in going because the ''weather would be shitty''. Just 5 seconds ago she wanted to have a ''girls trip''.   AITA? Should I have just been a generous friend and driven them there when I'm going there anyway and they even offered to pay for gas?	1643133727.0	scjr8q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjr8q/aita_for_not_wanting_to_drive_my_friends_to_a/	AITA for not wanting to drive my friends to a place I was already going to?
y4ak7	This is a much more complicated situation than at first blush, so here we go…  I was hired recently as a department head for a small startup company. They have had a head of this department, but hired me to replace this woman because she just wasn’t capable of being a department lead. She was (allegedly) told of her deficiencies prior to my coming on, that I was being brought in specifically to fix issues and prepare our department for rapid growth. She is retaining a pseudo-leadership role as a “lead,” but in name only.  I have been reviewing the work done and I can’t begin to describe how poor she’s been doing. The rest of the department actively ignores what she has to say, she gives incorrect information to customers and colleagues, she has no idea how to do even basic day analysis required for the position, and doesn’t even appear to care to learn what she doesn’t know.  Worst of all, because she’s been doing the job, they have her training me. She has scheduled a 6 week “transition period” while she teaches me how she has done the job. I’m not even 2 weeks in and can already see how much of a roadblock she has become to everyone in her orbit. She believes she is being considered for an “in person support specialist” role that does t exist, and there doesn’t appear to be any plans on creating in the next 5 years, which makes me worried she is either delusional or in denial about her position in the company.  We are on boarding a new entry-level person in the department at the same time, and she is in charge of training the new guy, as well. I’m honestly concerned she is going to damage the newbie with bad information, based on what she has tried to train me to do so far. Would I be the asshole for putting her in her place now before there was a power struggle later?	1643134163.0	scjxh3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjxh3/wibta_for_telling_my_coworker_she_is_incompetent/	WIBTA for telling my coworker she is incompetent?
j0guq221	So i (27f) have been dating Derek (30th) for a year now and moved in together 3 months ago, i am in charge on laundry and cleaning the apartment while derek is in charge with cooking, grocery and taking the trash out, our relationship goes well and nothing seems to be a problem, or so i thought  You see, i won't say i'm the cleanest person or basically i am clean, yes i clean the whole apartment yes and do laundry yes, but i'm actually quite a lazy person  I take a shower every 3 days, sometimes i would be almost a week (but i wash my hair with water in between those days to avoid it being smelly) and usually it takes me one hour, and also i don't change my tshirt every day or week, as long as it doesn't smell in my opinion i don't plan on changing it, well ofc after 2 or 3 weeks i would change it (even tho it doesn't smell bad) ofc i do change my pants, mostly once a week, and definitley i change underwear ofc, once or twice a day it depends, especially after coming home from outside, but i don't change my bras often,i only change them once in a month (do not worry, it doesn't smell since i put deodorant under my chest)  When i start my menstrual, i don't Take a shower, as it causes my mentrual to stop, however i do wash my hair and armpit to avoid the smell, After i finish my menstrual, that's when i change everything, bras, tshirt and pants like everything to start new fresh  I don't see this a problem from the beginning, and i thought it didn't bother my boyfriend at all, however i took a shower early, did all my shower routine, and checked my clothes, i changed my pants after 2 weeks (i have different fabric of pants, there's some that makes me change less than a week, and there's some i can wear for like 2 or 3 weeks without it smells) however i did not change my tshirt or bra, wore my tshirt 2 weeks ago, and wore my bra since december, i'm waiting for my menstrual to come then i can change them all (again, it doesn't smell) i really don't like changing them all and then here comes my mentrual, for some reason it's late, might be the winter  Anyway, my boyfriend came home and noticed that i took a shower and saw my in my same tshirt and scoffed, i was confused and asked if he was having a bad day and he was like "no, not until i saw your dirty tshirt" and complained about how i changed my pants but not my tshirt or bras, i was shocked and tried to explain to him about why but he didn't let me, he called me a dirty woman and told me that i have to change clothes every time i take a shower, i asked him if i smell and he said "no but you still need to change" and told i'm embarrasssing, i refused because i can't stand changing clothes often if it's not necessary in my opinion, he's not talking to me rn  This made me feel bad, i've done this for years and never thought it would affect someone,  i honestly can't stand changing tshirt/bra often, AITA?	1643134160.0	scjxfj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scjxfj/aita_for_refusing_to_change_my_ways_of_clothing/	AITA for refusing to change my ways of clothing?
4v5b06lz	Basically my best friend 16m had a really serious online gf for the better part of last year until they had a realy long and drawn out break up cus he couldnt  break it off.  He knew her from a small discord server (16 people) we are both on and she lives in another country,  she came out as asexual Wich was a bit if a deal breaker for him but he kinda tried to keep it alive for another three months before dumping her.  They're both still super active on the server but he's been taking alot (outside of the server) about how he hates her and she wastes his time  Wich isn't the case hes just making himself the victim, basically he thinks she's a horrible person now for no reason other than he had to end it and I geuss hating her is easier than actually being sad about it?  Anyway he's been taking about other girls and stuff on the server when she's online and it seem kinda insensentive ( worst was Saturday when he got drunk and talked about wanting to kiss like four different girls in one night)  and today he was talking alot about this girl he really likes and how he asked her out.  I wanna know if I should tell him to maybe keep that stuff out of the server to be sensetive or if it's not my place, the other people in the server are really close to both of us and his ex so I feel like he's making it hard for everyone but am I just stiking my nose where it doesn't belong?  If this seem kinda rushed this is the only way I could do it without making it way to long but TL;DR my friend is acting like the victim in his breakup even though he isn't and now he talikg about other girls infront of his ex and i wanna know if I should say smth or stay out of it.	1643134610.0	sck3xg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sck3xg/aita_for_thinking_my_friend_should_avoid_talking/	AITA for thinking my friend should avoid talking about girla front of his ex
9zrbfawx	My SO (M27) and I F(29) are coming up on a year of dating and this issue has come up several times and I’m starting to wonder if I’m being a snob for lack of a better term. This all started early in us dating I was invited to a formal/black tie optional wedding - I wanted to take him as my plus one - but it came up he didn’t own a suit - since there wasn’t that much time and it was early in us dating I let it go and I went alone - had a blast he picked me up all fine- Now a little bit about him - he’s a blue collar jeans and a tshirt guy - loves to be comfortable- his idea of dressing up is a flannel or button down with his jeans and work boots- and most of the time this is fine he’s comfortable works for me- me I like to dress up soemtimes for no reason put on a little extra makeup throw on some heeled boots and sometimes for date night we look very mismatched. It’s totally my choice to dress up because I like to and normally I don’t care what he wears. My issue is this- he owns no dressy clothes at all. I understand maybe not owning a suit but not even a pair of slacks? I mentioned we should go shopping a grab him something just to have so if something comes up it’s not an emergency or a rush. He pushes it off and pushes it off and if I bring it up he talks about buying more jeans. And not dressy jeans or clean looking jean (because jeans can look nice I dress up jeans all the time) but more of the work pants he wears bc he “just wants to be comfortable” and now another situation has come up where his regular clothes just aren’t appropriate, and he’d be my plus one (in about a month . He started complaining  about dress codes and shopping etc. and gone so far as to complain as to why the host put a dress code in place to begin with. Even called the dress code a “bombshell” And I’m again considering just going without him frankly id be embarrassed to have him show up in something very casual especially since this is a family event. And I’m wondering if AITA for wanting to push him to dress nicer when I feel the occasion calls for it ? Is it snobby? I’m starting to feel a little crazy and embarrassed,  A few notes to clarify-   1. we do have some cultural differences - his family is very blue collar (no judgment blue collar is the backbone of America) just that no family is events really call for dressing up My family dresses up more frequently for events though we’re still decidedly middle class 2. When I say dress up I don’t mean designer or expensive. I’m a bargain hunter and frequently buy at tjmaxx, clearance sales etc. and don’t expect him to spend ton of money or re do his whole wardrobe just have something to  grab for when go out someplace really nice or an event comes up  3. He’s not hurting for cash- and I’ve even offered to contribute financially in more than one occasions since it’s my family events he needs to dress up for   AITA?	1643134513.0	sck2ke	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sck2ke/aita_for_insisting_my_so_buy_nicer_clothing/	AITA for insisting my SO buy nicer clothing?
7rfm95vh	In Mar 20, my sister's partner (Mike) moved in with her and her kids to help her after a very nasty divorce that left her financially screwed. He has a tenant but left most of the house empty until Jan 21 when he offered it to me for a well-below market rate. I agreed, and moved in. In March, my housemate (Dave) returned from Poland. He is fundamentally a very good guy but he is very hard to live with due to PTSD from a car accident and him being on the autistic spectrum. Dave demands complete silence after 9pm when he goes to bed (he sends shirty texts when he doesn't get it, like at 9:30pm on Christmas Eve even with whispering and the TV volume so low subtitles have to be on for me to hear). He flips out at the smallest things being out of place. I do my best to fix these but when it gets down to empty bottles in the shower, it becomes a bit excessive. I usually just take the shouting and tantrums, but it is not a good environment and I don't want to live here anymore.  The most recent of these (which was about a 2cm stain on the hob and sticky spot on the counter from the previous evening which took about 10 seconds to clean) also lead to him contacting Mike to complain about me. For context, we pay the same rent and split all bills, but he has been here for 8 years. I left with my partner and dog for the weekend and got an equally shirty phonecall from my sister (who I'm otherwise very close to) saying I can either suck it up or move out and pay a lot more elsewhere. She also said her kids said I was messy. For context, that is based on when she went to the Maldives with Mike and I looked after four kids by myself while working full time. It's not inaccurate, but it's more than a little unfair.  In the background, my partner's mother has offered to go 50/50 with us on a mini-house at the bottom of her garden while my girlfriend and I save for a mortgage, I'll be paid back for my investment and she'll have a supplementary income when we buy. Given the flipouts, she has also offered for me to move in rent free immediately, me helping with bills.  My sister has asked that I don't move out until it's built. My rent was due to be going to her but for the last few months it hasn't. They want to give Dave his notice of 8 months before fixing the place and renting it out for a lot more money. They have no plans to replace me, they know finding one who could deal with my housemate would be difficult.  I don't want to financially screw my sister(who thanks to the divorce has to find 200k in 4 years to buy out her ex-husband) but I also don't feel it's my responsibility to accommodate for Mike's lack of savings or contributions.

hha96iud	(20F) have been friends with this guy, Kevin (fake name) for 4 years now. We met in high school, and he got assimilated into my already existing group.   All throughout high school, Kevin cracked a lot of jokes at my expense. I had put on a lot of weight back then, due to stress and other factors, and this resulted in constant fat jokes. I can't really put the jokes on here, because they were in my mother tongue so they won't really properly translate to English. But they were pretty offensive, and what made it worse is that all my other friends laughed at his jokes. I kind of put up with these jokes, because I was kind of lonely during high school  and I didn't want to lose my friends. This only encouraged him, and at this point, I feel like I'm less a friend, and more of a long running joke in my group. Yesterday when he was over, he started with the fat jokes. And he knows I'm very insecure about my body. I told him that I wasn't okay with such jokes, and that it hurt me. He claimed I was being oversensitive, and I should take things lightly. I still told him to stop with the jokes, to which he agreed. However, he still cracked another one later (which he attributed to being an "old habit"). This severely pissed me off. Later that day, a friend put up pics of us in our group chat. Kevin was wearing shorts, an attire he isn't too fond of taking pictures in. I was feeling rather petty that day, and wanted to give him a taste of his own medicine. So I called him a "shorty" (that's supposed to be a pun because he is short and was wearing shorts). He has told me before that he has always been insecure of height, so I did that deliberately, I admit. He completely went OFF on me after that joke. He kept spamming "Fatty" "Indecisive drama queen" and such words on the group, so I left it, saying that I needed time to cool down. Then he messaged me privately, saying I'm an insecure fat person. I blocked him immediately to stop myself from engaging. Then he messages me on Instagram that I bullied him my calling him short even after he apologized for his jokes. I told him that he had constantly been cracking jokes at my expense for 3 years. I couldn't look at myself in the mirror at one point in my life. To that he told me that I'm a hypocrite because I put up with shit that a partner had put me through, but I couldn't forgive him for merely joking. He kept rehashing this point over and over again, though it was completely unrelated to the issue at hand. It also made me think that he was implying that if I dealt with bad treatment from one person, I should take it from all. It made me feel super upset, and I blocked him everywhere else, thus ending the friendship. One of my friends from this group is telling me I overreacted and should apologize to Kevin AITA for ending the friendship over this?	1643135230.0	sckcg0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckcg0/aita_for_overreacting_to_my_friend_cracking_fat/	AITA for overreacting to my friend cracking fat jokes?
814en0kx	I work at a very popular chain pizza place that can get very busy when there’s sports games, events, etc.   The other night I was scheduled to work 5pm-12am which basically means I’m helping the shift manager close the store (we’re open till 2am). It’s important to note that I never indicate that I can work past 12 because any later will cause my IBS to flare up and I will feel very ill the next day, which basically forces me to stay home. It’s common for the instore that helps the closer to go home at 11pm or 12am.   This particular day was hellishly busy because there was a hockey game. Usually around 11pm I will do my dishes, and I can go home by 12am. However, I had no time to do dishes, and all I could do was make pizzas, so obviously I was gonna stay longer and help out the closing manager, because although I am no way LEGALLY obligated to do this. (Canada), it’s kind of expected at my work. I did get the chance to do over half of the dishes, but not all of them. I ended up going home at 1:30am, so I stayed an hour and a half later that I was scheduled to.   At this point I told my manager that I was going home, and she got really upset, saying that she wasn’t going to get to go home till 6:30am and that its our policy that I stay until it’s not busy (at least for 1 person to handle themselves AND do clean up for the store). I told her that I’m already starting to feel like shit, and that I don’t legally need to be here. It’s important to note as well that this shift manager is rude. She didn’t ask if I could stay, she told me that I must, and she commonly gets mad at employees for this that are honestly her own fault.   I worked with her the next day and she looked dead because she had to work at her other job I’m between. My other coworkers think it was pretty shallow of me to leave her there. A lot of the drivers gave me a hard time, and kept asking me to stay the night previously too. I felt terrible that I left her! But I didn’t sign up to be a shift manager, and I don’t get paid enough to lose sleep over it. I set work boundaries for a reason and I don’t think that I should be criticized for them. She ended up going home at 4:30am and had started working at 9pm—I don’t know when she worked her other job.

gohlecin	First of all, sorry for any grammatical errors. English isn't my first language. So there's this friend of mine I've known for 5 years but only started being close with about 6 months ago. We were in the same class too.  I'll start by giving some background information. As a kid, my mom and I were financially abused by my father. It's not like mom wasn't earning well or my father needed money, he just had (and still has) an obsession with money. He used to take my mom's salary away, giving her very little money to run the house with. I had a small amount of clothes that were given to me in gifts (no hand me downs) and even my uniform was old. there was a point where I was getting dress coded bcs my skirt was too short and dad wasn't letting me buy a new one. my maternal grandparents had to buy me the essential stuff.   due to this, all of my friends had the "oh she's poor" impression of me, including the one I'm about to talk about. said friend doesn't have extremely rich parents but they always get what they want and are able to fulfill their desires. frankly speaking, I'm genuinely jealous of them. i can only wish I had (or have) that.   now, the thing is that I just started dental school and my tuition was paid by my dad (the first time he's ever spent money on me) and this 'pricked' my friend maybe because they weren't able to go to their desired college due to financial reasons. ever since I told them that dad payed the fee they have started mocking me a lot. they KNOW that I wasn't (and still am not) in a financially good situation on a personal level but they don't see that now   this is some of the stuff they've said: "well your daddy's rich, you can't talk about being poor"  "you wouldn't understand, not all of us have parents who can pay full college fee"  "you have such a big house" (this one felt insulting because it's literally a normal 2 bedroom house and theirs is bigger than mine) "why can't you buy *insert anything*, youre just showing off at this point. you're being such a stupid bitch" (this is where I lost my shit)  the last line was what was said to me today, after which I proceeded to say "I don't wanna talk to you anymore, you're being too mean to me and I'd like to have friends who actually care about me" and blocked them on social media.   so, i KNOW i sound superficial. maybe I am being selfish. this is why I'm here, am I the asshole for calling them out?	1643136310.0	sckqyt	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckqyt/aita_for_calling_out_my_friend_who_is_mocking_my/	AITA for calling out my friend who is mocking my richness
j0jyuaue	Throwaway and on mobile, so I apologise for my formatting in advance.    We had online lessons today and my teacher (X) was present for the first lesson. After the first lesson my teacher said that we will be going on break, and that we would be researching for our assignment after the break. However, he didn't specify how long the break was for. I assumed 15 minutes as that's what is stated on my timetable. The second lesson was due to start at 14:30 and finish at 16:00. I came back at 14:30 while my teacher remained in the meeting with his mic off. I then waited 5 minutes, but none of my other classmates showed up and my teacher still had his mic off. I unmuted myself called him a few times but he didn't answer. I tried again at 14:40 and at 14:45. He still didn't answer. I then messaged my main form tutor (MFT) as I was concerned for him as he had a history of not answering before (and because I was slightly annoyed that he didn't answer). This is basically how the conversation went:    OP: Do you know if anything is wrong with X? The lesson was supposed to start at 14:30 and he isn't answering when I call him.    MFT: I'll try to reach him to see what's up.    (Minutes later)    MFT: Has he set you some work to do?    OP: Yes, I'm doing it now.    (Minutes later)    MFT: Is he still there? (She meant is his mic on)    OP: No.    2 minutes after that X unmuted himself and he sounded annoyed:    X: Hi OP, are you ok? Do you have any other work to do?    OP: I'm fine, and I don't have any other work to do. What time were we supposed to come back after the break as you didn't specify?    X: 14:30. I'm going to end the lesson here for today, see you tomorrow. (I was annoyed at this point).    Then he ended the meeting. I told my family members what happened and they said that I shouldn't have reported him to my MFT. My argument was that I wasn't trying to report him, but I wasn't going to sit in an empty meeting when I could be doing something more valuable with my time.

ieuln00x	I would like to preface I’m 17 and less confrontational than most of my family also being less emotional as well  This is something that happened last summer and I do feel like the asshole to some extent. So my mom has problems with her family and it’s been this way for forever. On a mountain vacation her family goes coincidentally at the exact same time as us. This does not go over well with anyone besides my mom because here family has mistreated her for years. So anyways near the end of our trip at our lodge my mom is silent. She was upset because she wanted to spend more time with her family. Despite my mom spending just as much time with her family as her immediate family. My brother is angry about this and confronts her about it. One thing leads to another and words are being thrown. My brother makes an accusation that my mom planned the trip at the same time as her family and that it was a dumb idea. I intervened because it was getting too harsh and I told him that he shouldn’t blame our mom for that and I told my mom she should have spent more time with us. My brother gets mad at me saying that I was picking her side. I responded with I’m not picking anyones side and that unnecessary conflict a few days before we leave isn’t necessary and that was basically it. My brother was mad at me the whole trip and was a bit passive aggressive	1643136624.0	sckvaf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sckvaf/aita_for_telling_my_26_year_old_brother_hes_being/	AITA for telling my 26 year old brother he’s being immature for blaming a bad trip on my mom
3xa2u4nn	So for Valentine’s Day I decided to make a ych (your character here) commissions to make some extra money. I’m also apart of a few role play groups, groups I’ve been apart of for years. When posting about them in the group’s discord servers I charge $10 for characters that apart of that group.   However, when posting in other servers (non group servers) I’m charging $20 instead. I didn’t realize someone from one the group servers is also in the other server and called me out for my difference in prices.   I explained that I give a discount to those who have characters in the groups I’m apart of. And the person stated it was wrong and an asshole move.   A few others in the server agreed and I proceeded to just leave the server.   I mentioned it to a few friends and they were divided. Some saying I should have been mindful of who was all in the server.   AITA?  TLDR; I made a ych commission. Charged $10 for characters in an rp and charged $20 for those who aren’t and people got mad.	1643136976.0	scl01w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scl01w/aita_for_charging_different_prices_on_my/	AITA for charging different prices on my commissions?
j0hqs9r7	   I (29F) have been friends with we’ll call her Lauren (28F) for 10 years. Some background on our friendship I’m married with 2 kids and she’s been in my kids lives for most of their lives.   Since October I have somewhat kept her at arms length after I started noticing some increasing frustrating traits in our friendship. Along with a handful of events that have left me questioning our friendship.   What really brought a lot of this to my attention that maybe this was not a healthy friendship for me anymore was because I had texted her that a family death happened and her response was “okay”. Which then led to me telling her that her response was as hurtful and unsympathetic. She blamed it on being at work and not having time to respond even tho around the same time she responded to me she had also posted stuff on Facebook. When I told her that she could’ve waiting to respond she then changed it up to “I didn’t really read your text” and continued to saying I’m sorry followed by some excuse. It drew attention to the lack of reciprocity of our friendship and that our friendship heavily focused on her.  She’s fairly dependent on others in the sense that when she doesn’t have work she practically lives at my house on weekdays/whenever her significant other isn’t home. If she won’t see her therapist for awhile she makes jokes with the underlying implication being I’ll have to take on the responsibility of her mental health. This isn’t even the tip of the iceberg. One example is I bought myself a cricut so I could start a small business for myself and she immediately started asking me to make her things to give as gifts and said she’d pay for all the supplies. I made a comment that if she had me make a lot I’d also charge her a small labor fee and she was like “why would you do that?” And didn’t seem to understand why after explaining to her.   I have reached the point where it’s becoming so taxing on me that I’ve started lying about being busy most days just so I can have a break from it all. I’ve started to feel really guilty about it since now she has complained that all she does is sit at home alone when I’m busy.

8c1g3q65	TLDR; My ex-stepmother's cat died, and I didn't contact her as I'd decided not to maintain our relationship only to get my dad's money back.   Anne and my dad divorced about 5 years ago, but I still think of her as my stepmother. They were together for around 12 years, from when I was 8 til I was 20.   My dad is pretty wealthy. He inherited a house and money from his parents, and he was a well-respected barrister in the public sector. Anne was a secretary at a large firm. She was careless with money, drank at least 5 bottles of wine a week and constantly shopped for clothes and furniture online. Her spending stressed out my dad. It was his dream to help me and my brother buy properties, which is seriously expensive in our area.   We had two cats. One chose to go and live with the neighbours who adored her. Anne was obsessed with cats and had little cat ornaments all over the house, and she adored Phoebe, the other.   Anne was a terrible stepmother and wife in many ways. Not everything was bad, she loved spoiling my brother and me. But she was a very unhappy woman, and made us miserable too. I remember often sitting cowed on the sofa while she drunkenly stared at me with wide red eyes, and told me how disappointed she was in me. The silences between her talking were almost worse than the talking itself. She bitched to me about my dad, she bitched to me about my brother. And for all I know, she bitched about me to them too. She loved to tease, bordering on mean. She once spent several weeks deriding me for my "posh" accent. I would say something, and she would repeat it back at me mockingly. I eventually stopped talking, which just made her angry.   Their divorce was messy, and Anne got enough to buy a 3-bedroom house, plus enough cash to never work again.  My dad has ever since been heartbroken that money from his late parents and money he spent his life saving for me and my brother was now gone to this woman. He's encouraged us to maintain a relationship with her, as she'd said she'd remember us in her will. For a while I went along with it. I'd text her, wish her happy birthday and Christmas, and sometimes visit. A couple years ago I decided I couldn't pretend anymore. I decided to view the money as gone, and stopped trying.   After they divorced, Anne had taken Phoebe with her to her new house. I heard that, one by one, she fell out with her closest friends, lovely people who couldn't deal with her shit anymore. Being a lone woman with few friends left, Phoebe was probably her only real comfort. Phoebe died six months ago. I thought about messaging that day, and the next, dithering until a week had gone by and I felt like it was too late. I didn't want a relationship with this woman.   My father has since said he's pretty disappointed in me, that it was heartless to not get in touch. She loves me and still sends me bday and Christmas presents, but I didn't show compassion.

e6l5w8ny	Long story short: my fiancé and I had wanted to get a matching tattoo together. About a year in the making…. But we never actually made the plans, never really decided on the tattoo.  Last week I went with my best friend and got a tattoo with HIM. He is a straight male, very effeminate, 10 yrs older than me.  I mention these facts because there has never been anything between us, for the 6 years we’ve been absolute BEST friends. However, I think the fact that he is a male makes my fiancé uncomfortable.  The tattoo is not a matching tattoo, though the same characters from a popular tv show are in both of them. They DO represent our friendship.  Anyway, my fiancé has basically ignored me for 5 days, which is hard seeing that we live together. He has been cold, distant. I have apologized and offered to have the tattoo covered.  I know I may have hurt his feelings, but there is a common theme in many of our conversations and arguments. He wishes to be the first with me & he cannot be. He’s mentioned wishing we had a child together and gone through the parenting stages together (instead I was a single mother for 8 years before beginning this relationship). He wishes I had not experienced certain things in the bedroom before. He wishes I had not been engaged before. In our last argument he bursted out and yelled, “Why can’t you just be who I want you to be!?” Freudian slip I think…  Ok, basically I have ripped away yet another opportunity for him to be my “first”, which I personally find ridiculous. But I need honesty- Am I the asshole?	1643137979.0	scldzr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scldzr/aita_my_fiancé_is_mad_i_got_a_tattoo/	AITA: My fiancé is mad I got a tattoo

j0l52dfk	It’s my son’s birthday soon. His birthday is on a Wednesday and I’ve organised a party for the weekend after. Everything has been arranged and the invites sent. Now, my husband wants me to reschedule it to the weekend after the original party date as something has come up and he might not be able to fly here in time for the party. I told him no and that he should prioritise our son and come to the party like he was supposed to.  He kept insisting he couldn’t reschedule his other arrangement and told me I need to reschedule the party. I refused to and told him they can do something else when he finally decides to see our kids but I wasn’t going to change the party. Now he’s angry at me and keeps sending me angry texts threatening to cancel the party himself.

j0llcq8j	I (23F) and my husband (23M) were asked to be in our BIL/SIL's wedding party. We happily agreed. But we just found out now (several months since they asked us) that they pushed their wedding back, and it is now on my birthday.   Growing up, my birthday always fell on exam week and I never really got to properly celebrate it without stress and sleeplessness. Now as an adult, I try my best to celebrate the day to the fullest. Last year, my husband was asked to do a presentation at work and because he just started the job, he didn't want to say no. So we ended up having a late night dinner with a couple of friends. It was definitely very nice, but I wanted a day to spend doing things that I love like going to a museum/zoo. I also come from a culture where we share everything and to have something just for myself would be considered selfish. And my birthday is the one thing/one day where I can be be free...be 'selfish' so to say.  So I have been waiting all year for my birthday to come around again. I am quite hurt that the bride and groom changed the date without telling us, and I not sure, but I do suspect that they forgot that that would be my birthday. I know my husband would not want to skip the wedding altogether.

11baff	Alright, so here’s a bit of background: I have a group of friends from college, one of whom is my buddy whom I’ll call Ethan. Ethan is a naturally very affectionate person and has a lot of girl friends, which has been a sticking point for his girlfriend, whom I’ll call Marie. I don’t know what her issue is, but Marie has had a problem with me from day one. Got visibly upset if me and Ethan were hanging out or having fun, always said something cutting if it seemed like I was getting more attention from anyone in a group context, offered a lot of backhanded compliments about my appearance, you get the gist. The bullying and subtle mean girl behavior continued throughout college, which generally made me feel really bad about myself, particularly because there was always some sort of plausible deniability for it, and I didn’t want to stir anything up by pointing out that she was, to me anyway, obviously singling me out and making me feel unwelcome and insulting me at every opportunity she could. Like, the girl tried to ask me to uninvite people from my 21st birthday party that she didn’t personally like and then when I didn’t do that, sulked the whole time and made a very ~mysterious manic pixie dream girl~ exit by leaving suddenly. Seriously.       Cut to about 2 years ago: my dad is dying, and I text the college friends group chat, which both Marie and Ethan are in, that he has maybe a few days left, that I am feeling really down, and that I may not be as quick to respond to stuff in the chat, and thanking everyone for being supportive. Everyone else is very kind and understanding, including Ethan. However, rather than in any way addressing what I had just said, Marie responded to an earlier message I had sent, saying that it had a typo in it and that that episode of whatever TV show I had been talking about was actually filmed in Prague and not London or some other inane stupid correction. Did not offer me condolences, did not acknowledge what I had said, just more trying to make me feel foolish.       Fast forward to about two weeks ago, when Marie has suffered the same loss as me, and announces that her dad had passed suddenly from a stroke. She had bemoaned to anyone who would listen that she never really got along with her dad, and that he was (pretty credibly, if her descriptions are accurate) emotionally and financially abusive. Nonetheless, losing a parent at a relatively young age is hard, and everyone else was vocally supportive of her. However, I said nothing. I knew responding with the same cattiness she did would only cause problems, but I also felt a pang of guilt about not offering condolences or solidarity to another person going through the same hard time I just had. Am I being exactly as terrible as Marie by saying nothing? Was this the mature response?

5fiow7do	I (16f) help out at my school as a voluntary ,teacher’ for younger students. They can simply enroll by asking for help in a specific subject. Then they get assigned a random tutor for one-one-one-meetings and homework help. I am available on Tuesdays and Thursdays, because of my extracurricular activities on other days.   Now to the story.   H (12) ist S U P E R unreliable. I always remind him a day ahead that we’re doing the homework. We’ll schedule a meeting for 12:30 and he texts me 13:20 that he’s sick. Or he just won’t show up.   Since Christmas there have been 20 scheduled homework sessions, he has been to THREE. I am really getting fed up about this, because having to wait for the next bus is super annoying. I also prepare for every meeting: making summaries, tense tables or printing texts.   Now the real deal.   I get a mail today from another one of the homework-helpers, an older student in my grade, telling me that she and H have been having three meetings a week.   I respond to her, asking about H’s attendance at her course and she says that they meet every Monday, Wednesday and Friday afternoon.  She then asks me (in a petty tone) to stick to the schedule - and to be more responsible. I am pretty gobsmacked about that accusation and tell her about my thoughts in person - H doesn’t show up.

9inpnoha	I (27nb) am triggered and very anxious to see my ex(26m) at my bff's (27m) birthday party  When I was 20 my ex and I started a band. He was a guitarist, I was the singer and we were looking for a drummer... my best friend from school is a drummer, so I introduced him to my ex and we all became friends and performed together for a couple years. I moved out to another country to study music abroad but they kept the band so they are still friends now.  My bff and I have a 13 year friendship. I consider him my BROTHER and I love him so so much He even visited me when I studied abroad. Distance could not separate us and now that I graduated and I'm back home and I don't know what to do with this birthday situation.  Now to the ex boyfriend...we started dating when we were 17 and we had a long, on and off, very toxic 4year relationship that ended in him cheating and lying to me. I was completely blindfolded to the emotional ab\*se and I could not get out of it until literally was miles away from him when I traveled to Canada. There were times that I wanted to leave him and he would play victim and make me feel like an awful person because 'he needed me' so I stayed. We would engage in physical activities, get romantic, and I would say 'I love you' and he always backed up and say we are just friends...then I would say 'well friends don't do this and I'd try to keep my distance from him, but again he would just tell me how mistaken he was, that he needed me and that I was being selfish for treating him differently, so then I fell for him again... Once after making out in my room he sarted talking about this other girl who is flirting with him, and he would tell me stuff like 'I think she is very pretty...'etc. We would hang out and he would show me stuff and say 'this other girl gifted me X, she knows me so well, I love this kind of stuff...' I would get hurt and mad at him and he would sorry blah blah blah and somehow I was still with him.   The part that hurts the most to this day is that my ex would frequently comment on my appearance. He would say, I don't like how you dress, Why do you always were the same type of shoes? This other girl dresses nicer, why don't you dress like her. He would say that I was gaining weight and if we are gonna have a future together I was not allowed to be fat. Nnow I am hyper self-conscious about how I am going to look like for my bff's bithday party (plus I gained some pounds during the pandemic)  My bff's girlfriend and I are the ones organizing this party because it's supposed to be a surprise for him, but she was the one to invite the ppl cuz she knows more who he is friends with, and now we all ended up at a group chat when she explained everyone about the surprise plan thing... Since everyone in our friend group knows the story with my ex to some extent I did not think he would get invited... but apparently when bff's gf asked him with whom he wanted to spend his birthday, he did mentioned him...

I'm hoping that after he graduates from high school, he will apply for admission into an engineering college.  &#x200B;  However, there is a problem now. Of late, he's developed an interest in hip-hop music and thinks that becoming a hip-hop star is the best thing in life. He thinks they're the coolest people out there. I couldn't disagree more. He is obviously wasting his potential by going into music since he has no musical talent at all. Moreover, we are white; not black or Latino. We can't get into hip-hop; no one will accept a white boy for a hip-hop star. My son just doesn't get any of this. We've been having arguments over this for weeks now. He thinks it's his life and he should get to decide what he wants to do. I think he's out of his mind and missing out on a great career opportunity as a highly-paid engineer.

ghg7si0r	At the end of September, my friend "jane" (25f) had sent me paragraphs about things she didn't like about me and things I've done in the past 4 years I've known her that have pissed her off but has never said anything to me about it. She told me that if I changed all of these things, then we could absolutely still be friends. I apologized for the things that I actually could apologize for that I remember doing or that deserved an apology, but in general, this annoyed me because   a) 90% of the things she listed were things OTHER people told ME about HER but told HER that I said them    b) the other 10% is either I didn't invite her to something (getting food or running errands), saying I copy her hair color (I'm brunette with purple ends - she's blonde with red ends?) or that I'm always crying about my ex (he cheated on me with his current gf and I didn't find out until a year later but by that point I had already been with my current bf for 5 months) <--- Jane also constantly flirted and brushed up against my ex all the time when I was around and always tried to hang out with him at his house when I wasn't home.  and c) she didn't respond when I called her out on things she's done to me that I have brought up to her multiple times before but she continues to do.  Fast forward to now. I haven't really spoken to Jane since maybe the week before halloween? She recently got engaged so I texted her and said "congratulations on your engagement!!" Nothing big because we haven't really been taking part in each others lives anymore and I didn't think I needed to send a huge message and all she said was "thanks."  Well, apparently, Jane told our mutual friends that I'm an AH because I didn't send her a long message congratulating her and that I'm being petty by not talking to her after she "called me out for being a shitty person."

hu05oim7	For context, I (29M) work from home. So does my roommate, Ben (28M).   Ben’s on salary so he pretty much only works when he has something to do. As a result, he will usually spend his days in the living room watching TV or working on a quick task. My bedroom is right off the living room so there is often noise that interferes with my work. It’s not loud noise, so I just close my door and that prevents people in my meetings from hearing his TV shows. It also prevents Ben from hearing me talking if he’s trying to work.  Well, Ben has a dog. I love that little thing. He’s so cool! The dog likes me too. He follows me around and likes to spend time with me. I don’t mind him hanging out in my room when he wants. He will come up to my door and bark to let me know he’s out there and wants in. Here’s where I might be TA. I’ve never had a dog before and therefore don’t know hardly anything about training or how to behave around dogs, but apparently I have taught him that he can go into whatever room he wants if he sits outside the door and barks. I can see why that’s a problem so I’ve stopped opening my door when he sits outside and barks with hopes that he unlearns this behavior. I didn’t intentionally teach this to his dog. I don’t close my door to keep him from entering, I close my door to dampen noise coming from the living room so I didn’t see it as a problem to let him in. But Ben is still furious at me and blames me whenever he has to punish his dog.

j0nlher6	My (m28) wife (f27) had to take over as guardians of my SIL after her father unexpectedly passed 2 years ago. She was rocked by it and I’m so proud of her for her recent accomplishments despite all that she’s been through.   She recently got into a solid in state college and an even better out of state school. If I’m being honest she’s too smart for the in state school but the out of state tuition is ridiculously high. After scholarships and what her dad left behind she’d need to pay 80k+ for the 4 years. For the in state option it’s about 32,000 for all 4 years.   My wife suggested that we use our savings to cover her tuition. I immediately told her that we’re not covering her entire out of state tuition. I suggested covering what ever in state is and then we can co sign her loans for the rest of the tuition if she chooses to go out of state. She was not happy at all about this but agreed.   The reason I was being a little stingy is because I’m planning to get my masters next fall and we kind of need to fall back on our savings since I’m taking time off work.  My SIL is a little upset because her dad promised to pay for her college completely and she assumed that he had left behind enough for her college or that we’d help her out.

g2u168oe	    I’m getting married in a little over 3 months I wanted an small intimate wedding with my family and friends. It’s only going to be around 40 people.        around 9 months ago I asked my mother if she and my step dad would like to come to my wedding. She didn’t say yes or no went into a whole speech about how much she disapproves of my decision and I let her go off and that’s that. She even got upset that her family is coming to my wedding and called my grandma upset that my grandma knew and didn’t tell her anything.               For context my mothers family doesn’t necessarily hate her but they aren’t close with her bc of her past actions that she refuses to take accountability for. Just so she couldnt say that I did not invite them I asked her 2 more times each time she did the same thing. For those who might wonder my mother hates my fiancé because she thinks that he will never amount to anything. Meanwhile my fiancé is very close to her side of the family he helps my grandma and aunts with money and is great with all my younger cousins he is also going to be a partner for a business my uncle owns which is will infuriate my mother when she finds out. As of right now I am almost no contact with her and my step dad. I’ve been very vocal with my decision to not have them at my wedding but some family that isn’t as close think that I should still make ammends with her and step dad	1643141054.0	scmjdx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmjdx/aita_for_not_wanting_my_parents_at_my_wedding/	AITA for not wanting my parents at my wedding?
8to7itr4	I’ve had the same group of friends for about 3 years now. We’ve all bonded over having certain difficulties throughout our lives and we’ve all been very supportive of each other. One friend, who we’ll call J, has been clinically diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder, or “DiD” for short, for about 7 years now. We’ve all been very understanding and have taken it upon ourselves to get educated on DiD.  Recently, J has been struggling with their disorder and we’ve all handed around him to be as supportive as we can and do as much as possible for him. Another friend, who we’ll call A, has claimed that they have also been diagnosed with DiD, but only within the past few days. The group of course offered any help we could if she needed it. J thought it was strange how suddenly when he began struggling and receiving attention from the rest of us, that A suddenly claimed to get diagnosed. But he brushed it off, as A has been clinically diagnosed with autism and he didn’t want to seem like a jerk.  However, he came to me not long ago and said how there were so many things that didn’t add up about A having DiD. From how long she claimed to have gone through the diagnosis process, to how it would only affect A when someone else was getting some kind of attention, etc. I wasn’t sure what to do, as I wanted to give A the benefit of the doubt as she had always been a good friend. But I also wanted to trust J and help him out.  One night, a couple days ago, J confronted A while the whole group was on the phone together. We tried to calm them down as it was quickly evolving into an argument and that was the last thing we wanted. Finally, A broke down and said that J was right. She had been faking it because she liked the attention. She also admitted to faking traumas and then left the call. Everyone made the decision to not speak to her anymore, as lying about something as severe as that is not okay in the slightest.  We blocked her on everything and no one has spoken to her. However, I can’t help but feel guilty about doing so. As I said before, she’s autistic and so am I. I feel like an ableist jackass for dropping her, but I knew it would be best for the group. So, am I the asshole?	1643141196.0	scmld7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmld7/aita_for_blocking_a_friend_who_lied_to_the_whole/	AITA for blocking a friend who lied to the whole group?
inm789qd	My (20F) mom (50F) remarried when I was four. My step dad (60F) is basically my dad, and also has two adult daughters 40F (we don't talk to one) and a son my age. I didn't get along with my step brother as a kid but since we reached around 15 we became civil and actually have a drink together on occasion. I've never met one of my step sisters but have met the other, her husband and their son (21M) and we get along pretty well, shes a good big sister to me, she also gets along with my mom really well.  Our parents had only dated for a few months before getting married and moving in together (dad moved in with us since mom owned our house and he was renting an apartment). As a result of moving in together, obviously dad, as he's the higher earner, has contributed a hell of a lot to the mortgage.   Fast forward to now. After my grandfather died, the topic of wills and such came up between my parents. Dad said "obviously I'll be leaving things to all three of them, plus my grandson" which mom agreed with. The step sister we don't talk to is a separate issue that I don't know enough about to discuss.   Anyway, he then asked what was happening with the house, as it was only in my mom's name (which he was always perfectly happy with, not a fan of paper work) and what with his health issues (liver related) and the ten year age gap, presumably he'd go first.  She said it was getting left to me. My dad was not happy but knew that since he'd be dead in this scenario there was no point in arguing. I found out about this, and assured him that I planned to just sell it and split it with my step siblings since he had contributed to the majority of the mortgage so far. He was happy with this and we hugged and that was it. Until we realised mom heard us.  She blew up at me, telling me I had no right to give money from HER house to HIS kids since they were not apart of OUR family. I told her that it would be my decision, and that I will do with the money what I want, and it was only fair to them and dad. She's still mad at me and won't talk to me until I agree to keep the house to myself. I just don't think it's fair though.  So AITA for planning to share my inheritance with my step siblings?	1643140924.0	scmhh6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmhh6/aita_for_planning_to_share_my_inheritance_with_my/	AITA for planning to share my inheritance with my step siblings?
j0muu3un	My brother is in the middle of a very angry divorce. He's living at our parent's house right now because he can't afford a place on his own. The divorce is completely his fault. He blew money on stocks and bitcoin and other expensive stuff and took out loans and lines of credit in secret. He didn't tell his wife and went so far as to show her false statements. It didn't work as well as it he thought because she figured it out and is divorcing him. But their house has been foreclosed, their savings were wiped, both of them applied for bankruptcy because my brother got them into massive debt on stocks and other wild out of control spending and finances. His wife lost her job because a bankruptcy is a negative in her industry. She's living with her parents too and both of them are relying on legal aid and parents to help pay the legal fees for the divorce. Normally I strive to ignore my brother but lately he's been saying it's not his fault because the stock market is rigged and his wife should have paid more attention (he actively hid from her). The last time he said I said the entire divorce is his fault and he should apologize for destroying his wife's life. He wasn't pleased about it and the next time I saw him he spent the whole time trying to pick a fight with me. He's tried to get our parents involved too all because of how upset he is for me not agreeing with him.	1643141186.0	scml82	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scml82/aita_for_telling_my_brother_that_his_divorce_is/	AITA for telling my brother that his divorce is his own fault?
j0ob93yy	My wife is in the habit of always putting on makeup whenever she has to go outside. In the three years we've been married, I've never seen her leave the house without any makeup on. Even if she had to go to the neighbor's house, she'd still put on her makeup. I've spoken to her about this many times as I find it absurd, to say the least. But the only answer I get from her is that she just likes to take extra care of the way looks. It gets even more frustrating whenever our plans are delayed because she spends so much time on her makeup.     Yesterday, my wife had to go to the supermarket and asked me if I could take her there. She's too nervous to drive ever since she had a minor traffic accident over a year ago, so I have to drive her around. I had a lot of work piled up for that day and I didn't want to be disturbed when I was in the middle of it, so I said that we'd have to go right then and return within an hour. She said okay, and sat down to put on her makeup. I was pissed when I saw that and told her that we had to hurry since I knew she'd take more than 40 minutes at the supermarket, and the drive to the supermarket could take anywhere between 5-10 minutes. Five minutes went by and she was still not ready; said she was putting on the finishing touches. That's when I lost it and yelled at her. I said that people didn't give a damn about how she looked and that she should stop deluding herself and wasting my time. For a moment, she just stared at me. Then, she broke down and started sobbing.     We didn't go to the supermarket, needless to say. Also, she hasn't been talking to me at all since yesterday. I don't know what to make of the situation. On the one hand, I feel bad for her, but on the other hand, I feel like she was being unreasonable and needed a wake-up call.

I texted both my dad and my sister if they wanted anything, my sister replied saying no, my dad didn’t respond. My mother didn’t want any so I just bought myself a meal and we continued on our way back home.  When I arrived home my dad was still at work and I ate my KFC meal. When my dad arrived home an hour later he got upset seeing that I didn’t buy him anything. I told him I sent him a message but he told me that he was busy and couldn’t check his phone and I should’ve known he would’ve wanted a meal.

3oca8ued	So, my best friend and I have been friends for seven years. We will refer to them as C. C and I met at a convention while I was attending college, and our friendship was a very important one. We have quite a few good memories between us. To put things into perspective, we have remained in near constant contact for the past seven years.  The only times we have gone more than a day without talking was because they were having a bad day, and I always respected their need for space during these times. On C's end, they have been extremely comforting and supportive of me through a few bad periods in my life and I would without a doubt take a bullet for them.  For the past three or four years, C and I have sent each other gifts for Christmas and our respective birthdays, and occasionally a random gift if we had seen something the other would like. C and I would never tell each other what we were getting the other because we wanted to always surprise the other.  Last fall, my mom was cleaning out a desk in her room, and had found a case of gel pens. I messaged C and asked them if they wanted me to send them out to them if they were still good. C said they would take them and gave me their address (C had just moved to another state.  However, most of the gel pens were not any good. So I told C that I'd send them a little surprise gift.  I bought a plushie I saw at a store, and mailed it to them, and when C recieved it, and absolutely loved it. This was last October. One day in November, I sent a picture of a hat, and C messaged me, telling me that they did not want me to send them anything.  I wasn't initially surprised, I just figured that C maybe was tight on money, and did not want me to send them a gift if they could not send one in return.  When I asked them about it, C told me that they felt uncomfortable with me sending them gifts, and that they were setting a boundary that they wanted me to stop sending them gifts.  I asked if I could still send C and their partner Christmas cards, and I was met with the same general response.  I started asking them where this whole thing was coming from, because it was quite out of the blue, and I have never seen C act this way before. We've never really argued about anything and I just wanted to know what triggered C to set this boundary, but C was starting to get very frustrated that I was not letting the conversation go, so I relented. I was rather concerned about this whole thing because the way my friend acted seemed very uncharacteristic.  I'm not opposed to them feeling this way, I was just concerned about why they felt this way cause if they felt there was something going on regarding our friendship, I wanted to talk to them about it.  I feel like I am the asshole for asking my friend about why they felt they needed to do this when I saw nothing going on in the friendship that would have been a cause for concern.	1643141858.0	scmuia	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmuia/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_to_explain_their/	AITA for asking my best friend to explain their reasoning for setting a boundary?
3i4zw53k	A friend of ours recently gave us a tablet pro with a keyboard as she said it wouldn’t turn on. She said it was a gift if my husband wanted to fix it for us to use.   He looked at it later and discovered it was a very simple charging issue and had it up and running in a matter of minutes.   When he relayed a thank you and mentioned it was easy to fix she proceeded to ask for it back (she’s a single low income mom).

enmip	To begin, it's totally possible I'm overreacting to this, so I was hoping to get your thoughts.  My mom called me yesterday and told me that her friend has a daughter who is about my age, and like me, is single.  My mom's friend thought it would be a good idea if we got in touch, to which my mom agreed.  This girl, too, apparently saw a photo of me and thought I was "cute" or something like that.  Sounds good, right?   Here's where things started getting a little odd (for me, at least).  During this same call, my mom informed me that *time is of the essence* here, and that I need to reach out soon.  Otherwise, this girl 1) would be super disappointed if I didn't reach out/would be "hurt", and 2) I would look like a "jerk" if I didn't initiate contact.  My mom indicated her friend thinks that unless I reach out here, I'mTheAsshole™ and I would hurt her daughter's feelings.  I don't mean to sound like a curmudgeon or anything.  Honestly, I like it when people float dating ideas, and I've gone on dates before where friends have set me up with someone.  But that's just it - I like when people *float* the idea, not when they essentially tell me I must make contact or I'm a "jerk."  I'm not even all that opposed to the idea of reaching out to this girl either, and quite frankly, I would have been much more open to the idea if this hadn't happened.  The fact is, I'm just really against people pushing me around in this sort of way, and especially when it comes to more personal matters involving things like dating/flirting, which I feel are things that should flow more organically and voluntarily, and not through compulsion.  Also, just to clarify: this girl and I do NOT know each other, and were unaware of each other's existence prior to this.  I'm skeptical of the idea this girl will be super let down if I don't reach out.  I'm basically a face in a photograph she's seen, and that's it.  So.  Am I overreacting/am I the asshole?  Is my mom's friend the asshole?  There's just something about this that seems weird... like, am I obligated to reach out under these circumstances?  Is this normal?  Thanks all, appreciate your thoughts.	1643141888.0	scmuwi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmuwi/aita_for_not_wanting_to_reach_out_to_a_girl_my/	AITA for not wanting to reach out to a girl my mother's friend is trying to set me up with when that friend told my mom I would be a "jerk" and "rude" if I failed to initiate conversation?
8bla2g5l	So at the weekend I was at my grandparent's house with my family. We were all sat around the table for luch and the tv was on. The programme we were watching was over and the next programme coming up was kind of unsuitable. No one was watching the tv so I decided to turn it off. A few minutes later my mum gives out hell to me for turning it off. She said that it was "rude" to turn it off because it wasn't "my house". My granny then said that it was alright and that I was right to turn it off but my mother keep saying otherwise.	1643142350.0	scn135	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn135/aita_for_turning_off_the_television_in_my/	AITA for turning off the television in my grandparent's house?
316xr8ak	I've (26f) been living with my dad (57m) and his wife (46f) for the past 7 years and in the past 2 years, I've learned that my step mom isn't really that great. She's very controlling, manipulative and toxic and I've only realized this too late. There are many examples but I’ll focus on what tipped it recently. For Thanksgiving, every year, she always wants all of her "kids" under her roof for a few days. This last year might've been the worst one. I've never trusted her and this was further proof of that because when me and my siblings went out for the day, she lied to her sister, my aunt, about me, saying that I had been smoking weed the whole time since Thursday however, my brother (31m) and his wife (27f) didn't come until Friday and didn't have any weed until Saturday. She did ask/command that I not smoke weed that day because I would cause drama in the family but I don't smoke unless I'm with my brother because I can't afford it. I did have one puff outside with him but that was it. When we came back inside, she yelled at me in front of everybody that she told me not to smoke weed and that if I did, she was going to make me pack my stuff and go back to Colorado to live with my mom, causing a scene. So I don't understand how 'I' brought the drama and not her. I lied right back to her, telling her I didn't smoke weed outside and she continued to scream at me. When my brother came to my defense to try to help me, she started yelling at him too. A few weeks ago, my brother called my dad and asked to talk to him in private, stating that he noticed some toxicity going on and wanted to know if my dad was okay. Instead, my dad told my step mom about their conversation and twisted it. She's translated it into "your brother wants us to separate and he's never liked me or viewed me as family" and rambled on for hours about how my brother is actually toxic for HER. After coming home from work that night, they were still going on about it but instead, they were picking at all his flaws and mistakes that he's tried extremely hard to overcome and she's even taking him out of her will. I had a moment of realization that if I left, they'd say the same things about me. I want to move out, live on my own but she's made it extremely hard for me to gain any type of independence. I still don't have a full time job and I'm constantly searching for one. I don't have a car as I can't drive. But my mental health has taken a toll the longer I stay here. I don't want to feel this way about her, I know that she's hurting too from her own mother's detachment and neglect. I also can't help but feel very guilty if I left my dad too because my brother wants to leave him in the dust now too. My sister in law told me that because she loves me, she's not going to start a fight with my stepmom until I'm out of there. But by no longer pursuing a relationship with either of them to try to find happiness, AITA?	1643142160.0	scmyiw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmyiw/aita_for_wanting_to_end_my_relationship_with_my/	AITA For wanting to end my relationship with my dad and my step mom?
j0if24vd	I (22f) have been with my boyfriend (22m) for 4 years. We both work is the same place but we work in different sections. We met before we staring working at the same place.  This girl started working next to my boyfriend and at first it was fine. My boyfriend introduced me to her and she seemed nice. He presented her as shy like me and that was the reason she didn't talk much to me.   As time went on they became closer and hung out more but only at work which was fine with me but when I would come to visit my boyfriend, she'd always leave.   Months later she started leaving her stuff with my boyfriend even tho she had her own area. Other coworkers would make jokes saying for me to watch out cause she's stealing my boyfriend which made me feel very uncomfortable.   My boyfriend would always tell me about the convos he has with her and how she has sexual relationships with many of the guys from work. He'd also talk about her sex life and talk to her about ours and what condom brand we use. He even brought condoms for her which I told him that that was uncomfortable with that so he left them in the car. And even after all these months, she'd have convos with my boyfriend, I'd walk up and she'd just leave. I didnt really understand it. I asked my boyfriend and said it can't be cause she's just shy cause she talks to most of the other coworkers and she the bosses. Also she added him on snapchar which kinda felt sus for me since the chat and photos disappear.  I tried to confront my boyfriend to tell him I feel uncomfortable but he gets very defensive and tells me he's allowed to have friends who are girls. I agree with him especially since he has another friend from work who is a girl but she's chill and doesn't act strange around me. We are friends. He then said that I had a guy friend who I talk about sex to. But in my opinion isn't the same since I only talk about that in a group with my other friends. I told him that I didn't want to stop him from being friends that I just want boundaries to be set up. He snapped and said that it wasn't a big deal and I'm overreacting and a hypocrite.

b9qqa199	I F(25) and bf Brett M(28) have a roommate Kyle M(28) Brett moved Kyle into our home against my objections.  Since Kyle moved in he has left my garage door open (garage is attached to the kitchen) and my front door open 5 times. I am a full time dogsitter and one of these times i had 4 client's dogs plus my own dog escape thankfully no one was hurt but i live 30 feet from a 6 lane 55mph speed limit road in the city. Which one clients dog got to close to for comfort when they all escaped. That happened the 4th time he did that. And two days ago he again left my front door open and left to go somewhere, thankfully i was awake and caught it immediately before any of my client's dogs or my pets escaped. For context i have a dog, 3 indoor only cats, and 2 free roam parrots who can't fly due to wing arthritis and are only allowed outside when i am there to supervise.  On top of this Kyle never does any house chores like was discussed when he moved in that he needed to help out with, and he blatantly treats me like his maid. He has been reminded time and time again since he cost me a $300 job when my client's seen the dissary of the bathroom he promised me he would keep clean and i trusted him. After 2 months of him lying about cleaning that bathroom it was filthy there was feces, piss and visible sweaty butt scum on the toilet and the toilet seat, the bathtub was so soap scummy the scum bunched up in front of the sponge when i scrubbed it out, the counters were equally as filthy you get my point. He still to this day has never cleaned that bathroom either. Myself or Brett does every single time.   After Kyle left the door open the 4th time and all the dogs escaped he was sternly warned by myself and Brett that if anything like that ever happened again he would be kicked out that day no more chances. Brett thinks he is doing these things on purpose because he wants to break us up so he can live here longer than the year i was pushed into agreeing to let him live here for. The reason Brett thinks this is because come to find out this entire time Kyle behind my back to Brett has been lying and trying to blame me for leaving the doors open and other stupid things.   For more context i have been dogsitting since 2018 and our last house didn't even have a fenced in yard or anything and i have never once had a single dog escape or put in danger. No doors were ever left open or anything ever until Kyle moved in, in June. My house has also alway's been clean neat and tidy. When guest's came over I've literally gotten dozens of compliments about how neat and clean my house was..   So WIBTA if i told Brett that i couldn't forgive Kyle this time because I've given him too many chances and that i want him to move out by the end of February or i will?	1643142730.0	scn677	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scn677/wibta_if_i_kicked_my_roommate_out_for_being/	WIBTA if i kicked my roommate out for being generally disrespectful and jebordizing my job
gzls0z63	This has got to be one of the stupidest arguments I’ve gotten into with my mom.   I am currently ~4 weeks post op from a leg surgery. I’m still dealing with pain and swelling and am working from home for at least another month to 2 months per doctors orders.   When I have to be on camera, I move to a recliner but it’s not extremely comfortable so at all other times, I work from bed where I can fully elevate my leg.   No one knows that I’m responding to email from bed so why does it matter?  My mom came over to check on me a couple hours ago and bring by my medication. She has a key so she let herself in. When she realized I was in bed working (I was on a quick phone call) she asked what is wrong with me and told me I was probably making my coworkers uncomfortable by working from my bed.

d1bxgxuf	So me(25m) and my partner(22f) at the time (together for year and a half or so) were in a poly relationship, she had two other partners at the time one in South America and one on the east coast we lived on the west coast. I was fine with the long distance thing for her because I had some role play friends I had around the world that she was fine with. Now to the actual story. It’s mid December and I had gotten injured at work(sprained arm nothing to bad) but I was restricted from working till it healed so I’m stressed out about trying to get my bills paid. My partner just started a new job barley a week in as she’s spending the night and the next morning she tells me she’s already started having feelings for a coworker. I’m already stressed out and say no because I didn’t wanna talk about it at the moment. But we did talk about it over the next week and I asked her to give me a month to think and get my thoughts together. She agreed but still pestered about it for a couple weeks. I got so stressed out that I started having nightmares waking up in tears about random things like my siblings dying so I texted her and told her that I can’t do it anymore and that I’m gonna uphold something I said when we got together. “ if I feel like I’m gonna hold you back from being happy I’m gonna step back” so I did (yes I know doing it in text wasn’t the right thing at the time but I needed it off my chest. She came over that Saturday and we did talk about it completely finalizing out break up) she kept saying things like “it’s just your jellousy and controlling that made me this way” and that hurt cuz I was trying to make sure she was happy not myself. We tried staying friends but she kept sending tictoks about how not accepting poly was bigotry and how not wanting to let someone have another partner was controlling and selfish. I had enough and told her I felt like I was being attacked and harassed while I’m trying to price my life back together and trying my best not to let my depression and anxiety send me to the hospital again. She said I was over reacting I told her over reacting would be calling her and telling her to fuck off or to block her all I did was explain how I felt and asked her to stop sending the videos.

ipr8yelu	I participated in a fantasy league this year (NFL) a friend of a friend was the commissioner. The league comprised of 20 teams, all with $20 buy ins. Winner takes all.   This was my 4th team I was managing and honestly the group dynamic was pretty lame so I didn’t really participate much in discussions or anything. I also don’t know most of the participants, it felt awkward any time I participated in group text threads. Well it turns out, I won.   Commissioner *3 weeks after playoffs* sent me $240. I was under the impression I’d be getting $400. So I contacted my friend first and asked what the deal was. My friend reached out to the commissioner and was told “I didn’t get buy-in payment from everyone, so I awarded all of what I received”.   I expressed to my friend that I want the full $400 and my friend played Switzerland and said take your $240 and be happy or take it up with the commissioner.   So I did. I contacted him and let him know I expect the full $400 … doesn’t have to be immediately, obviously get the buy in from anyone outstanding … but I want it. It’s what I agreed to. Commissioner was really passive aggressively laughing at me and reminded me there was no binding contract. I kept pushing and he told me to “stop being an asshole” over this.   I obviously will never participate in that league again. But …. am I being the asshole here? Should I just drop it and move along? I feel duped.	1643142120.0	scmxzc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scmxzc/aita_for_demanding_full_fantasy_league_payout/	AITA for Demanding Full Fantasy League Payout
j0onoz1k	I play football and I'm a QB. About 2 months ago at this point, my team went to the state championship and we won. I wasn't pressured a single time in the playoffs, not one single missed assignment on my big guys up front. The only time I got touched was on designed runs.   The whole team partied after the game but I never felt like I got a chance to fully appreciate what those guys up front did for me. They put their bodies on the line for me to protected. I give some credit to them on me getting D1 offers. I was thinking about it for a while and I decided what I was going to do for them.  So I come from a wealthy family but have made some good money on my own in high school. Plus I'm going to college on a full scholarship so money isn't really a thing. A few weeks ago, to truly appreciate them, I took my five starting guys out for a nice dinner. That by itself was almost $500. And then after dinner I gifted all of them Louis Vuitton wallets. That came in around $2,000.   I didn't tell anybody about my plans, not even my parents. I thought everyone would understand it, everyone being my parents and teammates. But things did not go smoothly. Where to begin on what happened. A few of my teammates were mad that I didn't get them anything, even the ones that I hang out with more often. Saying that if I had to do something for them, then everyone should've got something. If I had done that, I'd have been spending like 10k, and that's not at all realistic.   My parents were more mad that I spent that much without telling them then they were at me doing it in the first place. They were on my back about it saying that's how you lose all your money, with grand gestures to friends and other people. This isn't something I've ever done before and probably not something I'll do again for anyone until way on down road. They aren't making me recollect but they're still a bit pissed.   I was just trying to do something nice for the guys who literally protect me from injury and have literally fought other people for me. I wasn't trying to play favorites or stir up any mess or problems.

4bd8v2n1	I'm writing this on mobile. I'm not a native speaker, we are from Germany.   So my fiance(28m) and I(26f) are together for 5 years, moved in fall 2020, got engaged in fall 2021. He works full time as a teacher and I'm part time working. Overall we have a pretty perfect relationship, we have had our ups and downs as any couple has. But if we face the downs we are always able to talk through it and find a solution. Together we have grown our communication and we truly value each other.  On to the problem. My lovely fiance has a hobby, as he should have. It's ping pong. He plays it since he is 16. I've known since the beginning how much he loves it: he rescheduled our very first date because of a tournament. So he goes to practices pretty often, 3 times a week plus tournaments on the weekends, sometimes both Saturday and Sunday. What really bothers me is his time management regarding his practice. For example: today he said he'll be back at 8:30 in the evening. It's currently 9:45 in the evening, without a notification that he will be late. I made dinner and it was ready when he would have normally been out of the shower. If he was home, when he said he was home. It's not everytime, but maybe six or seven times out of ten. Normally cooking takes one to one and a half hour and then I have to also clean the kitchen, because he isn't home when I make dinner. Ive told him how I feel about it and not like one time in 5 years. He promised me that he will do better and does it two or three times and then back to business. It seemes his brain stops working when it comes to practice. I sometimes call ping pong his side chick. It feels disrespectful, but I understand that he uses practice to wind down after a hard working day. So would I be the A-hole if I would tell him that I will not cook for him, when he continues to be late after practice, on these days?	1643143581.0	scnhrh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnhrh/wibta_if_i_tell_my_fiance_hell_be_cooking_his_own/	WIBTA if I tell my fiance he'll be cooking his own dinner after practice if he is late?
iwjvejmu	I (F47) am buying my house from my mom. I have been paying on my house for 12 years. Never once missed a rent payment, or been late on my rent. I have the opportunity to go on a cruise (free to me) with my cousin, within the next 12 months.   When I was excited and telling my mom about this opportunity, she got angry. She told me she would end our relationship if I went, and evict me from my house. There is nothing on paper saying I am buying the house, it is completely in her and my step dad's name.   I have to deal with her anger ANYTIME I want to go do something fun in my life. My husband passed away, (in our home) in December 2020. My children are grown, married, living out of my home and have their own children. There is nothing keeping me from going. I have been saving money to be able to one day go on a cruise.   I don't understand why she is acting this way as she as already went on a cruise, and other vacations. I was ALWAYS happy for her to have to opportunity to go to these places and experience these things in her life.

j0o3v0gy	My grandfather (my mom's dad) passed away recently. After he died my grandmother decided to move into a seniors community. She was moving from a house to a one bedroom flat so there was lots of items she didn't need. The house was pretty full and lived in because she and my grandfather lived in it for like 50 years. When we were going through the attic we found boxes and boxes of old pictures. My grandmother wanted to go through them. In some there were pictures of my mom when she was little and there was a baby in them or a kid younger then her. I asked her who it was because she doesn't have a sister, and she doesn't have any aunts and uncles so no cousins either. My dad said my mom had a younger sister but she died from cot death and to not say anything to my grandmother because it would upset her to talk about especially so close after my grandfather's death. At the time what my parents told me made sense.  After that I helped to move the furniture to her new flat or to sort what she was not keeping. I honestly forgot about the pictures. The next month I found one of my dad with a woman in a bridal grown. It wasn't my mom and I could not figure out why my mom's parent's would have a photograph of my dad at a wedding not to their daughter. My mom was there when I found it and she couldn't explain it then. The next day my grandmother told me the truth when I confronted her. My mom had a sister. She was married to my dad. My dad played away with my mom, who was his wife's sister and I was born from the affair. My dad divorced my mom's sister to be with my mom. My mom's sister went away somewhere else because my grandmother and grandfather wouldn't condemn the divorce and they are estranged and not in contact now for almost 30 years. My dad's parents also knew all of this and didn't tell me. My mom and dad never bothered to get married after his eventual divorce from my mom's sister.  I'm angry that the only family members I have, my parents and both sets of grandparents have kept this from me. I would never have known if I didn't accidentally see those pictures. My grandmother had thought they got rid of all the photographs of my mom's sister. My parents and my other grandparents have admitted this too and told me the same thing as my grandmother. My parents tell me it is none of my concern since it happened before I was born and doesn't affect me. I disagree such a big secret should have been kept from me plus I don't agree with the behaviour of anyone involved in this. Do you believe I'm right to be angry or are my parents and grandparents correct and I'm in error?	1643143689.0	scnj85	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnj85/aita_for_being_angry_about_my_parents_and/	AITA for being angry about my parents and grandparents keeping a secret and hiding a part of our family history from me?
cf76yikv	Since August last year I (16nb) have been paid £30-90 each month to babysit my youngest brother (1m) we were all happy with this arrangement, for the most part my parents don't have to worry about childcare and i get a chance to work without getting an actual job which isn't possible for me right now.  My babysitting duties are simple, all basic stuff like: cleaning, cooking, entertainment, etc and this month I've done all of that and more and yet today my dad told me I'd be getting significantly less than usual which I'm of course not happy with, i told him that it isn't fair to me when I've done my job and how he wouldn't be happy if his boss cut his pay significantly for seemingly no reason, he just ignored me  So am i the ass for being annoyed?

h5sg05u7	My friend ended up giving me a puppy. This is my first puppy I have owned so I'm trying to figure everything out for the first time. I own my own house, but I asked the two beforehand if they would be okay with a dog in the house. They both agreed. As some of you might know, puppies are a lot of work. She is still learning to be potty trained. Fortunately/unfortunately I got covid so I've been able to work from home the last month to take care of the puppy. I try to take her out 1 every hour or two, but she still poops and pees in the house. Unfortunately, my job has long hours, so I do what I can when I can. In the last month my roommate has complained about the poop and pee and continues to lecture me. He see it as pointing out stuff, but he accuses me of not cleaning up fast enough. I just came back from the store and I see some poop. I put away the groceries and then go clean up the poop. He lectures me again and how there was a stain on the stairs. Earlier in the week someone put a paper towel over the poop. Me having covid and not smelling it made a stain. I blow up on him telling him he is annoying the fuck out of me. He comes back saying he is just stating facts. So wibta if I kicked him out?   Ps: he got kicked out of his old place and says he doesn't know why. I should have pressed harder imo.	1643144305.0	scnr9z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnr9z/wibta_if_i_kicked_out_my_roommate/	WIBTA if I kicked out my roommate?
j0nu2v93	So I (32M) have been married to my wife Allie (33F) for 5 years. Her dad was a restaurant/business owner and her mom was SAHM. Both of Allie’s sisters got married to very successful guys and had kids. At the beginning of our relationship I was starting my own construction business. I wasn’t making a ton of money and Allie’s parents hated it. Her sisters always tried to set Allie up with their husbands friends. Her father disapproved of our wedding and forced Allie to ask for a prenup if she wanted help with the wedding. Allie also asked for us to have separate finances. We have had a loving marriage so far even with the rocky start. But whenever she visits her family I tend to not go.   So Allies dad made some bad investments, got screwed by his partner and his business took big losses. Due to this him and his wife are struggling to retire like they hoped. Allie sisters came up with a surprise for their parents on their 40 wedding anniversary. They would pay off their house and send them on a vacation to celebrate retirement. Whole thing would cost about 30K. Each sister would be responsible for 10K. Allie has always paid for things regarding her family and I pay for mine. She gets along with my parents however and will buy things for them sometimes. So Allie is a school teacher and when she found out the plan she asked me for 8k. I literally laughed. I said her parents were awful to me, thought I was a broke loser and you asked for a prenup. That our finances were separate because she asked for it and I don’t plan on changing it. Allie said she didn’t have the money right now but would pay me back. Which I know is BS and isn’t something I’d consider anyway. As I intend to not help her family out in anyway.   Allie and her sisters got on a zoom call to talk about it. I was called into the meeting and asked by the sisters to have some empathy. I told them I made my decision and then was berated. Her sisters went off how I’m holding a grudge still, how I should be willing to help my wife and how it’s just money. I said how neither of them have worked a day in their life (ones a STAM and one divorced their doctor husband and gets alimony). How neither of them gave me a chance 6 years ago. How neither of them are using their money either, just using their husbands like they always do. That Allie asked for a prenup because their dad thought I was a loser and now he needs my help. That Allie should managed her money better. I told them both never to ask me for a favor again.   After we got off the call Allie said she feels like I’m being unfair and petty. That I’ve helped my parents out before. (Which is true I bought my dad a new 30K truck about a year ago). I said that’s because my “silly” business took off and I can afford to do those things. And that her parents are her responsibility and I don’t owe them a thing. My parents think while I’m not in the wrong, laughing at my wife’s request was kinda an AH move.

j0pmjyuk	Okay, the title might seem confusing but I’ll explain. I, M18 and my bf M18 have been together for almost a year now. Things are great but I recently told him that when I was with him one evening, I went to his instagram account on his phone and followed ToxicReddit on there so he could see the posts, and he blew up at me. Throw away for obvious reasons.   It’s not as bad as it looks. I’ve been following the account for ages, reading up on the posts and keeping up to date on the craziest Reddit posts you can find posted on instagram. Through it, I’ve noticed some things that I do that I’ve managed to fix about myself (be less controlling etc). I felt like maybe it would help him too, I haven’t noticed anything toxic about him yet but you never know.   We don’t live together, and one day I went to stay over his house for the night. We were playing some stupid video game, he’s into that stuff for some reason, and he let me scroll through his phone (we’re pretty open with stuff like that). I was on his instagram, and I saw that a ToxicReddit post was on his explore page. I followed the account but never told him.   This was months ago, and whenever I see the ToxicReddit posts come on my feed, I see that he’s liked it, which lead me to believe nothing would be wrong with him following the account.   I owned up to it a few days ago as a passing comment, and he completely blew up at me. He told me that I was ‘controlling who and what he seees on social media’ which I think is ridiculous, since it’s just one account, not changing his whole feed.   Anyways, we haven’t spoken for the past few days because he wants me to think about my actions. So, Reddit, aita?	1643144760.0	scnxjg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnxjg/aita_for_following_the_instagram_account/	AITA for following the instagram account ToxicReddit for my bf??
32et5ib	I lost my father suddenly 2 weeks ago. He was in NZ, and I live on the other side of the world. I could not get home for the funeral and if I'm honest, I am struggling. I live in a small town and have 2-3 close friends here. When he died, they contacted me offering their condolences etc. But since then, I have heard nothing from them. I have passed them a couple of times and told them I am not good and I'm struggling, but still, I have heard nothing from them. All I want is for them to reach out to me asking me how I am and would I like to go for a drink or something. That is what I have done in the past for friends when they have lost loved ones.

1z6qex67	This is a problem I (20F) had at the end of high school but I don't know whether I was TA or not. It's one of the reasons I avoid visiting my parents.  I'm the oldest of four siblings, and one day my dad insisted that we were using too much toilet paper. He decided he wanted to limit us to a certain number of squares per bathroom trip and he said that no one should ever need more than 5 squares, even if it is "#2." I though this was ridiculous because I couldn't get my butthole clean with only 5 squares. Also, I have heavy periods that he refused to take me to the doctor for (I waited until I was an adult and went myself) and I couldn't clean up the period blood plus the poop/pee with only 5 single squares.  I argued with him and he got mad. He thought me and my siblings were wasteful, but I didn't feel like I was and my dad has a six figure salary. Nevertheless he said that if we used too much toilet paper we would have to start paying for it ourselves.   He also wanted to make us use a timer in the shower and threatened to shut the hot water off while I was in it, because my showers were admittedly long. I was very clumsy as a middle-schooler and one of my chores involved putting away dishes. Sometimes I would accidentally break some even though I was careful, and he would become enraged and yell that I would have to pay for them if I continued breaking them. My allowance was $2 a week at that time.	1643144837.0	scnyla	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnyla/aita_for_insisting_on_more_than_5_squares_of/	AITA for insisting on more than 5 squares of toilet paper?
j00zx5dy	My friend works in tech at a faang company, is pretty and we live in NC making her hot shit among our friend group. One of our friend has had a crush on her for years and never had the guts to tell her. Finally last weekend he got tipsy and told her in front of some of us that he liked her and asked her out. She straight up told him she wasn’t interested and didn’t want to drive him back even though she was the only sober one at the party(no she was not dd she just didn’t drink but it would have been nice). He had to sleep there overnight(because the cab ride was $70 and he couldn’t afford it) and was humiliated and I felt for him. Last week we met up again and this guy was avoiding her and I wanted to clear the air since I wanted to hang out with them both rather than switching events for them. I tried to get him to come but he said he didn’t want to things to be awkward. I asked her to talk to the guy and let her know they are still friends and she wasn’t going to make things awkward so he can join back up. She dismissed me saying she didn’t do anything but reject him and never said he couldn’t hang out with them again and it’s only him making it more of a deal than it is. I got angry because the guy has literally been avoiding anywhere she could be and she won’t even try to talk to him to make it so they can coexist in the same building. She thinks I’m an interfering and if I’ve already told our friend what she said and he still doesn’t want to come out then it’s his problem.  Then we got into an argument where she made it clear she didn’t see our mutual friend as any kind of long term prospect and even say him as a loser. I’m disgusted because she’s clearly just after a rich guy and her being rich doesn’t excuse that. I called her a gold digger and she told me I was jealous of her success.	1643144923.0	scnzsi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scnzsi/aita_for_getting_angry_at_my_friends_dating/	AITA for getting angry at my friend’s dating preferences?
992uuv3l	My (35f) son (13m) is friends with a set of twin boys (14m) who live down the street. They all play guitar. The twins share a 3/4 size Gibson that is about $1,000 USD brand new. However it’s in rough shape as they have used it hard since they were 5.  My son went over last week and these brilliant boys decided to play their guitars on their trampoline. I’m unclear how but my son accepted the blame for the headstock of the twins guitar breaking.  I went over to sort this out and the mom (Carrie ~45f) was very dramatic. This hit a nerve with me so I’m asking you all if I’m reacting unreasonably. She said the guitar has a lot of sentimental value and it’s super high quality etc. she pulled up a guitar on her phone with the same name that cost about $1,500 and said I could just buy them that. I looked at it closely and said it was a standard size that we were looking at and what they have is not. She commented that she didn’t realize I knew guitars. I’m not sure if she was just commenting or admitting that she tried to pull a fast one on me but I moved on.  Obviously I wasn’t going to pay $1500 for an upgrade for the twins so I offered to have it repaired. She gave me a half answer but wouldn’t give me to guitar. I took photos and took it to a local shop for a quote.  I asked for the value of the guitar before it broke and cost to fix it. He said the it is in such rough shape it was worth maybe $300 and the repair would be $400. He also thought there’s wood glue on it which indicates it’s been broken before and DIY repaired but he couldn’t be sure from the photos.  I told him the situation and he had a used guitar for sale for $900, also a Gibson of a similar caliber, but it’s in good shape and standard size. He offered to sell that to me for $500 plus the broken guitar. We also discussed a barter for him to fix it in exchange for some minor engineering work I could do for him.   Not sure what would be fair, I went to Carrie with the numbers and offered to pay $300. She would pay the other $200 and give up the old guitar for the full size Gibson. I figured outcome works out best for everyone. I pay/work the full retail value of the one my son broke, and she and the twins trade in a $300 guitar for a nice $900 guitar that’s better suited for them for $200. Basically they’re up $400.  She gave zero consideration and said I should just buy them the $900 guitar and make them whole. That she wanted to keep the broken guitar for sentimental reasons. I said that is 100% not going to happen and noted that the guitar had previously broken in that spot, which we didn’t deny. I offered to just get it fixed and she said no. She offered to accept $400 and I said no because I’d rather do some consulting than pay up and I feel like she’s just being petty.  Now we’re at an impasse but I’m not sure if I might be the AH for trying to find a mutually beneficial arrangement.	1643145040.0	sco1bj	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco1bj/aita_for_not_fully_replacing_a_guitar_my_son_broke/	AITA for not fully replacing a guitar my son broke?
8hnokh6t	Two important things to note: One, my mom has several health conditions; these include conditions that compromise her heart. Two, I have severe ADHD-PI. Because of this, I have a really hard time starting the smallest of tasks. Homework is especially hard; it takes me hours to complete an assignment that would take another person five minutes.   Yesterday, my mom went to the ER due to complications with her heart. Thankfully, she’s completely alright; they ran some tests and she was cleared to go home a couple hours afterward with some advice from her doctor moving forward. One of these suggestions was to avoid doing specific chores, as it would not be good for her heart. So today, after lunch, my mom asked me this:  Mom: “Can you wash the dishes?”  Me: “Oh, okay.”  Mom: “And can you mop the bathroom floors?”  Me: “… what? Now?”  Mom: “Yes. Come on, it will only take you five minutes. You know what the doctor said? He said I shouldn’t mop the floors because of my heart. I shouldn’t work but look, I still am. And I already cleaned the most of the bathroom.” \[Then she smiles at me sarcastically\] “*Seeeeee?* Aren’t you grateful that your mother still works? You don’t have to do everything yourself.”  Me: “Okay… Could I finish my homework first though?” (I barely had anything done, so I wanted to finish that before I did anything else.)  Mom: “*Ohhh*, here we go again.”  Dad, already sounding annoyed: “When will you be done?”  Me: “I… don’t know.”  Dad: “So at midnight? So it will be too late for you to do it?”  \[My parents laugh. I get upset.\]  Me, snapping: “OKAY! Okay, I get it, I’ll do it in a few hours … you could’ve just *asked*.”  I stormed off by then. There was silence, but then my parents started talking to each other in their first language by the time I went to my room. That meant they didn’t want me to know what they were talking about… AKA me. Which means I disrespected them again.  I’m trying my best. Even with my ADHD, I take college level courses, I’m in the top 25% of my grade, and I currently have a 3.8 GPA. I only achieve that to make my parents proud. Even though it’s so hard to even get up every day, I always try to push through life just for their happiness.  They know how hard I try. They know how much longer it takes for me to do things compared to a normal person. They know how much I struggle because of my ADHD and still made those jokes. I’m not trying to be lazy, I’m not trying to make excuses to avoid working, I’m not trying to be an ungrateful brat. It never feels like they understand that. It felt condescending, it felt invalidating. It hurt.  But did I overreact? Was I just being too sensitive? My parents already do so much for me and my mom just wanted me to do a basic task. The jokes weren’t even *wrong*, I take forever and I shouldn’t. And I shouldn’t be so reluctant to do something that only takes a few minutes.  I don’t know. I’m so sick and tired and overwhelmed at this point.

A girl from my classroom forgot to take her jacket, and as she was really cold, I decided to give her mine. My girlfriend knows really well that we're just friends and she's got a boyfriend as well. However, while we were talking about what we've done today, I told her about me being a bit cold because I gave that girl my jacket. She then lost her shit, said that I had better not told her, I ruined her evening and now she won't even talk to me. I don't think I am in the wrong here, I didn't see it as a romantic gesture.

7prz5tjr	players are me (34F), my husband (33M), my mother(71F) and my cousin (49M) also playing a bit part is our 8 week old baby.  My mother decided she needed to renovate, it started with the kitchen countertops, then a new back splash, then she decided she was tired of the hardwood floor (there was some damage from sun and water it did need to be done) and this has turned from the kitchen only, to include the bedrooms and finally redoing the entire main floor. All the way to our front door landing which ment the removal of several false walls where doorways used to be, the demo of a glass decorative wall in the hall way, pulling up the entire floor all the way to the living room and the partial demo of our wall that separates her space from ours. She did it herself with some help from my husband.  She told husband she needed a hand moving the furniture on monday from the living room into the bedrooms and then move them back as they did the floors. She recruited my cousin to help. She also told me he needed to take the baseboards off the opposite wall.  So last night Husband got home, we connected about our day, heard that the baby was freaking out, I was at my wits end trying to console her and stepped in. It was time to make dinner for us (I make dinner for everyone including mom)I go into our living room halfway through and husband is asleep on the couch, baby too. I can hear noise downstairs and I look out to see cousin has arrived and is getting started on moving the furniture. I go down and ask if he wants a plate, he declines. Mom shoots me a nasty look. I finish up dinner around 6:30 and wake him up to take a plate down to mom, while I dish up and eat, after I take this hands-free opportunity to grab the lifter and pull off the baseboards that were mentioned previously.   I go to return the lifter and here's where the fight starts, mom walks by and says "tell husband thank you for the help in moving the furniture/s" and I retort back with why didn't you tell him when cousin arrived or mention something when he brought down food. She says she shouldn't have to say anything it should just get done. I take off back upstairs, I take the baby and tell him it would be a good idea to head downstairs and take care of business, more yelling from both, He comes back up and is snappy with me saying how nice to go down to help only to be yelled at and he doesn't want to participate with her nasty attitude. I convince him to go back down and work with cousin. We argue about who is doing what, and cousin jumps in to take mom's side. "He knew he had to help and didn't say anything" I replied with she didn't say anything about time frames or expectations when you arrived it was assumed, not communicated to the right person and not followed up on. She said if we don't like it we can leave. (Her usual shut down phrase).  Should I have said something earlier?	1643145215.0	sco3r6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco3r6/aita_who_should_have_talked_to_who/	AITA who should have talked to who?
308l41b0	Backstory: I am an 18 year old boy who has family problems, my mother has ALS which means my dad is taking care of her all the time, so I have never been able to drive with my dad. I drove with him for like, 30 minutes.  That also means I didn't start driving until I was 18 last year in November. And I was having a blast! I was nervous at first, but that’s normal for students.  I did have a break from driving when Christmas came and didn't drive for a few weeks as lessons didn't line up, so it was safe to say, I was rusty with driving. (This is important.)  Now for the story, My driving instructor who will now be referred to as DI, met a few weeks ago and nothing has really gone wrong! A few hiccups here and there with turn signals and whatnot, but that’s expected, I'm new.  I was so afraid of crashing or doing something wrong to damage the car, I am a person who overuses the word "Sorry". I mean, I don't want to get in trouble, that's the last thing I want to happen! DI Said something to me during lessons, "Don't worry, this car is BUILT FOR MISTAKES." This quote burned into my mind that "Oh, I'm new, small mistakes shouldn't matter much because the car is cheap and old." Which is true, the car looked really old.   Cue today, and they arrive 10 minutes early, so I quickly get off and rush outside, get inside, and try to pull out of my driveway.  There was a problem though, my dad's car was in the middle of it and when I try to drive out, I get into a bad position, so I think "Okay, I'll drive just a little forward to try to get out of here" noticing the tree in front of me, so I let off the brake and the car doesn't move forward automatically because of the snow on the ground, okay... so I press on the gas lightly... at least I try to.  I hear the engine go loud and move my foot to the brake, or at least... I thought I did.  I drove right into the tree.  Mind me, I didn't drive too fast, I don't even think I damaged the car THAT much, but before I could even say a word, before I could say sorry and apologize, DI immediately looks to me  DI: "Are you a fucking idiot!?"  Now this... this hurt me HARD instantly, at that moment my mind tries to justify me doing this, and I pipe out  Me: "B-But I didn't mean to-"  DI: "Get out."  We bicker back and forth, me trying to apologize and stay in the lesson, as I want to take the lesson! he kept on pushing for me to get out and when I still protested, apologizing more, he yells out  DI: "Get out now or I will DRAG you out!"  I picked up my stuff and got out, storming inside in shock and a bit of rage as I tell my dad what happened, and he is in shock that I well, drove into a tree...  He tries to tell me why he would kick me out of the car and everything, saying he would do it too, and I just broke into tears, I hated myself for driving into the tree and cried for 10 minutes straight, saying sorry to dad and everything...  I just stand there, crying my eyes out, only calming down 10 minutes later…  AITA?	1643145437.0	sco6os	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco6os/aita_for_driving_into_a_tree/	AITA for driving into a tree?
7953h3ok	I know the title makes me sound like a asshole, but I’ll keep it short.  Last Monday I sold a ps4 pro that has one controller on fb marketplace for $195, it worked flawlessly, and it ran games quickly. The buyer came to my house, I let him inside my house and let him personally test the PlayStation out with games, and internet connections.  The guy i sold it to said that night that it doesn’t work, he has tried to reset it and he said that it doesn’t turn on, complete bullshit imo  We later set up sometime to meet on Thursday last week, he came to my house and I swear it felt like a different ps4, the controller was scratched up more too, and it didn’t turn on. while I was inspecting it a screw was missing which instantly blew a a red flag in my brain.  I didnt give him his money back since he said he “opened it to see if he could fix it”  AITA here?	1643145489.0	sco7db	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sco7db/aita_for_not_acceptin_a_refund_request_for_a/	AITA for not acceptin a refund request for a “broken” ps4?
j0onsfmn	Me and my spouse have a 16-month son who tends to go to bed later then the average child - not unusual for him to stay up after 22:00. I'm off the opinion we need to enforce better sleep hygiene while she is more laizze-fair.   Today she called me to come and help and it turned out she was swinging him in a carpet like hammock with her mother and got tired in the arms and wanted me to help her with it.   I did in a pretty polite but clear way refuse and say I didn't like it as it was 21:15pm - he should get ready to sleep - no "active" playing etc - so I would not partake. My spouse got clearly irritated and gave me the business and it ended with her half screaming to me "Get out!".   \- My pov is regardless if she disagrees or not she should understand that my point is valid. If it's valid and one disagrees one should not act that way back to their partner (including losing ones temper in front of the child. Therefor she should apologise (I'm sort of standing my ground here because it's one similar of many)  \- Her pov is that I should not say this at that moment, it ruins the mood when they have fun with the baby and I become a douchebag. And since I'm often not home this hour, this is how it's usually done and I know nothing about the practicalities and should be quiet.  I'm unsure to why but I've taken a stand on this hill and are willing to die on it - but if I do will I die as an asshole?	1643145823.0	scobvn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scobvn/aita_for_refusing_to_back_down_and_demand_an/	AITA - for refusing to back down and demand an apology.
j0otuua8	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I (32M) am child free. I always thought my little brother would be too, but he actually really likes kids. I always thought my SIL must be behind him feeling like that, but he says he’s the one who really wants them but I don’t know if I believe that honestly.  She’s currently pregnant with their second child and they already have a one year old. They were over to celebrate our dad's birthday and my mom told SIL she was sure she was exhausted and to sit down and rest and not help with the dishes. I fake pouted and jokingly asked why she offered the broodmare rest but not her son who’s been helping her all day. I expected my mom to laugh and sort of swat my shoulder like she usually would, but it was silent.   My brother asked me WTF I just said about his wife. I laughed it off and said to take it easy, it was just a joke. He demanded I explain what was funny about calling his wife a broodmare. By that point I was irritated and said they’re the ones who thought popping out kids close together was a smart idea and at this point that’s what she essentially was. He called me a disgusting immature asshole for how I spoke about his wife.   My dad told me to leave and my mom refuses to answer any calls or texts other than once to tell me she was disappointed in me. I really thought my family was just overreacting but now several of my friends are saying I was being an asshole to my SIL and that there was no reason for me to say that. I really was just kidding though, am I really the asshole just because my joke fell flat?	1643145709.0	scoacp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scoacp/aita_for_making_a_joke_about_my_pregnant_sil_or/	AITA for making a joke about my pregnant SIL or is my brother overreacting?
4cz41k2d	Sorry if my story is a bit all over the place but anyway, here I go. I'm getting married in the summer and most of our cousins are married or have a long term partner. One of my cousins (30F) is single and to the last family wedding she brought a tinder date.    Now I don't want that kind of situation on my wedding. I just don't feel like having a complete stranger there, but the problem is that in the country where my mom's from they usually give everyone a plus one. Where I live and grew up, people who are single just come alone and it's not uncommon to even invite only half of a couple (for example when inviting people from work, from hobbies etc.).   My mom told my grandma about not giving that cousin a plus one and grandma basically shut this idea down completely. Saying she's afraid this will lead to resentment, to that entire part of the family not wanting to come and them staying away from her as well (Grandma lives in the same country as they do, we live in a different one). So basically she's afraid this will ruin the family. She even said that in that case she wouldn't come as well. This really sucks and I normally have a great relationship with her, so this just really hurts.   So tell me, AITA for really not wanting this? Mom says to just give in, for grandma's sake, but I really don't feel like it...	1643145744.0	scoatr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scoatr/aita_by_not_wanting_give_my_cousin_a_plus_one_to/	AITA by not wanting give my cousin a plus one to my wedding?
j0oqf9zo	My gf of 8 months now refuses to let me drive if she’s in the car with me. She has told me multiple times I’m a reckless driver but I just don’t agree. I drive max 5-10 kph above the speed limit which is allowed and I follow all the rules. Only thing is sometimes I bit close to semi trucks and she starts frantically telling me to stay away from the them. She is always telling me there’s ice on the ground (we are in Canada so there is in winter) so I should slow down. Sometimes there is a tiny bit but I still have to drive at the speed of traffic which is usually faster than me. We got skiing and hiking a lot so driving is a big thing getting there and now she is refusing to let me drive insisting on doing all the driving because she thinks me driving is going to get her killed. But I’ve only been in 2 minor bumper damage no injury accidents and I feel like I’m a pretty safe driver. I’ve told her I don’t want her completely driving my car to get to resorts and hikes and she refuses to get into the car with me. Basically she told me as long as I don’t change my driving or let her drive she is going skiing and other activities with her friends. We are in a standstill because of this but I don’t see how my driving is reckless.	1643146101.0	scofkh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scofkh/aita_for_driving_recklessly/	AITA for driving recklessly?
i4hb7qc7	 So here goes I’m F(25) partner is M(28) been together over 5 years. Have two children 3 and 8 months.  I work part-time and run the household I came off maternity early with both kids and returned to work when they were both 3 months ish, he is currently unemployed has been since before Christmas. As it stands doesn’t have any intention of returning to work, but doesn’t want me to go full time either.  I do all the housework, pay all the bills bar one (internet he pays that, although recently I have had to pay that too), food shop, and majority of the things that involve the kids I sort/arrange.   Recently I’ve been feeling like I’m running on fumes, I’m overwhelmed, tired and I won’t lie I’ve been miserable and moody, and so have asked him if he can please help out a bit more with the kids and housework. Seeing as he is home and all he seems to do is play his gaming console.  All I have asked is that he  1) Tidies up after himself (he literally throws clothes everywhere round the house, leaves plates and rubbish everywhere)  2) If I cook tea, wash up after. 3) Get up when I’m working through the night with the baby. So three times a week. 4) Get up a little earlier to help sort the kids (one starts at 9 and he will literally get up at 8:45) 5) If I need his help or want to do something ie have a shower, can he come off his game so I can. 6) Contribute financially when he returns to work. 7) when the kids are in bed and I’m at work, just tidy up the mess they’ve made before going on game.  He thinks he does enough by watching the kids while I work on evenings, taking our son to nursery and occasionally bathing the kids. He said I should be grateful that he even does that much.   Whereas I literally get up sort both kids, cook, clean, do all the washing and drying, make sure kids have clothes/shoes everything they need. Pay bills, bail him out of debt.  AITA in this situation for just thinking he’s lazy and doesn’t do enough?

2u6ir3y0	I (29F) originally had court ordered mediation with my ex (32M) in regards to our child (5M).  After 3 hours of sitting on this call, it came to a close with us both verbally agreeing on a visitation schedule, tax schedule, and a bunch of stuff that is overall insignificant to the whole story.   This was a month ago, and since we had this mediation session, I’ve signed nothing and just waited. I didn’t feel comfortable originally and was asking for clarification from his attorney on certain matters such as dates for child support and tax filing for having dependents and such and they have been ignoring the mediator, myself and the court when trying to get this matter settled.   My ex makes 4 times what I make and though I’m trying really hard to not make this about money but about our child’s well-being, money is an unfortunate part of raising a child. I don’t want to raise child support, but I don’t think it’s financially beneficial for him to claim our son as he makes too much to get any of the child tax credits.   In response, I told the mediator that I’ve changed my mind about the original agreement and would rather take the issue to court so I can have some of my concerns heard and actually get an explanation. AITA?  TL;DR: Went to court ordered mediation, reached a verbal agreement there, then changed my mind after thinking about it.	1643146337.0	scoipu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scoipu/aita_if_i_change_my_mind/	AITA If I change my mind?
e9hia1ac	Can’t believe I’m posting about it, but I made a whole new account so people in my life don’t tie this to my main one.   I (23F) am visibly Muslim as I wear a hijab (no I do not care about your opinions I’m regards to my religion, keep those thoughts to yourself). I also live in the south of the USA. Thankfully, the specific city I live in is a large metropolitan one, so it’s incredibly diverse and I rarely run into any issues. However my friend, let’s call her Sally (24F), is marrying a man who’s family is conservative American.   Now I couldn’t care less about someone’s political views unless they start trying to talk to me about it or shove it down my throat, then in my opinion they invited me to the debate so they should prepare to to hear my opinions since they gave theirs unsolicited. Now the only time I don’t do this is when it could negatively affect someone else, such as a week ago when I went to Sally’s engagement party. Her in laws were loudly talking about politics, politics I didn’t quite agree with, but they weren’t talking to me and even if they were I wasn’t going to cause drama and a fight at my friends engagement party.   However during the party, I spent most of my time hanging out with a few friends, while Sally’s in laws kept looking at me oddly from the side of their eye. I try not to take it to heart, so I ignore it.   The next day, Sally calls me to thank me for coming. At some point in the call she seems nervous to say something, so I ask her to just spit it out. That’s when she admitted that I made her in laws uncomfortable, and as though they couldn’t freely talk with someone like me around.   I say sorry, but her in laws seem like blatant racists, but it’s not like I’m the one marrying them so if she likes them I hope she has a great wedding and I just won’t come. Now Sally was expecting my help during the wedding, as I freelance as a make up artist, so she asks if I can just take off my hijab for the wedding and do her makeup while not “scaring” her in laws.   Here’s where I may be the asshole, I tell her “no way in fucking hell would I ever change myself or compromise my religion for a bunch strangers, and I won’t step foot near them as I’d hate to “scare” them”.   Now she’s mad I offended her and her future family, and while my other friends say her suggestion was wildly inappropriate, I did promise to do her makeup for free, and with the wedding only a month away, I left her in a tough position.

cug5aj10	Hey all, this is going to be a long post so TLDR is at the bottom. Basically, this is my situation.  Before going forward please consider:  \- AG (aunts girlfriend) (22f) moved here without a job to be closer to aunt and cannot legally work in the country  \- Aunt assumes all expenses for AG  \- weekly chores include but are not limited to: bathroom, kitchen, floors, and taking trash out.  &#x200B;  I had suggested to my aunt that AG could move in with us (myself and my bf (27m)) while they got themselves sorted out and on their feet. It's been 6 months and AG is still living with [us.My](https://us.My) aunt still lives with her mom and is used to not having to do much around the house except clean up after herself, and AG grew up in a similar home. Aunt doesn't live here permanently, but spends a lot of time here.  At some point, aunt and AG decided they did not want to keep cleaning, so we had hired a maid to come clean every week. It's been a month since we stopped asking the maid to come clean and only my bf and I have been cleaning the house weekly.  I really don't want to make them sound like the worst roommates because they're really not. My aunt helps in driving us around when we need to do stuff because we don't own a car yet. I usually pay her for gas, but she has helped on more than one occasion without waiting anything in return.  Today, my bf and aunt got into an argument which escalated and my bf pointed out that we're the ones who have been cleaning and told her that if she didn't like the dirty floors, then could clean them herself considering there's 4 of us living in the apartment and only 2 cleaning.  They exchanged words, I told them both that I understood their points and agreed with both but that I was in complete agreement with bf and asked them to pull their weight. Aunt shrugged it off and said that of course I was going to be biased and would agree with bf. Aunt is still pissed off at my bf and now at me. I was caught in between.  I spoke with my bf and we agreed that this situation may not be working out as we thought and it might be best to ask my aunt and AG to leave. The lease is active for another 2 years and is under my name. I want to offer to give them back their part of the deposit out of my own pocket so they can put that towards finding an apartment.  So here's my question: WIBTA if I asked them to leave and offer give them their part of the security deposit out of my own pocket?  All feedback is appreciated!! Please feel free to reach out to me. Feel free to ask for more INFO. Had to cut some stuff because of the character limit.  TLDR; I had let my aunt's gf move in with us to help my aunt out economically as AG cannot legally work and aunt is paying for her rent/other expenses on one income. Now, they don't help in the cleaning of the house and my bf and I have had to assume this weekly responsibility and clean on our own. We now want to have the apartment to ourselves to keep the peace.

4rj3qy78	I hired a babysitter for my 2 girls, they're 1 and 5. She seemed great at first but she comes over high (I don't have a problem with weed but it seems like she is too high to pay attention to my kids). I allowed her to bring her 2 boys who are the same ages as my girls. The older boy is fantastic, we rarely have any problems with her. Her youngest is spoiled rotten and has started teaching my youngest how to throw tantrums which she never did before. He's destroyed things in the house and I've just replaced them and moved on while asking her not to let him in the front room where kids shouldn't be since it isn't babyproofed. She's allowed the 5 year olds to paint in the front room on the carpet of the house I rent. I ended up with pink splotches on my carpet. After that and a lot more safety concerns I told her she absolutely has to keep the kids out of there. She's left cleaner with bleach in the baby playpen because she used a bathroom product with bleach on the carpet for some reason. She gave my baby eggs that were expired and half cooked food multiple times. The eggs were partially our fault because we left expired eggs in the fridge but who doesn't look at expiration dates on eggs or milk? She has been paying less and less attention to the kids and allowing them into areas of the house that I've told her not to and I've gated them off since we havent had a chance to babyproof them yet. She found out I was in a tough spot at the beginning of the year and basically told me she wanted to watch the kids at her house or she was putting in her 2 weeks. I said no since people get shot in her neighborhood and it's not safe so she put in her 2 weeks. when she realized I wasn't budging on the issue she decided to stay. I've been looking for someone else and I had planned on giving her 2 weeks notice until today. Today I went into the bathoom to find a disaster made by one of the little kids. I can't get a straight answer about who it was but frankly I don't care. Bathrooms are not safe places for little kids since they can drown or get hurt. They had to have been in there for 3 minutes or more by themselves since she didn't even know the mess was there. At this point I don't believe my baby is safe and I don't want her around her so I want to get my key back and be done. My problem is, She doesn't have a lot of money and she has 2 kids so I'd be putting her in a really tough spot. Would it be completely awful to let her go with no notice since it's for the safety of my kids?	1643147108.0	scosmi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scosmi/wibta_for_firing_my_babysitter_without_giving_2/	WIBTA for firing my babysitter without giving 2 weeks?
hqkd3i6j	To give some context, I am a from a large South-Asian Family. My Father has several siblings and He is the youngest. My Parents looked after my Grandfather as he was growing older. Sadly, a year after my birth, my Grandfather passed. My eldest uncle took the sum willed to My Father claiming that repairs needed to be done on the ancestral house.     Two of my cousins (sisters) had a extravagant upbringing. I did not realize the difference growing up though I constantly felt this sense of superiority emanating from them.    A few years later, my sister cousins’ father (third brother) passed. Third uncle seemed to be the only sibling who had any affection for My Father and even paid for a part of His education. Third Uncle had a very high-paying job but his wife was a stay-at-home Mom. Their eldest daughter was working too.  My Eldest Uncle asked My Father to help. My Parents forked out a sum of over 5000 USD.      Cousin’s Family also received a massive amount through insurance payout.     Eldest Uncle continued to suggest that My Parents offer more money as the sister cousins continued to complain to the world about their financial woes and about how We could do more. All the while they continued their spending and extravagant lifestyle of salon visits, high-end gadets, trips, designer clothes and bags.  My Mother still bore no ill will against them and attended one of the sister cousin’s wedding and even gave a cash gift equivalent to the amount given a few years ago. It was not acknowledged and the third uncle’s wife just nodded and then complained to my Eldest Uncle (with a messiah complex) who shouted at My Parents for “treating the sister-in-law badly and ignoring her financial problems”.   Eldest Uncle asked My Father to relinquish His rights to the ancestral mansion so that it could be given to their sisters. The never aunts looked after my Grandparents though they swooped down on my late Grandfather possessions including his Rolex just days after his death.  My Dad wanted to keep a part of legacy and asked to keep his share which was met by insults.  Me and My Siblings are grown up and are independent young adults based abroad. We are not born into wealth but My Parents have worked extremely hard and saved. I had enough of their toxicity and told My Mother to not help them anymore.  Eldest Uncle acts as an enabler for the entitled family members. He gets to be a messiah without taking a dime from his own kids and splurging My Father’s hard made money.

j0pxc9cq	I (29F) have been dating my gf (Tina-27F) for two years. Tina has a dog, a German Shepard named Cookie that I adore. He’s a big dog and I was a bit intimidated at first as I‘ve never really been around dogs but he’s such a sweetheart.  Anyways, my brother, Jaden (17M) is staying with me for a few days because our parents had an emergency in a different city and because of a few reasons, he isn’t allowed to be alone for too long. Jaden is absolutely terrified of dogs. He’s working on this fear and he used to be much worse.   I told Tina that she couldn’t bring Cookie over to my house while Jaden was home because he was scared of dogs and she went “yeah yeah don’t worry about it”.  I believed she understood just how terrified he was as I made it very clear to her but I was absolutely shocked when she showed up at my house with Cookie.  I tried giving her the benefit of the doubt and reminded her that Jaden was inside but she said she was here because of Jaden. Apparently she read some post about how this girl went from fearing dogs to loving them after being forced to stay in a room with one. I explained to her why that was absolutely ridiculous with many reasons but she was INSISTING on trying.   I assume my brother heard us and Cookie’s barking because he came up to me and asked what was happening. I tried closing the door to explain but Tina kept it open and he saw Cookie. He tried to stay calm but the second he sensed the fact that Cookie was about to run in, he ran straight to his room and had a bit of a panic attack.   I’m thankful Tina had Cookie on a leash but I was extremely upset. I asked her if this was what she wanted and slammed the door in her face. I was very frustrated as the only one able to calm Jaden down is our mom and she was hours away. I managed but I was still upset.   Tina called me later saying I was really rude to her when all she was trying to do was help. Apparently I was dramatic and made her feel like her feelings are worthless. She said she didn’t mean to scare Jaden but heal him and that if I had let her into the house then she would’ve “cured” him and there wouldn’t have been a problem. Now, I love dogs and especially Cookie but I doubt this would’ve solved anything. I tried telling her this but she’s convinced I’m the asshole.

izi4x4lj	If the title sounds familiar, I’ve posted about this teacher before on a different account. He told me that I had to go to extra help every day, or else I was going to drown. So, I went today and I’m never going back. Much to the objection of my mother. Here is what happened:  I went to the geometry room at the beginning of lunch. The teacher told me to leave and then come back, so I panicked and nearly cried in the bathroom for 10 minutes. Some other students said that when they went for extra help and asked the teacher a question, he would say “kiss my ass” and then ask them to leave. So I was dreading it.  I came back into the room, quietly sat at a desk, and took out my homework that I had a question on. There were other students taking tests, and he was joking around with them when they were testing. I was about to ask him the question when this other teacher walked in, and the two of them talked about baseball for 10 minutes. As if it couldn’t get worse, this girl that he used to coach for basketball walked in and they made paper airplanes for another 10 minutes. When I politely asked the teacher to help me when he had a chance, he would say “wait!”  He sat at a desk behind me, and gave me these random problems to solve. He would look at my notebook and give me the same “look” that my mom gives when I curse. He said, “seriously, kid? How do you not know this! You’re killing me.” I was about to tear up, but I would not cry in front of this guy and show him that I’m weak.  When I got home from school, my mom was pissed that the teacher never answered an email she sent him. Yesterday the teacher gave us a lecture on how we’re 16 years old so he ignores all emails from parents, because we’re too old to have mommy and daddy to come and save us. I told my mom about this, and I told her that I’m never going to extra help again because the teacher tore me down and did not help at all.   My mom and I got into a huge fight, and she said that I’m too sensitive and was overreacting.

8qmwwej6	My first post here, I just want some outside perspective.  A little background first: I grew up in an abusive home and didn't learn to set personal boundaries or recognize abusive behavior, I was also incapable of straight-up refusing people until about a year and a half ago when I got therapy. I'm still unsure on most things connected to this subject, hence why I seek outside input.  A couple (maybe 6) years back, I made a friend via Fb, let's call him Tom. Tom was very attentive guy from the US about a year younger than me and we got along very well but over time, it became clear our interests didn't match. I often let him talk over me because he openly stated my interests were boring or just ignored them and kept talking about his things. Admittedly, he was one of the few people I had to talk to so I talked about the same few things a lot of times. We slowly fell out of touch, though Tom kept messaging me very often. I ended up muting his chat because he was getting overwhelming and would throw fits if I didn't answer soon enough. I still engaged him sometimes though. At one point he confessed he had feelings for me and I panicked and told him I saw him like a brother even though I never did.  About a year ago, I decided to revive some old contacts and invited Tom to my private Discord. Not only did he not get along with my friends at all but he would often crash our calls and talk about things I told him made me uncomfortable. I ended up muting him again. After a particularly upsetting incident (me discussing a sensitive issue and him making fun of me), I removed him from the server. I then sent him a long message explaining it didn't mean I hated him, but that we should stay casual acquaintances from now on. Tom flipped out, started berating me and insulting me, then I flipped out and yelled at him back. We both said pretty harsh things but what he did hurt me a bit too much so I blocked him.  It turns out that he'd somehow found my Twitter and Tumblr which I never mentioned to him and he started pursuing me there, apologizing, but I was fed up and blocked him. I told him to never message me again after what he told me. This was about seven months ago.  Today, which has already been a horrible day for me, I got a random friend request on Discord and upon opening it, I asked the person who they were and how they got my profile. They played coy for a while but then admitted to being Tom. He said he had to talk with me one last time and that he wouldn't give up. I told him to fuck off and blocked him again. Since then he's been making new accounts and trying to message me on Fb too. Until now I blocked at least 5 of his alt accounts and one account that claimed to be a friend of his sent by him. I cussed the friend out too.  My friends told me I was in the right but I would like an outside perspective. Should I unblock Tom and let him talk to me again? Did I overreact today because I'm stressed out?	1643147831.0	scp193	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp193/aita_for_flipping_out_and_not_giving_another/	AITA for flipping out and not giving another chance?
hp31k7uu	I (23f) have been best friends with Ella (23f) for around five years. We met in college and bonded over being sad and stressed.  Please note, Ella is extremely overweight. She has always confided in me about her insecurities. She feels that her weight significantly affects her social life, but most importantly her dating life. She shares that she will be “forever alone” for the rest of her life because she has never had a boyfriend or had any boy show interest in her. I am always supportive of her. I tell her that she is young and still has time to start dating when she feels ready to put herself out there.  In the past year, Ella and I haven’t seen each other in person after graduating, but we maintain our friendship by calling and texting pretty much everyday. However, she has been “ranting” more frequently about her weight and lack of dating experience since more of friends have entered relationships.  Six months ago, I started dating Jordan (28m) and Ella moved to a different state. Jordan is my first serious relationship. Before this, I had a few short-term relationships and many failed talking stages. Ella and I still talked, but I could not spend 3 hours of my night listening to her “rants” because I also want to give time to Jordan. Occasionally, I would share some of my relationship arguments with Ella. Ella’s advice every single time would be to completely break things off with Jordan. I found this strange, especially considering our arguments were often about boundaries we were still defining. Jordan and Ella have never met or spoken to each other.  Three months later, Ella began ignoring my phone calls and text messages. I was upset. I reached out multiple times telling her I missed her and asking her if everything was okay since I hadn’t heard from her. She assured me she was just “busy” but continued to ignore me. A mutual friend of ours, Mike (21m) suggested that she may be upset that I was giving Jordan more time. So I reached out to her again and asked her to be honest with me about why she was distancing herself from me so we could resolve it. She confirmed that she was upset that I was spending more time with Jordan and not her. We ended up resolving the issue. She even told Mike that we were fine and we spoke again normally.  Three weeks ago, Ella ignores me multiple times again, sometimes not responding for a whole week until I reached out again. Last week, Mike confides in me that Ella has been expressing to him that my relationship with Jordan has been the “cherry on top” for her not wanting to be friends with me. She even went so far to say that she wishes me and Jordan broke up and would not comfort me if I was sad. She also tried to convince Mike to not comfort me if I broke up with him.  I confronted her about everything she said about me and told her I would not remain friends with a miserable person who wishes misery and pain on others just because they have something she lacks in life.

45xxmxh0	I don’t know how else to word the title, but here it goes.   I (24F) have been with my partner Brian (26M) for over four years and living together for 2.   My job (employed for over a year)is very demanding and I am an intern so I often draw the short end of the stick when it comes to my schedule. Because I am in school for the field I am in I have two days off during the week (more like 1/2 a day when we are really busy) for class; therefore I have to work every weekend. I work every single weekend unless I request off months in advance.   I am also on call four nights a week which requires me to be at my place of work within 30 minutes of notification. Weekends included. And requesting off from working during the day doesn’t ensure I will be off from being on call during the night.   So on to the issue, without fail, Brian will always ask me “are you working this weekend?” He knows damn well the answer is yes but he has to ask me every week. He will also make plans to go do fun things with friends, ask me to come, and be disappointed that I say no.   I checked in with him to ask why he does this despite knowing that my schedule keeps me from doing events far away from us (like going to his friends an hour away). He said that he just wanted to “offer it to me in case there was a chance” but there isn’t a chance. Ever. Unless we plan for it.   I kindly asked him a few times if he could please stop asking me if I am working on the weekends and if I can travel all over the state with him. He seemed upset and still hasn’t stopped asking me these questions over and over.   I feel guilty for being upset because I know some people would kill to have their partner include them in their plans, but he’s trying to include me when he knows I’m unavailable. And I’m going crazy from repeatedly saying no. It makes me feel like a villain.   Anyway the judgement swings, I will accept.	1643147762.0	scp0d5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp0d5/aita_for_asking_my_boyfriend_to_stop_inviting_me/	AITA for asking my boyfriend to stop inviting me to go out?
2ltvobea	 So, firstly, some context. My partner & I are moving to a new place next month.  We will have more space than we have now as the flat is generally a bit bigger and we will also have an extra bedroom.  My partner has a small clothing business and currently has a studio space in the city we live in. We're moving to a smaller town, so she'll be having her 'studio' in the spare bedroom. (3 bedrooms. 1 for us. 1 for our son and the spare room / studio space)  Our bedroom is a converted attic space, and due to the shape, we can't have wardrobes up there. So we said I said we would have to put a wardrobe in the spare room / studio space, but she doesn't think there will be enough room for that and her stuff. So she has suggested that we put our clothes in the Living Room (which is larger than we have now but definitely not huge huge) with a curtain in front of it to hide it.  Long story short, I thought this was a mental idea and was shocked that she would even consider this an option. I just kind of said exactly that and flat out disregarded it. But she was unhappy that I wouldn't 'explore all the options before deciding'   Admittedly, I was a little brash with her to begin with, which i have apologised for, but I just feel very strongly that I don't want to have our clothes in the Living room so I'm basically unwilling to even explore that as an option.  So, am I the Asshole? Or is it absolutely proper mental?  She uses Reddit heavily and will almost definitely see this so, hey babes!	1643147858.0	scp1l3	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scp1l3/aita_for_flat_out_refusing_to_have_our_wardrobe/	AITA for flat out refusing to have our wardrobe in our Living Room?
izflad3r	I (20F) grew up with parents who are very old school. I appreciate them for fulfilling their roles as parents but my mom gave me trauma. I have 1 brother (26M) & he understands my pain to an extent. Since I was 16, she’ll call me all types of curse words. She did this at family events, she said this at my prom bc she hated my dress, she did this when I wore fitted clothing. She said I was a mistake & wished i was part of a different family. then acts like nothing happened next day. I was scared of her growing up so when she yelled, I didn’t talk back. if she was mad at my father or brother, she’ll come to my room to take her anger out on me. She ripped things off my wall, trashed my room, etc. My parents have old school mentality that girls clean & boys work. I was always cleaning & helping my mom while my brother & dad sat there. Even now that I’m older, it’s the same. my parents live on the 2nd floor, me in the basement, brother next door. I’m in college, work on the weekend & have a small online business. My mom yells at me for not doing the families laundry, not cleaning my room everyday, not cleaning upstairs (I don’t go upstairs bc I don’t have the key so it’s only my mom & dad). I can understand being upset my room is messy but she expects me to clean after the families mess & clean my brothers mess while he sits there playing COD. I only work on the weekends doing instacart bc it’s flexible hours but she’ll force me to drive her places so I’ll miss whole work days. Yet my parents don’t pay my bills, don’t give me $. Only thing Is I don’t pay rent & use my fathers hand me down car. She’ll clean after my brother bc he ‘works hard’ but soon as he’s home he plays COD for hours. I go to college for hours, work on my online business everyday, work instacart weekends, but that ‘doesn’t count’. Now that I’m older she expects me home by 8. If I’m not, she yells at me bc it’s late. She’ll make me stop anything I’m doing to pick her up from work & calls me ungrateful if I don’t but never asks my brother or father who’s home for hours. I wanted to go to college far away but She didn’t let me. due to COVID my father was sick so we couldn’t celebrate New Years. I asked her if I can see my bf, she said yes. When I got back she was mad I didn’t celebrate with her. She blew up my phone, said she hates me & im not her real family. next day acts like it didn’t happen. I notice now everytime she’s around me Im irritated. I want to move but she says I cant leave till I’m married. I want my own apartment but need a roommate & my bf tells me I should wait 2-3 years. I refuse to wait so I want to pack my bags & dorm & take out a loan without her knowing.

iugq6ncd	My sister has a wedding coming up this summer.  Its not a destination wedding, it will be in a local park/pavilion, she just told us about it recently and told us to expect the invitations, but we knew it was a possibility with as I heard recently her boyfriend asked our dad about how he would feel if they got married (essentially asking for her hand in marriage, old fashioned but I guess).    Well, when we received the invitations, it said this wedding will be "child free". Once I got my invitation, I called my sister up just to discuss the wedding and give her my response by phone. I didn't mention the child free part, just asked about the wedding and how her planning was going.  She seemed excited, told me she can't wait to be the "center of attention" on her special day.  I congratulated her, but I told her as its child free and I have two sons, I wouldn't be able to make it, I would send a gift with our parents though.    She kinda got upset and asked why I wasn't going to come.  I simply told her weddings are family events for me, and if its not a family event I don't see the point (i.e. kids being allowed).  Our parents are the important people to be there for her special day, so I don't feel my presence as direly needed.  My sister was very unhappy about this, she yelled that I never even tried to find babysitting or come to her wedding.  She got angry because last year I attended our cousins wedding, and she feels hers should be more important and one I should want to attend.    Their wedding wasn't child free, my kids were there, very well behaved and it was definitely a family event.  I don't feel that I should shell out money to have someone watch my kids, just to watch her get married and honestly I just don't want to.  I didn't mention her changing the rule, I just told her I wouldn't be attending.  She got angry and is now involving my husband and parents in my decision, saying if I choose not to come she won't speak to me again (her hill to die on, not my problem).  My parents would like me to come just to keep the peace, and my husband says its really my decision and he backs me either way.  Personally I don't feel like an Asshole cause I'm not asking her to change anything, I'm just making a personal decision.

i6p15dqj	TLDR at bottom!  My (26F) close friend (25F) Molly frequently has get togethers at her house. She lives with her bf and their roommate John.  She had a Christmas party and usually I know everyone there but at this event there were a few people that I didn’t. There was a girl, Sarah, who was invited because she’s friends with John, who I’m not close with. I don’t have a problem with him or anything I just don’t see or talk to him outside of going to their house.  At the end of the party Sarah pulled me aside and said something along the lines of “If you need any advice or help with domestic violence in the military I’ll give you my contact info!” I brushed it off and said thanks and added her on Facebook but I was kind of taken back at her saying that.  For some context, I left a relationship almost 2 years ago with someone who was in the military because he physically hurt me. I have since moved on and have been happily dating someone for 7 months now.  Now, Molly and I are quite close. We’ve always both been pretty open with each other and she knows about my last relationship so I thought she might have mentioned it to Sarah and that’s why she was offering her support. After Sarah left I asked Molly if she had said anything to Sarah and she said no. Molly said she had never even met Sarah before and Sarah and I didn’t even talk much at the party.   I’ve been pretty open with my immediate friends about what happened to me but it’s not like I go broadcasting that information out to everyone. It honestly made me really uncomfortable that she somehow knew this about me, and upon further investigation it doesn’t seem like Sarah and I even have any mutual friends other than John. Even if she was trying to be nice I don’t feel comfortable that she pulled aside a complete stranger to discuss a very sensitive and private matter of my life that I have no idea how she’s aware of. I mentioned it to Molly a couple times after she left how weird it was and Molly said “Yeah, we should just keep these parties in the family from now on.”  Flash forward and Molly threw a small New Year’s get together. They were discussing if we should see what anyone else was doing and John mentioned that we should invite Sarah over. Molly said “she’s not welcome here.” John was perplexed and Molly told him it wasn’t her tea to spill. I would have had no problem explaining what happened at the Christmas party but I was really anxious and having sensory issues from all the loud noises coming from outside at the time, so I didn’t really feel like explaining myself.  I never told Molly not to invite Sarah to future events, but I feel like it’s my fault Molly doesn’t want her around anymore. AITA?  TLDR: A girl my friend’s roommate invited to their party that I had never met talked to me about a past abusive relationship I was in. I told my friend it made me uncomfortable and now she doesn’t want her at their house anymore.

itqg2qn5	Sorry if it seems like im all over the place writing is not my strong suit   So I (M20) and My mother(F40) do not have a good relationship in my opinion as she just left me and my sister (F21) to our grandparents at the age of 10 and 11 and has been not very active in our lives. Along with that men have gone in and out of our lives when she did have us for a year or two. At the same time raising my younger cousins while I was struggling with school and my mental health. At my graduation from high school, she said she would be there only for me to get a call from her in jail and tell. me they were keeping her for 30 days because she didn't pay after telling me she did.   So over years i just slowly grew to not rely on her. This was only part of the shit that she has done, two years ago she introduced up to her boyfriend(M mid 40's) at the time and we were fine as we were used to her bringing men in and out at this point. But then she would tell us he hot her he was yelling at her and that he was cheating on her. Which to me at that time was scary to hear especially when I can't do anything.  About a few months after we meet him, he cheats on her and she leaves him which at the time we were relieved only for her to get back with him and get engaged and move to another state over. It took a few weeks for me to get used to it but then the calls of her trying to "convince me" into going and living with her out there. I always say no but she gets "upset" that I won't move my whole life. With some man who has anger issues.  Fast forward to yesterday night me my sister and my mother are all on a call and she just "asks us" if we wanted to go to Vegas to her wedding but she won't be buying our tickets to go out there. My sister was unable to spend money and with no means of transportation to Vegas said no which my mom took normally. She then asked me and I said no she sounded surprised that i said that and asked why in a childish whiney voice. And I tell her all of my grievances with that 'man' and her response was to just say "well, that is just your opinion" before saying she didn't even want to get married he did and that he thought he was dying so they had to get married. I got upset and hung up the call and turned off my phone. Before just crying to myself as I guess I had realized how much she just did not care what I had to say, she just wanted me to do what she wanted.   Some hours later I talked to my grandmother about it and she said it was wrong and that I should support her because she is happy, which I dont care I want her to be happy she can't just expect me to be happy with her especially with that man.

ibnak0tx	On mobile. Sorry for spelling errors  So this happened 5 years ago, but I “had to bring it back up.” This situation happened Sunday- To the story!  Back story: My (now 30f, then 25) brother (then 28m) worked at a sneaker store. He LOVES shoes. Our cousin (then 30m) also shares a love of shoes, but does not finance well, asked my brother to get him these limited edition sneakers. Also let me say, my family is very close and we all live in very close proximity to each other. My brother, great human but at times foolish, properly got and sent the sneakers.   They had a deal where my brother would send the shoes, THEN my cousin would pay. So obviously red flag. My brother waited for the money to be sent my cousin never sent it. My cousin posted online about the shoes, “he got at a great deal,” my brother asked for his money, blocked. My brother finally tells me, the situation because he ended up miscalculating his finances and was low on money, and he asked to see if I could get him his money, because my brother lives out of state. I ask my cousin for the money, he tells me, “(brothers name), should have known better than to send me anything expecting money in return.” I was fuming that he would be so rude.   My family owned a restaurant this time and as my cousin is telling me he’s never going to pay, he’s also telling me he was on his way for free food and gave me an order to put together for him. I told him he was no longer welcome unless he brought the shoes or paid. He said he wasn’t going to pay because he “didn’t have the money,” nor was he going to give up the shoes. He then LEFT FOR VACATION TO MEXICO. With his then gf now wife.   Five years later: So this past weekend, this very cousin got married and held a wedding party for family. Even though we haven’t spoken for 5 years, I went with my mom to represent our family and to meet his new one. My parents sent money in the name of our family. But, for some reason in front of all the guests he publicly thanked me and my brother for “not sending a wedding gift” for him and his new bride. So I said, “remember those shoes you STOLE from my brother? Consider THAT your gift.”  My phone has been blowing up with angry messages of how I embarrassed him in front of his wife and new in-laws. Everyone is demanding that I apologize because that wasn’t the “time or the place” and I should of let go of the past. But I’m not sorry.

iykq6pog	A little back story: my you get sibling came out to me and the rest of my family as non-binary about a 2 years ago (late 2019). Shortly after (like a week after) they got into a fight with our mom regarding moms reluctance to call them by their chosen name (Matthew for privacy purposes).  Matthew then contacted me and started badmouthing our mom saying that she would never change (again it’s been a week) and would never accept them for who they are. I was sympathetic to this, as I know how our mom is, she is very set in her ways. However soon after that, Matthew started attacking mom personally and calling her an abusive POS.  There was only one thing from our whole childhood that could really be considered abuse, but I won’t go into all of that. I was genuinely confused. Sibling then starts going on about how our moms political affiliation means that she will never accept them and that just showing support for that party means that they would rather Matthew be dead. Matthew then told our mother to consider them dead.  To me that was an incredibly horrible thing to say to you parent who has done everything for you from raising you by yourself to paying for your college (Matthew was the only child that got college paid for, and it was out of state because “community college is for stupid people”) and who was trying to understand where you are coming from.  I told my sibling that the way they were acting was asinine and you can’t just assume that mom won’t change because of her political beliefs. Matthew would not listen and I got angry and told them that I shared our moms political beliefs so that must mean that I can’t change either. Apparently that was the wrong thing to say to them, the only response I got was “you can consider me dead too”  Fast forward a year and a half later I have not talked to my sibling since then but I am engaged and getting married in 2 months. I reached out to my other sibling to see if Matthew would consider coming to the wedding as I would love to have them there.  Matthew asked how I could guarantee that they would not have to interact with parents, I told them that there was no way I could guarantee that and i would love if they could put their differences aside for one day and be there for me on my wedding day as it is probably the only wedding I will ever have.  Matthew has not responded to me and I’m wondering if AITA for asking my sibling to leave their comfort zone and be around my parents for my wedding.	1643149675.0	scpp8z	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpp8z/aita_for_asking_my_sibling_to_come_to_my_wedding/	AITA for asking my sibling to come to my wedding even though they are NC with my parents
j0r3uw7e	Throwaway cause some family know my personal account, sorry for format I'm on mobile, on with the story.  So my fiance (24M) and I (24F) are getting married in July of this year. I just got back in contact with my father (51M)  after a few years of not speaking. I also just found out that he is VERY transphobic, in his words he "won't call a rock a tree just because it thinks it is". For most people this would be a deal breaker for me but I want to give him a chance to be a part of my childs life because he wasn't a part of mine growing up.   He works in another country and originally wasn't able to come to our wedding but now, he is. Now, my soon to be BIL is transgender and has been out for the last few years. Everyone has accepted his identity and I love him like he's my own little brother.   My father has never met my FBIL and I've always just referred to him as his name/ he. FBIL is super open about being trans and is about to start hormones and I worry that if (father) finds out he will not be respectful.   I've spoken to my fiance about it and have decided to tell my father that my FBIL is trans and if he refuses to respect his identity then he will not be welcome at our wedding or any family functions FBIL will be at.

q7kzq9c	  The other day we had unexpected snowfall and I decided it would be cute to go outside and write a little message in the snow to send to my gf. I went outside wrote it and maybe it was in between me being super cold or just a brain fart or a combo of both i misspelled her name, it was just an “a” instead of an “e” for context. She texted back and said that i just hate her because I forgot how to spell it, I apologized, in my head though she was joking, obviously I fucked up for getting the letter wrong but it’s not like I don’t Actually know how to spell it. I went back out and redid it, spelled correctly with a little asterisk next to it, and I thought it was a funny little moment that would pass quickly. It didn’t though, and I was in no way trying to undermine her feelings either, I again apologized because she said it really hurt her and tried to reassure her it’s not that I didn’t know how to spell it, it was just a moment. I had literally texted her her name maybe a day or two before that for reference. She then went on to say it’s hard for her to believe that I truly love her if I can’t get her name right, and said “so i should never wake up again then”. At this point I decided it went way too far and told her that I apologized and that’s all i can do, and that she has the right to accept or reject it, but using manipulation like that was unacceptable and not something I am going to entertain. She then went on to say that she wasn’t being manipulative, that she was just asking for reassurance and that’s the best way she knows how, and asked what was she trying to manipulate me into doing. I couldn’t answer her with anything specific, because in that moment no, she wasn’t trying to get me to do anything, but in my head im shutting that down now before it gets to that point because she frequently uses that tactic with her family and friends and that’s just not something I want to fall into. Anyway, I acknowledge that I messed up in spelling her name wrong but is she overreacting?  TLDR; I misspelled my gf’s name once in our 1 year relationship and she sees that as me not having any love for her and has been dragging the conversation on for days.	1643149810.0	scpr0u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpr0u/aita_i_20m_accidentally_misspelled_my_gfs_19f/	AITA: I (20M) accidentally misspelled my gf’s (19F) name and I feel like she is overly upset, and being manipulative.
gvleoqlf	before you read this, my laptop wont turn yellow (my layover colour) so my dyslexia is kicking in and its hard for me to know what i wrote.  So, this happened last night and my dad has been complaining about it since i got home. i have a best friend who i have known since i was 4, he is practically family to me. i have always go on holiday with him and his siblings and he always comes with us. our parents are also good friends and our mums have known eachother since high school.  his dad unfortunately passed away a couple of months ago, and because his mum was struggling with 3 kids and none of her siblings or parents around, in early december they decided to move to Australia (where his Mums family live.) we were both devastated however knew it was for the best. they left 3 days ago and landed some time yesterday.  last night, when my friend first found his phone (he lost it in his bag) we called. this was about 1pm Sdeny time however 2am uk time. my dad heard me laughing and came storming into my room asking what i was doing and why i was awake because i have school in the morning. i told him i was calling my friend as i miss him. my dad took my phone off my and all my other devices and left. hes now saying i innterupted his sleeping and how im going to fail my tests because of my sleep lacking.    so AITA?	1643150009.0	scptsl	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scptsl/aita_for_calling_my_bestfriend_despite_it_being/	AITA for calling my bestfriend despite it being 2am?
hb708fuy	i (16 non-binary) am the oldest of four children (14 male), (13 male) and (9 female). From a young age i have been told that i will go to university because i’m not allowed to “waste my brains” and have always been ushered away from anything artsy or musical, being told that it won’t take me anywhere. so, i have made plans to move states by myself next year, at the age of 17 to “follow my dreams” of becoming a paediatric oncology nurse in one of my states top hospitals. this morning i asked my brother (14 male) what he would like to do at university and he said he wasn’t going, my mum agreed and i was honestly gobsmacked. from such a young age it was pushed on me that i was the oldest and had to pave the way for my siblings, so is it wrong for me to want my siblings to “go places” the same way i was forced to?	1643150385.0	scpyzf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scpyzf/aita_for_wanting_my_siblings_to_go_to_university/	AITA for wanting my siblings to go to university?
7lxiy	So a little background, I live in an apartment complex in the downtown area of a major city. I received a formal complaint 3 weeks ago after I had friends come over after we had gone to some bars, we ended up hanging out at my place and drinking until about 3 am when people started to head home. I received it from my landlord the day after and felt I was pretty understanding. Told them I would cease having people over late nights. I'm in a studio so I understand there isn't a ton of sound insolation in my unit, probably not the best idea to have people that late.  They also informed me that the tenant said they could hear me playing music during the day as well and that that was too loud. That I was a little surprised by since I don't think it's too loud, I mostly just listen to music while I'm working during the day (WFH). However, same idea, it's a studio and my speaker (which is just a small portable bose speaker) was sitting close to the wall. I've since moved my speaker to the center of apartment and away from the walls and have been trying to play it quieter. I also gave the landlord permission to give the other tenant my phone number so if there are ever any more issues they can always text/call me and let me know that I'm being loud.  Like I said, it has been 3 weeks since then and I believe I've been pretty well behaved when it comes to noise. However, yesterday I received another formal complaint from my landlord. My landlord was really nice about it and said that they called again Saturday night at 1130 saying I was being loud again. That Saturday night I had two friends over (who also live in the building) so we could just watch the NFL playoffs together, the game finished around 1130 probably and they left not too long after. We weren't partying or anything, just sitting on my couch watching football.  I also learned from my landlord that they tried to give my neighbors my phone number and said they were free to text me, but they had no interest in texting, calling, or coming by themselves. They wanted to limit any and all contact to be had through the landlord.  I can totally understand their initial complaints from 3 weeks ago, and perhaps after that it's just a situation where they're on edge in regards to noise coming from my apartment, but I can't help but feel that after the last complaint that they are being a little overbearing. It just feels unreasonable to me if they think me having 2 friends over at 11 pm on a Saturday to watch TV is overstepping boundaries.  What's more is that I really want to find the best way to make this work, but the fact that they refuse to talk to me directly makes this way harder. With the landlord having to be a middle man I'm almost never going to get immediate feedback on when I'm being too loud, and if 3 guys sitting on the couch casually watching TV is too much I don't know how I'm supposed to proceed.

13m5jo	I'm 20 and I live in a room in my parents basement. Didn't have work today and I felt sick so I decided to sleep and chill all day. Around noon, my uncle and mom comes in with my 5 year old twin cousins. They both have autism and get hyperactive sometimes. One of them goes to a school near my house so sometimes they drop by before dropping him off. My mom tells me to make sure they don't go into her living room or ruin anything before going back to work while my uncle stays here with me.   30 minutes pass and my uncle goes to drop one of the boys off. I watch the other one until he comes back. I'm thinking they're gonna leave, but they stay for 4 HOURS until the other boy is put of school. This is no problem to me. While they're there, they watch TV and I give the other twin toys and stuff to play with. Still feeling sick, I go back into my room and lay down for a couple of hours.   Whrn I woke up, my uncle was sleeping and the twin was playing with glass figurines on a shelf. One of them was broken. I took them away from him and gave him something else to play with. I then go upstairs and notice that he left shoeprints all over my moms living room. The floor is waxed wood that she takes care of regularly.   Eventually, they left and my mom came home. She was pissed and blamed me for not watching them, even though my uncle was asleep. She says that she told me to watch them, making me liable for their behavior, not my uncle.

j0qhudcp	I (29m) have known this girl (33f) for years, we weren't "close" friends but we once worked in the same place and were friends on social media etc. About two years ago we started chatting and decided to go on a date but we live in different cities and pandemic etc got in the way. Our talks were really open and honest about stuff and she was always upfront which I liked. Anyway we were talking over messaging about our recent sexual pasts and I asked her where was the wildest place she'd ever had sex. Her answer was pretty wild, and I asked if that was when she was in a relationship or a hook up. She answered a hook up and that surprised me. Anyway she asked why I asked and I replied "it just seems like something you'd do with a long term partner that's all *shrug*" She then said I was being judgemental, and that really irritated me because I'm not judgemental at all about sexual stuff.  I said I wasn't disgusted or anything just surprised, because I would have assumed she'd be in a relationship with someone because this is something people in long term relationships do to spice it up (it was a public place). She just wouldn't believe me, she said it was obvious I had an issue otherwise I wouldn't have asked if she was in a relationship at all. So I told her I was sorry she had interpreted it that way, and she got even madder and said that wasn't an apology. It lasted for literally hours with her accusing me of being judgemental, and while she acknowledged I probably didn't mean to, I'd still hurt her feelings, and it shouldn't matter what sexual stuff she did whether she was in a relationship or not so why did I ask unless the answer mattered to me. I said it wasn't common for people outside long term relationships to do wild sex stuff like that and she said she didn't think it mattered, and she asked if I would say that to any of my guy friends.  This was literally hours long argument, so I got mad as well, and told her she wasn't right in the head and this was part of an anti-male agenda she has, because she was effectively calling me a misogynistic pig which I'm not.  (For context: she's come out with anti male generalising stuff before, like the other night she kept complaining about a guy in her hotel who kept inviting her up to his room, but she was saying stuff like "I wish men would just take no for an answer" because he kept on at her. I said she must have looked nice like, and she dropped the subject). Anyway I said it was nice knowing her, she said the same and she blocked me. I don't think being surprised by someone's sexual past makes me an asshole, but it came out wrong and she wouldn't listen, so maybe I dodged a bullet here?

j0scah2m	I (f29) got married to my partner of three years (m28) last weekend. We wanted our wedding to be untraditional, and we had decided we wanted tiers of cupcakes rather than a normal wedding cake. We married on a Friday, and on the previous Wednesday morning, I went to a local bake shop to pick up my order of 120 cupcakes. I had specified that they were all to be vanilla cupcakes with white frosting in the center that would ombré into the outlines of the cupcakes' frosting which would be black. When I arrived on Wednesday at 7:30 AM, I found that they were nothing like I had ordered. I asked why the frosting on top was completely black, and they said that the cupcakes were filled with white frosting *inside* and topped with black frosting. I explained how it wasn't what I asked for, and the worker (a probably 70-year-old woman) agreed to have my order redone by that afternoon, except I'd still have to pay part of the price of the first cupcakes since my "directions were unclear."  I reluctantly payed and then came back at 4:30 to yet again find cupcakes that were NOT how I asked. There was no ombré design at all; just a white circle in the middle surrounded by a chunky black outline. I pulled up a picture on my phone of how I had wanted them to look, and to my surprise, some of the workers there were kind enough to stay at work late to fix my order (and this time I didn't have to pay). I assumed they would bake the cupcakes then and call me in the morning, so I was again surprised when they called me that same day at 6:00 to tell me my order was fixed. When I got there, the cupcakes were finally pretty much just as I had imagined them. I asked how they got them done so quickly, and to my shock the said they literally scraped the frosting off the old ones and redid the frosting. "I hope that's okay" says the same 70-year-old lady as earlier (she should've said that they'd do that BEFORE she "fixed" them). Upon further examination, I noticed that there were obvious imperfections in many of the cupcakes, and you could see staining from the original layer of frosting. I did not accept these cupcakes and yet I was told I had to pay FULL PRICE for them because of all the trouble I supposedly caused the workers. I asked if I could talk to the manager about my situation (I promise I'm not a Karen), and lo and behold, I was already talking to her, the 70-year-old woman. I had nothing else to do but pay nearly $200 for nothing.  The next day I found a different bake shop and they completed my order properly first try like any normal bake shop would be expected to do.

90ivz634	I was having a casual conversation with my mum the other day regarding eating out, and I briefly mentioned that me and my brother bought some pastries on the way home from our vaccinations, around a week ago.   My mum seemed slightly taken aback by this, and asked who payed for them. I told her that we each payed for our own pastries. She then seemed really shocked and told me that what I did wasn't natural, and that I should pay for both pastries as I am the oldest sibling.   At first I took what she said in-stride, and told her that yes, next time this happened I would offer to pay first. My mum didn't seem satisfied by this, and she just kept talking about how I should just do this kind of thing without thinking, and the fact that I didn't showed that me and my brother were "missing something". When I asked her why she was making a big deal over a pastry, she said that "it's not about the money, it's about some special bond which me and my brother don't have". She ended the conversation by saying that what I did was "so alien to her that she just couldn't understand it".   At this point I started to get frustrated that my mum was making me feel like an asshole over what I didn't think was such a big deal, and I just left it there and walked away.   Now a few days later my mum's still bringing it up. Any explanation or excuse I give is just met with the same old lines as mentioned before.   Some additional context: I'm 25 and my brother's 18. We both have our own credit cards which is what we used to pay. Our parents are from India and we've spent the majority of our lives in the UK, but I've never heard of anything like this in our culture before now.  I don't mind offering to pay and all, I'm just frustrated that my mum's making me out to be an asshole over not thinking to do it, and she won't stop mentioning it.

f9z7aeh5	Hello!  Trying to see if I am the asshole in this situation-for telling my now ex’s mom bout how he verbally abused my mom.  My ex and I broke up in November (on my bday after he basically acted like it didn’t matter and when I pointed it out, he yelled at me…but that’s a different story).  We were together for 2 years, lived together where I basically paid for everything, while he constantly lied to me bout applying for jobs.  His mom and I became close and talked frequently. After we broke up, we unfortunately had to live together for another month due to him not having $$. During that time, I guess we talked it and became “civil”. After he moved (I helped him pack and move everything, and even got the uhaul since he can’t get a new license due to a court case) 😑 A few weeks ago, my mom was stranded at the airport in the town he lives after delays and I didn’t want her staying the night in the airport, and since he was coming back to the town we lived the next day to pick up more things, I asked him if he could get her from the airport and let her stay on his couch and drive her down (since he was going to anyways, and I sent him $50 for gas).  Well my mom and I don’t have the best relationship, and this is something i’ve vented to him bout when we were dating. After he picked up my mom, he decided to basically verbally abuse her by calling her a terrible mother and yelling at her. like she called me from his place crying and scared. when I asked her to have him the phone, he knocked it out of her hand. she requested to go back to the airport to spend the night.  his idea of “apologizing” was “sorry for disrespecting your mom and you” in a text to me.  His mom and I talked the following day, she calls me once a week and I basically told her the whole mess.  Now he’s upset with me for telling his mom how he yelled and berated my mom.

75olg6cp	hi, i’m going to delete this after in case it gets too much attention but here’s the gist of it. me and my ex (C) broke up our long distance relationship after a lot of arguing, i felt unheard and unloved towards the end. we’ve been still talking as friends and hoping to get back together again. C has a younger sister (17) who has a bf (R)  Now R doesn’t follow me on insta, but he always viewed my story. i was weirded out by this, and asked C who i was still with at the time, who this guy was. he said it’s his sister’s bf and he’s a nice guy. i, not impressed by this, said it’s weird for a guy with a girlfriend to constantly stalk another girl let alone his girlfriend’s brother’s girl. C told his sister and she told R to block me. great  a week after he blocked me, he unblocked me and continued. i then received a message request from him without a message. and today i got a dm from him saying “hey👀”. i showed C, and he showed his sister. they made comments like the screenshot looks edited, the font is different etc, i said i have a different phone so obv it’s going to look different. R is saying it wasn’t him and that someone must’ve made a fake account pretending to be him. i said no bc it came from his actual account. he deleted the message and blocked me .   C is saying to give him my instagram password bc he can check if R actually dm’d me, and said that R passed this check and came out free, it’s just me left who looks guilty. i said no, bc once i let C borrow my phone when he didn’t have one, and he went through all my messages, media and private conversations. i said i’m not giving my password bc of that and we’re not even together.   the last message C sent was “get lost you liar don’t talk to me again.” i feel really sad that i spent years with this person and i’ve never lied to him, and whenever i told him something he did that i didn’t like, he’d call me a liar then as well. it feels like when i say “hey this bad thing happened to me and it’s really hurt me” nobody believes me. i’m wondering now if i should have just given the password?	1643151315.0	scqbm9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqbm9/aita_for_not_giving_my_ex_bf_my_instagram_password/	AITA for not giving my ex bf my instagram password?
ay1w0mv2	I have three children \[12m, 10f & 8m\], all of whom I have full custody of. We also have a dog. My partner does not live with us, but he spends most nights at our house so he knows my kids well. He gets on with the boys, albeit not as well with my daughter, and is capable of looking after the dog.   My father died of pneumonia last year and my mother has not been coping well. My sisters and I have been unable to visit recently as she has been ill, but one of my sisters still does her shopping for her. I received a phone call from my sister two nights ago telling me my mother had fallen down the stairs and badly damaged her hip.   Immediately, I wanted to jump in the car and go, but that was not possible. I spoke to my partner and asked him if he would be alright if I left him alone with the kids for the night.  Realistically, all he would need to do was cook dinner, drive them to school and make sure that the boys don’t attempt to kill each other. He has a daughter \[26f\] so he has parenting experience, but he thought that it was unfair of me to spring this on him. What if he had had plans? He told me that I seemed not to care about his time and that I should have a babysitter ready for things like this. I asked him again if he’d do it and he said no, so I asked him to leave while I contacted a friend, who agreed to come over and watch them.   I’ve spoken to my sisters about this and one agrees that it makes sense I would ask him, he’s always at my house anyway, but the other thought it was unfair of me and that he would probably have wanted to be invited to visit my mother with me instead.

hadgpqzm	My mum's first kid is my brother, whom she had with her then husband. The divorce went well, and they co parented. She married my dad, who is German, and had me when my brother was 7.   My parents have now been married for 20 years, and my mum has never lived in Germany. She's visited, but never lived. And now my brother makes "jokes" about it. He says stuff like "what's the point of marrying him if after 20 years you still don't have an EU passport", "20 years down the drain" and stuff like that.   These comments hurt mum's feelings a lot, especially because my brother doesn't understand or doesn't want to understand that the entire reason why our mum didn't move is because she had a kid who she loves and didn't want to fight with her ex over because she suddenly wanted to move to a foreign country.  These comments increase in certain situations. I remember when mum and dad wanted to travel in 2017, mum had to apply for a schengen visa again because hers had expired and the comments my brother was making were horrible.   Mum and dad celebrated their 20th anniversary with a small dinner last week - just me, my brother, SIL and my mum's siblings. Literally the day afterwards my brother starts with the comments. This time I get really pissed. We fight, even though my mum begs me to let it go. She's even more upset that my dad sided with me instead of her this time.   She tells me she knows I was standing up for her but she would really prefer if I go and makeup with him. But I really don't feel like it. He's just going to do it again if I apologise, and honestly I'd rather not speak to him for a while. My brother hasn't spoken to mum either since and I have a feeling he's not going to until I apologise.	1643151359.0	scqc7h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqc7h/aita_for_getting_upset_at_my_brother_for_the/	AITA for getting upset at my brother for the horrible things he said to mum the day after her anniversary dinner even though she didn't want me to?
j0t0swty	For context, my friend and I are virtual friends. We met via gaming and twitch, and became friends really quickly. We bonded over our mutual love to gossip and spill the tea, enough so that I decided to fly them into visit IRL. It was a good enough time, we road tripped and karaoked our way through fun, but it kind of descended into chaos when on the last day together, they got so shit faced that I found second hand embarrassment as my roommates had to help him up off the floor and to bed.   &#x200B;  This wasn't the end all, though. From my understanding (this is solely through the grapevine, as apparently this friend of mine either withheld or straight up lied to me) , this friend was engaged and the relationship ended. They were fairly and reasonably upset, and I tried to cheer them up where I could being several states away. That's when the real problems started to rise.   &#x200B;  Not only did they become emotionally distant (to be expected, honestly), but they started lashing out. Not at me, per se, but my other friends, and roommates. They were confronted by not only me, but other mutual friends, of which they proceeded to rebound their own troubles, telling said mutuals that  their problems only compounded his problems. This was a bit much for me, because I don't tolerate gaslighting behavior.   &#x200B;  At that point, my mutuals and I created a discord channel to be able to commune where this friend was not allowed to interrupt any conversations with negativity or perceived hostility. I understand that this is, to a degree, inherently petty, but it has come to us needing what we feel is a safe space free of this friend in order to enjoy ourselves. We cannot play games, or be around this friend without the situation becoming toxic and negative and it's emotionally exhausting. This friend hardly attempts to connect with us anymore, and constantly lurks in twitch channels. So am I the asshole for essentially separating myself from this friend to give it space and time?	1643151508.0	scqe76	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqe76/aita_for_ignoring_my_friend/	AITA for ignoring my friend?
izara0ay	I (19F) have always wanted to work in the medical field. I love helping people and have always been better at biology, chem, etc. In high school, I did the medical track our school offered and got awards for having the highest grades.   However, when I was signing up for colleges, my parents strongly opposed. My older brother(27M) was a compsci major and right after college, he was offered a job at Apple. He makes six figures andworks an "easy" job.   My parents told me that the medical field is a bad option and kept pushing computer science on me. They literally wouldn't let me turn in my college application and started telling me to leave the house and stuff during the lockdown. We argued and compromised. I would finish the major as long as they would pay the tuition and I could do whatever I wanted after getting my degree.   Fast forward:  First-year was horrible. I had such a hard time learning how to code and was basically struggling in all my classes across the board. Being in the medical track, I hadn't touched calculus since 9th grade and the other classes weren't better. I was very depressed. Second-year. I have a better grasp on my major but one thing is clear. I hate it. I hate sitting in front of a computer for hours, I hate coding, and I feel so isolated.   Yesterday, my mom tried to force me to apply for a compsci internship, as if I'm not depressed enough with my compsci classes. I told her no and that I wasn't going to pursue compsci and was looking into medical schools in Korea (cheaper and have family there who are supportive,) to which she called me an AH, saying I was wasting her money.

9fxgzvrq	I (F29) have been with my partner, 'Andrew' (M29) for 6.5 years. Andrew for the last few years, really struggled with his temper and he would lose it in a horrible way (breaking doors by putting his fist through them, shouting, breaking a windshield etc.).  In addition to this, there were other instances that really broke my trust and he made me no longer think of him as my safe place. This was all exaggerated through my own personal trauma of a very angry father who would shout at nothing. This all came crushing down when we were at Andrew father's house where he ended up breaking a door. I had begged him to calm down, I never shouted back, I shut down completely and waited for his range to end. I realised that my response to his anger was irrelevant. I was completely in the mercy of his range and of when he will manage to calm down himself.   After that I left. I was away for 1 month and arranged a flat to stay close to some close friends in a completely different city.  He started going to a counsellor and he has now understood how wrong he was, with the temper and other things, and they explored where the anger was coming from (also unresolved childhood trauma, that meant he never learned how to express his emotions in a healthy way). I decided to give it another go, provided he continues with the changes that he has set out. In addition, I opted to still go to this other city, and give myself the space to think and forgive him because this would never work until I do as I will just keep banging on about his past mistakes. Since we got back together, he has been wonderful. I just want to ensure that this change is sustainable.   However, we had a discussion the other night on the back of me saying that I enjoyed meeting some people and thinking of having my 30th here, in this city as I now have more friends here. He poured his heart out and explained that he feels it's really unfair for me to just go away and abandon all our responsibilities (we are moving house, we have two dogs etc. which he is now looking after). I explained that even though I decided to try again, there are still a lot of unresolved feelings and in order for us to ever be in a healthy relationship I would need to let these go and I haven't yet. He can't understand why I can't take space and time to forgive him while in the same city.   I now have doubts. AITA here? I just left everything behind and left him deal with everything that we had both committed to do.   So AITA?  TLDR. partner has anger issues that we broke up over.

You needed to fill in 5 Slides, then make a trailer and promotional video. We were required to have partners, but we were allowed to choose. Me and one of my friends decided to collaborate. We both met up in class when the time came, and we worked on our specific slides to speed things up.  However, I noticed she was staring at the screen and only typing out a few words during each session. We were assigned to do these slides for homework, and we selected times to meet up. I logged on to Google Slides, only to notice she wasn't viewing OR working on it. I waited for her while I worked on my part, but she never came. I didn't want to get disciplined for not finishing the homework, so I finished what was required for the day.   The next day, I confronted her on her absence. She told me she needed to visit family, and when she came back home it was too late to start/continue working on it.  I asked why she didn't leave a note on her slide or have told me in advance, but she said she wasn't allowed to bring her school supplied laptop to the gathering, and that she wasn't told ahead of time. I brushed it off, but this continued several times, with differing excuses (Extracurricular activies, appointments)  Eventually, Friday came and we were assigned to make the promotional video and trailer. I asked if she could finish it because I ended up needing to do everything else. She said she couldn't because she needed to help her relative pack up and move. I told her she needed to finish it because she contributed almost nothing else and that I needed to do everything else for her, but she still said she couldn't do it and that she was sorry, but I told her that we both chose to work together and that she needed to do her part. I told her she either needed to find time or tell the teacher she couldn't do the project. She said she would try and do it if she found time, but I just dismissed her because that was what she said each time she slacked off.  For the entire weekend, I did not log onto Google Slides. For other reasons which are irrelevant, I was/am absent. I am not sure if my approach was too harsh or if it was necessary at all, or if I should have taken other measures first. I have yet to see the aftermath, but I am currently unsure of what I did in the moment was wrong.	1643151134.0	scq981	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scq981/aita_for_refusing_to_finish_a_project_me_and_my/	AITA for refusing to finish a project me and my friend (?) were assigned because she was slacking off?
3d4uo4is	So my friend's cat Snickerdoodle (name changed) is going to be 21 in a few months and they just found out that she has cancer, so they've decided to put her down at the end of the week. My friend has had her since she was a baby and got her way back in high school; now my friend is married and since they're currently childless Snickerdoodle has been a huge part of their lives together. I know this is hitting my friend and their spouse hard and I feel so bad for them both.  The thing is though, Snickerdoodle is an infamous cat amongst the couples' friends, with such a long and storied life that she's basically the cat equivalent of Paul Bunyan. Her exploits were a regular source of amusement and wonder to us and I think most of us looked forward to seeing what Snickerdoodle would get up to next.  My friend is the kind of person that can show up at any event and find a way to have a good time. They're incredibly positive and optimistic and are always a source of affirmation and encouragement when you need it. We are not the closest of friends but have known each other a long time and our interactions are always positive and meaningful. My friend's spouse is an independent artist and I've hired them a few times previously so we have a good working relationship.  They're both incredibly good people so I really just want to find a way to help them feel better through this process.  I was driving home from the grocery store and thinking about Snickerdoodle when a thought crossed my mind, it would not surprise me if they had a party in her honor and I think it would be a fun time. Obviously the pandemic would be taken into consideration so it would more likely be a Zoom party, but still. I would totally want to participate in that so I kind of want to suggest it to them.  The thing is, I have absolutely no idea what it feels like to lose such an important part of my life. I have an 11 year old cat that I've had since she was a year old, but she's still healthy and spry and I didn't start keeping pets until I was an adult so I've never dealt with a loss beyond Betta fish. My friend is losing their Best Girl and perhaps the pain is so much that the idea of celebrating her might be too much. The last thing I want to do is hurt their feelings and compound the awfulness of it all.  So, WIBTA if I suggested to my friend that they throw an End of Life Party for Snickerdoodle?	1643151833.0	scqijq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqijq/wibta_if_i_suggested_that_my_friends_throw_a/	WIBTA if I suggested that my friends throw a party the day before they put down their 20 year old cat?
940xbfxy	 I’m a SAHM, I take care of all four of the kids (1.5, 7,9, and 12 - the youngest is biologically mine the other three are from previous marriage) while my boyfriend owns a business and is constantly working. He of course helps when he’s home but he’s not home a lot, so I pick up all the slack.  To get to the point and cutting out a bunch of info that’s not as important, my bf got a dog for our middle child’s birthday in August. He didn’t ask me if he should do it, he didn’t make plans for who would care for it, he just went and dropped over a thousand dollars on this dog. After dealing with this dog and a toddler and being a homemaker and a full time college student - I’ve gotten pretty fed up and it’s caused a lot of resentment. I complain every time I have to clean up pee or something he rips up (like shoes, etc) and the fact that no one even remembers to feed him or take him outside half the time. He howls and barks during my daughters nap time, and if he isn’t in the same room as someone he whimpers. He’s annoying, and a burden to me. I get the idea - it was supposed to be a nice gift for one of our children but even through multiple talks, no one takes responsibility for the dog more than a day and it ALWAYS lands back on me to take care of it. We live in a multi home so his parents are upstairs and he mostly just passes this dog off onto them, which they don’t seem to mind but it’s just the lack of responsibility that’s a turn off. He gets pissed off at me when I say stuff about the dog and says that I always bring it up and that he would resent me if he got rid of it. Which is funny because I resent him for blowing money on a dog, making a big decision that mostly affects me WITHOUT me, and doesn’t validate any of my concerns or the drama that comes with having this freakin dog.  Am I the asshole for constantly bitching about the dog?	1643152176.0	scqmvu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqmvu/aita_for_not_liking_the_dog_and_constantly/	AITA for not liking the dog and constantly complaining?
1iu17irj	I'm 20f, my friend is 20f. Here is some important back history.  Back in 2019, I got Billie Eilish tickets and I told this friend, we'll call her Zarina that I would take her. We got into some drama shortly after. We blocked eachothers numbers as a joke, I unblocked immediately after and then she forgot to unblock me. We had plans that weekend, I texted her saying due to rain that we needed to reschedule, since I was blocked she didn't get my messages and thought I was ignoring her. She told me to take someone else to Billie and that we were no longer friends.   I asked my friend (I'll call her Feng) later that day and Feng said yes. Me and Zarina resolved the drama that monday, but Zarina was mad that I wasn't going to uninvite my friend Feng from the concert. She said that Feng shouldn't care and that it was an accident so Zarina should go. I said that it wasn't fair to Feng. I even offered to purchase an extra $80 ticket for her so she could come with us. Zarina was still mad and rejected saying that me and Feng should go have fun without her. That whole ordeal put a huge dent in our friendship. Zarina shaded me the day of the concert.  Fast forward to 2021, me and Zarina are still friends but we don't see each other every day like in h.s. I bought Billie Eilish tickets for her upcoming tour. I figured it would be a nice thing to finally take her since I felt awful about 2019. I told Zarina on her bday that I would take her with me if she wanted. She seemed uninterested and said how she doesn't like the album and doesn't really like Billie anymore but was her reaction was "oh ok i guess"   She hasn't brought up the concert at all, her bday was in July, the concert is in March. I don't know if she even wants to go still. She recently removed me from all of her discord servers and as a friend on steam. I believe this is because me and my bf have been playing Dead by Daylight without her. She is very competitive with games, my bf hates playing with her for this reason. I also don't really enjoy being berated while playing either. She also likes to play late at night when the queues for survivor are 15+ minutes. I only play killer at night for this reason.   I usually offer to play at a different time in the morning or when my bf works. I also offer to play other games as well. She usually rejects me on that. I haven't brought up her unadding me, she has BPD so she will have occasional episodes like this. I give her space and let it blow over. However she hasn't texted or spoken to me in over a week.   I'm in need of money currently, my car needs fixing and I have incoming medical bills due to some tests that had to be done. With the pandemic I was thinking of selling the Billie Eilish tickets. I could get around $400-500 for the tickets which would really help me. Should I offer to sell her the tickets? Or should I just sell them. Idk what to do.   Would I be the asshole if I sold the concert tickets?	1643152380.0	scqpou	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqpou/wibta_if_i_sold_the_concert_tickets_i_told_my/	WIBTA if I sold the concert tickets I told my friend I'd take her to?
7y8obzoh	I (f43) live at my MIL’s (f78) house with my husband (m52). We moved here about 9 months ago after my MIL got sick. My life is not ideal and I can’t say that I like living here.   We have a neighbour (f age?) who speaks no English at all except for “good morning”, “hi”, and “no”. I’m grateful that she has been helpful to my MIL before we moved in but now that I live here, I’ve been trying to set boundaries to no avail.   On garbage day, she (neighbour) goes through my garbage and puts her garbage in my bin. She also removes the contents from my green bin (in Canada we have a green bin for food scraps) and places the bags in her bin.   I don’t like the idea of someone going through my garbage bins. It really offends me and literally makes me angry.  I’d like to add that she often gives us plates of food that she cooks but we don’t eat it. It goes in the green bin.  Today is the day before my curb-side pick up, I go through the house and empty the garbage cans and get rid of any leftovers in the fridge that won’t be eaten. I went outside to put the stuff in the bins and she comes running up to me loudly scolding me in her language to put my food scraps in her bin. I say something like “oh no, no, no” and waving my hands. She gets louder but I proceeded to place my items in the bin. I notice that my bin had been emptied but I just walked away.  There are many other instances of her being “nice” that get me riled up but I’ll leave those alone for now.   My husband thinks that I’m the asshole, what do you guys think?	1643152379.0	scqpoi	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqpoi/aita_for_feeling_angry_when_my_neighbour_does/	AITA for feeling angry when my neighbour does something “nice” for us?
j0kfk6dv	My (22f) friend (24f) is taking care of her niece (2). A few months ago, the kid's parents dropped her off at my friend's house and asked her to watch the kid for a few days and they never came back for her. I get that it's horrible for the kid and it's hard for my friend to raise a 2 year old by herself but almost every time we hang out, she either asks to bring the 2 year old or move it to her house because her babysitter canceled, she couldn't get a babysitter, her mom couldn't watch the kid, or some other excuse for why she doesn't have anyone to watch the kid.  Most of our friends think the baby is adorable and always say yes to having her join us or move the get together to her house but everything has to be kid friendly whenever we go out and there's toys everywhere at her house and if she's awake when we come over, she wants to show us all of her toys. If she's asleep, we can drink and don't have to be child friendly but we have to be quiet so it still somewhat revolves around her niece.  We were supposed to go to another friend's house on Saturday for dinner and drinks but she texted the group chat a few hours before because her babysitter is sick and it's too late to find anyone to watch her niece. Everyone else said yes but I texted back that I would rather not change our plans just to have another night revolve around a 2 year old.   Most of our friends started to defend her and I was basically told that if I didn't want to be around my friend's niece, I don't have to go tonight (the friend with the niece did not say this, she mostly stayed out of the conversation).  I was ranting to my boyfriend about this and he said he thinks I should be more understanding to the friend with the niece because she essentially just became a single mom.

49glb7zq	So, I've (30f) recently told a close friend (30f) that I have no interest in going to Japan anymore despite it's been on the cards for the last 12 years or so. We were both young weebs at that time, loving anime and obsessed with Japanese culture (or what we romanticised) and couldn't go earlier mainly because of money. In the last decade or so my interest in anime has decreased dramatically. Don't care for it now. However, my friend has always wanted to go and still loves the anime/gaming stuff until this day.   When I told her I could tell she was disappointed (ton of bricks fell on her kind of way), I explained that I fell out of love for Japan years ago, not just because of the lack of interest in anime but other issues (learning over the years Japan's xenophobic views and treatment to foreigners - I know not all Japanese are like that and I am sure most are welcoming and polite, but I want to find my own right reasons to visit). Also, I believe there's no point of going somewhere and spending so much money on a country you don't have interest at the time. I have other plans like buying a house/car or holiday wise visiting other places I either I have connection to or somewhere I want to see, understand their art and culture, cuisines etc.   So am I the asshole for changing my mind about Japan despite it's been a long dream holiday for my close friend who envisioned us going?	1643152918.0	scqwxv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqwxv/aita_for_ditching_our_dream_holiday_to_japan/	AITA for ditching our dream holiday to Japan?
nhgc6	My (28M) younger brother (26) lives over 800 miles away and we usually see each other nowadays at family gatherings. Sometimes we visit each other, but it has always been when our homes had enough room for guests to stay the night—before I moved I had a house with a large living room and a couch that could be made into a bed for guests, and he has a house with a guest bedroom. I currently rent a small 1 bedroom apartment, my living room doesn’t even have space for a couch, just a love seat (seats 2 people). These details will become important later.  Last time he flew out to visit me he wanted to sleep at my place for those few nights, and I explained I live in a much smaller place now and  even the love seat isn’t big enough for him to sleep on. I suggested he may want to book a room at the nearby hotel, just 2 blocks down the road—he could spread out and we wouldn’t get on each other’s nerves at night and in the morning (we don’t get along well late night or early morning, our bedtime/morning routines clash and often cause hurt feelings—the rest of the day is fine). Money for a room wasn’t an issue (he makes much more than I do). He insisted he stay at my place and even brought a sleeping bag to sleep on the living room floor (he is a camping geek and loves to use it).  As I anticipated, days are fine but we have issues with night time and early morning routines. After his stay I bring up the hotel option again and insist he book a room next time he visits. He gets offended because “family should let family sleep over” and that it was rude of me to ask him to pay for a hotel room. I explain that if I had a bigger place and we could separate more (like at my last place) I’d be fine with that but in my cramped apartment I didn’t feel comfortable having a guest sleep over. When my parents visit me at my current place they always stay in said hotel because it’s so close and they know my place is small.  That was over a year ago, and he wants to visit me again and this time wants to bring his girlfriend. He says they can both sleep on the floor in the living room like he did last time. I’m thinking why would he want that? I would never ask the person I’m dating to sleep on the floor at my sibling’s apartment when there’s an affordable hotel down the road we could both stay at.  WIBTA if I said they can visit on the condition they book a hotel room? I realize I enjoy my privacy more than he does, so that’s probably why I find it hard to understand why he is pushing for this.  And because I’m certain it will come up, in our family we don’t give up beds for guests or family members. I know that’s a thing in certain family cultures, giving up your bed when your grandparents or cousins come to visit. We don’t have that expectation in our family. We have always treated beds and bedrooms as private spaces.	1643153077.0	scqz1r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scqz1r/wibta_for_requiring_my_brother_and_his_girlfriend/	WIBTA for requiring my brother and his girlfriend to stay at a hotel while they visit?

i25ex2kk	To start this off, this is a throw away account.  My friend, let's call them L, and I have been friends for over twenty years (we are both still in our 20s). I struggled growing up. And have became frugal because of it. I don't spend my paychecks the second I get them, so I gave a good amount of savings and idea on what to spend and what not. I make dinners to last a while, I don't shop needlessly, ect. Long story short, I'm good with my money and habits.  L, who is several years older than me, has always been quick to spend their money. They shop online constantly, eat out a lot, buy useless things, go out drinking, ect. Living the best life, I won't fault them on that.   On top of this though, they often ask for help on social media to pay bills. Constantly have friends to loan them money, and have sugar partners and heavily relies on this as income or problem solving, and if they doesn't fit, I will help in the end regretfully if there is no other choice. Most things are often over $500.  However, recently they are struggling with surgery, and job issues from it. They now have a hefty bill to pay and has a GoFundMe for it. Either pay or lose it type deal. This certain one is stretching into the $1k bounds.  Now, I have this money. I could help. But I have helped so much in the past that I'm becoming resentful to lift a finger. In my mind, somewhere somehow someone is gonna help. But they are whining and crying the whole way about it about everything and woe is me, this and that. Guilt trip  central.  So I have to ask.

j0szp4q7	I'm a college student that just got a new laptop this summer. My friend that works at Walmart told me about a laptop that had off the shelf that was on clearance and hit the final clearance price of ~$150 with an original price of ~$560. I bought it and started using it as my main laptop and brought it to college this year.   The issue comes when this year I was studying in the dorm with some people and left my laptop on the table when I went to the bathroom. When I came back my laptop was smashed from a freak accident. The story I got was "Bob" stood up from the table and tripped, hitting my laptop of the table and then Bob fell on top of it. The screen was almost fully snapped off and the body of the laptop was in pretty poor condition too. The laptop wouldn't turn on and the computer guy on the floor said it was way beyond repair and even a data recovery might be difficult.   Bob was pretty apologetic about the whole thing. I was pretty devastated because I needed the laptop for school and did lose some files (most things were on the cloud, but not all). I was pretty silent for a while until Bob brought up paying me to replace it. He got straight to work and looked up the model number to find a replacement. The only ones for sale he could find were from third party resellers for $700+. I told him the retail price was "like $600". He said he'd pay me that. He Venmo'ed me the $600. I then started looking for laptops with similar specs and eventually found one close enough for $620.  We're a pretty close knit floor and everyone found out about the incident. However word got out that I only paid $150 for the laptop (I think I told people earlier in the school year that  I got it for $150). Drama ensued and I got quite a few people mad at me and calling me a scammer and a bad person, including Bob. Bob was very pissed and wanted $450 dollars back. I told him that I didn't have the money anymore and tried explaining that $150 couldn't buy a laptop close to mine was. Apparently Bob also tried filing a claim with Venmo too. Some people are on my side though. They understand that it wouldn't be fair for my laptop to be replaced by one that had much worse specs. It's turned into a big thing on my floor with some people not even saying hi in the hallways to me anymore.	1643153597.0	scr5qn	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scr5qn/aita_for_charging_600_to_replace_a_laptop_that/	AITA for charging $600 to replace a laptop that cost me $150?

j0ve1qc4	I know the title makes me sound like some kind of brat but here me out.   I (17 M) am high functioning autistic. That comes with a lot of sensory issues, mix that with not being raised to have a healthy relationship with food, I struggle with meals most days.   At home I’m relied on a lot, I do a lot of chores, take care of my young sister who is also neurodivergent, and take care of our dog. A lot of this leaves little time to cook dinner, so when my parents do get home they usually make dinner.  Most of the time they don’t consider what I like, making foods that trigger my sensory issues, and I try and eat it I’ll get sick. My parents play this off as I’m picky and just choosing to be rude.   Well after a long day for me and my parents we all came home exhausted. I thought it would maybe be a good night to order food, since we do that about once every other week, but today when I asked I got snapped at.   My stepmom told me I was being a brat and I broke down. She said that I need to be considerate and not an asshole because they’re the ones making dinner and taking care of me, so I don’t get to be picky. I tried not to get emotional until she put a plate of food that will make me sick in front of me.   I broke down crying and she called me a brat again.

iu645wc2	I 40f and my husband 39m are currently living separately. To make a long story short we bought a house across country two years ago. Shortly after, right before we were scheduled to move his uncle had a stroke. Because of this his uncle 65isM and his grandmother 90isF needed someone to stay with. Eventually that someone will be his father 67isM but for now father needs help. I stayed for a while but the house was too crowded. It’s a three bedroom house and we are a family of 5 with several dogs, cats and fish. So we proceeded with the move. My husband went back to help his father. Fast forward to now. Last week I thought I had broken my washer. My husband had just gone back across country and was at work so I called a colleague. I asked him if he could help me find a repair man. After some time he responded with “call me”. When I did and explained the problem he yelled at me and told me “your damn husband needs to be here taking care of his family! This is unacceptable” I was speechless. He then proceeded to inform me that he couldn’t get to me because his truck was stuck in the snow. I told him I was not asking for that at all, and because I am farther north the blizzard was worse here. He told me what to check and I politely got off the phone. Later he tried to apologize but I didn’t answer his call.  Then he sent me a picture of his dog saying that his dog misses me (I never met his dog, nor have I been at his place). Again I didn’t engage. So, just to make it clear he knows why my husband isn’t here and with Current events finding care for two disabled people is hard.

81kc2dj3	I (21f) have a complicated relationship with my sexuality due to certain events (nothing crazy, just enough to make me wary) and I feel uncomfortable with certain acts. One of which I was always scared would chase guys away as that is something very popular. I'm sure you can guess.   Today I was looking for my slippers (it is freezing outside) and extensions for the vacuum that typically find themselves under the couch, which my gracious husband (23m) was laying on watching TV. I sat next to him on the floor with a flashlight to look, while actively telling him what I was doing, and he pulled my hair to his region, expecting. I was furious as he is well aware of how I feel and I yelled at him for pushing me before. He apologized in the past and after we unintentionally saw a TV episode that mentioned it, he swore he finally saw the issue and wouldn't press again.   Here's where I may be TA. I got super angry with him, and I feel like I find myself angry a lot. Recently we have been on ice because during an afternoon stroll I mentioned how I didn't want to buy a house (we were just planning lightly for the future as we are far from the necessary funds) because of how rocky our relationship has been, and how he avoids conflict. He got further upset when I said I wanted to finish the walk with some space between us, I walk behind him so I could have some time to myself, and he retaliated by walking home the other way and making me wait outside my front door for 10 minutes while he caught up. (40 degrees Fahrenheit outside and I had on a light jacket, I'm Texan so don't judge my lack of heat regulation, please). He ignored me for the day and wanted me to ignore him the next day. This has made me angry, but I didn't say anything. I think the incident brought out my anger more, and now he thinks I am overreacting. I yelled for a minute, then decided to walk to another room.

When I was in high school my FPs bought a few properties to rent out. One of them my mom and SF actually ended up moving into and still live there. For YEARS they have been pestering about buying it from them. Originally they were told no because it was upside down due to the market. Recently, my parents had me ask again and my FPs actually said they would consider it if they all sat down and talked about it first though. I found out the reason for wanting a discussion first is because my parents pay $1,200 in rent. It has never been raised in the 18 years they have lived there. The mortgage is actually around $1,600 and my FP’s pay the difference and my parents don’t know this. Sometimes my mom struggles to make the rent or it’s late. So I know she couldn’t afford the whole mortgage.   A few years ago my foster mom called me and asked for some personal info from me. (Like my social and stuff.) When I asked what it was for she said she was updating her will and needed it for the lawyer. I just said okay and gave it to her. Didn’t ask any questions. None of my business. Now with my mom filing bankruptcy though, I’m worried if I’m being left my parent’s house. I DO NOT want it. It would be a disaster.   I can’t afford to pay the mortgage difference if I got it and didn’t sell it to them. If they asked me to sell it to them neither of us could afford repairs, inspection fees, earnest money, closing costs, or anything else that comes with a home purchase. (I couldn’t afford to sell it to anyone else because of this either.)  There is of course the chance that my foster mom would sell all her properties and just split the money between us kids. (I’m hoping for this. Not for the money, but because then I won’t be responsible directly for them having to move.) Any way I look at it my parents will have to move and there’s no way they could afford anything else in their area. 1 bd apts go for more than their house. (They live in So Cal. I’ve moved out of state.) Telling them will be a nightmare too as my SF is an abusive narcissistic alcoholic. (Another reason I don’t want to deal with it.)  I want to call my foster mom and ask her if she’s leaving me the house in the will. Is it rude to ask someone what they leave you? If she says no I don’t want to ask her what am I getting then as I really don’t care. I’m not greedy and would be happy if she just left me some family photos.	1643154774.0	scrlc5	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrlc5/wibta_if_i_asked_my_parents_if_they_are_leaving/	WIBTA if I asked my parents if they are leaving me the house in their will?
4lqbo17s	I (28F) am part of a close-knit friend group that’s been together for 5 years now; it consists of 2 women (me and 29F) and 3 men (28M, 29M, 29M). One of the guys (I’ll call him “Em”) started dating an awesome woman (I’ll call her “Te”) about 4 months ago, and they’re honestly so great together. We all really dig her, and she meshes really well with us.   A few days ago, Em told us that he wanted the 6 of us (including Te) to go do some surprise activity later this week, meaning that we won’t even know what we’re doing until we arrive. The only guidance regarding attire he provided was “super casual”. I wasn’t sure what to wear, so I sent a few outfit options via text throughout the day (3 pics total), and the entire group, including Te, chimed in to help me decide.   The next day, Te texted me to let me know that she was uncomfortable with the pics I sent, and accused me of trying to “thirst trap” Em. I was totally caught off guard. I was covered up in all of the pics, and nothing I was wearing was even remotely sexy. I texted her back to tell her that the accusation was unfair, and that there was nothing non-platonic about the pics. It’s been 2 days, and she hasn’t responded to me. No one, including Em, saw anything wrong with the pics. Apparently, Te has also been ignoring Em for the past 2 days as well.

4wdr6vew	I(f18) have been dating my boyfriend(m18) for a little over a year and a half. I have a great relationship with his mother but I absolutely hate her cooking.   She doesn’t use any seasoning, not even salt because she thinks it’s “unhealthy”. And why I understand that too much salt is bad, having no salt in any meal is just gross. She also doesn’t know how to cook rice because it always come out like mashed potatoes. And again, she uses no salt in the rice so it’s just like I’m eating mushy water. I also had her steak before and she put no seasoning in it, just some olive oil so it didn’t stick to the pan, it was stuff and had no flavor, she gave me salt because she knows I like flavor but not even that helped, plus it was weird to put salt on steak. She also cooked ham for Christmas and it was slimey, it was so bad that I felt sick by the end of the night.  Now I come from a Hispanic family that loves using sazon and adobo is almost everything, and if not that then my mom creates her own mixture of seasonings. I love her cooking and so does my boyfriend, he always talks about how he loves her rice so much because it has so much flavor.   She made white rice.  And only added salt and a little bit of oil to it for flavor.   Anyways tho, I told my boyfriend about how I felt about his mother’s cooking, and that I wanted to cook with her to help her improve. He thinks that doing that would make me an asshole since I’m insulting her cooking.   So yeah, AITA???  Summary: boyfriend’s mother’s cooking is really bad that it even made me sick once, and I offered to help her improve but boyfriend thinks I’m the asshole	1643154822.0	scrlxp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrlxp/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_i_dont_like/	AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don’t like his mother’s cooking?
7jqgmqrh	Me (19M) and my brother (18M) would always help our mother (39F) with our baby siblings (1m&f) when needed. I would sometimes play with them for a little bit just to cheer them up when they're upset or because I want to.  My mother said that we need to talk more when we're around them because they don't talk much as they use to. The issue is that I'm not much of a talker. Sure, I would say few words around them, but I would feel awkward if I just start making them say stuff. I'm obviously not use to this and I think I'll admit the problem is mostly me not speaking much. I think I have a better chance doing it alone than with someone around me watching me doing it, but idk.  Truth be told, I think a parent should be the one helping their children learning to speak. I guess it wouldn't hurt helping her out, but I feel a bit awkward doing it.

h33v7ntt	I (M24) have been dating my girlfriend (F22) for about six months now. I and my roommate (25M) moved to her college town about a year ago and we met not long after.   She easily got involved with my group of friends and vice versa after we met and her and my roommate have always gotten along well enough, but she’s always privately made comments to me that he acts strange. I asked how and she said just things he says sometimes. I didn’t think anything of us as him and I have been best friends for most of our lives and he has always been a bit socially awkward and so is she, so I figured maybe their personalities clash.   Since me and her started dating and she’s been at my house much more, I have noticed he does do and say odd things about her. More so than I’ve ever noticed him say to anyone else. He constantly comments on her appearance. He says he doesn’t like how she dresses bc it’s more alternative fashion and he even has referred to it as “sl*tty”. He talks about how she always has an RBF, that she cusses too much, that there are women who will “care about me like a woman should” and he always always always says that she’s “too young”. I always tell him that he’s being disrespectful and that he needs to consider the way he talks to/about women in general.  I asked him why he always says stuff about my girlfriend that I’ve never heard him say before and he tells me it’s because she “isn’t a prize” and that she should be more “respectful”, and that I should listen to some podcast he started listening to.   She came over recently for help with her school, she’s in her last year and struggles with math so I typically help her, but I wasn’t home from work yet. She texted me when she got there and said he was being weird again. When I did get home, I came in to my roommate berating her about how dumb she is that she needs help and making a lot of gross comments/questions about her body count, etc etc. He was standing at my bedroom door when I came up the stairs and acted clueless, like I hadn’t heard all the stuff he was saying.    I told him to apologize but he acted like he had no idea what I was talking about. I told him’s been creepy lately and that he needs to stop listening to his podcast if it makes him treat women like this. He took personal offense to this and said it was my fault for dating such a “dumb sl*t” and I yelled at him and told him to leave.   I don’t know what story he told people, but my parents are blowing me up saying I’m losing my best friend over a girl and that I should apologize and end my relationship. They won’t listen to me. I won’t reconsider my relationship by any means. AITA?	1643155062.0	scrp0g	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrp0g/aita_for_yelling_at_my_friend/	AITA for yelling at my “friend”
5cq37e7d	I invited my (f53) family to our house for a BBQ on Australia Day.  This includes my parents, my brother, his wife and 3 kids.  We don't have them over a lot (maybe three times in ten years) because I have a disability and it's a lot of work to get the house ready for guests.  My husband is not keen on entertaining more than 3 or 4 people at a time, and my brother's kids are a lot compared to our only daughter.  Because it's at my house, I am providing all the meat.  I have sausages, chicken kebabs and some eye fillet steak, but not enough for the children.  We get eye fillet because my husband is super fussy about meat and I am sick of wasting food because if he sees any fat at all he won't eat the whole piece. I shop at an expensive organic butcher.  I spent over $100 in the meat and I also had another $70 of eye fillet that I will use depending on who wants a steak.  I just realised this morning that my daughter is 18 and will probably want one. I didn't plan any steaks for the kids 10, 12 & 15.  So AITA for not buying enough for everyone to have a steak?	1643154493.0	scrhn8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scrhn8/aita_for_not_providing_expensive_steak_for_the/	AITA for not providing expensive steak for the children at a family BBQ (aka cookout)
5rca7m1l	I [30f] have known my friend [32f], who we’ll call Candy, for about 2 years now. We met on a dating app, but her profile at the time said she was just looking for friends. She is a fun person to hang out with, and we have become rather close. Sometimes though, I just don’t like the way she treats her “partners.”  Candy said she went through a traumatic experience when she was in her early 20s. She found someone who was “perfect” and who she thought was her soulmate, but it turned out they were abusive and using her.  She has been dating three, sometimes four, people at a time since I met her, and from what I’ve seen, all of her partners think the other partners are just her friends.   I have met a few of them, and she introduced them as her “boyfriend” or “partner.” She acts flirty and romantic with them. But here’s the kicker: She told me she thinks what she’s doing is okay because she doesn’t have sex with any of them.  I expressed concerns about it being unethical polyamory after she giggled about how so-and-so doesn’t know about the other partners. Even though she lies to them when she’s hanging out with another date, she said she’s not into any of them and doesn’t have sex—so she doesn’t think it’s wrong.  She also said that when someone wants to get sexy, she says she’s not ready and waits for them to lose interest. That usually gets guys to break it off, which she is happy about because they all secretly annoy her.  A few of these people have posted about how amazing she is. They are in pictures where they look like happy couples. They all have relationship statuses up. But she told me she doesn’t like any of them enough to want to commit *or* have sex with them.  After she was venting about how stupid and emotionally immature one of her partners was for about the 80th time, I finally told her that I thought what she was doing was exactly what her abusive ex from years ago did to her—minus the sex—and I said I felt sorry for her partners because they were investing in someone who was leading them on.

f3ztqkwb	   I (24 F) and my roommate (25 F) Janice\* have been friends for 11 years. I recently moved in with her and our other Roommate, lets call him Sam (23 M), and Janice has basically done no cleaning since I have been here.  Janice would leave dishes in the sink for weeks, not clean up after herself (leaving socks on couch etc) and didn't contribute to cleaning for the rent inspection ( I had been there less than a month) because she was exhausted from work and her mental health was bad. We agreed to help her and said dishes could stay for like 48 hours MAX among other things.   It worked well for a few days, she asked if we could help with some of the dishes because it was overwhelming and we did. I had been working long hours ( Sam and I work full time and Janice is currently off work, she works casually) and it had been hot. Her BF came over and cooked for her and days later she left to her parents and the dishes were still there. They smelt rancid (we were in the middle of a heatwave and don't have aircon.) I sent a message to our group chat saying that we need to do better because there are still dishes once again left by the sink all week, I was upset. She ignored my messages.  When she finally got home she left a message on our white board saying that she doesn't appreciate the passive aggressive messages and how we need to message her in a kind manner because she is struggling with her mental health.  After all we went through (there is a lot more that I could add) AITA for not accepting her excuse of mental health for not cleaning up after herself in the house?	1643156082.0	scs2un	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scs2un/aita_for_not_accepting_my_roommates_mental_health/	AITA for not accepting my roommates mental health as an excuse to not to clean up after herself?
1no0hhf8	For a little context, my bf and his friend, i’ll call him Caleb, were trying to get to class. There was a couple standing in the middle of the hallway blocking their way.   My bf texts me and tells me Caleb pushes the girlfriend out of the way, and her boyfriend gets mad and shoves Caleb. I’m thinking to myself “Well i’d be mad too if someone pushed my girl.” So i said “Y’all couldn’t just say excuse me instead of pushing someone?” and it went downhill from there and he got angry with me and it started an argument because I thought him and his friend were being mean to push someone.  Later on in the argument, he said Caleb just walked between them and didn’t touch them, and then the guy pushed Caleb. He told me he didn’t know what had happened fully. I made the assumption based on what I was told. So, Caleb ended up being in the right.  Am I the asshole for not taking his side to start with or was I right to tell him that was mean?	1643156044.0	scs2ch	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scs2ch/aita_for_taking_a_strangers_side_over_my_bf_and/	AITA for taking a strangers side over my bf and his friend?

She has an eating disorder, and I've always made sure to be kind to her and never say anything that could upset her. I usually wear skirts, shorts, and crop tops, and this is how I've dressed for at least 2 years. Recently, K sat me down and asked if I could wear baggier clothes because "my body upsets her." I really do feel bad for her because I know she's struggling, but this just seems like too much. I asked her how long I would be expected to not wear 3/4ths of my closet, and she said 3-4 MONTHS. I told her that I can't do that, and she can't expect this much from me. She stormed off and immediately told our friend group that I'm "showing off my body just to trigger her." I explained what happened, and 2 of my friends are on her side, but 4 of them are on my side.

55bsdzyf	So I work retail, at the moment I'm seriously struggling with my mental health and I know it's all due to my current working conditions. Just a brief list of problems include:  \-Constantly being short staffed on the evening shifts, which has left us open to aggressive shoplifters and groups of trouble making young adults.  \-Morning staff have been really slagging off their duties, especially not date rotating newer stock, which when I do reductions in the evening it makes my job twice as hard. I do the reductions every shift I'm in.  \-Whenever I come in after my days off, the boss pulls me aside because the people doing the reductions in that time have missed a tonne of stuff and done waste wrong, but I'm the one who's told it needs to be improved as if it's my fault.  \-I'm often expected to do reductions and waste alone, which really is jobs for about 3 people on bad days.  \-The staff are basically treated with a 'suck it up' attitude, or are brushed off and given details for the company therapy which is as useful as a chocolate teapot (this is from personal experience)  \-Constantly puts people in for hours they can't work, then expects them to arrange cover if they don't notice till it's a week or so before. Also personal experience.  List goes on honestly. It's gotten to the point now that for the past week I've gone home and just completely broken down, full on emotional, uncontrollable sobbing. I hardly sleep the night before.  I walk to work (15 minutes at most) and get pains in my chest like a cold hands gripping my lungs and difficulty breathing, even though I can normally do an hour- 2 hour walk no issue. I had to call out of my most recent shift (sun) because I woke up at 3am having a panic attack that was so bad I repeatedly threw up. I called the doctors monday and got a 2 week sick note. It was digital so thankfully I didn't have to go in to work to hand it in and just sent it to my manager. But I'm now being made to feel like TAH as another colleague messaged me on FB to ask if i was ok (she's normally pretty friendly and genuine.) I was honest and told her no, I wasn't and gave a brief 'It's mental health stuff.' She pointed out that another colleague of hours was going through a bad split with her husband and has been depressed all week but she's still coming in. But this person is one of the managers, she has more duties than I do and is supposed to be there for closing.

j0v3v45c	In my fiancé’s family they believe that men should be the providers and it’s seen as a shameful thing if you don’t provide for your wife. Soon after we got engaged my fiancé gave me a card and told me to use it for everything and anything. Before that we never shared finances and I’ll readily admit I had an issue accepting expensive gifts from him.  My future sister-in-law (FSIL) invited me to go shopping with her a few days ago. I tried things on for fun but I wasn’t planning to buy anything. I found a dress which was really beautiful but expensive. I decided not to buy it because it felt overpriced and I probably wouldn’t wear it very often. My FSIL tried to convince me to get it and told me my fiancé wouldn’t care if I bought it but I decided not to buy it.  Today, my fiancé gave me the dress but he didn’t look happy when he gave it to me. I was surprised since I never mentioned it to him. After I asked him why he looked so upset and how he knew about the dress he said I had made him look bad to his family because my FSIL assumed I wasn’t buying it because he had told me not to spend his money. Since that’s a big thing in their family his parents asked him if he was ready to have a wife if that was how he behaved.  I did tell my FSIL it was expensive initially when she asked why I wasn’t getting it and I know how his family view these things so I can understand where the misunderstanding came from.

j0mkz4j5	I haven't really done anything, but I'm still pondering what I should do.  I (16F) have been trying to put more effort into my future lately, which also means planning out what I'm going to do to make sure I'm as independent as I can be before it's time for me to head to college. My parents support that fully, saying that it's important for me to continue striving for independence.  However, as of late, my father's been asking me when I'll be getting my learner's permit, so that I can start driver's ed. Both my mom and my dad have been asking when I'll be getting my learner's permit, and we've even been to the DMV to try getting my permit test done (we never got it done because of the holdup).  The thing is, I don't really feel ready to start driving. I don't know what it is, but I'm really hesitant. It doesn't really help that the adults in my life keep asking me every other day when I'll get my learner's permit. I want to get my permit and I do want to drive but I don't feel ready. I want to be able to do it on my own terms, and not during school because of all the added pressure (I volunteer at the school and do engineering club). I did tell my parents I wasn't ready to start, and that I would let them know when I was. They agreed, but I still feel really horrible.  I don't want them to go through the added trouble of picking me and my sister (15F) up from school when they have busy and demanding jobs. And while we do walk home and have no difficulties, they often worry about our safety, which makes me feel even worse, for both my parents and my sister.

46b0y8q0	I (F30s) was speaking on the phone with a friend with benefits (M28). He was staying at a hotel with his family on vacation. His mom is very overbearing, noisy, and lacks boundaries, so he hasn’t said anything to her or his family about our nearly year long FWB arrangement (relevant later). I also never expected him to disclose anything he’s not comfortable with.   Back to the story: he was staying in his own hotel room and his parents and young siblings in another. He called me tipsy wanting to chat and as we were speaking, I heard his hotel phone ring. He said it may be his family calling and asked me to be quiet. I went silent as he picked up the phone and I heard him say “are you my mom?” which was super funny at the time and I accidentally let out a laugh. At that point I heard all kind of scrambling noises and he hung up.   He immediately called me back telling me how much of an asshole I was because it was his mom who heard my laugh and now he’ll have to explain who I am. He also said he spilled something on the floor while trying to mute me so now he’ll have a hotel cleaning fee. He blamed me for the spill and for not staying quiet. I feel like I may be the asshole because I didn’t stay quiet and I know how hard it is for him dealing with his crazy parents. I apologized to him. I also said he doesn’t need to explain anything; he could just say it was the TV or something.  Meanwhile, he never told me I was on speaker phone. Also, I feel like he was responsible for the spill; I mean I wasn’t even there. We’re currently not speaking.

4x4mvkwz	My roommate (let’s call her Dee) has been wanting a 2nd cat for the apartment. I had mentioned wanting a cat for my own as well. I really want this cat to be my own, but Dee wants to have a say in regards to what cat we bring into the apartment. I told her she could come meet cats with me, but I ultimately want final say in what cat we get if I’m paying for all the medical/food/care expenses.  I ended up visiting a rescue just to look, but instantly fell in love with a little kitten. I put in an application but needed the vet information about Dee’s cat (let’s call her Tina). Turns out Tina is out-of-date with all her vaccines and never had FIV/FeLV testing. My application got put on hold until Tina was medically safe to be around other cats.   When I asked Dee about getting her cat to a vet, she got upset with me and said she can’t really afford that right now. I got really mad, and I love cats, so I made the executive decision to schedule and pay for most of Tina’s vet care. Tina is such a good cat and I want her to be healthy. It took a week for me to get Tina to all the necessary appointments, and since then other people applied for the kitten I fell in love with. BTW Dee has no intention on paying back nearly the $100 I dropped on her cat. My chances of getting the kitten I applied for are way lower now since my application was delayed, so I won’t be getting my hopes up. I’ve been looking into other rescues since.  Just today, Dee admitted she’s been thinking about just getting whatever cat she wants from Craigslist without telling me. That way she can name it and it be the “apartment cat” shared by both of us. I was so tempted to flip out at her since she can barely take care of the cat she owns now. She wants full control of the fun parts of being a pet owner without the responsibility that comes with it. I’m afraid if I wait much longer, she’ll just come home with a cat one day without asking.  Would I be the asshole if I did just that, bring home a cat without involving her in the process? I intend to pay for everything and I want the cat to come with me when I ultimately part ways with Dee. I don’t want her to have any claim over the 2nd cat.	1643156875.0	scsd1f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scsd1f/wibta_if_i_just_adopted_a_cat_without_full/	WIBTA if I just adopted a cat without full approval from my roommate who wants a 2nd cat but barely takes care of her own?
94lmz4hs	Before I start I’d like to stress that I am by no means denying that fat bias exists within the medical field though as someone who is healthy, fit and skinny I have never had to experience this.   My friend (27f) recently went to the doctors about her mental health. I don’t know the full story but I know she broke down in tears and talked about how she hated the way she looked, how it limits her going out and makes her only want to wear joggers and hoodies because she feels disgusting. She mentioned something on the lines of being unable to eat in public because she knows people are watching her but eats copious amounts of comfort food in the house before bursting into tears even more with food guilt and hating the way she looked. I didn’t know it was that bad because she had only told us bits.   Her GP stated he believed she was suffering Cynical Depression, Generalised Anxiety, and Body Dysmorphia as well as Binge Eating Disorder. He put her on anti depressants and referred her to an mental health specialist. Because she is unable to work right now he also offered to give her a referral to the leisure centre for a personal training to help her loss weight. Even from her biased retelling it sounded like he was truly just trying to help her since her size is clearly impacting her mental health but my friend broke down in tears and vented into the server that he was fatphobic and how he hates her for being fat. She also said she was going to ignore the mental health referral because she can’t trust anyone with her weight. I told her it sounded like fatphobia and he can just see loving your size clearly isn’t working for her. She logged off and isn’t speaking to anyone. Our friend group is really divided with some saying I should have been more sympathetic towards her because she’s going through a hard time while others said I was right the GP was just doing his job.

bsu1bph1	 For reference, I’m 28M and she’s 27F. We’ve been together for 8 months and live together.    I’ll try to keep this short. My girlfriend and I are both out of work right now. I’m waiting to start my new job after leaving my old one; she’s taking a mental health break (something we both agreed on). Needless to say, I’m not in the best financial shape. I have an okay savings to cover upcoming moving expenses, my bills are covered, but not a whole lot of spending money.    My girlfriend is from the other side of the country. Recently, she expressed being homesick and was visibly sad about it. I thought this would be a good opportunity to do something nice. Without her knowing, I coordinated with her family and I purchased her a plane ticket for a 5-day trip home. I was super excited about it and thought it was an awesome surprise. I surprised her the same night with it. I didn’t expect an extravagant reaction or a bundle of thanks. She said it was very sweet. She casually mentioned that 5 days isn’t a lot of time to see all the family and friends she wanted to see and that it stressed her out. I didn’t think much of it.    A couple days later, she approached me and asked me if there’s a reason I only made the trip 5 days. I told her it’s because at 6 days the tickets started getting more expensive. The price different was a little less than $100 and I figured 5 days was a good in-between until I’m settled into my new job and can afford a longer trip for her or both of us. She said “usually the prices aren’t different depending on the number of days, only how long out you’re booking the flight.” She wanted to see her itinerary and started looking to see if what I said was true, and seeing if she could extend the trip.    I was pretty upset internally at this. I was super excited about this surprise and I felt like it wasn’t enough. I didn’t say anything in the moment. Today, we were in an argument and I brought up the trip and told her she was unappreciative and ungrateful. I told her I got her a gift with money I barely have, and that I was upset that her reaction was to ask for more, instead of just being grateful for what she has. She said she’ll refund the ticket and I told her it’s not about the money, but the sentiment.    Her argument is that it’s not a big deal if she wants to spend more time there, and I don’t disagree - but that’s not the point and I feel like I’m not getting the point across. She insists on telling me it’s not a big deal if she stays for longer, and I insist on telling her that I’m not arguing against that. I’m arguing that being given a thoughtful gift and responding by asking for more is ungrateful and unappreciative. I’ll stop beating this horse now.

6ia2jyd0	I (21F) and my spouse (21) have been married for almost 3 years and we have an almost 2 year old son. Let’s call my spouse M and our son S M has a drinking and addiction problem that came to a head at the end of 2021 (October) when they were hospitalized and then sent to rehab. During that time I became the sole provider and caregiver for S. M has been out since early December 2021 and they are now living in a sober living house.  Since coming out they haven’t been working much, haven’t helped with our son and they generally haven’t given anything towards helping our family. I have been working 4 separate jobs, taking care of S 24/7 and paying for all of his needs as well as all of the bills and even M’s rent.  M has been very toxic and manipulative and  I haven’t been the best spouse either and so have I at times and we have been working on trying to repair our relationship on both sides.  Yesterday, M told me that they can’t be involved in our relationship or with S anymore because they keep putting their recovery to the side.  I was surprised seeing as though they have been going to meetings and talking to their sponsor almost daily. And they have chosen to come hang out with S and I on multiple occasions without mentioning them potentially needing to do anything pertaining to their recovery.  I was extremely upset and frustrated because every moment and every cent I have goes to providing for M and S and I feel as though I’ve been extremely supportive in their recovery.  My spouse has mental health issues and like I said they are in recovery so they are saying they just can’t help with S. Anytime I tried to argue that S is our son and we should both be caring for him even if M only takes him for a day or something, M would say I don’t understand their recovery and I’m using it against them and pinning everything on them.  I told M that I would be focusing on S and I and they can let me know when they are ready. Which is what M wanted, to be hands off and only focus on themselves.  Today, I finally decided that S needed a haircut. He was pulling on his hair cause it was getting in his ears and it’s been annoying him for awhile. This would be S’s first haircut. So I cut his hair and took some before and after pictures. I sent some of the pictures to M.  My then called me all upset because they wanted to be there for S’s first haircut and I should have known it was important. I argued back that they were the one who didn’t want to get involved in S’s life right now and that they don’t get to be a “birthday parent”.  M got really hurt and told me that I was mean for saying that and that they can’t be a parent right now but that doesnt take away from the fact that they are S’s parent and still want to be there for the fun and important things. I told them that it’s not fair to stick me with all the responsibility and then just decide to be a parent when they want to.  They are still mad at me but I don’t think I did anything wrong.

j0typf3p	My family consists of me (M25), my parents (F46 and M48) and my siblings (F17 and M7). I no longer live with them ever since I got a job years ago.  My family grew up in good conditions, nothing amazing but also not poor. This was thanks to my parents who both had a job, and me when I turned 16.  The issues started when I left my house and moved to an apartment two years ago. The company my dad worked for shut down and he lost his job, and was an entire year searching for a new one until he found one that pays him way less. Given my mom's job is cleaning houses, this change affected their lifestyle pretty bad.   To help them, I decided I'd pay for my little brother's costs (school, clothing, medicaments, etc.) and take care of him if my mom or dad couldn't do it.  Everything worked fine until some months ago. Once I got used to paying for the stuff I already mentioned, I realized there were a lot of other stuff my little brother couldn't have because my parents couldn't afford it, like toys and nice clothes. Since the money I get at my work is more than enough for me, I started buying stuff for my little brother that wasn't on what my parents and I agreed at the start. I didn't thought it was something bad since it wasn't dangerous stuff and it made him happy. The first time I brought him home with a new pair of shoes they seemed shocked but that's it.  Last week, I took him to my parents after him and I bought him some new toys. My mom told him to accommodate them somewhere instead of leaving them at the entrance, but we both told her no since those toys were supposed to be for my apartment for the times he visits (taking his toys from the house to my apartment is a pain in the ass tbh). She sent my brother to his bedroom and then told me this was already too much. She said I was giving too much gifts to him and that she was starting to think I was trying to steal him from her, since I knew pretty well my parents couldn't afford that stuff and that I was getting him used to stuff he wasn't supposed to like an asshole.  This time I got mad and told her he could indeed afford them cause I could pay for them. She told me that if I keep doing it he'll end up preferring me over them, and that I should let my sister take care of him from now on. I refused cause she doesn't know how to take care of him (she's also very irresponsible imo) and that I can do it just fine. She couldn't answer me cause my father came home and instead told me to go and talk about it later. I didn't want to discuss with both of them then, when my little brother was very likely listening, so I just got out.  AITA? I kind of get where she's coming from, but I also don't think it's ok to deny my brother gifts and stuff other kids his age have because my parents can't afford it, when I perfectly can.	1643158675.0	sct01q	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sct01q/aita_for_buying_stuff_for_my_little_brother/	AITA for buying stuff for my little brother?
j0xw2t59	 My (M17) older brother (M26) passed away 3 weeks ago in an auto accident. It was devastating for the entire family though he was low contact with them for minor disagreements. His girlfriend was the one devastated the most. She didn't eat or take a shower for an entire week. My parents took her in last week because she could no longer afford rent for the apartment she shared with my brother.  Here's the situation, before my brother passed away, I think about a month ago. He confined in me with his problems with his girlfriend and said he was planning on breaking up with her next month (Jan) I thought that was too much for his girlfriend since she'd always been the one to try to work things out but my brother had issues.   Seeing his girlfriend depressed to the point of losing weight and hearing her break down crying multiple times a day. I decided to sit down and tell her what my brother was planning on doing. I didn't just dish it out on her, I just told her what he told me but she reacted in a very negative way. She had a break down crying and screaming at me. My parents came rushing asking what was happenning and I told them after my brother's girlfriend rushed upstairs. My parents berated me saying I should never have said this to her seeing how breaved and struggling she was. I explained that I felt bad for her and didn't think it was fair for me to hide this important truth from her. They told me I just made it worse and confused her even more. I got punished harshly but my friends agreed I did the right thing since my brother's girlfriend's situation is just tragic and she needed this piece of info and I was right and considerate to give it to her.   I really think I just let her know this because I felt guilty for hiding the truth from her but I might be TA for what I did.	1643158838.0	sct27x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sct27x/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_girlfriend_what_he/	AITA for telling my brother's girlfriend what he was planning to do before he passed away?
6d3mtsqo	Okay this is a bit of a long one. Basically my parents had a very nasty, protracted divorce and my mother and father hate each other. My father married another woman when my sibling and I were under 10 so we have grown up with her.   She is very controlling to the point where our father never calls or texts us, communication has to through her. For example, if we text him, she will reply.   Over the years, whenever there have been family get togethers, illnesses and things like that, my sibling and I will be told at the last minute, after the event or even not at all (the latter two not about get togethers but news). We have politely asked over the years that my stepmom keep us informed as we want to know if someone isn’t well or there is good news to share. Other family members assume she tell us and we are scared to cause drama in case we lose contact with our dad.   Today was the straw that broke the camel’s back. We have a family group chat and a big piece of news was being discussed. Everyone assumed we knew (think, engagement, pregnancy etc). We did not - it was revealed at a party but I couldn’t go because I was unwell. After the party I texted stepmom to ask how it was and she didn’t mention this big news that the whole family was told about.   Today I asked why. It spiralled into a big thing and basically she said the whole family was scared my sibling and I would tell our mum. This has been a theme in the past. My sibling and I are late twenties and do not tell our mum this kind of stuff because quite frankly, she doesn’t really care. Even if we did tell our mum, who cares?   So my stepmom excluded us and my dad supported her because they deem us untrustworthy (even though literally everyone else knew). Other family members were very shocked we didn’t already know.   I just feel insulted and disrespected and I feel like I’m kind of done. I love my dad and want to keep a relationship but it’s so hard with how they obviously see me and my sibling. I need a break and am thinking of going low contact.   WIBTA?

7g7d78zb	Warning, I’m on mobile: preface- Hey guys, just got a call from my realtor today from the sellers agent that they want me to “chill out” as there is another month between now and is closing on our house.   Background: so we are buying a new home (great time, right? 😅). Anyways, so offer goes in fine, there’s a few things we need to do such as put a new roof on the house (the sellers refuse to for some reason) and we need to put a fence around the yard for starters (have two big dogs). So we asked for HOA info, their agent sent ours very very base info, pretty much just “this is the name of the HOA and founding stuff” no rules or regulations at all.   I reach out to the hoa president listed (only have his phone number, no other members) and find base information such as fencing rules and whatnot. Conversation seemed to be really pleasant, I told him we are under contract for the house and just want to figure out what we can and can’t do with the property, since we never received that. No complaints from then on.   Fast forward to today and my realtor says he got a call today from their agent sayin, “Hey realtor, can you tell anon to chill out, there’s still a month till close and you’re making the sellers anxious.”   Am I the Asshole for trying to get my ducks in a row figuring out fencing and roofing requirements so I can get them done as close to day of close as possible? (Fence for animals, roof because otherwise it’s un-insurable with a 21yr old roof)  TIA	1643159024.0	sct4p7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sct4p7/aita_for_reaching_out_to_hoa_for_info/	AITA for reaching out to HOA for info?
iltwwk4z	I(17F) have grown exhausted from my mom and sister(21F) relationship. My mom has always said she loves us both equally but her actions always seem to contradict her words. Recently my mom has been paying for all of my sister’s expenses plus extras like birthdays, clothes, and drinks because she no longer has a job. So my mom has been complaining about money being tight. I asked my mom if I could get a new pair of shoes because mine were starting to rip and she told me “no” and said “you dont go out much anyways”. Saturday my sister came downstairs and asked if she could get a bottle of wine using my parents money. My mom said yes right away and my sister later came back with a $17 bottle of wine. Today I asked my mom if I can run to the store and get oat milk and mangos as I use them frequently, and she told me no because  “money is tight”. This is just 1 of the many instances in my lifetime involving the two of them. Tonight at dinner we all were eating in silence and the tension was very awkward. My mom then brought up how I couldn’t wait a few days even though i havent had milk in over a week. I stayed silent and my sister said im stingy with food and I can wait. I finally said “I’ve been waiting, there are things I actually need and u proceed to tell me no but when (sister) asks for anything, its handed to her. She’s a grown adult and I get helping her out but what about that extra money going towards her when you could be saving for food rather than alcohol for your daughter to sit in her room and drink alone.” My mom and sister just stared at me dumbfounded and my mom started yelling and telling me im being dramatic and making a scene(we are home with no guests). My sister then said “you literally dont know anything about the wine so just shut the fuck up for once and keep your thoughts to yourself”. I left the table and went in my room leaving my food. I could hear my dad yelling at both my mom and sister but couldn’t make it out. I think I am the asshole in the sense that it wasnt the right time to say anything and I could have addressed the problem nicer than just going off on them two. I also maybe should’ve had a private conversation with just my mom instead of including the whole family. I just dont know how to move forward with this and im not sure my feelings are valid.

j0wacl4c	For some backstory on this, I have mental issues ranging from mild to extremely severe. These include things such as depression, anger issues, and anxiety. I also have sensory issues, and even stuff like yelling can make things worse for me. Due to who knows what, I have a really bad neck twitching problem. My therapist said it's probably because of my anxiety, anger issues, and sensory issues, so there's that for you. My head can go from barely an inch away from where I was originally looking to turn all the way to the right. My mom and I were going to get an EKG, which is a heart test because I had a high heart rate, even while I was just around doing nothing, so I was really anxious that they'd find some stupid unfixable heart malfunction that's gonna kill me in the next hour.   My mom had noticed my neck twitching and asked me why it was happening. I gave her a simple "I don't know." and went back to texting my friend. She noticed it again a few minutes later and told me to stop. I told her that I can't and I don't want my neck to jerk around like that. She started going on about some girls who developed tics because they were on TikTok too much. I don't even understand how that happens, but whatever. She does this a lot. I try to tell her that I genuinely can't help it, and I'm just anxious and have nothing to take it out on, which results in my neck twitching. She started yelling at me, saying I'm faking it because she had never noticed my neck twitching before. I told her to stop bothering me about it and to leave it alone. She kept on yelling and yelling and yelling as my twitching got worse and worse and worse. This resulted in her yelling more, which resulted in me twitching more, which then creates a huge cycle of yelling and twitching. After what seemed like decades of this, I got tired of it and raised my voice just louder than hers and told her to be quiet and stop telling me I'm faking because I'm not. That's where I think I screwed up. Should I have shut up and tried to control my twitching?	1643159619.0	sctc7e	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctc7e/aita_for_yelling_at_my_own_mother_over_my_neck/	AITA For yelling at my own mother over my neck twitching?
33lkr4xq	So, a bit of back story, my partner and I just bought a house. His parents have been helping us out a lot with moving stuff to the new place, fixing up the garden and stuff like that. Also other back story, I have a really dark past - which include a physically and verbally abusive dad - and I have severe depression. They know this, and they know that the way I deal is to isolate and close into myself for a few days, until I can pull myself back up again.  Okay now I’ll explain, so I got home the other morning at 1:30am after a 6 hour drive home from a work trip that got cancelled part way through. So I was feeling pretty depressed, borderline suicidal if I’m perfectly honest. At about 9am that day I was in my lounge watching tv and suddenly I saw someone standing the garden. That’s when I realised that they were coming over today to fix our sprinklers - something we didn’t ask for and had intended to ask the gardener we booked to fix the yard up to do (we appreciate it, of course, but worth mentioning we said we didn’t need it and they chose to do it anyway - they have a real “we know best” attitude). Now I didn’t feel like speaking to ANYONE and they have in the past told me that depression isn’t real, it’s just having a bad day (which is super fun to hear, of course) so naturally, I didn’t really want to speak to them. And I knew they’d want to ask why I was home when I was supposed to be gone for a few more days. And I knew I would be rude and just say “can you leave me alone please. I’m depressed” which they would have taken personally and gotten upset.  So instead, I hid. I waited for them to go back to the front yard and quickly shut the blinds and flicked the door locked. Then stayed in the Lounge with the sound down very low. After 10 minutes I got too anxious and went to bed. About half an hour later my partner gets a text from his mum saying that she hopes everything’s okay, they felt like they were intruding because the blinds were closed and so they’ve done the sprinklers and left. And that his dad was really sad because he was just trying to help. So he told them the truth - with my permission - that I was depressed and didn’t want to interact with anyone (also worth noting that they had a friend with them who I have never met). So she just responded “well she got what she wanted then”. So naturally my partner is pissed that she was rude instead of understanding. But I am now crying because I HATE upsetting people, like so genuinely, it hurts me to know I’ve hurt someone. So I messaged his dad directly. And this is the conversation that ensued…  Me: Hey, sorry I wasn’t trying to be rude by closing the blinds. My work got cancelled early, I got home just after 1am - drove all the way back from mt gambier - and was feeling depressed and didn’t really want to interact with anyone. And I know when I’m depressed I can come off as rude when talking to people, so I wanted to avoid a conversation so that I didn’t come off wrong, sorry if I upset you, it wasn’t intentional. We really do appreciate your help, I’m sorry.  His dad: (my name) I didn't really expect that sort of treatment from you as I thought we had more respect for each other than that  and I was embarrassed I front of a family friend   you need to learn that in my family no matter our mood we still show kindness and respect towards each other.  as a family we accept each other no matter there mood    remember we are not people - we are family    please never shut me out again   I have never done that to you    I do expect to be treated the same way as I treat you   I'm sorry if you take offence to this but as a parent it's my responsibility to show my family what is acceptable and what is not  and as you are a wonderful part of this family  I will not let you down   (My name) don't get upset with this just think about what I've said and maybe how things can change for the better   know I have only good intentions and do what I think is best for everyone  Remember we never make mistakes we just have lessons to learn and that's a good thing  ❤ Ps I have never thought of you as rude  probably never will   I hope you know you can speak your mind freely to (MIL) or myself any time   we may not agree with you but that's OK  you may not agree with us   we are allowed to think and be different  as long as it's with respect    ❤  Me: I’m sorry I made you feel that way  Him: Hey (my name) I know you are   i just want you to know how important you and (my partner) are to me  but i have expectations how our family should be and it hurts me to think we are not on the same page    but how are you to know what i think if i don't tell you   and the same goes for you  i do want to know what you think  i want us to be open with each other  if your not in a great place  thats ok  i get like that sometimes but i do my best not to inflict my moods on the ones i love   (MIL) and i would do anything for you two    just know your happiness is everything  to us  and we as always have your backs  ALWAYS  ❤  thankyou for being so understanding   lets just keep this in the back of our minds and move on as the strong family that we are and let this make us even stronger  ❤  Personally I think that they have been really out of line with me and I feel like I’ve just been told, you’re only allowed to feel your emotions in a way I deem appropriate and acceptable.  Perhaps also worth noting, I am 21 and have shoved my feelings down, allowed him to steam roll my emotions, for the sake of peace and he’s 60 and isn’t willing to accept the way that I deal with things.  Am I the asshole for wanting to deal with this in a way that makes me comfortable? Or should I have just told them what was up, even though it makes me uncomfortable?	1643159598.0	sctbya	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctbya/aita_for_not_opening_up_to_fil/	AITA for not opening up to FIL
fmwbpcj5	For some background: I used to be very close to my grandfather when I was younger, until he developed a nicotine addiction that ultimately lead to his death. Since then, I’ve been adamantly anti-smoke. All of my friends know this. My grandfather was the only family member that has ever truly gotten me and losing him to something like that shattered me.   A few weeks ago, my friend and I were talking, giving each other advice and whatnot. I was talking about some issues with the rest of my family (we don’t have a very good relationship) and how upset I was at some things my mom had done. This is pretty normal stuff— neither of us have good home lives and it’s standard for us to talk back and forth about this. When I was done, my friend said they had something they wanted to tell me, which I thought meant it was their turn to share some stuff about their family, and I was ready to listen and support them.   It was not what I had expected. They told me they had developed a nicotine addiction. Us being close, I was upset. Sad, but not mad at them. Part of me understood the appeal, but I wasn’t happy. At first I asked them questions, like when did it start, and why? I wanted to help them. Make sure they were okay and help them quit. It seemed like they wanted help and I didn’t want to lose another amazing person to cigarettes, and I wanted them to know I’d support them through it. Clearly, it wasn’t enough for them.   Later, I found out it was all one giant lie. Before all this happened, they asked if I could ever hate them, and I said no. Apparently, they didn’t believe me and lied about developing an addiction about something I’m sensitive towards to see if that was enough to make me hate them. I was furious. In my mind, they used the death of my favorite family member to test me, and I wasnt having it, so. for a while, I shut them out. When I was ready, a few days later, I talked to them, and they still, to this day, haven’t apologized for it.  I still treat them like a liar for what they did, and I‘m still angry about it. They‘ve gotten mad at me for overreacting by holding a grudge for too long.

j0yma1h0	I get this might be a no brainer to some but hear me out.  My dad passed a couple days ago. It was a longtime coming and only made worse by COVID. I’m handling the funeral arrangements as I was named executor of his estate. I included my aunts and uncle in the planning process out of respect. While we were discussing, my aunt said my cousin, who is diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, wants to perform an interpretive dance at the church infront of the casket to “bid your (my) father farewell”.  I said no, absolutely not. For one this is all happening in a church. The priest would have a stroke. Next, my cousin is not a good dancer. It’s his hobby and I’m happy he found something he loves, but I don’t feel my dad’s funeral is the right venue to showcase his moves to Candle in the Wind.  My aunt is having a fit and my cousin is also extremely upset and has accused me of not letting him say goodbye to him in his own way. I told him that he’s more than welcome to have a dance at the grave whenever he wants but the funeral isn't that time (another cousin told me he was planning to record it for a YouTube video which hard no).

7hhjiqbq	So I (30m) live at home with my parents and brother and sister (28 and 24 respectively).  I pay rent and help with groceries and other bills and have for years.  Anyhow, about 5 months ago I got this new job that pays pretty well (so I started contributing more to the household).  In a couple weeks I'll be getting my bonus for Q4 2021, and it will be... significant.  Like mid 5 digits, which is seriously way more money than I've ever seen in my life, I was working for slightly over minimum wage less than a year ago so this is wild and very new to me since my family is definitely not well off.  I do plan on buying the family some new appliances (a new fridge and some other things) and some other stuff we need, but it will be a relatively small portion of what I'll actually be getting, but I know that if I tell them just how much I'll get, they'll expect me to do a lot more than that.

First message:Jan 3rd Second message: Jan 11 Date she changed her mind but said I could still have the dog: Jan 15  Once my husband and I got back to the state I asked her what time she would be available the next day. She gave me a time and a place to pick her up. I took a nap and when I woke up she text me saying she never actually told her family and didn’t want to then blocked me. I called me husband freaking out because I felt like my hopes were being crushed.   An hour later I got a text from her fiancé saying if I made the two hour drive right then, I could have her. I woke my husband up, got dressed, got in the car…then he said never mind I could come the next day as planned. I agreed and went back inside. Not even 5 minutes later he texted again and said to come but it would be up to the dog to choose who she wanted to be with.   I agreed but asked that he bring her kennel, food, and vet records. Those were just the things that I bought her and sent with her and all of her vet papers were from visits I took her to. He said if I wouldn’t take her without them I couldn’t have her at all. I decided to go anyways.   The whole car ride there I kept getting texts (my car reads them aloud) about how she wouldn’t come with me, I was wasting my time, how dumb I’d feel when she went home with him, etc. When he finally got to the meeting spot it was almost midnight.   She took one sniff and that was it. He called her and she wouldn’t come back. They did bring her vet paperwork so at least I have that. She has not left my side since she’s been home but her initial happiness at seeing my husband has faded and she’s gone back to not liking him. I now have a 60 lb lap dog. She regressed a bit in her training but now that I’ll be home all the time we’ll finish our certification in no time!	1643160050.0	scthm6	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scthm6/update_wibta_if_i_take_my_dog_back/	Update: WIBTA If I Take My Dog Back
8t7d087t	I live in a conservative area and school. At my time there, I have seen countless incidents of racism. I will list them in order.  Case 1: Asian eyes #1  In Social Studies class one day, we were watching a video about China where A made the Asian eyes gesture and the teacher caught it.   Case 2: Asian eyes #2  Jump forward 2 years and we have a new Social Studies teacher and we are discussing the Progressive Era and China came up and these 2 kids O and I were jokingly making Asian eyes at each other and I caught them but the teacher did not.  Case 3: N word  Fast forward a little bit to during study hall where A was talking to his friends and I hear him faintly saying the n word and he then looks behind him to see if anyone else heard him but no one else did.   Case 4: Indian telemarketer  O was speaking like a Indian telemarketer one day and it was a very stereotypical India voice.   Case 5: Kool Kids Klub  E, O, and I were writing "Kool Kids Klub" on the board but I knew it was a reference to the Klu Klux Klan.  Case 6: Let's Go Brandon   During a school event, E, O, and A were chanting "Let's Go Brandon" which means f*ck the current president of my country. No teacher caught them but I did.   For #5 I got the kids involved suspended from school.

bzop3se2	I've decided to get back into fitness. I'm specifically looking for a kickboxing class. My husband casually mentioned a women's class.  I'll be honest, I'd probably be most comfortable in a women's class but overall I don't really care.    I tried a class at a place and kinda liked it but they didn't actually do any kickboxing, it was more cardio. It was advertised as women's only.   When I got home my husband asked how it went and who all was there. I explained I was looking for more bag work (punching/ kicking a bag) and mentioned there was actually a guy there too.  My husband said he didn't "like" that and I should probably look around.   So here's the would-be lie.  I found a new class at a new location that offers Brazilian jiu-jitsu for my son the same time and days as the kickboxing class.  This works out better and is cheaper though I have to drive 20 minutes instead of 5.  My husband is under the impression that it's women's only.  I haven't said otherwise but I also haven't officially signed up. WIBTA If I let him think it's women's only just because it would make him more comfortable or should I just tell the truth?  If I tell him the truth he won't "keep/stop" me from going but I know he won't like it.	1643160770.0	sctqky	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctqky/wibta_for_telling_a_small_lie_to_my_husband/	WIBTA for telling a small lie to my husband?
j0vn5je0	New account.  Backstory:  My husband (33M) and I (32F) have been avid indoor people most of our lives. We met on a computer game over a decade ago and have two children together (9 and 2) We both work full-time from home for the same company. Our older son was recently withdrawn from public school and is now being homeschooled by me (unable to be vaccinated).  &#x200B;  More about me:  I am not a very social person. I was dealing with diagnosed agoraphobia when I met my husband online as a teen and have had a tough time with some regression due to the pandemic. I was diagnosed with manic depression when I was a teen, which is now referred to as bipolar disorder. I've been on and off medication for this but did not use it for most of my adult life. I don't like how I feel on the medication and decided that I would rather deal with my manic episodes as they came instead of always feeling like bland chicken. I am also diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder.  About four years ago, I had a pretty bad manic episode that lasted for a couple of months. I ended up leaving my husband, going out all the time, maxing out my credit cards, doing drugs and flying back to my home state. I wouldn't have forgiven me, but my husband did. He fought a lot to keep our family together. We got back together after all that, and he still holds a lot of resentment for the things that I did (I don't blame him for this. We discussed leaving the past behind when we got married that year, though this is not something that has held up well for him.) During that time, I was very social and went out very often to party. This is not something that is normal to me but left the impression on my husband that I only like to do these things with other men. This is brought up often when I decline to go out to drink with him.  &#x200B;  The problem at hand:  My husband likes to drink and go to the bar for fun. I've never found alcohol to be that great of a thing but partake every now and then socially. My husband wants me to go out with him this evening and has tried to get me to go out multiple times this month. I've told him that I don't want to do this because I don't want to go to a crowded bar and get sick (which could get our children sick). I told him that I don't want to go out this evening but would go out on my day off, which is tomorrow. He told me that wasn't an option because I have turned him down so many times before and insisted that I was going out tonight with him or we would have a problem. I feel like this may be him trying to pull me out of the house, but I really don't want to go tonight. I work around 100 hours biweekly and am just coming off a long time without having a day off. I would like to prepare for going out and would feel less drained by going out on my day off tomorrow.  &#x200B;  AITA for not going out tonight?  &#x200B;  Reason I could be TA:  I have not been going out with my husband and turning him down again is not considering his feelings and what he wants to do.	1643161051.0	sctu6i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctu6i/aita_for_not_going_out/	AITA for not going out?
chmboaok	I 24(f) am Autistic, I have sister (25) that for this post I will call Sara and a younger brother (22) who I will call Danny.  Sara verbally and physically bullied me throughout our childhood, because of this we aren't close as adults and have limited contact, but in 2019 we talked it out and she apologized for how she treated me, it was a good talk and we both felt better after.  The thing is her behavior hasn't changed just lessened, (though it’s no longer physical bullying) We only see eachother at family gatherings and texts a few times a month, but whenever I text I have to be careful to only talk about my dogs or her dog, if I say anything related to my special interest, even a TV show that we both watch she'll start yelling.  We got together with extended family last week for our Aunts 50th birthday and both stayed for a week since it was out of State.  The problem:  Everytime she says my name I flinch, I can't help it but it pisses her off, she says we've already worked through our issues and me flinching like that hurts her feelings. I apologies everytime it happens.  The night before I left we had dinner with the extended family and the topic of allergies came up, I decided to join the conversation, I barely got out the words "Oh I had-" before Sara cut in with a very annoyed voice saying "No one wants to hear it OP."  I shut up immediately and apologized. My cousins told me Sara was wrong and they wanted to hear what I had to say. It took a while but I did speak again, I told them about how I had actually been in the hospital a few months back for a severe allergic relation and everyone did indeed want to hear about it. (it was in our familychat at the time which has our parents, Sara and Danny, so she did know about it before this.)  The way Sara shut me down in that conversation has been playing in my head since I got home and it made me realize just how little things have changed since our conversation, and I don't want to keep pretending we are good now, like with flinching, and the next time it happens I don't want to apologize and am tempted to say saying like "what do you expect when you bully someone their whole life?"  Danny agrees that Sara is in the wrong and needs to be better but says that I need to work harder not to set her off, like leaving the room when she gets mad or not saying stuff that will set her off. But it feels like she's always mad when we are in the same room so I would be walking out whenever she comes in, and I've tried not saying anything to not set her off (which in my opinion is anything) a few years back while we were alone in the living room and I put my headphones in and didn't speak, she ripped my headphone out of my ears and screamed at me for ignoring her, so I'm not sure I'm understanding his advice.  So Reddit WIBTA if I didn't apologize next time I flinched and probably start a fight with my sister?	1643159935.0	sctg51	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sctg51/wibta_if_i_didnt_apologize_the_next_time_my/	WIBTA if I didn't apologize the next time my sister saying my name makes me flinch?
8l85v7rj	I'm a bit hurt... I am a freshman in college and am a part of the tennis team. I thought we were all some what close, but there really haven't been any bonding activities like the coach recruited me for.   I have kind of ignored things and tried to keep positive. One team mate and I shared a birthday close together, and when their birthday came, everyone wished them a happy birthday. I was excited, too, they all knew when my birthday was and followed me on instagram where I literally posted about my birthday. And none of them, not one, wished me a happy birthday. We share a chat, so we all typically wish each other a happy birthday in the chat. Not one person out of 14.  I am a bit hurt, not going to lie. The last thing I want to do is cause drama, that's just know I am, but this really has bothered me. Another person had a birthday today and, of course, everyone wishes her happy birthday. I am pretending to not let it both me, but it really does. I am starting to think this team really isn't as close as the coach made it appear.   I want to confront them, but I really don't know how. I might just want to talk to the coach about not feeling included, but, at the same time, I feel this might divide me further from them. I am on the shyer side and am not very good with interaction, but I try really hard to be upbeat and positive. I feel defeated. I want to get closer with my team, and I want to be included.  However, I don't want to bring my coach into this. My sister called them a bunch of not good names, only in private, and said she would confront them. That's why I am considering it.

j0xy4lbk	Throwaway account because I'm pretty sure my roommate knows my Reddit username.  I moved in with a friend of mine a little over half a year ago and things were going real well, for a while. I'll admit I'm not the cleanest person on earth but I was making a sincere effort to keep the common areas clean since our apartment was nice, and he had requested it. Originally our understanding was that the apartment was clean before we went to bed for the night and / or one of us was having people over. I wasn't perfect but over time he became more frustrated with us sticking to the plan, soon requesting that the common areas be completely clean whenever he and I were done with them. This was frustrating to me especially since both of us are working remotely so sometimes things come up, and I had just started grad school, but over time came to adopt this. However soon he became angry if I would leave something out when I would use the restroom and come right back. And then again when I would go to use the shower and leave my bag or coat on the couch before work.  His response was always heavily hostile or rude, going directly to, "clean your fucking dishes," or "what the fuck is wrong with you." An example is when I walked in to the common area and saw him said hello and started putting my groceries in the fridge not noticing his headphones. He then screams at me saying "I can't fucking hear you don't talk to me when I'm on a work call."  This came to a head yesterday when he yelled at me again for leaving a singular hat on a table despite me sitting next to it. I told him that it was unessesary for him to be so disrespectful to me at every step. His response was to tell me that I am annoying and when asked why that was enough reason to be so rude to me he said it wasn't. But to make his point he told me he has every right to do so since his job is more difficult and that he works more hours. He then makes fun of my mental illness, and despite now following exactly his rules on cleaning the apartment, the fact that he ever had to ask for me to do any sort of cleaning ever was enough reason for him to curse at me.  I honestly don't know what to do at this point because litteraly existing in the same room as him results in him being absolutely hostile, often without cause.

9u5zh5m9	So, to begin, I wanted to explain that My husband and I adopted a kitten a year ago who wound up having serious health problems and passed away after only 6 months. Thousands of dollars in vet bills later (which we are still paying off) out kitten wound up having tumors and liver disease and we had to put him down. We have a beautiful 3 year old female cat who is wonderful but definitely a little lonely after losing the kitten, so we made the decision to adopt another cat- but this time we wanted an older cat because we were both pretty messed up after seeing our beautiful baby kitten get sick and have to put him down.  So my mother volunteers at a very small scale and poorly run cat rescue and she is often stuck fostering and caring for very ill kittens and cats and they are often in the same floor of her living space as her personal cats. She tries to separate them but diseases can spread even if they’re in separate rooms. Anyway, she had a kitten who was up for adoption, and I really couldn’t take another kitten so soon, but has a 3 year old boy cat who I love and is super sweet and I feel like he was timid and needed extra love, so I offered to adopt him and she was very happy as she didn’t really have the time to give him the love that he needs . My only caveat was that I needed him checked out with a clear bill of health - blood work, stool and get him up to date on vaccines. This is important because he would be living with my female cat who I can’t have getting sick and also because we are scared of getting a sick cat and having to go through seeing our pet sick and die.  Fast forward, she takes the cat in, and finds out he has significant oral disease and needs all of his teeth pulled. This is not an old cat, and this leads me to believe that he had some other health problems going on. I also was afraid that I wouldn’t be able to open an insurance plan for him, which was another stipulation that my husband and I had for any new cat. I told my mom that we felt very bad but we think he might have something else going on and we weren’t comfortable taking him anymore. We were also concerned that he might have significant behavioral changes after having such an extreme surgery, and it might be bad for him to have the surgery then also change his environment. My mother was very upset and couldn’t believe that we would reject him for this reason.  I offered to pay for the vet visit and that was ignored as she was so upset. Fast forward again, my husband and I find a family who had a 3year old cat up for adoption - he is fixed, has all shots up to date and was not living with other pets. My mother found out that we “got a cat with out telling her” and told me that she is done with me and hung up on me.

j0xzqu25	Throwaway because my family and friends have Reddit.   I (16f) go to a small high school in the middle of nowhere.  I actually just moved here around a month ago. I didn’t really talk about religion or my ethnicity/where I’m from, as I felt slightly unsafe with the views around what I practice.   The other day I reposted an image on my Instagram story of one of my family friends big celebrations in my religion. (I went to this celebration) Usually these are big parties with a service… a year or so of learning, etc.    My friend (16f) then responded asking how I knew them when I said they were family friends.  She then asked if I was said religion where I said yes. She kept asking my political views on things, blaming me for racist tropes about my people, and calling me a slur specific to my people. She then got mad at me for not telling her when we first met. This was the first time she had ever been like this to any religion/ethnicity that I knew of.   I felt pretty uncomfortable WITHOUT everyone knowing and now I’m scared I’ll get talked to at school in certain ways.    Ps, I’m sorry for being very vague I just didn’t want the focus to be on my religion and more on what happened because I am scared to get messages and such from people disagreeing with certain politics.	1643161746.0	scu2sr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu2sr/aita_for_not_telling_my_friends_my_religion/	AITA for not telling my friends my religion?
6m7oa43n	I, 16F, have been riding the bus since I was in kindergarten. Bus drivers are usually pretty laidback and don’t say much besides the occasional “quiet down”. This year we got a new bus driver, she is very upbeat and loud, and just not someone I would get along with at all because of her personality. At 7 in the morning I don’t exactly look forward to her yelling and blasting music in the bus. She would say “Hello!” as I got on the bus and I would usually nod or wave back. One day she stopped me as I was walking off the bus and said “I always say hi to you, why don’t you say hi back?” and I didn’t have much to say except “I’m sorry.” So then I started vocally saying hello and goodbye. But as I was getting on the bus to go home from school today, I said hello to her, and she got visibly upset. I live in a cold climate right now so we have the heaters going in the bus, which are very loud. So I couldn’t hear a word of her rant to me. As I was getting off she was saying goodbye to everyone else, and when I said goodbye she said “I wasn’t talking to you.” in a really mean tone. I don’t know how I am being disrespectful if she just didn’t hear me.. But maybe I should have apologized right away. The guilt has been eating at me all day. AITA?  TLDR: My bus driver didn’t hear me say hello, so when everyone was getting off the bus she refused to say goodbye to me in reply.	1643161929.0	scu50h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu50h/aita_for_not_saying_hi_to_my_bus_driver/	AITA for not saying hi to my bus driver?
i70mfe5w	Just a little bit of context, I’m 16 and my brother is 12, I let him use my PlayStation, pc, school iPad, and switch whenever he wants. And I share them without an argument, however he never lets my use/play anything of his like his Xbox or his 2DS or even his phone for emergency calls.  Anyway; in 2020, the day it came out in Australia I went out and bought Animal Crossing New Horizons with my own $80 I had put aside specifically for the game.   It is one of the very few games I refuse to let him use (the other 2 being pkmn sword/pkmn shining pearl). Because I have let him play it once but after he finished with the game I had to restart the whole thing (made a villager I love move out and got me 300,000 bells in debt). After that I said no more playing.  After that spat, he hid the game and wouldn’t give it back until my mum screamed at him. After that encounter he never asked me to play again.  Skip to last night, I brought the switch with me on holiday, I opened up animal crossing to see my younger brother had logged in, made irreversible changes. He upgraded my one room house, had planted bamboo and other plants I didn’t want on their, made yet ANOTHER VILLAGER MOVE OUT. And had also decided to move in with his own house. He had also once again put me in cataclysmic debt.  I was pissed, but I asked him nicely to never play again, and to hand me the switch, he told me to stop being a bitch, I got angry and told him to give it to me again-blah, blah, blah; ended up with me getting in trouble and my mum comforting my younger brother.	1643161983.0	scu5n2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu5n2/aita_for_screaming_at_my_brother_over_a_video_game/	AITA for screaming at my brother over a video game?
bs9gvspr	My gf (18) & I (18) have been together for 2 years. We’ve never been out for valentines day because when we started dating we were still in school & then covid happened and now we have a chance to go out. I’ve been trying to make plans early because I like to plan ahead but my gf keeps saying she doesn’t know what there is to do and she doesn’t wanna make the plans. So I took the initiative. I made reservations for a restaurant we could walk to from my house for the sunday before valentines day so we could hang out and exchange gifts before our reservations at 4. ( I work monday) I sent her the menu to look at what she would like because shes kinda picky. She said it was too expensive and I told her I was paying since I picked the restaurant. She still didn’t wanna do it.. so I made different reservations at a cheaper place. She said ok she would ask her parents for a ride now. A couple minutes later I get a call from her saying her dad said he’ll take her if him and his wife can tag along. I said sure even though I was uncomfortable with the idea. I’ve only met her parents twice for a couple of minutes. It felt weird to invite yourself to your daughter’s valentines date. After we end the call I get a text saying how her dad wants to go to a different (more expensive) restaurant. I got very annoyed because I had to plan this whole thing & I made and canceled 2 reservations. I told her I wasn’t interested in going anywhere with any of them at this point. I feel bad because this is our first real valentines day. I mightve been overdramatic but idk.

He was doing well and had his 30 day chip for sobriety, but he broke the other day at a party she was at. When they all left, he asked if she wanted to smoke some weed with him, and B said yes. When he went over to her place they were hanging out till they had sex. Though our boss is engaged, she had no shame when telling me, and told me gross details like how he had a huge dick so she couldn’t possibly regret it. He is not in an open relationship, and has cheated in the past. K doesn’t know that I know, but being around them both is killing me. I know it’s petty but I hate people who cheat, and have been asking him guilt tripping questions like “when is the wedding again?” “Do you guys have the flowers picked out yet?” Whenever B is around.

710gx774	I work in an airport setting. My work has three stores in this place, and there's an ( annoying ) group message that was started by a manager months ago. The phones in our stores do not work , so people message with questions, etc...  One person messaged that she was exposed to a highly contagious Flu (?) by a roommate. I asked, Who is this?  The reply was, NYB ( not your business ).  I responded: You messaged 12 people in a group chat, and I asked so I would know if there was a possible exposure in my store. If you wanted this to be private, then you should have messaged the manager directly.  The NYB person said: That was the intention to make it private.  I responded: You messaged 12 people. So................  At that point a manager stepped in and said all of the messaging needed to stop. And I hope it all does.  In reality, had I gone back through the messages I probably could have figured out who left it by the various messages and phone numbers and using process of elimination.  So - AITA?

8f6gu9jz	i (18f) am a music student in university and take methods courses, where i learn how to play other instruments that arent my main. this semester, im taking percussion methods, and my professor required we buy our own sticks and mallets, and a practice drum pad. today i went out and bought these things and came home. I had also bought some stuff from the grocery store for my mom for dinner, so when i came home, i had a bunch of bags that i dumped on the counter.  my dad (42m) started taking the stuff out of the bags, and grabbed my sticks and my drum pad, wanting to use it. my older brother (20m) then grabbed it and wanted to use it, and i told him to hide them so that our youngest brother (3m) wouldnt see them, because i knew if he did, he would want to use them and "play" with them, and i didnt want him to use them and possibly break them since i literally just bought them. 3m started crying for the drumsticks after i hid them in my pocket, saying he knew how to play the drums and he wanted to play with them.  my dad then told me to give 3m the sticks, to which i said no, i just bought them today and it's not like they're for fun or anything, its for a class and i literally needed them the next day, and i drove all the way to another town to go buy them from the only music store in our area. i said i didnt want to give them to 3m because i knew if i did, he wouldnt want to give them back and he might break them, to which my dad said he didnt care.  he asked why didn't i buy them online, then he started getting mad at me, saying he'd break my sticks and threatened to take my car away, saying that he bought it for me (i literally make monthly payments for my car every month to my dad and pay my insurance every 6 months) so why cant i do the same and let 3m use something that i bought. after i didn't budge and never handed over my sticks he said something across the lines of i made my brother cry over two sticks of wood and i could've just given it to him.  so, aita?	1643162118.0	scu7ce	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scu7ce/aita_for_not_giving_my_brother_my_drumsticks/	AITA for not giving my brother my drumsticks?
j0yg4agp	 My girlfriend Katie grew up in what I understand to be ... Not a great home. I don't want to take anything away from that, but I think it's made her react a little excessively to certian things.   I'll give a few examples.   One time, the family nextdoor in the duplex was arguing and she put on loud music to drown them out. The landlord texted her asking her to turn down the music as the other family's request.  She replied saying "They were having an extended screaming match, both the length of time and the level of agression was upsetting to me to hear. Frankly if it occurs again, we may be calling for a wellness check instead of trying to ignore it by playing music."   I felt like she overeacted coming out with threats and not even apologizing for the music.  Another time, she was at work (we both work from home for the same company, I referred her for a job a year ago.)  I heard her on a call saying "Respectfully, I will not be able to continue this discussion when you take that tone with me. I will be rescheduling this meeting for the same time tomorrow, I greatly hope you will come to that meeting with your temper in check."  She left her office and I asked her what was up. She shrugged and said she was off work early. I said I overheard her call, who was she speaking to? She said the name of a senior manager.   I asked what he said. She said it wasn't something she wanted to get into outside of work, and now she was off the clock. I said that it was stressing me to hear her speak to a senior manager like that, I had referred her to a job, and her behavior would reflect on me. She said that no employment is worth being subject to someone unable to control their temper  One other time, we had gone to hang out with my brother and his girlfriend, we were all drinking, we were having a bonfire and she threw a shot of whiskey in to see it burn and he raised his voice to say she was throwing his money away.  My girlfriend stood up and headed out, not another word. And she told me later she wasn't interested in hanging out with my brother again unless he gets his temper in check.   Overall, I feel frustrated because I think she is too quick to walk away or accuse someone of something bad whenever anyone raises their voice.   I brought this up with her, And she got really upset with me, saying I was asking her to tolerate abusive behavior that, as an adult with the agency to choose, she was choosing to not tolerate.   She said she needed a partner who would not just respect her choice to not tolerate agression in her life, but also have her back.  I said I thought she was way too sensitive to what she called "agression" and she got very frustrated and said quietly that I was sounding just like her dad, I had just repeated his favorite sentence.

h3qv6jk7	This requires backstory:   I am the eldest of three children. Growing up, I realized things were not the most normal. What I mean by that, and I am going to put this really simply, is that I raised myself. I did my own laundry since 5, cooked my frozen meals, made sure to get myself to school and waking myself up on time, and just other things. That doesn't seem all too bad, right? Well, I noticed things were weird when I had to be the one to wake my sisters up, get them dressed, fed, and ready for whatever they had to take on. My dad often was away on travels, and my mom, well, she was basically locked in her room for my entire childhood. The house was often disgusting, the laundry room filled to the top with clothes, and she did the bear minimum. If we had to be driven to tennis, then that's fine. When it came to cooking? She would get fast food.   However, that is the basics. My mom, in my opinion, is not only a manipulator, but verbally abusive. My parents always called it discussions, and then they would blame it on being northerns. But, in reality, my mom pushed my dad until he finally cracks. Then they make up the next day and pretend nothing happened. My siblings and I were traumatized to the point where we didn't care if they got a divorce.  I was home for winter break, from college, and my mom and father were arguing per the usual. She then slammed into my room, my dad telling her to leave me alone and asked,"You had a good childhood, right?"  I said yes but she then said,"You're lying! Tell me the truth!" And, the flood gates kind of opened. I refused one more time but she kept on insisting. So I was honest,  "You used me as a therapist when you had no one else. You often blamed dad for your mistakes, and you did the bare minimum to keep our childhood. I raised myself, I raised my siblings. And you throw money at me and try to pretend everything is fine. You put so much pressure on me. Last year? When you had a meltdown? You drove two hours to my college and told me that I was the only thing keeping you from driving sixteen hours to your hometown. Do you know how much pressure that put on me? That I am the only thing keeping you from leaving? That's not fair to me."  At this point I was crying, I mentioned about our time to Amsterdam and how it was ruined when she stormed out of the room after screaming my dad at 2 in the morning ALONE! And I continued, unleashing my pent up anger. I didn't stop until she slammed the door and left.  My dad told me I was too harsh but he is sorry and didn't realize what I went through. So AITA? I haven't spoken to her since I've come back to college, she's blocked on everything right now.	1643163215.0	scukrw	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scukrw/aita_for_telling_the_truth_about_my_childhood_to/	AITA for telling the truth about my childhood to my mom
9pw9mrns	I've been having trouble with two if my roommates, let's call em Marc and Saul, since the beginning of fall semester. We butt heads mainly because they're weed addicts and Saul is a drug dealer. So far they have chased two guys out of our apartment in one semester because of their activities. They're also assholes.    I've tried to have a conversation with them to fix our issues but it ended with them screaming at me that I thought I was better than them or treating them like kids. Since then, Marc has changed the story about the confrontation and added that I tried to harm him. Luckily i had been documenting everything with my RAs and our other 2 roommates, to prevent this slander from affecting me academically or legally.  However, I'm concerned about the dealing and how it may affect me still. I live in the hispanic dorm on campus because I went to white schools all my life and I feel at home here. But all of us being brown and the stereotypes around Latines with drugs, I'm afraid of if my roommate gets caught, what will happen to me. I've seen how police and even campus police act towards us. Too risky and I want to get away from the possibility of being involved in a bust. Idc if people smoke weed, my problem is them doing it indoors and dealing. In our state, dealing is punishable by jail time.  The school cant do anything until they catch them smoking or dealing but they rely on my RA for reports. Unfortunately for me, my RA uses my roommate as a plug so he wont do anything.  My dad's a lawyer and wants to write a letter about the RA's involvement in these activities. He had admitted to my parents he is aware dealing is going on from who and how. I feel guilty that the RA could find himself in massive trouble even though he sucks at his job.  I'll admit I'm peeved I've been ignored this past semester but I worry I'm letting the anger get the best of me. Two guys have already been chased out of my apartment so it's not anything new or personal.  Should I talk my dad out of writing the letter even if it means I have to leave?  WIBTA if I didnt talk him out of it?  Tl;dr RA wont do anything about my crazy roommates because one roommate is his plug. My dad wants to report it to the school, this would ruin my RA's future.

j0zf7p5p	This event actually happened in the past, but its been tearing me up inside for months. I've been friends with these two girls for a long time and they've always been a bit toxic. Anytime I would talk about a problem I had, they wouldn't care or they would have this weird tone, like they were kind of judging me for being upset when they would be passive aggressive with me.  One night, I was at another friend's birthday party, a slumber party, and before I was going to sleep, one girl offered me a rice Krispy. I declined, and the other girl kept asking if I was sure. I said no, but they kept asking. I said no one last time, and I went to bed irritated. However, I was almost asleep when i heard them talking about how the rice Krispy was an edible one girl bought off of someone (Marijuana is illegal in this state, and we are all minors). My brain immediately told me that they didn't even tell me, they wanted me to eat it without knowing.   Months pass, and our friendship changed since that night. I've been avoiding them a lot, but we have almost every class together so I simply tolerate them. Over time, they continue to mess with me even after I try talking to them. When I block them for a short time, they complain that I should have talked to them. This pattern repeats, and I get sick of it. Finally, one day I snapped. I went onto my private story where my friend group was and I posted the story of what happened that night. Later, I get a metal waterbottle slammed in front of my lunch from one of the girls and I ignored her. Today was actually the day when I started getting hate messages on my anonymous answering app and people kept calling me a liar and that I make it harder for "real victims" to come out and say their stories. I did have other people who believe me and im grateful for them. In the end, a counselor was called and we all had to talk. I feel so broken on the inside because people keep spamming hate to me. Was I actually in the wrong for speaking about what happened?	1643163319.0	scum2l	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scum2l/aita_when_i_posted_on_snapchat_about_my_former/	AITA when I posted on snapchat about my former friends trying to drug me?
8z849gxw	Title, we’re both very much in love, no reasons to question trust between us etc  She is currently best friends with an ex FWB she was seeing regularly before me. He’s her close friend, someone very important to her. I’ve had no worries about them spending time together and actively tried not to interfere with her relationship with him. Initially, it was difficult to feel comfortable and understand their bond, and set boundaries about them living together and talking about our sex life/relationship.   But after getting to know her and her friend, its become clear to me that I shouldn’t feel distrustful and insecure, and I regret asking her to do this. I feel terrible and selfish, and would like to give her the option to live with her friend (which I know would be her preferred living situation, both financially and emotionally).   Right now she refuses to live with him because she worries that it will negatively impact our relationship / make me unhappy, despite me telling her otherwise.

c7ibfxue	I am a first time mother (F20) and my husband (M21) is going to be a first time father as well. I've had an over all very positive pregnancy, little to no morning sickness and tame cravings, but it did come with severe anxiety. I can't tolerate the presence of anyone for a long period time except for my husband. This especially goes for my in-laws!   In the earliest months of our relationship, I was charmed by his family. I quickly learned how fake their behavior was not only towards me, but to other the women in serious relationships with their sons as well. The women who my mother in law swore were enemies and wanted to hurt people, were really just normal people who didn't agree with her opinions.  Towards the beginning of my pregnancy, there was a conflict going on between the mother and the wife of one her sons. She was quick to talk bad behind their backs a lot and tried to get every family member to form some sort of alliance with her, even having his own brothers call and text to shame him and demand that they apologize to her. This isn't the first time the situation has happened to them, and they've even done it a few times to my husband and i as well. The only difference is that this time around, my brother in law and his wife had enough and swore off all contact with his side of the family except for my me and  my husband who want no part in that situation.  I've heard that she has been saying little things here and there such as I've been conspiring with the other wife and that I'm being selfish with my pregnancy and husband, but it's been a few months since they've completely crossed the line with me so I'm just keeping my distance. Even going to their house for longer than a few minutes stresses me out. My husband has started to notice that and while he doesn't take offense he still feels a bit sad that we don't go over as much, but I just can't handle it.  Now my due date is in 2 weeks. The thought of most people holding my newborn doesn't sit right with me; however I can picture my mom and dad, my sisters, or the brother in laws that haven't crossed me holding her after a she's a few days old. On the other hand the thought my mother and father in law, as well as their sons who have directly offended me or my husband makes me very uncomfortable. I wouldn't do it to spite anyone purposely, but the idea of people who impact my mental health in a bad way influencing my children (even in early years) doesn't sit right with me at all. Not to mention I am a bit of a germaphobe and have a dog allergy; they aren't exactly the most germ cautious people I've met and they certainly don't clean the dog hair as much as they should, but I feel that way about acquaintances and strangers as well. I really don't want my newborn to get sick, or have an allergic reaction if she inherits my allergies and eczema.	1643163601.0	scupcu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scupcu/aita_for_not_wanting_my_in_laws_to_touch_my_baby/	AITA For Not Wanting My In Laws to Touch My Baby
7a2oxkb8	So some history first: my step dad came into my life when I was 10. He has no children and while our relationship was rocky at first, he adopted me and has been my “Dad” for the past 10+ years. He and my Mom split but he still stayed in my life and is very important to me.  His birthday is in April and I booked a tattoo that will be dedicated to him. I told my Mom and she is angry and hurt. She feels upset that I’m getting a tattoo for him, not her, since she raised me and they had a pretty messy break up. I will admit that he was cruel to her at the end.   I’m second guessing getting it now. My step dad was not the best partner to my Mom, and he wasn’t too keen on me at first, but over the years he has grown into a loving, caring man and Dad. But again I respect my Mom for raising me as a single mom and don’t want to hurt her. Also afraid she’s going to throw a fit over this and what was supposed to be a memory of my chosen family will turn into a memory of family drama.  TLDR: getting tattoo for step dad who adopted me as a tween. Mom doesn’t like him and is angry I would get a tattoo for him, when she raised me.   So, AITA for getting a tattoo for my step dad (mom’s ex) when he was a jerk to her during their breakup?

ft5su33q	My dad got mad recently because I wear headphones all the time, and no I’m not kidding.  It happened a few mins ago I was minding my business in my bed till he called me, to be honest I couldn’t hear him, and it wasn’t because of my headphones. I don’t use any special headphones that cancel noise or something, it’s just regular headphones. Then he got mad, really mad just because he couldn’t raise his voice. He literally screamed at me saying that why I wear headphones all day, I told him that the reason that I always wear headphones was because I didn’t want to bother the people around me and that I have some sort of insecurity that I don’t want to show people what I’m doing or watching, and also because of my brothers, they are literally the loudest shit in the house and not mentioning that my neighbors are insanely loud. He wasn’t content with my response, so he literally grabbed my headphones and threw them away, theatening me that if I ever use headphones again he will take away my phone.  Seriously I’m not sure if I’m a spoiled brat or my parents are absolute assholes.	1643164037.0	scuuqe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scuuqe/aita_for_wearing_headphones_247/	AITA for wearing headphones 24/7?
iun8i6v1	I (29f) am an avid buyer of sales and being part of different social media where people sell used items. The old adage is “One man’s junk is another person’s treasure.  A lady who is also a friend places 20 books for sale for $5.00.  I immediately reply to the post to purchase the books, and pick up the books from my friend for $5.00.   Later that night, I receive a call from the lady that she accidentally sold her husband’s first edition The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck 1st printing. She tells me her husband is livid and it is creating marital discord with their marriage.  I tell her that I will look into the situation and get back to her with an answer.   I explained the situation to my parents and they said under no circumstance do I return the book. It is ethically and morally yours, and you have no obligation to return it.  My husband disagreed with my parents and said it was an honest mistake and you will lose your friendship over $1000 book accidentally sold.   I subsequently took my parent’s advise, and kept the book, and she kept the $5.00.  AITA for not returning the book and losing the friendships?

du7pgpev	I'm very lonely and unloved.  I'm a single female (30) and aromantic (for those who may tell me "if you want someone who hugs you, go get a boyfriend!"). Aside from this one friend of mine (M 28 gay) who lives three states away and therefore I don't see all the time, absolutely no one hugs me. Before meeting said friend almost two years ago, I haven't had a hug in years, even before the pandemic. My own family don't even hug me.   I've addressed the issue with my family several times but that just makes things worse. They usually just snap at me and yell me no, that I'm an annoying pain in the ass.   They're emotionally unavailable and lack any affections, but are very generous with birthday and Christmas gifts. I, however, am not materialistic and not into gifts; I would much rather prefer hugs and affection.   My family always demand things from me like I cook, help them move, decorate their new condo, ETC. I'm stupid and oblige cause I'm a foolish idiot. But since I receive no affection, I feel more like a servant than a loved one. :(   The month before Christmas, I spent my 30th birthday alone without a single hug.    My family gave me plenty in the way of birthday and Christmas gifts but I feel hurt. I feel it is their weak excuse for lacking any real hugs and affection. Before my birthday and Christmas, I told them that I didn't need gifts and would much rather prefer to just have some hugs.  Sick of it, I went and either returned their Christmas and birthday presents; And the stuff I couldn't return, I just donated.	1643163801.0	scurwe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scurwe/aita_my_family_wont_hug_me_or_show_any_affection/	AITA: My family won't hug me or show any affection, so I got rid of presents from them

I had a cancelled date so I went with him, we had a nice time that was it.  I got a text today from Adams girlfriend “I can’t believe you I knew you liked him but this is insane that you’re so desperate he isn’t interested back off” I responded with a question mark and she sent a zoomed in picture from the wedding where Adam and I are sitting close and laughing in the background and a second text “really think I can’t see it” I told her that we were laughing that I went because a date cancelled and I ended up with a bridesmaid’s number. She blocked me after and I reached out to Adam who said they were ‘dealing with some things’ and that it wasn’t my fault and I shouldn’t worry.  I feel bad, I know I wouldn’t feel great if my partner went to a wedding with someone and I saw pictures of them buddy-buddy so I’m questioning if I should have gone with Adam at all.	1643164820.0	scv4ib	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scv4ib/aita_for_being_my_friends_1/	AITA for being my friends +1

iw44w5k6	I have three kids. My young(15) Emma has  Down syndrome. During the pandemic I lost my job but my husband kept his. In order to support the family on one income, he required to be moved to an office in California. We had to move suddenly, new house, new town, and new schools for the kids. Emma is a freshman in high school. I will admit I am protective of her. In her previous school, she stayed in the special ed program due to some learning disables. This meant she didn't really social with the other kids. The special ED program kept her with a certain classroom, a different lunch period and on a different class schedule than the "normal" kids. At her new school, I requested she be put in their special ED program like I always have. After giving her an assessment, the officials at the school said Emma didn't need the special ED program other than for tests and homework help.   My husband and I decided we would try it for the year and remove Emma if she didn't do well. She has done very well in the general population. She gets extra time on tests though and homework help if she needs it. About a week ago, Emma begged me for a sleepover with her friends. I told her she could have four friends over. Now I will admit I hadn't met any of her new friends yet. Emma has talked about them a lot though and she was really excited. The sleepover comes and all the girls were normal. That is not a bad thing, don't hold it against me. I merely mean that all her old friends from the old school were from her special ed program. Emma had a great time at the sleepover.   After her friends were all gone, I asked why she didn't invite any of the kids from the special ED programs. Emma said none of them were her friends, she doesn't like any of them and for once she just wants to have normal friends. I told her that was very rude to say, that she wouldn't write off people for being different, and even suggested that we have another sleep over with some of the kids. Emma got very upset with me! She screams that she likes having normal friends and she's not special!  I grounded her. Later my husband said I was being too hard on her. He ungrounded her behind my back. I think I was being far cause I don't want Emma to just hang out with "normal" people. She's always been in special ED programs.

8e1780ej	I'm an almost 21 year old female (my birthday is coming up soon). My dad (45M) has been disabled since birth. He's had 21 surgeries to correct his feet/legs, and he can walk most of the time. I'm my dad's caretaker. Being his caretaker involves working on his feet first thing in the morning and right before bed, keeping a clean house, and making sure he gets everywhere ok -even at home. He's fallen before in the bathroom.- I even accompany him to his doctor's appointments.   My dad and I had this agreement that we'd split cleaning the dishes on certain days. He rarely ever does the dishes, and then gets angry saying he's done more than I have. I've kept up with my end until two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I got very sick. When I recovered, I saw the whole kitchen was covered in dirty dishes, and the fridge was disgusting! I deep cleaned the fridge, and got halfway through all the dishes. My dad didn't lift a finger and just watched TV. Well, I ended up spraining my left shoulder and tearing the muscle. I now can't do any exercise for 2 more weeks.   The whole kitchen is covered in dirty dishes again, and my dad just watches TV while I'm going crazy about it. I've thought about cleaning the dishes and putting the ones I own in my room. I mean, he's not doing his chores and making me suffer. Here's where I might be an asshole; I own 75% of everything we have in our kitchen.

I went through a bit of trouble to get myself a flag to represent my identity, since my dad doesn't support this stuff, getting it without him knowing took a long time and was very difficult, so this flag is importent to me, when the bird moved into my room, I said that if it touched my flag then we were going to have probloms, up until today the bird would use the bathroom on the door under the window, and floor, I didn't care much until today, I found that the bird had used the bathroom on my flag, I was pissed. I rolled the bird cage out of my room and into the hallway, told in a loud voice that my sister "needed to clean up after her god damn bird" and slammed my door. my mom came it not to long after and said it wasn't a big deal and that my sister probably just hadn't noticed. but it didn't stop me from being anymore angry becuase at the start my mom was on my side when I said I didn't want the bird near my flag.

j0z7ugh7	I (43F) have been trying to teach my daughter (16F) how to drive for almost a year now. She has never showed much interest in driving, and only went to take her permit test last March because my husband (44M) and I told her it would be easier if she learned how to drive so she could take herself to club meetings after school. She would always be close to tears while driving or afterwards and I felt like she wasn't really getting anywhere.  She is now a somewhat decent driver, but even though some days she seemed much more confident and comfortable with it, she always looked like she would much rather be anywhere else on the planet. It honestly confuses me a little as to why she seems so scared of driving, as she's never been in a major wreck or anything of the sort.  There are a few wrecks which she has been told about countless times, one resulting in my neck/shoulder injury and another resulting in my brother-in-law needing years of surgery and physical therapy to repair his legs.  There are a few drunk driving incidents she's been in as well. One, about a year ago, involved my drunk husband driving us home very late at night. My husband and I have no memory of this, so the details I have were given to me the following morning by my daughter. I won't go into detail, but it shook her up a little. We, thankfully, were not in a wreck due to this.  After that incident, I told her that it was just the way her father was, that he had a problem but didn't recognize it. I also told her it wouldn't happen again. We didn't bring up that, or any other, incident after the initial conversation about it and don't talk about any of them outside the house. My daughter avoids alcohol, and is a bit wary around drunk adults, but this can likely be chalked up to her being a good kid with good morals.  I didn't really see any of those reasons as something that could scare her away from driving, and never took them into consideration, although now I'm thinking I should have.  Today my daughter had a club meeting after school, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to get her to drive home, especially since it was dark when she got out so she could get some night driving experience.  I regretted that decision almost immediately, as I'm pretty sure my she had driven better the first time she ever drove a car. She was overall a disaster. She also looked a little panicked the whole drive.  I yelled at her every time she made a mistake, which I feel awful about. It's not an excuse, but I was just frustrated because I knew she knew how to drive, but it was like she just forgot everything she knew. By the time we got home, I could see tears in her eyes, and I had to park the car in the driveway because when she tried, she almost ran over the mailbox.

3d4trc88	To prepare for this story, I’ll give a cast of characters.  Bubba, the 24 lb terrier/dachshund/min pin mix and my 16 month old I’ll call Ray. Bubba loves people, he especially loves kids.  We like to take walks everyday and will stop off at a local park to play.   We tend to go to a park about a mile away because it is huge.  Ray will run around and Bubba and I follow him.  Many of the kids know Bubba and will play with him.  I usually bring a ball and the kids will throw it for Bubba.  Bubba loves the attention and pets from the kids.    Today, we got a late start on our walk and didn’t have time to go to our usual park and instead went the smaller one a block from our house.    I parked the stroller near the playground and got Ray out.  I took Bubba with us over to the swings.  When we walked past the actual playground structure, a girl about my son’s age was on the second level near an opening and jumped back when she saw Bubba.  He was on the leash and didn’t react to her.  Her dad came over to her.  I made a mental note to stay away from her because she was likely afraid of dogs, and we did stay away from the playground structure- the swings are about 15 feet away. A few kids came up wanting to pet Bubba so we let them.  My son then got on one of those metal animals on springs near the swings and was wiggling while Bubba was being pet.    Everything seemed happy but then the dad walked up to me with a park employee and told me I needed to take my dog away from the playground and keep him away from “where kids were playing.”  The dad then said “I just don’t think dogs should be at the park.” I said “ok.” The dad walked away.  I told the park employee we would leave.  I felt really uncomfortable and left the playground as fast as we could.  The dad was watching us as we left.  Ray was fussing because he was not done playing.  Now that I’m home I feel pretty ashamed but I also feel indignant because Bubba is  sweet dog, he didn’t do anything except exist and this guy decided my dog couldn’t be there since his daughter was scared of an animal.  I also see that his daughter does have a right to play at the public playground and feel safe.  Since I see both side but feel like a sack of dog poop, I figured I’d reach out to this sub for a verdict.  Am I the asshole for bringing my dog to the playground?  There is a sign at the park stating dogs must be on leash, nothing stating they cannot be there.	1643165645.0	scvemz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvemz/aita_for_bringing_my_dog_to_the_playground/	AITA for bringing my dog to the playground?
3iuzmzel	Context: my parents are divorced and I live with my mother and stepfather. My father and stepmother have been barely involved in my life and during visitation would either be drunk and yelling or ignoring me completely. He has never attended anything of mine and has never made an attempt to be a father figure in my life.  I (17) am graduating in may. I’m going to the school of my dreams and life has really started to look up for me. My school is only allowing four guests to attend graduation. I want my mother, stepfather, brother (V), and grandmother to attend. In the last month my father has been messaging me asking when my graduation is so he can book flights (he and his wife live out of state). Even the thought of him coming to my graduation makes me so anxious that I puke. He makes everything about himself and I know that if he comes his parents will too. My father’s parents are genuinely terrible people, they would hit me, make me sleep in a dog kennel etc. It only got worse as I got older, the abuse turned from physical to sexual. My even grandfather attempting to make advances on me. I am genuinely petrified of them. My other brother (Z) says that letting my father attend would be the best option. He knows what the family has put me through but says it’s better to avoid the drama and let them attend. He says that my father loves me, but my father has never done anything that would let me believe that.  I know that if I were to tell them I don’t want them there that they would most likely cause a scene (maybe even show up to my house). And that there would most likely be a lot of angry texts and shouting.  My mom and stepdad say that they will support me no matter what I choose. V is backing me aswell, even offering for me to stay with him and his fiancé if my father’s family shows up. Z is still saying that it would be cruel of me to exclude my father from such an important event in my life.  Would I be the asshole for telling my father (and his side of the family) that I don’t want them there?	1643165870.0	scvhe1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvhe1/wibta_if_i_told_my_dad_i_dont_want_him_coming_to/	WIBTA if I told my dad I don’t want him coming to my graduation?
5nkvue0h	hi, minor here. i recently got some sort of irritation on my piercing and so my mom bought me neilmed to use and it’s worked great for my piercing but she said it hasn’t changed anything. it almost ran out and i asked if she could buy more neilmed for me and she said she would but she bought me bactine? which is a pain relieving spray?? i told her that you’re not supposed to use bactine on piercings (even the official bactine website said that you shouldn’t use it on piercings bc it’s a puncture wound) and that it was too harsh. i told her to return it (she had the receipt so she could return it) and she said ok.   then my dad came home and he said that his friend said that it was okay to use and that he used when he got his tattoos? which aren’t the same at all.  i told him what i told my mom and they both got mad at me saying that i was accusing them of like not doing what was best for me y’know? they just don’t listen to me and get upset when i try to explain. i even told them i would pay for it myself and they still refused.	1643165902.0	scvhso	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvhso/aita_for_wanting_to_get_neilmed_instead_of/	AITA for wanting to get neilmed instead of bactine for my piercing?
j10l1n7q	My son graduated in 2010 and my husband and I offered to pay for college for him and he said no he wants to start working. He wanted the money we would have used in college in cash and we told him no that we wouldn’t be giving him money directly only if he wants more education. He eventually gave up and we agreed to give him my used Corolla and 5k to get started. My daughter graduated in 2013 and took up our offer of college and graduated in 2017 with a degree in mathematics. We paid off the house with the money we would have spent on our son and due to both my husband and I having some chronic conditions that would make us susceptible to getting sick we retired early. My son now comes back and wants to go to college which we support but he asked us to pay for college. We told him we were retired and provisioned enough money for us to live of off but not for us to pay for his college. He has 8k saved up which would be enough for a semester and then he would have to pay out of pocket. He thinks we are playing favourites because we paid around 50k for my daughters schooling and gave him a car and 5k which is probably 15k total so he’s basically demanding we pay the difference or we won’t be invited to his wedding or be let to see him children.	1643166501.0	scvpbz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scvpbz/aita_for_not_giving_my_son_money_for_college_and/	AITA for not giving my son money for college and only my daughter?
izflad3r	I (20F) have a lot of things going on in the month of April. Last week of March is my spring break which I’m spending out of state to see my best friends new born baby for the first time & I have to pay a 500$ flight ticket. First week of April is my boyfriends birthday which he wants to spend out of state so that’s at least 1000$ ill have to spend on flight, hotel, presents, activities, etc. then my friends (call her A) birthday is right after.   Me and A have not been on the greatest terms. We known each other since childhood but soon as we became older, life drifted us apart. For her birthday every year she’ll be mad & curse me out if a problem came up & I couldn’t celebrate with her so every year I sacrificed something so I could show up. Her last birthday I struggled financially & had to max out a credit card I just opened to afford her plans & make her happy. My birthday was a couple months later. I never did anything big for my birthday growing up so this year I planned a trip 6 months ahead of time. She ended up canceling 2 weeks before the trip because her bf couldn’t go. With the 600$ she saved for my trip, she promised to hold on to it until I got back so we can plan something else for my bday. When I got back, I found out she spent half the $ and her new clothes (meant for my trip) on her friends bday trip that was the same weekend as mine. When I asked if we could do something, she said no she had no clothes & wanted to save her $. This was my first year celebrating my birthday so I was SUPER HURT.   Now that April is approaching, there’s already plans about her taking a bday trip out of state. We barely hang out now so my main priority this year is seeing my best friends baby & my man’s birthday. She didn’t make the only year I celebrated my birthday a priority so why should I now? I have other priorities now just like she did when I celebrated my birthday for the first time. I feel bad because she says she has no friends to celebrate her birthday with & I been to every birthday for 15+ years, but my first ever trip I spent with no friends, only with my boyfriend. Then she couldn’t even spend like 50$ to go out with me when I maxed out my cards for her. It’s a chance I could afford her trip but I’ll rather save it. Half of me thinks I’m being petty and knows she’ll stop talking to me entirely if I don’t show up, but half of me doesn’t care & wants to reciprocate the same energy she gave me.

j10nzgmt	Okay, so here's a little bit of background information: I (28F) have been dating my ex (28M) for 3 years. He's amazing, one of the kindest people on this planet, and we've been pretty happy together (ish.) I'm also a huge workaholic, and a month or two ago he approached me and explained he felt like I wasn't making time for him and was too obsessed with work.   Okay, well fine. Two other people had told me I was too obsessed with work, and it was honestly kind of logical. I apologized and started making more time for him. Even though he's amazing, I've felt awful in the last month.   Work is quite literally my whole life, and I have a job I've been working towards since I was 14, and I love it. I've always planned to sacrifice a bit of work for family because that's important to me. However, the more I spent with him in the last month, the more I felt he wasn't worth it if that makes any sense. I love him dearly, but he's not the one. He's not the person I'd give up this stuff for, and as more time passed, I realized it more and more, no matter how much I tried to tell myself he was great.   Two days ago, I finally decided that this relationship was going nowhere, and decided to break up with him. I asked him if we could talk, I had something important to say, but the doorbell rang, and when I opened it I found my two best friends for a surprise visit?? I was in so much shock and was also mildly upset bc I couldn't really break up with him with my best friends there.   Anyway, long story short he asked if we could continue the convo later, and I agreed, mentally panicking. The next thing I know, we're at a fair. We actually went on our first date at that fair, and the whole setup of the night made me panic that he was going to propose.   What do I know, he does propose. Some other friends of ours +his sister and her family is there, and I'm literally panicking. This guy is on one knee, and I want to break up. I quickly go "I'm sorry but no," and awkwardly shuffle away.   We talked about getting married once or twice, like months ago. Not at all recently, and even when we did talk about it, I think I said I'd be open to getting married in a year or so? Idk, but anyway.   His friend called me up and called me an asshole for rejecting him in front of friends and fam and a bunch of other people, and told me I could have accepted there and dumped him later on. I told him that that idea was shit, and I would never do that. He called me an asshole again, and my ex is refusing to talk to me.

acmr3221	My (29M) wife (26F) has this favorite light in our apartment. She likes it because it shines some pretty bright light into basically every other room in the apartment. She mostly uses it in the mornings when she's just woken up or at night when she's about to go to bed because of the indirect light it provides to the bathroom and bedroom. I'm fine with that. But then, she walks away, and just leaves the light on, especially in the morning when she's awake enough to start tolerating having a light on in the room she's in. But then she leaves it on after her eyes have adjusted, goes into another room, starts doing something else, and forgets about it. It'll end up being left on all day if I don't say something or turn it off myself. I've talked to her about it, and she says she'll try to remember, but she just keeps doing it, and gets mad when I call her out and/or turn it off after she's left it on for a few minutes and clearly forgotten about it. It's a mild annoyance that has built up enough that I decided to unscrew the bulbs and play dumb about it. Anytime she asks me to check it, I'm busy with something else, but I always talk her down from calling maintenance because "we haven't checked it yet, and it might be a simple fix." I'm really just hoping that if I leave it long enough, she'll get used to not having it and use the nightlight we have in the bathroom, or at least use light from a room she'll end up in instead of leaving one on in the hallway that we only spend a cumulative two minutes in each day.   Is this even gonna work?

i840pz16	disclaimer: I mention an ED near the end.  I (16M) am probably the healthiest and smallest in my family but I’m definitely not skinny. I try to eat clean but I mostly eat freely. I eat when I’m hungry and stop when I’m full. My mom does this thing where she will shame my sibling and I for eating “junk” and then later she will buy it for us.  Just yesterday, I came back home from school. I had PE as my last period and I was really hungry so I ate an apple with peanut butter but my dad said not to eat too much because mom is bringing home food.  I was okay with it because I probably wasn’t going to eat it since I wasn’t in the mood for the so-called “junk”. She ended up bringing home McDonalds but it was a concerning amount. I’m talking at least $40 worth.  I looked at my mom weirdly and ate another apple before heading to my room for the night. Later that morning I didn’t go to school due to both of my parents needing to work late. I stuck with my clean eating for the morning until dinner. I ate some of the MD’s from yesterday, as I started to hear my mom scoff. “as If I thought you were gonna eat healthier this year.” I took the plate I was going to eat and threw it in the sink. I raised my voice and said, “you know what, you should never speak to your son like that. If I develop an ED, remember it’s because of you.” I just ran into my room and haven’t spoken to her since, it’s been a day.

2xzqbc85	   I'm still trying to wrap my head around this.  I (F 20) live with my roommate (F 21) in a college dorm. Our dorms are actual apartments so we have separate rooms. I am always in my bedroom because A: Whenever I get back from breaks (where I actually fly home) She will be in the living room and end up glaring at me and going off to her room. B: I get nasty DM's about how "I need to clean up my mess" when I know very well that my items (Including my cooking stuff, pans, pots, etc.) are in my room. She has also grabbed my cups that were my grandfather's (that are supposed to be cleaned a certain way) and soaks them in water, ruining some of them to the point where I would have to glue them back together. I sent her a text saying I do not appreciate that she had touched my stuff without my permission and if she ends up breaking it, she would have to figure out how to get it fixed/ get me a new one. Upon her seeing this message, she wrote me this long nasty message stating that "she cleans everything" and "she isn't going to be fined (room checks) for my mess." I know this is a lie because all of my personal items are in my room and I only bring them out when I am making food/ leaving the house where I bring the item with me. I then send a lengthy text saying that I am pulling my weight and her attitude is to the point where I barely eat because I don't even want to be near her because of how disrespectful she is to me. In the text, I also explain how I have witnesses to what is my mess and that I have been cleaning every time, even when we had 3 other roommates, that I was ALWAYS cleaning. I have been nothing but professional to her, but she has been very rude, so, at the end of the message, I finally break because all this anger and confusion that I have been bottling up finally broke and I said, "And another thing, you are not my mother, you do not have the right to touch my stuff the same way I do not have the right to touch yours. I have been very professional with you and the only reason I text you is so we can resolve an issue without getting our RA involved. I am still going to treat you professionally, and I expect to be treated the same." I feel like I'm being an asshole, but at the same time, she has been harassing multiple people at this school, me and my friends included.  My dad, to who I sent the message first, says I am not the asshole, but I am not convinced. So, am I the asshole?	1643167772.0	scw4vo	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scw4vo/aita_for_asking_to_be_treated_professionally/	AITA for asking to be treated professionally?
6wughxsj	This is a bit silly but I (16f) work a minimum wage job and average on good weeks $150. Some of this goes into savings and the rest is things I need or have been wanting and I try and save as much as I can so if my friends want to randomly hang out I have enough money for it. My sister (21f) works in a childcare and earns I think around $1000 or so a week. She pays a bit of board and fuel money to our parents and definitely helps them out but they cover her food and drive her where she needs to go. She agreed with my parents that once a month she would buy our family takeaway, this cost around $80 which I think is a lot but she’s totally fine with it.     Now the problem is my mum wants me to buy the family takeaway sometimes because she doesn’t want to go shopping for dinner I’m assuming. I flat out refuse each time she asks because although I do have the money it wouldn’t leave me with much. I told her so and she said that my sister pays for takeaway and I said yeah cause she earns nearly 10x as much as me and she said that money doesn’t matter and it’s sad that I’m thinking like that. I tried to explain that $80 to my sister doesn’t affect her but my mum is adamant that it’s selfish of me. My mum is very very good at making you feel bad over a lot of things but I suppose I could afford it. I have gone halves before.

6oa8ve3x	Me (f25) and my husband (m25) finished watching tv at 10 and we’re going to go upstairs. I said i needed to load the dishwasher really quick and put the dinner food away. I asked if he would be willing to rinse and put two dinner dishes in the dishwasher, I would do the rest. Husband says “I don’t want to do it now, I’ll take care of the whole thing tomorrow when I get home from work” I explained that 1. We just got our house cleaned and I don’t want to go to bed leaving the kitchen a mess and 2. I have to feed our two year old breakfast and pack her lunch tomorrow morning which is really tough to do in a kitchen with dishes everywhere. He pouts around for a few minutes saying “now is not the time to tell me you want to do this, 7:00 would have been better.” I just kept saying (while cleaning the rest of the dishes) that all I was asking was for him to put two dishes in the dishwasher. After pouting some more he comes over to the sink and says “I’ll rinse them for you” to which I reply “then just put your arm down the extra two inches and put them in the dishwasher???” He then proceeds to tell me that 1. He doesn’t want to bend over and 2. That he doesn’t know how to load the dishwasher and that he can’t do it right. I give him an “are you kidding me” kind of look and he asks me what I’m thinking. I say “I mean I’m sorry but that just really seems like weaponized incompetence I mean come on. You’re really incapable of helping me out with two dishes?” After that he just stormed upstairs and went to bed. Dishes still on the counter. Let me be clear, he does a great job cleaning the kitchen when it’s something he wants to do in his own time (he washes dishes by hand) so it’s not like he does nothing around the house. I’m just really pissed he made excuses like that over two dishes.

ij1cohze	My two best friends and I all worked at the same company for about three years together. One of them was getting married in October and so she planned her bachelorette party in early august. Now our job is seasonal, roughly mid august-early may. We tried to plan her bachelorette party before august but not everyone could go during the other times so we all settled with the first weekend of august to also try and accommodate our job. Since it was the beginning of august we only had a couple of jobs that could have easily been accommodated by other employees. We gave him TWO MONTHS advance notice. Plenty of time we thought for our boss to work out the schedule. In my bosses defense, he does have to schedule things a few months in advance with our line of work because it has to accommodate our clients schedule as well. But we still thought with all of our employees that two months advance notice was plenty and that if he had us on the schedule he could easily re-arrange it. Many times in the past we have had to accommodate our coworkers schedules for things far less important than this so we thought he would be happy for us. Nevertheless, we bought our plane tickets as quickly as we could so that we could all fly together and so prices would be cheap. He ended up texting us a few days after saying he couldn’t give us those days off. We said that we tried our best to work around everyone’s schedule and that we unfortunately weren’t going to miss it. He ended up firing our friend who was GETTING MARRIED, and had a strict talk with me and my other friend and threatened to let us go but eventually didn’t. We don’t think he fired us because him and our bride have had some issues in the past but not with us. He said he felt disrespected that we just bought the tickets without his permission and that finding people to cover us for TWO DAYS would be very difficult. While I slightly understood maybe we should have waited for his reply before we got our tickets we were on a time crunch and we truly did our best to accommodate our job and everyone going on the trip. Plus we were going to go regardless of if he approved our leave or not and we were willing to lose our jobs to experience a once in a lifetime event for our best friend. If it was mid-season when it’s super busy of course we would understand his frustration. But we are not going to miss out on important life events for a stupid job that doesn’t even pay well. Are we the assholes for still going on our trip despite our bosses frustration with us?

84t4kwpk	Long time lurker, 1st time poster. Please forgive any errors.   My (42F) daughter “Sara” (17F) and I have an awesome relationship. When school started she told me about a boy, (17M) we’ll call Tom, she started talking too. This surprised me because she’s never had real boyfriend, although she has a lot of friends that are boys. He was new to the school, lives across the street from her BFF and is on the same sports team as Sara. All of a sudden one day Tom friend zones her. She’s confused but is like whatever no big deal. Three days later Tom has a girlfriend. Sara’s feelings are very hurt but she moves on with  no hard feelings. Sara and Tom work out together for their sport and stay truly friends. I see him and his parents at the sporting events and we all say hi, hang out and such, however, outside of their sport Sara hangs out with her other friends.  Today Sara came home from school and said “mom, hypothetically speaking, if a boy asked me to prom what would you say” I said “you’re 17, I don’t think I’d care who you go to prom with as long as it’s not Tom because of how he hurt you before”. She looked at me and said “ugh, o’well, it was with a shot” and turned to watch TV  I know all of her friends and their parents and am comfortable with whoever she wants goes with but am trying to protect her felling from being hurt by the same person again… AITA?	1643168278.0	scwb0m	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwb0m/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_go_to_prom_with/	AITA for not letting my daughter go to prom with a certain boy

axu4x8b9	So to start my husband is not allergic nor does he hate broccoli. It's on of about 4 vegetables he'll actually eat.   Anyway, our cats( 2 males) have randomly started being extremely aggressive with each other so we've been dealing with that and had a vet appointment for both this afternoon. We came home & deep cleaned after getting some mess prescribed to try to reset the scents everywhere & fix their relationship. Neither of us had eaten all do. We finally finish & I go to fix our plates. We have leftover mac & cheese so I ask if he wants the mac or the rice that's intended for tonight's meal, to nobody's surprise he want both.  This may be where I'm the asshole. I didn't mention the broccoli and just put it on his plate and heat it up. While heating my plate I bring him a glass of water & absent mindedly set it at my seat, he starts to get up for water & I realize what I did & slide the glass to him then go get his plate from the kitchen. He's immediately why is there broccoli on my plate? Did I ask for that? I'm just like I figured the plate is very beige & you could need a veggie. He then finished his plate as quickly as he could & retreated to the bedroom, telling me to figure out tonight's feeding schedule on my own.

j12uvl8a	I love her, first of all. I think she's smart, beautiful, sweet, and fun and I couldn't imagine my life without her. We have a great relationship and we communicate very well. Right now she's very upset with me. We were talking about trips we potentially want to take this year. As we were spitballing ideas and she threw out Disney World, said she hadn't been since 2003. Jokingly I said, " what's astounding is you're the same height now as you were in 03".

at27tzli	Bear with me because this just happened and I'm still upset but I could really use some outside opinions.  My senior prom is in a couple months, and because it is one of those big things I was trying to get things sorted to the best of my ability. The first thing being a date- which I wanted to be my partner. We talked about it a week ago and they seemed like they really wanted to go. I brought it up again a couple days ago to get a solid answer and .. they said no. We argued about it on and off for almost 12 hours, because it was just that important to me.   In the end, they decided their answer was no due to covid reasons which really stung but I tried to respect that decision.   After a couple days of processing I asked my friend to go with me because I wanted to go and I didn't wanna be alone. They (my friend) said they'd go with me and we started planning.   Well.. my partner changed their mind after I'd made plans with my friend, which placed me in a rough position because I can only have 1 guest with me. I chose my friend because we had made plans and it didn't feel fair to ditch them.   I tried my best to explain all this to my partner, but they're really upset and I feel like an ass. We had talked about doing our own celebration like a movie/dinner thing after prom when they had made their decision since they weren't comfortable going with me, and I asked if they still wanted to do that and.. They're ghosting.   I'm so messed up about this right now. Am I the asshole? And even if I'm not, is there a way to make this better?	1643169993.0	scwv5j	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scwv5j/aita_for_choosing_my_friend_to_go_with_me_to_prom/	AITA for choosing my friend to go with me to prom over my partner..?
3azaejbb	I have three roommates, and we all share one shower. This shower is very small and only has two small shelves that can each hold one person's soaps. When I moved in, I claimed one shelf by putting all of my soaps on it. Eventually, all four of us had our soaps in the shower, one of my roommates having claimed the other shelf (call him Ron) and the other two put their soaps on the floor of the shower (call them Fred and George). We sort of had an unspoken agreement that no one would move anyone else's soaps, so all the soap remained where it was.   I noticed that whenever anyone showered, Fred and George's soaps and wash clothes/loofas would be soaked (and saturated in whatever ends up on the floor of a shower used by four guys). Me, being the empathetic person that I am, thought that I wouldn't want my soaps and wash clothes/loofas to be soaked (and saturated in whatever ends up on the floor of a shower used by four guys) every time someone uses the shower.   So I asked if they would use a door hanging organizer with pockets for everyone's soap if I were to buy one. My idea was that the shower would be empty (all the soap would be in the organizer) unless someone was currently in the shower. That way the only soap in the shower when anyone is showering is their own, and they can put it wherever they want (i.e. one of the shelves).  Now admittedly, only two of my roommates said they would use the organizer, Ron and George. Fred said nothing. I bought one anyway and shortly after setting it up, George and I both had all of our soaps in it, leaving Ron's soap on the shelf and Fred's soap on the shower floor.   However, when I went to shower today, I found that Ron's soaps were still on one shelf, and Fred's soaps were ON MY ORIGINAL SHELF! So I moved his soaps back to their original spot on the floor, and put my soaps back on my original shelf. I left the shower in this state when I was done, without putting my soap back in the organizer.  I just think this was such a disrespectful thing for Fred to do. I was the only one using on of the shelves, and I came up with a solution to let everyone use it. I offered to suffer the minor inconvenience of moving my soaps every time I showered so that Fred and George could keep their soaps off the shower floor.   So AITA for taking back my shelf and moving Fred's soaps?	1643171273.0	scx9ln	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scx9ln/aita_for_moving_my_roommates_soap/	AITA for moving my roommates soap?
j14h9hw5	So I got my brother a job at the same company I work with. I originally got a job here because our mother also works here and helped me get on. An incentive the company gives you for referring friends and family to work here is that they will pay you $1000+ (depending on the position) for each person you referred that has worked for at least 3 months. When I started my mother got her referral money and I never thought twice of it. But now my brother is demanding I give him 1/2 of the money I get from referring him! I told him no because it was my reward and his was that he had a job he desperately needed and if he wanted a bonus check he should refer some friends or other family on his own. Now he is refusing to speak to me unless I pay him $500 even though I received less than the $1000 because of taxes anyways. I want to stay strong to my belief that I do not owe him the money but I’m starting feel guilty. AITA or is he just being greedy?	1643171473.0	scxbwe	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxbwe/aita_for_refusing_my_to_pay_my_brother/	AITA for refusing my to pay my brother
j14wjyj5	A little bit of context, every Saturday from 7am-1pm I(17m) go to an Arabic class to try and learn Arabic. After class every week I go to sleep for 2 hours or else I won’t be able to function the rest of the day. For the last 3 weeks my aunt(35f) and uncle(36m) have been coming to my house with their 18 month old son. Now everytime they come to my house they always insist on letting their kid sleep in my room because it is the smallest and there is no outside light. The first 2 times I didn’t mind, I let them sleep, and I would just stay awake, the 3rd time I got kind of annoyed, but my dad calmed me down.   Fast forward to last Saturday , my dad picks me up from Arabic class, and says my aunt and uncle are coming, I get mad and tell him I’m not giving up my room, he tells me “ no problem, let’s try and get there before them so you can sleep in your room”. We do get their first and I falll asleep, 30 minutes later my aunt is waking me up, telling me to leave, I tell her get out of my room, she try’s telling my mom to wake me up but my dad told her just sleep in his room, then 5 minutes later she comes back again with my uncle telling me to wake up ( my parents didn’t know they did this) so I wake up and scream “ Gtfo of my room” and I pushed both out locked the door and went back to sleep.  I wake up and hour later to find out they left, and today I find out they don’t want to come to my house anymore.

ch16psme	I 17f live with my sister 22f and our roommate J 21m. My sister and I used to live with my grandmother after my mom died of cancer New Year’s Eve 2019. My father is sort of in the picture but not active in my life. My grandpa (not blood related) died a week after my mom did of cancer as well. My grandma started dating someone new mid 2020 and brought him to dinner for my moms birthday. The night was awful as he kept trashing the restaurant and acting like he knew my mom but they never met. They ended up breaking up and she’s now dating a new man as of mid to late last year. He is very homophobic, racist and very old fashioned. My sister is gender fluid as well as bisexual. I am non-binary and bisexual as well just not out of the closet to anyone other than my sister and roommate, and my best friend. He constantly tells my sister that there are only two genders and that being gender fluid is wrong and not an actual thing. Alone with racist comments about the issues going on in the middle eastern countries right now. He’s told me that if I don’t go to in person school for my senior year (I do full online) I will die alone with no friends. And told me to “shut the f*ck up” after I screamed in his face over him butting into a conversation about my dead mothers items I have possibly getting destroyed by a bear that got into my grandmothers car as he lives in the woods.   Now onto the real reason I need to know if I’m an asshole. My grandmother wanted to do dinner again this year for my mom’s birthday which would have been her 41 birthday. My sister and I want it to be just family so my grandma, aunt, cousin, sister and I. My grandma wants to bring her new boyfriend this year and my sister told her “I kinda wanted this to just be a family thing. Last year wasn't really the best...” my grandmother now says she isn’t going and my uncle (moms gay brother) is calling us childish and assholes for not wanting him there. My aunt (moms sister) agrees with us and doesn’t want him there either. My uncle won’t be coming as he is in a completely different state. I agree with my sister and don’t think we were childish but I want outsiders opinions. So AITA for not wanting my grandmothers boyfriend at my deceased mothers birthday dinner?  Some more information. My mom died of colon cancer when I was 15 years old and she was 39. My sister and I have different fathers but the same mother. This is the second birthday without her and after our first being a shit show, we just want this year to be family only.	1643172502.0	scxn5b	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxn5b/aita_for_not_wanting_my_grandmothers_boyfriend_at/	AITA for not wanting my grandmother’s boyfriend at dinner
8lc6tp0b	For some context, I (F21) and my partner (M24) live in a strip of 10 units. If you were to look overhead the strip it would be 10 small units with their own courtyards and a long driveway just outside so everyone can park in front of their respective units. (I live in Australia and these are really common so I’m trying to paint a picture for people who might not have seen set ups like this before.) Living in such close proximity to people you would obviously get to know all your neighbours and hope to be friendly with all of them. We are not.  Two different neighbours have young children which are under 6 which would typically be fine but they allow their kids to play in the driveway. This has caused a lot of tension between us all because while they do have a right to play outside their house, it’s proven to be quite dangerous with the constant movement of cars in and out and the fact that strangers can just walk into the driveway. I’ve brought this up with the kids AND the parents after I witnessed a child almost get hit by a car. Which is relevant because the parents (and the rest of the neighbours) didn’t think that was important and have started to berate my partner and I whenever they see us.  Flash forward to today. There are two girls who live with their single mum (both are 12 and 14? And a different unit from the couple with the young kids) and their mum is often out working or at church. I hear a knock at our door so I go out and there’s no one there. Next thing I hear a loud thud and crash in my backyard/courtyard. I run out to see one of the girls jumping my fence. This has happened before a couple of times because the girls always forget their keys. But I got mad today. I often sit in my backyard when it’s hot in minimal clothing, sometimes none if I want to tan. It’s been really hot where I am and that’s my only respite from the heat. I became violently uncomfortable knowing that these girls may do this when I’m home alone or not at home at all.  I brought this up with her mum about 10 minutes ago but she doesn’t really see why I should be upset about this. I tried to explain what I do in my yard and that it’s private and the mother just said that if I don’t want someone seeing what I’m doing I shouldn’t do it which lead to a screaming match. I understand it’s hot and that maybe the girls just needed to be in their own house but they were airing at another neighbours house before they jumped my fence. Which means they could’ve just stayed there until their mum got back.  So, am I the asshole for getting mad at the girls and their mum for jumping my fence?? I do hate confrontation and I do believe they shouldn’t be doing that but part of me still feels bad…	1643172559.0	scxnqp	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxnqp/aita_for_yelling_at_my_neighbours_for_coming_in/	AITA for yelling at my neighbours for coming in my backyard?
ija5c	 My fiancé (43M) and I (44F) have been together for 2 years. We have decided on a small wedding 60 people MAX for June of this year.  We told both of our parents early on that we are having a SMALL wedding, 60 people max. We sent out our 1st round invites to our closest family/friends, last august. The deadline for RSVPs is 1/31/22.  His mother made requests to have invitations sent to cousins/family/friends and he told her that we would consider the request, but, it would depend on the RSVPs we received back on the deadline (as we had agreed).  I sent my mother and her BF separate invites. My mother said that she was going to take her friend to my wedding as her plus 1. My mother stated that "my aunt suggested" I invite THEIR cousin (my mother and aunt's) as "we should consider the gifts we would get and \[her cousin\] gives good gifts" \[side note: this cousin has NEVER reached out to me at all personally, so we are NOT close\]. I told my mother the same thing he told his mother.  Last weekend my mother called me and started the conversation with "didn't I tell you to invite \[my cousin\]?" I repeated my previous statement about it being a small wedding and we had to stay under 60 people. I was waiting on the RSVPs. She asked if I had invited some of my cousins and I said no. She asked if my cousin, who is one of my bridesmaids, is bringing her GF and I said Yes, as her plus 1. My mother proceeded to also ask if I invited her other sister who lives another country, but will be in the US at the time of my wedding, again I said no. She then made some comment implying that my fiancé must be taking up all of the invites as I keep telling her no I didn't invite all of my large family on this continent to the wedding. She also implies that I must be inviting my friends over "who's important" (meaning family). At this point, I am losing my temper, and I tell her that is ABSOLUTELY not the truth, and MY side has all the invites. My Fiancé does not have a big family on either side. Here's where it gets even dicier: my mother says to me: "Well if \[my cousin\] isn't going, then maybe I shouldn’t go either". I was stunned. She says that her cousin is very important to her, I know she is, but she is NOT important to ME, and I repeat my earlier sentiments to her. She says that she will tell her BF to "forget" going to my wedding. I am so mad that I say nothing, as I know I will say something that I will regret later. She suggests that maybe she will un-invite her friend instead. I tell her "I don't know what to tell you, but this is the situation."  I think at this point my mother realized that what she is saying is offending/hurting me, as she says: "Maybe I shouldn't have said that. You're my daughter and I don't want to hurt you. I'm sorry". Frankly, I don't want to accept her apology, but I also know that I should. I tell her “Ok" and pretty much leave it at that. I cut the conversation as I am mad and hang up the phone.

j1599yzm	My (18M) parents planned on being a child free couple, but because of religious beliefs they kept me even if I was an unwanted pregnancy.  I don't remember when exactly I was told, but I always knew that I would be expected to move out as soon as I reached 18 years old. I have been working and saving since I turned 13 and have a respectable ammount in a savings account.  Now to be fair to my parents, they provided for me financially, they were distant emotionally but they have never been abusive.  A week before my 18th birthday (January 13th) they sat me down and asked if I have found a place to move into yet. I said yes and that was the extent of the conversation.  I was planning to live in an apartment with 4 other guys, but a friend's family heard about it and offered me their finished basement with separate access for a very cheap price ($150 a month utilities included, no down payment required). So I jumped at the opportunity even though I know it is a pity offer. It is relevant that both his family and mine are of Indian descent.  I moved out the day after my birthday and my parents haven't contacted me since. I admit that I did not reach out to them too.  Yesterday my dad called to invite me to dinner. It was awkward even before they asked me to move back in, said I don't have to pay them rent or anything. But here's the thing, I like my new living situation, it lacks the awkwardness and tension that I didn't even know was there untill I moved out.  When I said no, politely at that and thanking them for the offer, my mother started crying and left the room, while my dad started scolding me and saying that their friends are excluding them because of the "rumour" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.  I said that that was exactly what happened, and it isn't my job to save them from the consequences of their actions and decisions.  Now my whole extended family is calling me nonstop and saying I am being an AH.

j157d0om	I (24f) recently moved out of my Dad's house from New Jersey to Illinois to live with my boyfriend. For some background information, i have never really asked my dad for anything aside from looking at my car from time to time. He would rely on my credit score occasionally or ask me for money to tie him over for bills or house maintenance on top of the agreed rent we discussed. Before I moved in with my boyfriend, my boyfriend came to visit me and my family. We were joking around and my father heard my boyfriend say something he thought was derogatory (which it was not) and he heard it out of context. So there is a little resentment there. I have a lot of friends in New Jersey that ride motorcycles and one of them was getting rid of some safety gear for free. This safety gear is my boyfriend's size, so I reached out to my friend to let her know I was interested in it. So, instead of her shipping the package to me, she wanted to drop it off at my Dad's house so he can ship it. I told him about it being for my boyfriend and he got upset with me for not asking before hand. He basically went on a rant of how I should have asked permission first instead of just "volunteering" him for the shipping. Meanwhile I also told him I will be paying for the shipping and there is no rush.

j14l5yaz	My friend and I know Anna due to us being in the same clubs in college. I initially thought she was really cool and I did hang out with her. She was publicly vocal about a lot of things I cared about. I had been hanging out with her for a few days when she said to make fun a few Chinese guys in our college. She was making fun of their accents, making fun of how they dressed and playing into some shitty stereotypes and it was very dismissive.   I am really ashamed that I didn't stand up to her, I was shocked by the things she said. My dad is Chinese and my mom is white. People just assume that I am white. I was just shocked by the shit she was saying. It really hurt me and I just stopped hanging out with her gang.   This happened about a year ago, We share a few courses and she missed a lot of classes due to getting sick. Peter, a friend of mine was also in the same course. She asked him to help her with an assignment.   It really ticked me of because he is Asian too and she has no qualm about making fun of the Asian and then asking for help. He usually helps everyone so I talked to him and told him about my things she said last year. He was kinda shocked but he decided not to help her.   My best friend knows about what happened and she thinks I am being a real asshole as I didn't confront this directly, I held grudges and I was too much of a coward to speak up when it mattered and then going behind her back to hurt her grades.   I feel bad because she does usually get good grades and her grades really weren't great this time around. My best friend things I took things too far and It has almost been a year and she is seriously upset with me about this. I feel like shit because she is usually right about things and I feel like I am coward for how I handled this.	1643173577.0	scxyyh	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scxyyh/aita_for_forcing_my_friend_to_not_help_a_girl/	AITA for forcing my friend to not help a girl ?

They asked if we wanted to go with them. I said no. My husband said he wants to go bc it will be fun for our kids to play there together/ have that experience. So we have been researching to see if it is feasible. They want to get an air bnb, if we go I want to stay on property. Our kids still require car seats, and renting a car and or walking from an air bnb feels silly. My husband says I’m an asshole bc I’m not trying to make things work and just looking for a no.

gtb5imkw	My (27f) husband (29m) has very strict helicopter parents. My BIL (15m) and I can’t do anything right according to my in laws. We have bonded over that fact. My husband is the golden child.   My BIL has had a girlfriend for the past couple of months. He has been telling me about her for the past few months. I understand 100% why he doesn’t want his parents to know he has a girlfriend. I have been treated like shit for the past 8 years, we have had to do a lot of marriage counseling.   Last weekend BIL informed me that he thinks he has an STD and needs someone to take him to the doctor. I told him if he could wait until Monday I would pick him up from school and take him to urgent care.   He couldn’t wait so FIL took him and he told the entire girlfriend saga to FIL and the doctor. (He had a UTI)  My in laws are really pissed. They told me that I overstepped and I had the right to tell them what was going on. She informed me that I need to parent my own children and not hers. That is in regards to the fact that I told him to wear a condom during sex and offered him some that I had. They are very religious and have not completely taught him sexual education.  My husband is super torn on who is right and who is wrong. (He is upset about that comment she made about my parenting.) I do kind of feel like I’ve overstepped here. In my eyes I don’t think telling his parents he had a girlfriend or that he told me before anyone else would’ve gone over well.

ca1ls	I (M27) am getting married to the love of my life (F25) later this year. I thought we had a wedding party of 3 each basically cemented until the other day when she came to me and said that it was basically non-negotiable that her brother (M18) will be in our wedding party. I know 3 is a somewhat small number for a wedding party but she has grown apart from her high school friends and has not made many new ones since then, I have 3 brothers 2 of which I am somewhat close to and have been in the wedding party of approximately 4 of my high school friends whom I am still somewhat close with.   I have been mulling over my decisions of who I would need to cut in order to get my number closer to hers. Now she is telling me that we HAVE to use her brother as one of the people in our wedding party, I do not want him to be as I am not that close to him and do not feel it is appropriate for me to cut some people who I have known basically my entire life in order for her to have her only sibling in our wedding party.  Am I TA for not wanting him to be up there when I am already cutting out people who I would much rather have or do I need to get over it and have her sibling up there for her?	1643173689.0	scy03r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scy03r/aita_for_not_wanting_my_fiancees_brother_to_be_in/	AITA for not wanting my Fiancee's Brother to be in our wedding party
51ms8kdf	Hi all! First-time poster, long-time lurker. Reposting because it was too long last time.  Backstory: I (23f) moved across the country in June 2020. I made friends with "A" (22m), who introduced me to his fiancée "L" (22f) and their (at the time) roommate, "T" (23m). A few weeks in to us hanging out, T asked me out to dinner, I said yes, and we ended up going out for a few months and had a really good time.   However, come fall 2020, I was realizing that I had a lot going on, I wasn't in a good place, and I needed a bit of time to settle in to this new place and figure myself out. I told T as much and that I wanted to be friends. He was really good about it, we had a good chat, and agreed to just be friends going forward.   So earlier, A and I had found out that we have the exact same birthday, so February 2021, the four of us went out for a joint birthday dinner for A and I.   Come summer 2021, T ended up moving away for work and was gone until early 2022. We texted a bit during this time, but not a ton, but I realized that I really, really missed him. I saw him once at Christmas and it just kind of reaffirmed for me that I really missed him and still had feelings for him.   So when he got back in January, T was texting me one night about planning this year's birthday dinner for A and I. We chatted for a bit, then ended the conversation for the night. However, I couldn't sleep because I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I said screw it, and texted him telling him how much I missed him and that I'd really like to be more than friends if he was interested. T said he still wanted to remain friends, but that he actually had a gf. I had NO idea, but apologized immediately, told him I was happy for him, and said I was absolutely good to be friends.   But this is where I may be the AH. I was talking with L a couple weeks later and she mentioned the birthday dinner. The thing is, selfishly, I don't want to have it this year. Not because I'm petty and jealous, but because I REALLY don't want to be a 5th wheel at my own birthday dinner. If I had a date or something, no big deal, absolutely it wouldn't be an issue. But having to go to my OWN birthday dinner as a 5th wheel, especially when I already feel like a bit of a loser after my confession to T? I just don't know if I could do it. So WIBTA if I told them I couldn't do the joint birthday dinner this year?	1643173723.0	scy0g1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scy0g1/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_a_birthday_dinner_for_me/	WIBTA If I Didn't Go to A Birthday Dinner for Me?
bsqq6xd0	Hi! First time poster. F 17  For context, we are new immigrants and these guests/distant relatives are the only family we got in the U.S.  So recently, they came over to our house. The thing is, one of them is a pretty heavy weed/tobacco smoker. Because of my eye problems, especially my hyper-sensitive left eye, smoke makes my eyes burn and tear up, kinda like onion but stronger. I asked my parents to tell our relative not to smoke/smoke outside, but they told me that they do not want to upset him because he is a guest in our house (middle eastern culture), and maybe I should just go to my room when he decides to smoke. I then proceeded to (**very calmly in a normal tone**) tell them that although I respect that, I have the following arguments to defend my case:  1- The comfort of me, their daughter, should be their priority. If my friend wanted to bring a cat in the house and my mom is bothered by cats, I would either ask her to leave the cat somewhere else (as much as I love cats) or not come over at all if the former is not an option for her. The comfort of those in the household should be the priority.   2- My PHYSICAL PAIN from smoke is on a higher level of importance than the inconvenience caused to my relative by not smoking/smoking outside. My parents and the relative, as any decent human being, have a duty to accommodate that.   3- HE should be the one to set aside his CHOICE to smoke inside to avoid causing me pain. I should not hide in my room to accommodate his CHOICE to smoke because my eyes have no choice in hurting when exposed to smoke. Having me go to my room is not fair.   My parents then proceeded to argue back that while they did have a duty to not make me feel pain, they have no duty to do it in a fair way. They gave me a choice to go to my room when he smokes, as a way to avoid pain. It is their house, and they have the right to go by whatever fairness (or lack there of) that they want, as long as I am not hurt or in pain. **They also told me that "it is just easier to ask you to go to your room, you know how hard (insert our relative's name) can be to deal with".**  I responded that I should not be banished to my room for something I have no choice in, and the fact that they are accommodating his choice to smoke inside because he is not as agreeable as I am is sending a very bad message, and I said to them, once again, very calmly, that "it feels like I am being punished for not being a difficult person, you doing this suggests that I should be unagreeable and throw tantrums to get my way".   Having, in my opinion, ran out of arguments, they yelled at me that I should stop "talking back to them" or else they might just kick me out altogether if I keep up that attitude, since I am turning 18 in march and me living with them is a privilege and I should thank them instead of talking back (as if defending your position is equal to ungratefulness).   So tell me, fellow redditors, AITA?	1643173720.0	scy0er	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scy0er/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_tell_our_guest_not/	AITA for wanting my parents to tell our guest not to smoke?
j158v9o6	I (32F) am getting married this spring and have 4 people in my wedding party, including my sisters, my future SIL, and my best friend who happens to be a guy. I have had a lot of opinions about the bridesmaid dresses, which has led to some tension. One of my sisters kept suggesting dresses that were inappropriate (too low cut, too short, too tight, etc.), another sister kept trying to convince me to change the color scheme, and my future SIL hates dressing up in general and would complain that literally every dress was uncomfortable. It’s been a nightmare honestly just trying to get them to agree on a simple, blue dress. My best friend, however, has great taste and I trust him to choose whatever suit he wants as long as he sticks to the color scheme. My sister was complaining to him at my bridal shower that I’m being crazy about dresses, expecting him to commiserate with her, but was surprised when he said no, I’m letting him wear whatever he wants. Now, my sisters have banded together against me, demanding that they should be allowed to wear what they want too. (My SIL isn’t involved in this for now.) If I trusted their taste, I probably wouldn’t mind. But I don’t, at all. Now they are saying I’m a bridezilla and I’m so stressed out. Am I being an AH for demanding that I have a say in their bridesmaids dresses, even though I’m letting my best guy friend choose his own outfit?	1643173969.0	scy32h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scy32h/aita_for_not_caring_what_my_brides_man_wears_even/	AITA for not caring what my “brides man” wears even though I had opinions about the bridesmaid dresses?
755nz3ln	I rent a unit in a townhome complex — most of the other units in the complex are owned by people who have purchased their units outright, AKA owners. I’m in a small minority of those who rent their units from others.   I moved in with my partner in March 2021 and have loved it — EXCEPT the neighbor directly below me has a huge, aggressive untrained German Shepard.   I tried to be cool about it at first, but within a month it cornered me, barking and snarling and trying to bite me. I cussed out the owner and reported it to the HOA, who ordered it to be muzzled and visited by a professional trainer at least 3x a week.   The owner complied and all was well for months and months. No incidents whatsoever. BUT, starting last month, the lady has let the dog act up again. She is no longer muzzling it and it recently cornered by partner and I right outside our unit — just three days ago.  TBH, I’ve had it. I reported the dog again to the HOA because it was unmuzzled at the time of the incident — they said there was nothing else they can do because she’s an owner. I said fuck that and called my landlord directly, who arranged a chat between her, I, and the owner.  APPARENTLY the owner of the unit, the dog owner, is taking care of the dog for her daughter, who purchased it as a puppy and can’t take care of it. The daughter wants her mom to house the dog until she (the daughter) can afford a house for it to have a yard to run in. Mind you, daughter is 20 years old and we live in Los Angeles. The owner told us she is in a tight spot because the dog is so aggressive she doesn’t know what to do with it — to prevent it from hurting her, she locks it in a crate for most of the day, taking it out for a short potty break twice a day. Apparently it just went in to the Vet because it is suffering extreme back pain which I attribute to the fact that it’s been locked in a cage for 12+ hours a day, 7 days a week.   From my conversation with the mother she refuses to surrender the dog because she doesn’t want to upset her daughter. However, I wasn’t willing to accept this answer — not only is everyone else on the complex being jeopardized by this owner, the dog is obviously suffering. I work for LA County so I leveraged that to call our Department of Animal Control directly and told them the animal was in pain and threatening everyone around it. They agreed to inspect the unit and did so today, ordering the woman to surrender the dog to them.   She and her daughter are FURIOUS — knocking on my door, calling me every name under the sun. They told me I’m a heartless bitch who doesn’t deserve to live. TBH I’m torn — I feel for their situation but I also feel like they weren’t doing right by ANYONE by keeping the dog, including the dog itself. AITA?  Tl;dr neighbor’s dog is aggressive and suffering. I called Animal Control and they took it away. Now my neighbor is out for blood.

a8m58fcy	Background:   I (29m) have never gotten along with my mother's (62f) boyfriend (54m), Frank. We'd had issues since they started dating, at which point I still lived with my mom. Frank had trouble paying his rent, and was deeply in debt, and therefore moved in only a few months after they started dating. Immediately he started causing drama, brooding, and having angry blow outs periodically. We mutually dislike eachother, putting it mildly. In the summer of 2019, I briefly moved out with what was at the time my girlfriend (now my wife), before she went back home abroad to finish her studies. Once she moved back, I moved back with my mom and to save money.  Story:   When I moved back, I felt it best to let bygones be bygones, and make peace with my mom's boyfriend. After a couple mostly uneventful weeks, I walked in the front door to see a camera recording full video and audio of the main area of the house. Where conversations go on, where people relax and so on. With internet linkage directly to Franks phone (and notably not my mom's).  I immediately expressed discomfort to my mother, and stated it was a huge breach of privacy, particularly given the history. She said Frank only wanted to protect the house since he had valuable music equipment. I disagreed, and thought it was a huge coincidence that I move in and suddenly cameras come out. My mom said that if I really trusted Frank, I wouldn't have a problem with it. After all, Frank doesn't want to spy. He'd only check the cameras if there was a break in. After much teeth pulling to no avail, I gave in.  But I decided to try an experiment. While on video chat with my now wife, I showed her the cameras, speaking openly about how violated they made me feel in my own home. I said "HI NOSY FRANK!!!!! YOU'RE NOT WATCHING ARE YOU?" And then flipped off the camera. Two middle fingers.  Frank was furious. And my point was proven. As per usual, I found out through my mom. My mom said he'd only found out because he'd seen something of interest while reviewing footage. That he'd gotten a motion notification. Gee, how'd that happen?  A huge blowout ensued, I wasn't sorry, I'll never be sorry, and I moved out of that place last August with my wife,  where I live happily ever since.   So what do you think reddit.

hdv3euw7	on mobile, sorry if this post looks like hot garbage.  for context, I'm 17, nearing 18, and I can't currently get a job due to my mental issues (that I have tried to open up about but have been brushed off) that make my every day life extremely hard.   my mom racked up a lot of credit card debt that she hid from us for years, and she wants me to take over some bills to "teach me responsibility" while my family pays off the debt, but considering I can't work, that wouldn't really work out. I've explained this and she won't budge, she insists I can do some jobs around the neighborhood and pay for it, but again, my mental health won't allow it for the time being.  everyone is insisting I should just suck it up and do it for her, but I don't feel I should be responsible for her debt in any way.

dgxb2qy7	Context: my sister is currently going through a tough time, she’s been recently diagnosed with clinical depression and I’ve been supportive for most of the time, she’s been to therapy and she is better now but still in the process. I, a 19 years old college student who pays part of the rent of the apartment and help with dishes and cleaning (she does the cooking cuz I don’t know how to). I try to do my best to make her days easier. So once a week, some times twice, I go to my friends’ place just to catch up and talk, I usually use my car but this week it wasn’t available, I (respecting her right to know where I am) told her I’d be going to Ana and her twin’s place I asked her to drive me there, but she told me to use her car instead, I thought it was fine and left the apartment at 4:00 pm, we (my sister and me) talked on the phone at 7:00 pm, she asked “When are you getting home?, I told her I will be on my way home after dinner. I got home at 9:45 pm and my sister was really mad.  She started saying that I shouldn’t be out  that late. I told her it wasn’t that late, but she was really mad and told me “it’s my house, so you got to play by my rules”, I told her “it’s my house too”. And I said that if she was planning on getting rules for the house she would also have to respect them (she goes out without telling anybody where she is going, with who she is going or when is she planning to get back home) we argued a little more, and she told me how it was so much harder for her when she was my age (she’s 24 now).  I told her i didn’t invalidate her experience but no body is asking her to babysit me and if I was such an inconvenience to her, then I could just leave, she responded with a “life is not that simple” and went to sleep. I thought of making my word true , but first I called my mom and explained the whole situation, my mom convinced me to stay with my sister, and tomorrow I could get back to my hometown.  Now I’m in my bed writing this post, but I feel bad about fighting with my sister. I really think it’s unfair that she treats me like that but I don’t know if was an asshole. Some more info: I don’t drink. Also English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry for my grammar errors and if a said something in a wrong way.	1643175921.0	scynjb	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scynjb/aita_for_almost_running_away_from_home_after_a/	AITA For almost running away from home after a fight with my sister?
7wkw56mf	Excuse the errors, typing on a cell phone   Some contexts: I 20M currently live in a dorm with my roommate “Kevin” 18/19M. I am not necessarily a clean freak, but I like to have the room organized and trash and things to be picked up or thrown away. Kevin does not seem to care in the slightest about any of these things. His half of the room is a complete mess. Clothes thrown everywhere, garbage on the floor, dirty dishes, and a pile of filled trash bags. I have told him multiple times to try to pick things up and keep the room remotely clean, to no avail. This was all irritating me enough as is, but it all came to a head tonight.   We have a microwave in our room that I bought but share with him. He was microwaving frozen White Castle sliders and overcooked them to the point of setting off the smoke detector in our room. We left while that was being dealt with and came back to a room that stunk and a microwave that was disgusting. I told him to clean out the microwave if there was a mess, as was dousing the room in air freshener and opening the window. He said there was no mess to clean. I opened the microwave to find a mess all over the inside, which I pointed out to him and asked him to clean since it was his mess. He grabbed a paper towel and wiped something in the microwave. Then he sat down at his computer and put his headphones on. When I checked the microwave a few minutes later it looked the exact same, I honestly don’t even know what he wiped. I spent the next 15 minutes cleaning it out myself since he obviously couldn’t, and by then I was furious. It wasn’t so much that he burned something, but that I had to clean up his mess, yet again, as this was not the first.   I, Kevin, and Jake (who lives next door to us) signed a lease to live off-campus next year. The lease does not guarantee that we will live together though. Jack and I are good friends and were planning on living together already. Kevin wanted to join us, and we obliged. Initially, I figured his meds would be confined to his room (we would all get our own bedrooms). However, I have been growing increasingly frustrated with his messiness, and if we share a kitchen, trash cans, living room, etc. next year will I or my other roommates be stuck cleaning up after him again? Here’s where I would feel bad though. He literally does not know anyone else on this campus as he has never tried to meet anyone and never leaves our room. Also, overcooking something in the microwave is an innocent mistake and I would feel bad doing this over something as little as that. Also, he already signed a lease thinking he would be living with me and Jake, is it wrong to tell the apartment people that we now do not want to live with him and make him go with random people.   It should also be noted that he is slightly autistic, although according to his mom, as long as he takes his meds, he’s fine. If his mom hadn’t told me, I wouldn’t have even thought anything of it, he seems to function normally.	1643176081.0	scyp2w	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/scyp2w/wibta_if_i_tell_my_roommate_i_dont_want_to_live/	WIBTA If I tell my roommate I don’t want to live with him next year?

She asked me to take the dog due to the fact her son never showed up. She refused to give me his shots and any proof he was now my dog after saying he was my dog. She is now yelling at my mom and calling police to get the dog back but never said anything to be about getting the dog back. I only found out after police.

e3ffcbow	Obligatory first time poster, also on mobile.  I (25F) live in a block of flats (UK) with my partner. We love our flat, it’s cosy and very lovely compared to others in the area. However, every morning at 5am the neighbours alarm goes off. They have one that vibrates and one that plays an annoying tune. The issue I have is, they do not turn it off. I don’t know if they’re awake or sleeping through it, but as of right now they have both been going off for an hour and a half. We’ve asked them before to not set so many alarms but they continue to do so. I completely understand that people have to get up for work and some people can be heavy sleepers, so that’s why I feel like TA because it can’t be helped that the walls are so thin/both of them are heavy sleepers.

i7s1brem	Around Halloween my friend group of five, including myself, was looking for something spooky to do. After some searching I found something interesting, and when I brought it up (in a group chat) everyone confirmed that they were interested. This being pandemic times you have to book and reserve everything. It would be messy if we each individually went through the booking process, so my friends appointed me event planner. I told everyone that I would be buying the tickets together, but I wanted everyone to pay me back for their own individual ticket by the end of October. Everyone said that was completely fine, and so I proceeded to buy the tickets.  Two of the friends e-transferred me the $22.77 ticket fee right away. And the other friend paid me in cash just before we went out for the event. The final friend, let’s call them Emma, still has not paid me even though it has been more than a month. At the start I gave gentle text reminders about every two weeks, and when I saw her in person I’d say something similar to “Whenever you get the spare change can you pay me back for the ticket please?”  She’s started ignoring me about the matter and my other friends are telling me to let it go because it’s not a lot of money to get upset over. I’ve explained that I don’t exactly have cash to spare, that I can’t afford to pay for friends, and I only bought the tickets on the groups behalf because they confirmed that they could afford to pay me back. After this discussion Emma had outright refused to pay me back. Am I the asshole here?	1643180566.0	sczxb8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczxb8/aita_for_insisting_my_friend_pay_me_back/	AITA for insisting my friend pay me back?
egv8eea9	I (F28) and hubby (M31) have a 18 month old. We both work from home in the tech industry, his jobs is more demanding than mine and I have a flexible schedule so I often work after baby goes to bed so that I can spend time with baby during the day. Hobby is a basketball coach, and loves basketball. He coaches at a high school every weekday, it pays about jack shit but it’s his passion and he loves it, in addition he also coaches some 1:1 kids on weekends 1/2 of the day.   I started feeling burned out and a tad bit resentful hubby gets to have all this passion time while I am “”””stuck”””” at home with our daughter sunup to sundown, and I don’t get that same free time to go do something for myself after he clocks off work like i would if he didn’t coach. So I suggested today if maybe he could tap down on the hrs, or maybe drop the weekend coaching so I could at least have one or some days of the week I could perhaps go to the gym or just do NOTHING. This was met with much resistance, and how marriage felt like a prison with demands and restrictions (I have before this complained that he goes clubbing every weekend where I cannot) he then shamed me for doing daytime activities like go to the Forrest or the playground or gymnastics with our daughter during the day because “who does that” which I then got upset over because I think it’s great I do outdoor activities with our daughter where he thinks that she is just fine being home watching tv “chilling”. I got so frustrated and felt so unseen in my request I started suggesting we should perhaps consider if marriage is still for us since we often have these spats and I feel like I can’t communicate issues with him.   He says I can just have me-time during the day (that would mean just have our daughter watch tv or sit on his lap while he work) and I would not enjoy said me time knowing I could be doing something good and stimulating for my daughter, that’s why I need some evening time where he can they take her to the part or something while I could do something or do nothing. But that would mean him giving up some % of his passion.   He feels I am being an asshole for requesting this, I feel he is being selfish.	1643179728.0	sczp6s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sczp6s/aita_for_requesting_husband_spend_more_time_with/	AITA for requesting husband spend more time with his child instead of hobby
j18z7gon	I live with a roommate, and he has a small dog that I was happy to let live with us. My roommate loves this dog more than anything else in the world, and sometimes the dog-PDA grosses me out. I'm not talking about normal things like the dog licking his arms or even his face, but more unusual things. For example, my roommate will sometimes nibble on the dog's ears, or let the dog lick his mouth immediately after the dog had been licking his bare feet, and even sometimes lets the dog lick his teeth.   Since it's his own dog he obviously has a right to do that stuff in private, but I asked him to please not do it in front of me or other guests since it makes me uncomfortable and grosses me out. When I made this request he got very defensive. He said that I was being very unreasonable, and that he should be allowed to kiss his own dog in the comfort of his own home.

4itipkgd	My mom has been pushing for me to become a physician since I came out the womb. Very early on she’d say things like “Doctor so and so became a cardiologist because his parents wanted him too. I want that for you too” etc etc. When I started college, my mom told me to not worry about tuition if I choose an affordable option in state. Initially I was set on the medical school pathway. Stuff I had initially seen on the interwebs and my own wants out of a profession lead me to believe that med school was the path for me. However, the more I talked to those in the field and as my professional desires began to change as my college experience progressed, so did my opinion about pursuing the medical school pathway. There are countless reasons: increasing red tape, administration "performance metrics", the lengthy steps taken to avoid litigation, increasing scope creep from midlevels, paper work, poor lifestyle for many specialties even after residency, learning more and more about how arduous the medicals school and residency process actually is, debt, and concerns about not matching into the specialty of my choice due to poor clinical grades, LOR quality, or Step 2 CK scores.  I was looking for alternative professions, and almost two years ago (summer of freshman year) I stumbled on the CAA path (anesthesiologist assistant). Administering anesthesia sounded rewarding and fascinating. The training time was much more reasonable as well (28 month masters), work life balance was easy to obtain in the field, and I didn't have to worry about matching into a field I had little interest in. Once you get into AA school, you're guaranteed a career in anesthesia. I shadowed the profession over winter and spring break and was sold.  I explained to my mom how this was the graduate program I wanted to pursue and my rationale for making the switch. I could tell the blessing she gave me to pursue this path was a reluctant one. Ever since, although she says she accepts my decision, she has continually expressed her disappointment in me for not wanting to pursue the physician pathway. I have a 4.0 in my coursework with most pre reqs done, and I think my EC list is dec (non clin and clin volunteering, PCE, clubs etc) . I say that because every time I accomplish anything academically or otherwise, she'll use that to say "See! You're doctor material. This is why you need to go all the way with your medical training!" " or something to that effect.  I feel so guilty for letting my mom down like this. I know that pursuing medical school solely to make my mom happy is a recipe for a lifetime of bitterness and resentment, but I just don't know how to handle this guilt. I know nothing would give her as much happiness as much as me becoming a physician (because she has said so multiple times), and the reason why I'm getting my bachelors debt free is because of her. Who wouldn't want to make their mom feel that happy?  Idk I feel like a bad son these days.

They is a girl named Ginger that works this lot on Fridays, you can find her on channel 11 if she's working, mention my name for $5 off.	1643181062.0	sd01sd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd01sd/aita_for_questioning_my_boyfriend/	AITA for questioning my boyfriend?
772ic7gh	I'm a F 19 and recently have started to sell my photos online which has been fruitless by the most part, A few nitros here and there but by most part 99% just bots trying to make me buy bitcoin. So yesterday I shared with my close friends a screenshot of a paypal transaction that was most likely faked,  It was a transaction of 5,100$ USD which a "sugar daddy" had sent to me (Probably faked but we will see in a few days)  So my friends reacted to the screenshot in the normal way; Telling me I'm going to prison for my actions and that I'm going to be kicked out of the country I'm in right now, And called me a "Proxy prostitute".   I became really hurt by all that (I didn't expect them to explode on me and im generally bad at communication) distanced myself from them only talking to one of them to explain what happened.  I woke up this morning to see that my friend said the following in a social media post;   "it hurts to think that so many people around you can be fake asf and you don't know it until they're doing everything to drag you through the mud for no reason and then lie about it "     Followed by my other friend replying to it, Agreeing. I want to be held accountable for my actions but I do not understand what I did wrong since I didn't do anything deserving this reaction. Am I the asshole?	1643183007.0	sd0j8t	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0j8t/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_becoming_a_discord/	AITA Am I the Asshole for becoming a Discord kitten?
7sfl0knf	I (20F) am in a group of friends (8 of us) that I met recently in university. We eat out sometimes and we usually pay our own bill when eating out. Well the other day, my friend, "Liam" (21M) sends everybody the same message that he's "taking everybody out for Egyptian Food" as he is half Egyptian.  So I and the others think he is going to buy us all dinner because none of us were planning on trying Egyptian food and he said he is "taking us out", so we all agree to go since we think we're getting free dinner. None of us confirms with Liam that we're getting free dinner, we just assume it from the wording of his text.  When we get to the restaurant, we are all given menus, but Liam instructs the waiter that we don't need the menus and he is going to be ordering everything. And Liam also does this because we also don't know the different meals/what is good.   So Liam orders everybody a $6 drink (it's like a popular drink in Egypt), and none of us ask for this. Liam just wants everybody to try his favorite foods. He then proceeds to order for the entire table, getting all his favorite foods and what tastes good.  We proceed to eat, and honestly, it tasted really good. They were shared meals, so it was just grab what you want. Except, another girl, Clare, has a low spice tolerance and I could tell that she didn't like the food that much cause it was overwhelmingly spicy for her palette.  When we finish, we go home and I get a text from Liam saying I owe $35. If I knew I was paying, I would've eaten more of the things I liked, and I wasn't really full at the end. As a result, I'm kinda pissed because Liam said that he was taking us out and now we all have to pay for a meal we didn't really want. And Clare didn't even like it or want the food. Usually, when we go out, it's a shared decision of where we want to eat. And we didn't even get a choice of what to eat, he just chose everything for us. If I'm going to pay, I would at least like a decision on what I want to eat.  I don't want to pay Liam back and I've been avoiding him and saying that I don't have the cash on me. I'm going to pay him back eventually, just I'm kinda mad at the moment. He is giving me passive-aggressiveness every time I see him. AITA?  Also, I should note that we are studying abroad, so Liam pays with his foreign credit card, but then we all pay him back in cash, and I think this is a ploy to get a good cash exchange rate.	1643184302.0	sd0vjv	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd0vjv/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_after_a_friend_said/	AITA for not wanting to pay after a friend said he would "take everybody out"
ixg45kev	I(22F) and my boyfriend(22M) have been together for 4 years but have lived together for 1.5 years. When we moved in with each other, I had a 8 month old dog, a bully breed . She is currently two years old. I have put a lot of time and energy into training pur 2 year old buy breed because I know the stigma that there is regarding bully breeds. On top of that, our bully breed has never been "aggressive" or anything to begin with, she's the biggest baby and with A LOT of training, she has became a great family dog. Up until Christmas of 2021, we only had our bully breed, until my boyfriend's parents gifted him a 4 year old doberman that costs thousands of dollars. I of course was happy to be adding another addition to our family. However, even after introducing the two dogs to each other slowly over the course of weeks, the doberman was very aggressive. She has not only bitten me, but has also attacked my other dog 3 times. My boyfriend acts as if just because the doberman was thousands of dollars and is a pure bred She can do whatever she wants. She has shown signs of aggression to me, my dog, my boyfriend's toddler nieces, yet my boyfriend refuses to recognize that she has bitten/attacked everyone just listed. He let's her do whatever to the point that she has torn up furniture, uses the bathroom in the house, and shows her teeth to our bully breed whenever our bully breed gets too close to my boyfriend. I told my boyfriend that she needs training, and that I would even put in the time and effort to train her myself and he argues with me every single time I tell him that she needs training. It has gotten so bad that I told him if he wasn't willing to train her then he needs to give her back to his parents, and he went I to a furious rage calling me selfish.	1643185425.0	sd154f	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd154f/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_ge_either/	AITA for telling my boyfriend that ge either needs to train his dog or give the dog back to his parents.
ffep38j6	Apologies for any possible typos, I’m on mobile.  I (21F) recently got engaged with my partner of two years. My family was excited, etc etc, nothing to report there.   When discussing potential wedding stuff a few years ago, I had told my sister (now 18F) that I had planned to make her my ring bearer; this is because she really hates wearing dresses and prefers to dress on the masculine side, so it was a way to cater to her preferences and still include her in the ceremony. She was really upset by this idea, and said she would be hurt if she wasn’t a bridesmaid. I warned her that she might not get to wear a suit, and she said she was fine with that. So, when I got engaged, I made her part of my bridal party.  Recently I sent her ideas for her attire. They were things like slacks and a loose button up/blouse, or maybe a nice sweater (my wedding is in the fall, so I figured it would fit fine), all monochrome in a nice emerald to match the bridesmaid dresses.  She said she didn’t like them, and that she didn’t want to wear anything feminine. I told her that I wasn’t making her wear a dress or heels, and that I wasn’t comfortable with her wearing a suit because a) colored suits are extremely expensive and I know my family will complain if she has to buy something like that and b) suits are very stiff looking in comparison to dresses and I wanted her outfit to be more harmonious with the rest of the bridal party.   In response, she said she would rather wear a suit and that she just didn’t like the style I had sent her, because she might stick out. I asked her for other ideas and she told me she didn’t have any and didn’t feel like she would find anything she liked online. That’s where our conversation ended.  I’ve been kind of torn with how to handle this for a few reasons, the main one being that photography is really expensive, so it’s super important to me that everything looks put together for the photos that day. But I also know that my sister is the type to be very loud about her discomfort and will likely complain to me the whole day if I don’t let her wear a suit, which will stress me out a lot. Plus, my parents will call me and be angry with me over it, and they’re hard enough to deal with as is.  I’ve been thinking about just removing her from the bridal party and having her do the ring bearing thing instead. I know she’ll be hurt and my family will be upset with me (my relationship with my parents is already very tenuous for various reasons) but she would still be invited to all the other bridesmaid activities, and it means she can wear the suit she wants. However, I can see that it would be kinda messed up for me to disinvite her from the bridal party.

8txtezsv	I am in pre u and we have to do this coursework that is compulsory for us to graduate. Our very kind hearted teacher guided us, one by one, from the beginning til the end of the coursework. But then there's this one lazy classmate who didn't do shit, EVEN WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE TEACHER, and he just asked almost every one of my classmate to share our COMPLETED coursework to him. According to him, he needed our coursework as reference and he won't copy A WORD from our work. Most of us did share our work with him, despite unwilling, we still did because we felt sorry for him. I made him swear to not copy my work (i sent my work to him in microsoft word form. stupid, i know) and he promised.  So the AITA story starts here. We had our coursework presentation today, AND my friend found out that he copied her work, word by word, for one whole section. He just changed a FEW words to make it seem like it's not plagiarism but it's still so fucking obvious. So, my friend told me he copied her work and i told her we should ask the teacher if we can compare his and her written essay. So we asked the teacher if we could confirm if he indeed copied her work and MY work in written form as well. I wanted to check mine as well because i did gave him my work too. I was just worried and anxious at the time :'(. The teacher said she'll be sure to check if there's plagiarism in his essay. A few minutes after reporting it to the teacher, we regretted our decision. We felt like we should've confronted him before reporting it to our teacher. Our teacher is nice, it's just that our pre u programme is kind of a small community and if someone's being accused of plagiarising, then it'd sure spread like wildfire because our teachers love to gossip and talk about their students. This guy is already hated enough by the teachers, we feel bad because it's like we're making things worse for him.

3xe2hnye	The title basically explains it, but ill just go into more detail. My (21F) brother (23M, ill call him Tom) has high functioning autism, which basically means yes he's autistic but he's perfectly capable of having a job and paying his bills. that being said, he struggles a bit to make friends. He isn't fully aware of everything around him, specifically in social situations in which he can come off as rude, insensitive, or even insulting even if that wasn't his intention. He can get easily over whelmed and lash out (mainly in verbal attacks) which makes him leave the situation instead of facing or fixing it, After so long he's found a girl (her name is peaches for the sake of the story) on line through Whatsapp. Peaches is a kind young lady who teaches english in her native country of the Philippines. I've only ever talked to her over face time and shes super sweet and kind. Although Tom and Peaches have only known each other for a few month and only been dating for less than one my brother is desperately trying to save up money to go see her. He soon confessed that he was going to buy her a ring, and propose to her.Im so glad my brother has someone that makes him happy in this hell scape of a planet. But as i asked further questions he soon revealed that he wanted to move to the Philippines with Peaches. Knowing my brother i cant help but to worry for him. I can't imagine what would happened if Peaches said no, but if she says yes, he'll move there. Tom knows NOTHING about Filipino culture. He's so head over heels for peaches, and im happy for him but im worried. If Tom moves there to marry Peaches, im worried how he would get a job or be able to do anything without getting overly frustrated. I know how my brother is, he cannot function without a "jimminy cricket" on his shoulder to assist him every now and then. I think its a bad idea for a person with his disabilities to move to a completely different country, surrounded by an overwhelming amount of differences and new changes im afraid he wont be able to adapt quick enough to. He'd be nearly completely cut off from me and our mom, and we cannot help him from the other side of the world if he needs it most.He has only told me, and i haven't told anyone about his plans to propose...but am i the Asshole for not wanting him to go?? I've tried to tell him about my worries, I've tried to ask him all the questions that he needs to answer before he makes such a serious decision. I've even asked Tom to talk to peaches about moving here if she says yes, but he's Tom. He so damn hard headed, and fiercely determined to move there if she says yes. want him to be happy, and he's happy with peaches, what if he never gets a chance to find this kind of love ever again? Im so worried, but i don't want to be the person to shit on his parade. Im glad he's happy, but im so worried....am i being selfish?? Am i the asshole???	1643187143.0	sd1jg7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1jg7/aita_for_not_wanting_my_brother_to_move_to_a/	AITA for not wanting my brother to move to a different country for a girl he's never met?
j1asgomn	My boyfriend (24m) and me(24f) live together for about a year. Yesterday we got in a fight about a Occulus Quest I bought off eBay. It was the first thing I bought strictly for myself since a few months and I bought it from my own money. So it's not really an issue of money or shopping addiction.  About 20 months back, I rented a Occulus Rift for a few weeks. I really enjoyed it (especially BeatSaber), but the pricetag was too high for me, so after I had to give it back, I didn't buy a new one.  A few days ago, my boyfriend(24m) and me(24f) were browsing on YouTube and somehow a video about BeatSaber came up.  I really, really wanted to play that game again. Out of curiosity, I looked at eBay for a used Occulus. At my surprise, I found an affordable one and without really thinking about it, I placed a bet (~150€). Maybe I was blinded by my desire to play that damn game again ⊙﹏⊙. Well, I got the thing, much to my surprise.  The Problem is, I didn't tell my boyfriend about it. I feared, he would be angry at me and we would have a big fight over it. He already is angry at me for not doing enough household stuff (I'm studying at home while he goes to work, so I am supposed to do most of it) and I feared he would deem the Occulus a problematic distraction from my duties.  I wanted to tell him about it in a few days when the mood was right.  He found it straight away, since I left a small note from the seller visible. As predicted, he got very angy and shouted at me for 10minutes. Not because I bought it, but because I kept it a secret. He still is offended and kept bringing it up this morning, going as far as forbidding me to use it.  I understand, it's bad to keep secrets from my boyfriend, and I apologized extensively about it yesterday. I just have the feeling he isn't considering why I didn't tell him straight away.  So is the offense really as bad as he considers it to be?	1643186933.0	sd1hov	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1hov/aita_for_buying_a_console_and_keeping_it_a_secret/	AITA for buying a console and keeping it a secret from my bf?
ctvncjin	I’m a picky eater, so I tend to order in a lot from certain restaurants or I cook for myself. When I cook my own meals at home, I cook for me. I cook only what I like to eat and I cook according to my own tastes and preferences. I don’t have a lot of free time and I put in a lot of effort into my cooking because I like to eat good food, so I don’t see the point in cooking meals that I’m not going to enjoy.  My boyfriend gets upset I never cook with him in mind. He thinks my cooking is too sweet, or that I cook certain dishes too often and he doesn’t like it. He wants me to adjust to his tastes, but then if I do that I won’t like the food.  I’ve told him that he can just order in food he likes. He’s welcome to use my kitchen and my tools if he cleans up after himself and buys his own ingredients, which I think is fair. I’ve also told him that I’m happy to cook meals that he’ll enjoy provided he doesn’t expect me to eat the same meal and that he, in turn, cooks me a meal that I’ll enjoy. But he says that’s an asshole move because I’m a good cook, and he isn’t. So that’s not something he can do.  A bit more background: I have my own place. I’m cooking in my own home. He stays with me so often he practically lives here but he also has his own place. I pay for all the ingredients. I do all the cooking and cleaning up. We both make good money, so frequently ordering in isn’t a problem financially. When we order in, we usually order separate meals from different restaurants, which he’s fine with. It’s just when I’m cooking that he’s somehow not okay with.   Reasons I could be an asshole: I am picky and selfish with my food. I offered a compromise that isn’t really a compromise because I know he can’t fulfill his part of it.

aikb025z	So, for years my husband(M45) & I(F41) have been in the swinger lifestyle. We have one couple that after many years we remained friends. We don't do the swinger thing anymore for many reasons(one being that we have kids now). And sometimes we laugh & reminisce about our wild times when we were younger.   Well, recently, we became friends with a couple in our neighborhood who has kids around the same age as our kids. Last weekend, we invited our old friends(former swingers) down for a sleepover with our kids. We all hung out with the new couple. Well, our friend's wife decides she is going to start bringing up stories from our old days. She almost let's it slip that we were swingers! I was super angry over this because this is the first mom I have connected with in our neighborhood! When we got back to our house, I asked her to never bring up the swinger stuff again. I just assumed she let it out because she was tipsy.   Well, the next day, we hang out again & my friend was talking about some of the swinger stuff again! It almost seems like she is trying to ruin this new friendship I just made. I literally had to wait until the new friend went to the bathroom & pulled my old friend aside to tell her to stop!   So, this week, my friend & I were randomly chatting. And now she says she no longer wants to go hang out at the camping party we do every year with our swinger friends. Even though the last 4 years, none of us have participated in swinger activities other than watching & it was more like visiting old friends. Then she got upset that I didn't want to go to this concert with her. And when I totalled up how much it would cost, for 1 weekend, it would cost us $1800! And we don't have that kind of money right now since we have a spring chimney repair that is going to cost $5000!   But I feel like her being angry over this is her way of deflecting what happened. And she has previously ruined other friendships I had by telling people about our swinger lifestyle. And I feel like if she & her husband are no longer in the lifestyle that she shouldn't be talking about it. Some people get very uncomfortable & will exile you. I have lost friends who have given me the excuse that "my husband said you came on to him" when they found out. And these are guys that I would never been attracted to.  So, would AITA if I kept my old friend & new friend apart?	1643187769.0	sd1p0c	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1p0c/aita_if_i_stop_a_friend_from_being_friends_with_a/	AITA if I stop a friend from being friends with a new friend if the old friend keeps bringing up swinger stuff?
bcr6y0ys	So for context I (16f) live with my dad and stepmother and mysister (16f), brother (20m) and stepbrother (30m) and my step mom is domineering and mean. She has 3 other kids that come over for Christmas, they are all over 25 and are absolute assholes who ignore my side of the family. On Christmas they all went through their 200 dollars worth of gifts  while my brother, sister and I opened our 2 gifts that cost max 20 dollars(which ended up being the same 2 things)And then we all go to our rooms while my stepmother makes her kids breakfast (we aren't allowed in the kitchen or living room when they're there and we don't really want to anyway) and my parents got each of us a shelf and a blanket. Its now January and I HATE the feel of dollar store fleece throws so I let my dog sleep with my blanket which made my step mom angry and she told me to keep it on my bed or shed take it so when I was donating clothes I put my blanket in there because i didn't like/want/use it . As for the shelves I kept them for a few days but my friend mentioned needing some type of wall shelf for books and because I have 4 of the exact shelves that I've been waiting to get my dad to help put up (not allowed to use his tools) I gave them to her since they had the screws and instructions. Forward to a week ago which was about 3 days after I got rid of them and my stepmother asks me where I put my gifts, so I told her I got rid of them bc I didn't use them and she called my dad over so I could tell him and they made me pay them 20 dollars and got mad at me and I told them that they clearly don't know anything about me considering they somehow managed to get the 2 things on earth that I didn't want and couldn't use. My siblings were mad at the fact they got us all the same gift while my older stepsiblings got to act like little kids on Christmas. All my stepsiblings and my parents keep telling me im ungrateful and an asshole and my friend told me that my parents might be hurt because I insulted them but I think they've shown that they don't care what we think and I didn't think they could expect me to just keep the things I didn't want and had no space to just let sit unused instead of getting rid of it. I think the bigger assholes are them for pretending like we don't even exist at Christmas.	1643188597.0	sd1vvf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd1vvf/aita_for_getting_rid_of_my_christmas_gifts/	AITA for getting rid of my Christmas gifts
j1b0kw4j	So my brother and I always get each other Christmas gifts, he tells me things throughout the year that he wouldn't mind owning and if he hasn't got them by the end of the year, I'll usually get him one of the things I know he wanted.   I was hinting to my brother about a few things all December, one included paintings for my house (5 in total) they match the decor in each room and the furniture and he said he'd be happy to do it. When his Christmas gifts arrived to me in the mail ...I was shocked to find the paintings and nothing else. I was under the impression that he was doing them as a favor for me and there were other things I wanted more than the artwork.   Instead of complaining about it, I sold the artwork for what he would have sold them for (it came up to about 22k) and managed to get everything I wanted on my wish list!!!  My brother was less than pleased when he found out and said I'm a complete asshole and that I shouldn't be selling gifts he put so much work into, let alone profiting off the gifts when he gave them to me for free and he could have made that amount for himself.   I personally think he's overreacting, you're not supposed to tell someone what a Christmas gift is in the first place. I thanked him for basically buying everything on my list for me anyway and now he's refusing to answer any of my phone calls or respond to any texts.   I honestly don't feel like I've done anything wrong here...people resell unwanted gifts all the time, even he's sold a few things I've purchased for him! (a tablet, laptop and stereo) but he's convinced this is somehow different.

j176hbu7	I (25F) am the only one that cooks at home. I meal plan and if my BF (26M) wants any extra snacks I make him add them to the grocery list.  Recently he started eating stuff I bought for a meal. First few times I was like ‘hey, it’s really annoying when I go cook and ingredients are gone. Just warn me when you eat them so I can replace them.’  He’d say sure and just never warn me. I made a big deal out of it a few days ago, telling him it wasn’t that hard to just tell me. I walk our dog afternoon and night and I can go to the shop if he JUST tells me when he eats stuff. He said ‘yeah, okay, I get it’ and just rolled his eyes at me.  Well, today I wanted to make pizza for my lunch and what do I find out? He ate a pound and a half of cheese! A freaking 700-800grams! I got livid because what the freak? He ate it after I went to bed, and apparently he forgot to tell me before I took out the dog today.  I said he should go get me more (shop is 5-10mins walking distance). He said no, because I was the one on a lunch break and he was still at work (we work from home. I have training all day long and cannot just be late.) I made him go and he said I was a drama queen.

5l230lk3	I live in Indiana and we my city just had a burst of snow. I keep a shovel with a bladed edge  on my porch outside my door. My apartment fails to shovel or plow the apartment so its on residents to do it. My neighbors say it isn't in their way so I keep it there year round.  Yesterday morning I shoveled a path to my car and put my shovel back on my porch before going to work. When I got home from work I realized that my shovel was gone. I ended up finding it 2 doors down in another neighbors storage spot. Its an open area under the staircase, no locks or anything like that.   I know it is mine because I carved my name into the handle last winter when I bought it. I took it back and put it into my house essentially out of spite because although I didn't mind them using it; I was extremely bothered they didn't put it back.   This morning I was awaken at 9am(I work 3rd shift so I had been asleep for about an hour) to someone pounding my door. I opened it and a woman asked me if I had taken the shovel.   I basically said yes, I took MY shovel. She the  chewed me out for 30 minutes about how rude it was and that if I was going to store it in my apartment the least I could do was keep my door unlocked so she could get it. I very plainly told her no. She can get her own shovel. Then I shut the door and double locked it with my shovel still inside. She kept yelling for a full hour letting me know that I was an asshole and a bad neighbor. I just ignored it and tried to go back to sleep.   AITA for taking the shovel back?  My family members(they dont live here) seem to be mixed because it was JUST a shovel and some think I could've kept it on the porch and had a conversation or left a note to whoever borrowed it but I feel like returning something you've borrowed should be a no brainer.	1643189765.0	sd25ig	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd25ig/aita_for_putting_the_shovel_inside/	AITA for putting the shovel inside?

d0191a0v	 Due to some family and housing troubles my best friend F23 of 8 years asked her mom if I F23 could move in with them for a while, just until me and Her my bff could move out together. Her mom said he had no problems if I paid rent and cooked for myself. I agreed because I’ve been paying rent to my parents since I was 18, and make my own meals.   I moved in and for three days it fine, then suddenly for the next three weeks I couldn’t seem to not upset her mom. Her mom didn’t like anyone to wash her dishes but her, so every time I would make food she would make weird jokes about how she couldn’t do much cause she had more dishes than usual to clean. So I tried to make less, then I would either eat to much or too little in her opinion. I once left a bite of hotdog left on my plate and she called me wasteful. My BFF said nothing and when I asked her about it said it was wasteful that I couldn’t have forced myself to finish it. I was having moments weekly where I would cry because I didn’t know how to make her mom happy with me. The last straw was three days ago.   The toilets in her house have very low water pressure so much that you have to flush waste and paper separately. I flushed a tissue without thinking because it was very late at night, and it clogged. They don’t own a plunger because her mother thinks they are gross. So I tell her and the mom pours draino down it, which you shouldn’t do, and it does nothing. She tells me to wait three days then try it. There are three bathrooms in the house, my bathroom, the guest bathroom and the moms bathroom. I am forbidden from the moms bathroom. My bff was in the downstairs and mine was still plugged. I HAD to go and my bff takes hours in the bathroom, I could not wait I was literally trying to not pee myself. I asked if there was anyway I could use her bathroom just once. She became mad I asked. She said if I was super insistent on my bathroom being fixed I could pay 150 for a Plummer. Even tho she hates people in her house and will avoid it at all costs. I reply you hate people in your house and I could buy a brand new plunger and fix it in seconds. She then decides to say that it’s not her fault I always seem to break something. I went to my room crying and called my mom and immediately left.   It’s been three days and my bff hasn’t texted me and when we saw each other, she avoided me.

j18cnxsl	Our company promoted a new assistant manager, JD. My other coworkers, BM, CA, and NY hate her. Their hatred is bc of personal feelings and how she did Christmas sales last year. I get it, I was mad about it too, but it’s over. They’re still holding onto what happened and bringing it into daily work life, as in ranting/getting pissed about the little things JD does.  BM always starts shit. Always gossiping and ranting about other coworkers, especially abt JD.  it’s usually unnecessary hate. She comes into work 80% of the time looking miserable and like she hates everyone. Her excuse is bc she’s tired, and if she’s in a mood, she feels she should just be left alone like that even if it affects other ppl.   BM told me the day after that they had a group chat/call? with CA and NY. she kept switching call and chat but emphasized phone call. she went on about it while on our shift, right under the cameras. She brought it up two other times. DH was also on that chat/call but she really doesn’t give a shit lol  I tolerate BM’s shitty attitude, but not that day lmao she was acting like no one was doing their job and her energy was just gross.  I told PK (my senior) abt it and brought up what BM said about the promotion. PK said she figured and would also let M know when she gets back.  Brought the issue up with M. She called me and we talked about it all. they’ve fired employees over this kind of thing before. It goes against company value and they don’t tolerate any drama and bullshit. The owner wanted to fire BM immediately but M stopped her and offered to give a warning first.   I text DH to give her a warning that M would be talking to her but said she just called and it was all sorted out on her end.   M calls me back, tells me DH was never in a phone call with them despite BM repeating that. BM texted DH the day of promotion her DH barely replied.   M also asked CA about it and she seemed shocked and pissed that someones spreading lies about her. Conclusion over the phone was that it’s all BM.  I trust DH, but not CA. BM and NY blocked me on IG a little after lmao I text M that they blocked me and she asks CA if she told BM. She said she hasn’t talked to her all day but I know DH wouldn’t go out of her way to even talk to anyone from work, so its back to CA. M didn’t even mention any names.   They'll talk to BM and NY within the week, which may or may not lead to BM getting fired. I’m not opposed to it, since there has just been way too many incidents. M has been working on BM’s  attitude issues but it still needs work lol  M won’t mention names but will be using the camera as an excuse. I like them but the whole thing has just been childish. It’s so high school but I think the issues and unnecessary drama with BM is enough. We never had issues before she started working here.   I really don’t think I was the AH here but having them block me on IG just tripped something and made me feel bad	1643190430.0	sd2azd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2azd/aita_for_telling_my_manager_that_our_other/	AITA for telling my manager that our other employees hate the new ASM?
iknsmcke	 I'm writing on behalf of my mother.   I (44 F) have several issues with my neighbour (35 F) pertaining to her cat. My neighbour owns a cat whom she lets out everyday, and everyday, the cat will come to my house and stay for breakfast, lunch and even dinner sometimes. Note: I do own a cat myself which is why the neighbour's cat has been visiting us all the time. Of course I'm not complaining about feeding the cat, however sometimes it feels as though my neighbour has been taking advantage of this.   As an example, every weekend, she leaves on a short holiday and leaves her cat on the streets without food, expecting the cat to come and eat at my house. However, what really gets on my nerve is she will harrass me every night asking about the cat's whereabouts. She would come to my house at midnight and enter every room looking for her cat. I'm not sure why, but this cat has to be home everynight. The next day, she would let the cat go all over again and the cycle repeats.   Note: The cat doesn't want to go back with her and I don't keep the cat either. He comes and goes whenever he pleases (unlike my cat who is fully indoors) because my neighbour says he's a street child.   AITA for feeling this way towards my neighbour?	1643190718.0	sd2df4	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2df4/aita_for_feeling_annoyed_about_my_neighbours_cat/	AITA for feeling annoyed about my neighbour's cat
965c6nvp	Hello everyone!  My partner and I just cancelled our lease for our current apartment that we share with a flatmate. To keep it short, our flatmate is just dirty and doesn't contribute to his chores at all. Luckily we also have a mold problem and are moving apart without bad feelings as this guy is also my bfs best friend.  Anyway, we've just secured our new lease yesterday which will start in April. I've been planning for months now to get a cat as soon as I was moving out of my parents house (which was September) but as it got clear we weren't staying here I decided to put that plan on ice.  By coincidence, however, I found a beautifully ugly cat on the homepage of a shelter nearby. I was originally looking for a place to volunteer at because I have some spare time left but I just fell in love.  The catch is - I don't know if it would be ethically right to adopt this cat right now.  They say on their page that she's an indoor cat only, doesn't like other cats but is also quite shy and I feel like moving after just two months will out unnecessary stress on her. On the other side she's just perfect and I'm afraid she'll be gone if I wait any longer. I know it's a selfish reason, that's why I'm unsure.  So, WIBTA if I adopted that cat before moving apartments?	1643190754.0	sd2dqz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2dqz/wibta_if_i_adopted_a_shelter_cat_even_though_im/	WIBTA if I adopted a shelter cat even though I'm moving away in April?
j1ccyekm	So, this is still kinda an active situation.  A friend (somewhere in their 20s) from my (Early 30s) DnD game group (meets about weekly) posted in a DnD based FB group about what happened in our game tonight. Ok fine. Except it had glaringly false information about what happened. I commented that the they should update with the actual info and gave a few details on what happened.  I now have a 3rd person, who is not part of our player group, just someone in the FB group, calling me toxic for correcting the record of what actually happened. They say I'm harassing my friend but not letting them vent freely.  I have made a point not to mention my opinion on the friend's emotional reaction to what happened in the game, and only on the actual facts of what happened.  The friend/other player hasn't responded, my guess is because of time difference and them being asleep.	1643191371.0	sd2jkg	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2jkg/aita_for_correcting_the_facts_in_a_fb_post/	AITA for correcting the facts in a FB post
5hpqj7hj	My sister (21f) attends Uni in WI. She flew back on Sun. I (24f) live in our childhood home in OR. I got a piano book as present from my Godparents in middle school. This book is nearly 15 years old and special. I discovered this morning that its gone. I'm upset. She'll take it for weeks or months at a time. When we went to uni together I didn't mind so much because I'd just walk across campus but then she'd also take it from my dorm. I messaged her to tell her bluntly that I'm upset with her. (Rude, I know but I'm so tired of this)  She said that she didn't realize that she had it. I said I understand but you still took it so you either need mail it or pay to replace it. She said she'll bring it back IF she comes home for spring break. I told her I don't want to wait that long and that even if it's an accident she needs to take responsibility and make it right. I'm told "I need to calm down". She then continues to bring up all the things I've done wrong.  She says "I'm not saying you won't get your book back but you're just going to have to wait till I get home" (in April). She says that she can't get to the Post Office because she doesn't have a car and then would have to buy a sleeve and stamps. Its Wisconsin in January so I get it. I told her she needs to pay to to replace it then. She says she won't and I just need to wait or that She'll send me a photocopy of the book "So you can at least have something" soon. I told her no bueno because I have no way to print them (and its technically illegal).  Now, I'm just frustrated because now it's as much about principle as it is the book. I just want her to be responsible and make it right. I feel petty but she always gets out of it. I told her that I don't want to be a dick and I get that its difficult to do things without a car but I'm still upset with her for a good reason. She tells me "No you're not. You just want it your way." I told her "No this is reasonable. Actions have reactions and even if this was an accident, you need to take responsibility. I am trying to give you options here and you chose none of the above". She reiterates that its super cold there. I told her that she has another option. She responded "You gave me 2 options and neither of them are possible and when I countered, (A photocopy I can't print) you shot it down. That is You getting your way. I'm not continuing this conversation. I can't send it back and I'm not buying you a new one."  I asked our mom what to do about it. She said I was just going to have to wait and deal with it and that she can't make her do anything. She says If its such a big deal that she'll just buy me a new one. I told her thanks but no thanks my sister needs to because she took it and has done this before. She lets out a huff and says "ThEn WhAt Do YoU wAnT mE tO dO aBoUt iT?!?" I asked her to talk to her. She slammed her stuff down and said "FINE, I'll talk to her." I walked out feeling defeated. If I'm wrong, straighten me out.

aqw4ppzn	I’ll start this by saying that I work at my fathers vet clinic, and late Monday a mother and her older children (late teens) came in with their mother/grandmothers dog. They explained to me that their mother/grandma had just unfortunately passed after a lengthy battle with cancer. She had a older but not that old rat terrier mutt that was her entire world, the dog was around 11 but was very healthy and probably had 5 good years before things would start to go down hill. They told me that their mother/grandmother wanted to be buried with the dogs ashes in her casket and asked us to put the dog down so they could continue with the process. At first I wasn’t sure if this was something we could do, so I went and asked my father and he explained that we could. But being that I would be the doing to act if I wasn’t comfortable I could say no. After a somewhat lengthy conversation, to make it brief I wasn’t comfortable turning them away knowing that they would find someone else to put down a healthy and cheerful dog. He explained what my options were and told me he would stand by whatever I chose to do. I went out and told them that we would not be putting the dog down and that we were putting the dog on a hold until the dogs safety could be assured. As I wasn’t comfortable letting the dog leave knowing what the outcome would be. There was a lot of yelling and crying about the situation, I just tried to stay calm and explain I was just looking out for the best interests of the dog. I gave them all the information on the legal avenues they could go through to reclaim the dog. AITA here? I know that if they went through the legal process of reclaiming they would most likely lose based on their plans on the dog. I just feel like such an a*s in this situation. Should I drop the hold and give them the dog back? I just feel like if this lady really loved her dog that much would she really want it put down, can’t they just burry the ashes at a later date.	1643191294.0	sd2is0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2is0/aita_for_refusing_to_put_a_dog_down_and_hold_it/	AITA for refusing to put a dog down and hold it against a family’s wishes?
j1d1qq0d	There is a practice in my workplace that if someone passes away, be it our colleagues or their relatives, the HR will pass around envelopes for us to put money in, "condolence money" they call it. They are a way for us to send our prayers and the money would be for the family of the deceased. I have always put some money into the envelopes, from $10 to $100 depends on how close am I to the affected colleague.   Last year my grandmother passed in our homecountry(my parents are immigrants). My family and I could not attend her funeral as one of our family member is at high risk and it was not safe to travel. I told the HR about my grandmother's death and was told that death certificate was required for approval for compassionate leaves, so I took annual leave instead to mourn my grandmother at home with my family.   The HR did not arrange for collection of "condolence money" for my grandmother, after the many times of me offering up mine to my colleagues deceased families. I know they need a death certificate as proof, but it would be very inappropriate for me to ask my extend family for her death certificate.   Earlier this week, HR announced that a family member of one of my colleague has passed away and started handing out envelopes again to collect "condolence money". It just did not hit me well, so this time I refused to offer any money. When the HR asked why, I told them how unfair I felt when it's always me paying for others and nobody pays my family anything when my grandmother passed.   I got told about how it was not their fault that I could not provide death certificate to let them organise one for me, and that the money was supposed to be a form of prayer, not exchange. In the end I stood firm saying I will not give any money.    Now the whole department knew that I refused to give "condolence money" and some have been looking at me disapprovingly.

d7k7y7lt	I am a qualified Social Care worker.  Typically entails unsociable hours and not great pay.  Since having my 1st child 4 years ago it has become very important for me to be home as much as possible with her. Luckily my partner's job earns enough that I can stay home.  Prior to getting pregnant I was due to go on my masters degree. I was never fully fulfilled by my job and hoped to study more. My OH knew about this of course.. My daughter will be starting school next year.  I have an 18 month old also. I feel ready to go back to it now. The problem is my partner is not fully support. The course I'm doing will require me to be out of the house from 5.30 to 10.30 one evening per week.  My partner's job is 8am-4.30 pm. He is usually home by 5 or half past anyway .  In 3 years time I would be working in this new field with a better wage, better hours and could work while my children are in school. I think doing the course would also give me a lot of satisfaction and the feeling of doing something to improve my life.   The issue is he occasionally has to cover a night shift. His job also has a lot of responsibility so if there is an emergency he can't guarantee being home on time .  He feels as though I shouldn't do the course because of this. He feels needing to be home will be too much stress and pressure on him. His job is new and he wants to make a good impression.   This makes me feel quite resentful as I feel as though I am Expected to be in the home 24/7 even though technically this is outside of his typical shift.   My own household was quite financially abusive and my father was a general misogynist to my  mother who was a stay at home parent so I think I may be misplacing anger here and Maybe he is right?   Childcare is so hard to come by but I think occasionally we could ask a family member to step in if we were very stuck.	1643192014.0	sd2pb8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2pb8/aita_for_choosing_to_back_to_college_even_though/	AITA for choosing to back to college even though it may impact partner's career
cq4txzsq	First time posting here folks, so bear with me.   My fiance (28F) and I (26M) are currently in the early stages of planning our wedding. We have come to the conclusion that we don't want to have a "top table" at our wedding partly due to my partners family dynamic (her father was absent for most of her childhood but tries to be the big "I am" and acts like a model father at family events) and due to my own strained relationship with my parents.   My parents didn't raise me. They effectively left that to the person they paid to look after me after school or I was left to my own devices in the evening or on weekends. Other weekends I'd dragged around auctions or whatever daft new thing my father wanted to do (none of them were particularly great for kids).  In the last few years,  they tried to be more involved, particularly after I moved to university and they seem to think that this makes up for 17 years of palming me off. True, they supported me through an awful break up and helped get me out of what I can see now was a massively unhealthy relationship.  Currently they seen to think that they were outstanding model parents, who were always there for me growing up and that by refusing to have a top table is some sort of slight against them and in their words "They are entitled to sit with us at the reception". Both my partner and I have tried to come to compromises with them and help them to be more involved in our ceremony but that's not enough for them. Both my mother and father have gone so far as to say that they won't attend if there isn't a top table with them at it.   This whole thing has caused so many arguments and so much stress that we have genuinely considered cancelling the wedding because it just seems doomed to fail at this point.  So I ask you, court of Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting a top table and letting my parents Lord it up like they are some sort of actual parents?	1643192208.0	sd2r03	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2r03/aita_for_not_wanting_a_top_table_at_my_wedding/	AITA- For not wanting a top table at my wedding?
i6ol61pp	Throwaway because I use reddit a lot and I don't want people knowing personal info about me.  So I(36m) and my friend, F(34m), play a lot of games together, along with my other friends. We play a mobile game that is an online base building and battle game similar to clash of clans. Well we made an alliance together and it was going pretty good but then he split off and made his own alliance with some chinese guys.   I was really upset about this because it simply was a violation of our friend code. (we wrote down a friend code and in it we state that we will never turn on eachother, even in video games) so he broke the code and now we are all mad at him. He joined the xbox party and announced that he was getting married to his boyfriend of like 5 months. We obviously congratulated him but I added that he made more of a commitment to a guy that none of us knew instead of his friends, and that I found it hard to respect him (also breaking the friend code), it was completely a joke, but he got offended about it and I was so confused. It was just a joke and very obviously a joke and all my friends laughed except him. He said he just wanted to play with some other friends of his.  I said he didn't even know those guys and he is just being rude to his friends and breaking the friend code for literally no reason. He was breaking the bro code and the friend code. He then said that I was being a closed minded asshole and that I never thought about how he felt. F then left the xbox party and then invited me to a party privately, without anyone else in it.  F said I ruined his big moment and he was gonna tell us and he wanted us to be happy for him and then that's when I yelled "we are happy for you, I just made a joke about that because you broke the friend code that we literally swore on" he said not to yell at him and left the party.

b0jajpfv	I (21 F) have a friend who is basically my sister (19 F).  She works as a server at her job and met a guy (26 M).  When she first told me about him she told me his age (26) then she changed it and said he was (23) then eventually slipped up that he in fact was the original age (26).  I’ve known her since we were children and I always try my best to be honest with her.  When she first told me about him she acted as if she really liked him. Eventually I found out he has children with two other women. I tried pointing all the red flags out to her but she just played it off as if she knew what she was doing and that she wasn’t going to get emotionally attached. I recently got engaged and when I told her she seems to have no interest in anything about it. Her main line was “you better make me the main bitch”. She seems to have little to no interest in talking about anything with me, only her and this guy. That was my main indication she was obsessed with him.  Fast forward to her telling me that she had found out he has lied to her. She found out about it because he left his phone in her car.  She seemed upset and that she was going to be done with him so I thought the situation was resolved.  Turns out it wasn’t.  The guy lives with one of the women he has a child with. The child is only 14 months old, and the mother thinks that they are still together in a relationship.  When my sister found out she was upset but continues to have s*x with him, hang out, and flirt. He swears he’s going to leave his gf of 6 years but I think it’s obvious he has no plans to do so.  My sister is in deep obsession over him, she’s already cried to me about him and has intense emotions for him.  My sister has no plans on telling the gf about him cheating and as far as I can see she never will. I’ve expressed my distaste for this relationship multiple times. My sister called me night before last and as I was trying to talk about my new tattoo, once again she has to turn the conversation to be about her relationship with him.  She was angry and told me that the gf said something pretty mean to him and how my sister thought she was disgusting, she was making the gf the villain. I lost it, I went off on her about how disgusting her relationship with this guy is and how he is a cheater. I said that he is a terrible father for doing this to his family and having no remorse for it. I told her how I think it’s repulsive that she knows he has a girlfriend and she is continuing in this inappropriate relationship and basically being a homewracker, she hung up on my shortly after. I feel bad for my delivery of what I said, usually I’m good at not getting escalated when getting my point across. I issued my sister an apology text and told her that regardless of my triggers I shouldn’t have gone off on her and that I should have delivered my opinion in a more appropriate way and that I was sorry.

She has fixed timing as she has to go to other houses as well and we are paying her according to the work she does.  My mom came to visit for a few days, the next morning I find her arguing with the housemaid about the flat not being promptly cleaned, there are so many dusty places like the top of shelves, corners etc, asking her to clean everything now, not doing her work properly etc etc. Mind you my mother is not familiar with the local language and their conversation was really messy.   I asked my mom to come inside my room first and told her not to talk to the maid like that, she is doing the work we are paying for. My mom brushed me off saying we bachelors don't know how to deal with maids, she is my mother and she has every right to deal with the maid and get the work done. I reminded her that she is my maid, not hers and if she wants to make some improvements then she should discuss with me first, I will get this done, berating my maid without even consulting me is not okay.

j1c6lga6	This may sound like childish banter, but I am actually struggling with this so I hope I can find help here.   I started streaming a few months ago, but in advance I watched multiple tutorials, did my research on what tools etc I want to use, I even did a couple of test streams to figure out if my current set up was good enough (it wasn't). It was really just me taking in information, writing down notes and troubleshooting for a few weeks until I finally had good sound, a good picture, and could start streaming. I stream with Twitch Studio (TS) and while you really don't have all the options other "studios" provide, to me it is enough and a lot easier to understand.   My friend wanted to start streaming around the same time as I did, but so far they didn't. They invested a lot of money in a great setup over the last few months but never actually took their time to figure out what they actually want to do on twitch. I told them multiple times I can send them the notes I took for TS, for example how I fixed audio problems and a recurring problem I now have when using Discord. They said no - they'd much rather use OBS because it is more professiolnal, since every big streamer uses that. I said okay, I know I can't force them to use a program they don't want.     Fast forward a bit, I have vacation soon and am finally being able to visit said friend again. We planned on streaming together for a while, but here's the thing.   I can't bring my setup. The trip is long and I am afraid of breaking anything since I can't afford that atm. So they offered we could stream using their setup. But, they still didn't do any research on OBS or what not. I brought that up, and said I will not log into my TS account from a device that doesn't belong to me. Their solution was that I could help them figure out how OBS works.   I have never used that, and I don't want to spend my vacation there watching tutorials (since I'm visiting family as well). Now, after months of saying it is too unprofessional, they decided that TS might also work for them, and that I can just bring the notes when I visit and we can figure that out.   I want to be completely honest. If they would have said this a month ago, I would have gladly send them pictures of my notes and links to tutorials that helped me, I would have talked them through the program on the phone, anything. I was so hyped to sit in a room with my friend and stream. But now that they want me to help them during my free time (which I barely have compared to them, they had about 3 months off now), in which I mostly visit my hometown to see family after we had a big loss, I am just....pissed.   I don't think I will even bring the notebook with me at this point.      So, here's the question again: Am I the asshole for not wanting to help my friend set up their stream during my vacation?	1643192906.0	sd2xfk	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd2xfk/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_my_friend_setting/	AITA for not wanting to help my friend setting their stream up in my vacation?
9lzmla9i	So this has happened a few times so far, for Christmas and another time as a gift early on when my child was a newborn, my mother in law purchased a couple of toys and onesies for my child.   When my mil gave me the first set of onesies she specifically told me (the mother) to put 2 of them aside when we were done for my sil (her daughter) to use with her future children. We used them and I packed them away for our next child without another thought about it. At Christmas time we again received a toy from my mil and some onesie from my sil and I was told by both my mil and my sil to make sure I put 2 onesies away and a toy so that my sil could use them with her future children.   When we got home my husband mentioned it when he was putting a onesie on my child and I told him that “I would not be putting anything away for his sisters future children as they were a gifts for our child and if they wanted the same onesies and toys that they should have bought extra and put it away for her kids”  While I appreciate the gift, I guess it just feels to me that they essentially purchased a gift for themselves and are letting my child borrow it in the meantime.   I know this is going to become a big fight in the future with them and I’m not sure I want to go through that… at the same time I don’t want my child to feel like they are getting something in the future and be told that it’s actually for their cousin and not them but they can use it for now… I would rather just not have it at this point and buy the stuff myself.  I don’t know… AITA	1643193599.0	sd33hy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd33hy/aita_for_not_wanting_to_put_away_the_gifts_my/	AITA for not wanting to put away the gifts my mother and sister in law bought for my child so my sister in law has them for her future kids
dbk8zxs9	So me best friend (M18) and I (F18) have known each other since kindergarten and we've been extremely close, practically siblings. Around a year ago his father had passed away and I tried my best to be there for him but he had become distant. Last year was also our final year of high school until we had to go to University and I had tried to make sure that we both kept up with out studies as I had been noticing that his grades were slipping and he wanted to work in the medical field.   It only came to my attention when I caught him in his backyard, that instead of studying he had been hanging out with a new friend group who were known at our school for being druggies and even though I had told him the dangers of hanging out with them he chose to ignore and eventually ended up doing drugs.   Around December last year there was a rumour going around the school that my friend and his mates were going to break into the school and steal the prize money for upcoming Christmas Competition. And so I waited until it was dark and snuck into school through one of the holes in the school's fences and what do you know?    Him and his mates were just trashing the whole place with a wad full of cash and drugs. I didn't want see him destroy his life further so I ended up calling the police on him. He is now facing a charge of at leat 3 years and a fine of $4000 last time I checked. I feel horrible because sending him to jail will stop him from working his dream job, his life will be heavily impacted and I already know that our relationship has been destroyed.

1n8wj5	This is tearing me up inside.  In 2015, shortly after my daughter was born my husband and I moved from the USA to New Zealand. Our reasons were mainly that we felt we could give our daughter a more secure upbringing there. (There were a lot of factors, not going into detail because word count.)  Prior to this, my grandma asked me to be the executor for her estate, which I agreed to. My mom and sister have never been good with money and as much as I love them, I understand why my grandma didn't trust them to handle her financial affairs after she passed. I, however, was always the 'responsible' one.  It had always been my intention to help take care of my mother as she grew older, but after my daughter was born my priorities took a dramatic shift. All I could think about was securing the best possible life for my daughter.  My husband got a chance to work in NZ, and I'm ashamed to say it didn't take much convincing for me to agree.  I knew my family would be unhappy to see us move so far away, but I felt it was the right choice for our girl. I promised my family we would visit every year, and told my grandma I would come back when/if she needed me for anything relating to her will. It was sad for all of us, but I still felt it was the right decision.  We did visit once a year, until Covid.  Then late 2017 my grandmother added my mother to her will as a 'co-executor' of the estate, as she felt I was too far away. Mom, as I mentioned, is not good with money. My sister is worried she won't be a responsible executor and said I was an asshole for leaving grandma with no other choice, that in my zeal to set up the 'perfect' life for my daughter I will have caused a financial shit-show once my grandma passes away.  Then in 2020 my grandma took a bad fall and ended up needing surgery for swelling in her brain. She recovered physically but her mental decline has been pretty steady since then. My mom moved in with her to take care of her, and I'm stuck here do to travel restrictions. My sister thinks I'm an asshole to have abandoned one family for another, and I'm feeling conflicted.   On the one hand I think I made the best decision I could for my daughter; my husband got a job here he never would have gotten in the states, and our quality of life overall is better. But I feel guilty that my family needs me and I can't be there...what if my sister is right?

7mb3hxua	Hear me out, title sounds like I’m a asshole.   Basically when we first met his mate had a free holiday going to Benidorm so my boyfriend went and ended up staying a few extra nights after telling me he got them nights free. I later found out he didn’t get those nights free and paid. Whatever, we move on.   1.5 years later, sake mate offers him to go on a all inclusive holiday to Mexico because him and his missus had an argument. Basically, if his mate can’t get his money back on the holiday, he’s offered my boyfriend to go for free.   Here’s where I get annoyed. I’ve been with him nearly 2 years, in which time he would of been on 2 lads holidays (granted one would be for free, but he’d also need spending money). Me and my kids have never been on a holiday with him the whole time we’ve been together, not even a holiday in the UK, and we struggle to do days out because of money problems.  I feel it’s quiet selfish of him if he went as  1. We’ve never even been on holiday, yet he’d be going on two in less than 2 years.  2. We have very low money atm, and I know he’d end up borrowing money then struggling to pay it back to people.  3. I feel there is lack of him taking my feelings into consideration.   He reckons I’m over reacting, making me feel like I’m being silly for getting upset etc.   AITA??	1643198381.0	sd4cjc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4cjc/aita_for_being_cross_at_boyfriend_for_possibly/	AITA for being cross at boyfriend for possibly going on all inclusive holiday
9sjiij	This started when I met my current bf on fb and after a year of chatting. I decided to finally go to SriLanka and meet him, ofcourse this was when covid was just blooming up and I got stuck in SL due to covid, lost my student visa and was left here to fend for myself   6 months in, his elder sister and his younger sister showed up at our place randomly all dressed up wanting to go out. I was saving up for my birthday which was in a week. She starts demanding that we take them out and basically pay for them and though I didnt want to, my bf asked me to just do it cause she was also going through something. Then his other sister's husband asked me to give him 300,000 in exchange for a laptop they were trying to sell so they could mpve abroad, and he didnt even ask me directly, so he obv asked my bf, and he didnt bother to tell him that asking for this much is absurd specially I had just recently bought a laptop for myself.   Then another time his brother suggested we go for a movie, so obviously I assume that he was going to pay his half. But my bf's charged it all to my card and when i asked why, he said he didnt have any money. so iwas like wtf, why is he suggesting to go somewhere when he doesnt even have the money to pay for his own shit?   Months later, his elder sister borrowed like 2000-3000 from us for 3 continuous months without paying back. my bf said its fine because it was time that my parents were sending money again to me to go through the next couple of months anyway. But she eventually paid like another 3 moths later to my bf , not me.   Other things happened and my bf owes me 11000. I cover up everything for my bf. On top of all this, his elder sister asks for a 1000, says she needs it urgently, I send it. then his brother asks for another 1000 for meds, I send it. Then they catch covid, now his mom wants another 7500 for a PCR test. He says that they will send it soon, then that night he tells me that his brother told him that he can only give me all the money end of Feb. Meanwhile, I still have to pay rent, my own living cost, health insurance and visa by feb.   My only requirements for him is that he keeps 50000 for living expenses, pay me 11000 from before and he has another 9000 remaining to send back home. He gets mad at me saying his family is sick, he needs to send more money back home. But I tell him that I can't keep paying for him and I know for sure he will run out of money if he sends any more than 9000 back home. I mean I already lent them so much money so am I really wrong to ask him to keep his 50000 to himself for his own costs? I mean I spend 100,000 each month. 50000 for rent which he doesnt pay for and another 50000 for myself, but i have clearly been spending more to cover up for him and lent his fam so much money And he is getting angry at me for asking him to keep enough money to handle his own costs.	1643200510.0	sd4yvy	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4yvy/aita_for_doubting_my_bf_and_his_fam_who/	AITA for doubting my bf and his fam who constantly keep asking me for money?
j1dz08pj	In high school, I had a massive year long crush on Adam. Adam and I were friends but nothing ever happened between us, I told my sister about my crush on Adam. Two weeks later, He was dating Emma, one of her friends. It sucked but I realized that it was kinda messed up on my part to keep pining on him and I moved on and dated other people.   I have not thought about him or his relationship for years but Adam and Emma got married I am happy for them as you don't usually see high school relationship lasting this long. My best friend attended the wedding and she sent me a video of the speech given by the maid of honor.   In the video, The maid of honor talked about how my sister set them up and how she had invited him along to as a date for their friend so that she wouldn't be alone while they hung out with their boyfriends. She joked about my sister talking a big game about a finding a perfect guy for her.  She also said that my sister offered them extra tickets to a concert for their first date.   My friend told me to check my chats because she was pretty sure that my sister had set them up after I told her about my crush and yeah, I checked my chats and yeah, this whole thing happened after I told my sister about my crush.   I honestly didn't believe it and thought Emma had a crush on him already and that is why my sister played a great wing woman. I texted her the video and joked about breaking the sister code and she texted back that he was never into me and I was an idiot not to see it. She said they clearly where meant for each other and she just helped the process along and she didn't mean to hurt me.   I told her that it was kinda hurtful that she wasn't upfront about what she had done and it feels like she went behind my back to set up my crush with her friend. She said I was being a child about something that happened 6 years ago and to stop pinning over a married man and she said it was ridiculous to talk about this anymore.   I feel guilty because it is right, I am 23 year old. I should be over high school bullshit and I do feel like a child bringing it up.	1643200622.0	sd4zyc	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd4zyc/aita_for_feeling_betrayed_that_my_sister_set_up/	AITA for feeling betrayed that my sister set up my high school crush with a friend.
iwiv0g9t	Throwaway account. Sorry if the formatting is odd, I'm on mobile.  Me (24F) and my ex (26M) have been together for just under 5 years. We've lived together for majority of that time, split the rent and bills 50-50 even though our money fluctuated a lot as we were both broke students on 0 hours contracts. A few months ago, I got a stable job which pays me enough to not panic about making sure everything was paid on time. This role involves confidential phone calls and due to covid I had to WFH in a separate room to my ex.  Long story short, we broke up around a couple of months ago, as I have stopped feeling safe around him. The situation has been building up over several months. It got to the stage that he has threatened to break my things if I didn't let him work in the same room as me (i would get fired if I was caught with him working in the same room and he was to overhear personal data).   This really scared me and my alarm bells immediately went off. I ended up panic calling a friend, crashed at their place and the following morning they helped me get some of my stuff out of the flat. My ex wasn't there, so I got some of my things and left everything else behind. I gave my notice to the lardlord (they required a month), and I paid my share of the rent for the notice period directly to the landlord to avoid further contact with my ex.   My ex then started blowing up my phone asking me for money for the rent and for the bills for the following month. I messaged him to say I've paid the rent money to the landlord but I'm not going to pay the bills if I no longer live there. My name was never on the utility bills as my ex was the one who chose to sort them out, and he never put my name on them.   Now, he's accusing me of purposefully screwing them out of money since now they have pay all the bills themselves. I feel bad because I know they're not financially well off, but I know that I also need to find a new place to live as my friend is generous enough to let me stay for a little while, but it is very temporary - and that will take a lot of money too.   I do have some money in my savings, but I don't want to give them over to cover the bills if I no longer live there.

j1gg6lns	This might sound minor, but I'm really conflicted. I've never had to deal with anything like this before.  I (19f) was part of a small group who were working on a cutesy little game for the past 6 months. I was doing music. Unfortunately, the project went under after 3 people left- one because he wasn't invested anymore and the other 2 because of military service. It was just myself and the developer. He messaged me to let me know the project was no longer going ahead and thanked me. I then had 6 unused songs that I loved just sitting there, so I posted them on my youtube channel as an EP. I thought it was all fine, until the dev messaged me asking me to take them down because they were for his project and he didn't give me permission to upload them separate of that. I said no, they were never in the game and it's my property. He got really mad and said it was for his project. I asked a friend of mine about it and he said it was asshole-ish of me to not ask before posting.    Now I'm wondering if I should have just taken them down?

j1gxqzv4	My husband, (45M) passed away unexpectedly recently. I am utterly devastated. He was the love of my life and my absolute rock.   I was raised Christian, and my husband was not, however we met in college, and he soon started attending Sunday services with me until eventually he was baptized and became a full member of my church. We were married in a church, our children have been raised in the church, and we have all been active and prominent members of our church community since we moved to our current town.  Since my husband’s passing, his mother has been staying with us. She and I have never got along - I found her rude and crass, and she would often make obscene comments or deliberately take the Lord’s name in vain in order to offend me. My husband repeatedly spoke to her about this, but it had no effect.  I was named the executor of my husband’s estate, and I have organized his funeral to be held in our church and performed by our Reverend, who is also a family friend.  My MIL was apoplectic with rage over this, saying I was forcing my beliefs on my husband’s memory, that I’d been brainwashing him for years and that she wouldn’t stand for it, that I have to hold the funeral at a secular location, and if not, she will take legal action against me.  My husband had made his wishes for his funeral abundantly clear, in conversation and in writing, so I do not believe that she would have any legal standing to take such action, but nevertheless the fact she would do such a thing was the ‘last straw’ for me, and I told her in no uncertain terms that if she pursued that avenue, she would never again be welcome in my home.  I understand that she is going through a terrible time, and that the loss of one’s child is unimaginable, but I too am suffering. I am a widow in my early forties with two school age children who adored their father. I understand also that grief can make people do things they would never consider in normal circumstances, but frankly this behavior is not far enough out of character for me to see this as a valid explanation.  After I put my foot down, my MIL left, and I received a series of phone calls from my SIL and BIL, calling me a number of awful names.  I wonder if my own grief is obscuring my ability to think clearly.

a0p4fo5k	Hey guys, it's my first time ever posting on Reddit so bare with me.  As the title says, I've been feeling quite uncomfortable at work as my new friend that i met from work is not really putting much effort in the friendship when in person. I've only started talking to her about a month before returning back to office and i must say, we started off pretty good. Good energy with conversations.   However, when we return back to office last week, i tried instigating some conversation but always met with single/ few words reply and the conversation just ends. On top of that, she's always on her phone and i felt so disrespected. A total 180 degree change from what she is when we were working from home  I've confronted her about this multiple times and all she said was that i was thinking too much and that she prefers low maintenance friendship. She also mention that she treats her friend similar to what she did to me in person. Mind you, she did mention before when we were working from home that I was her work bff or at least a friend but i felt it was all nonsense when we returned to office.  Right now after confronting her again, she says she's really turn off by how much i expect her to put as much effort as me into just a friendship when all i said is that i hope she puts in some effort to make me not feel like a ghost and that she now feels like staying away from me. On top of that, she's now ignoring me.    Sorry if I made you guys lost a little. Just wanted to put it out there as well. So am I the asshole for wanting just some effort in a friendship?

b74trez7	So a little context, I have been friends with this girl(17) since freshman we're senior now, after our freshman year we want to different classes but we stayed friends, and this year we have PE together, we have been doing badminton for some weeks now and usually the teacher pairs people together in groups of 5.   Yesterday the teacher didn't assign any groups and told us to pair up as we wish(but to go with people in the same level as ourselves) . So 4 girls I've been paired with before approached me and asked me to join them and I did. My friend then came and asked me to go with her and 3 other girls and I said "no you suck" jokingly meaning you're badminton level is bad and everyone around laughed.  On more thing to note we always joke around like this like she'd post me in her private story with me playing and put a clown emoji on it. (Jokingly ofc) But Yesterday she really took offense to what I said, and when I realized I apologizes to her right away.  But she has been cold with me ever since and now I'm starting to feel like I'm an asshole.  So am I?

7jn1x770	Backstory: me(16M) and 4 other people became really close at the beginning of our sophomore year and we still are. However 2 out of the 4 in our friend group have a boyfriend, and I wanna host a party because in order for us to graduate some of us have to complete OSHA (Occupational Safety and Handlers Assessment) which is a 10 hour test based around the industry we wanna work in after high school which most of us did those who didn't never needed to take it because of their vocation. However they're completely different around just us compared to when their boyfriends are here.   They're boyfriends are extremely rude for example: Me and one of the girls who were taken were taking pictures together and her boyfriend walks in and says before even saying hi to anyone "Comprehensivelab6765 I didn't realize your flip phone could take pictures" now he has the newest Iphone while I have an Android (however it's not a flip phone). Everyone else in the group also has some version of an iphone. That's not the only thing their boyfriends talk about, they'll say stuff about the clothes I'm wearing what my hair looks like but it's not like a once in a while thing it's everyday everytime they get the chance.   I've asked them to stop because it gets annoying and they tell me I'm being "Too sensitive" so would I be the asshole if I asked them not to come?	1643202919.0	sd5qcf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd5qcf/wibta_if_i_asked_my_friends_to_not_bring_their/	WIBTA if I asked my friends to not bring their boyfriend to a party I'm hosting?
etzdnycd	Background: me (21M) and my girlfriend (23F) Live together and split rent. This is our fourth month living together. During our third month together in December my girlfriend told me she couldn’t afford to spend half her rent because she works under the table and took time off to be with me on a family trip. I paid for all of the rent for one month, then I noticed my girlfriend going on spending spree’s and paying for $500 lip injections and multiple trips to the spa and nail salon.  Two days ago my girlfriend came home from the nail Salon and I ignored her and didn’t ask to see her nails or toes like I normally do. The next day she texted me and told me that she felt that I was judging her for getting her nails done and I told her that I wasn’t going to lie to her and that I was judging her for getting her nails done and trips to the spa, and all the money she has been spending that could’ve easily have gone to her half of the rent. I am about one year away from my bachelors degree and I’ve managed to pay for the degree all myself using my own money. Last month was the first month I’ve ever had to put school money on a credit card because I need the money to pay her half of the rent. Now that I have spent that money on rent I have to put grocery bills and power bills and other bills on my credit card for the first time. I explain this all to my girlfriend and she told me that I am an asshole for judging her for doing something that makes her feel pretty and that I should feel good knowing that I’m with a woman who wants to look good for me. She also told me that we have split our finances and that I have no right to judge her for what she wants to spend money on.

4v1n4b1x	I guess this is more of a "we" question, since it is my husband and I.  Ok, so, a couple years ago we made a deal with an old farmer to buy his Farmall 340 for $1000, amazing deal. These things go for like $3500 to the right buyer. We also made a deal that we would pay him cash for most of it and then do some work for him to pay off the rest. Usually we charge $75/hour for our bobcat work, 2 hour minimum, so this is how we covered $150. Everyone is happy.   Then, a few weeks later, he is saying he messed up the price, and he wants a few hundred more (it was in the $600-$800 more range). I'm pissed but my husband pays up.   Now, 2 years later, he is calling my husband incessantly for ANOTHER $150 he says we owe him. Bless his heart, my husband sends him $75, and the guy keeps calling for the rest. Finally I put my foot down and say I'm just going to send him an invoice for the equipment work we did, and he can send us the money for that, since he obviously didn't count that towards the tractor payment.   We eventually stopped hearing from him.   I am still pissed and feeling like he tried to scam us. Husband felt bad and wanted to send him the rest.

j0w4fydu	I have a stepdaughter “Anna” who I have an ok relationship with. I’d say outside of some teen angst we’ve always gotten along ok though she absolutely despised my bio daughter “Katie”  Anna is someone who does tend to hyper focus on her own feelings and can’t see beyond her feelings being hurt. I’d say she also has some anxiety.   When they were both in high school (a little over 10 years ago) she cut up Katie’s prom dress because she was so upset that it was nicer than hers (dads family had money) and because my husband was forcing Anna to go to prom (which I agree was wrong) but he thought she was being childish for refusing to go because she was unhappy with her dress.   Don’t get me wrong I was beyond furious to the point I wanted her out of the house (once I calmed down I realized that was ridiculous) and I did resent Anna for a while over it but it was high school. We’re way past it.   Recently Katie who isn’t invited to the wedding made a joke about I need to destroy Anna’s dress to avenge her. Katie and Anna’s fiancé got into a huge fight and I didn’t even realize Anna was upset, but now she’s paranoid that I’m going to do something. Katie is pretty serious and has made multiple comments about how great it would be to destroy the dress and I should do it for her (she doesn’t know the wedding date, location, or where Anna lives)  I told her I wouldn’t. She does have intrusive thoughts sometimes and right now there is no convincing her and she asked for me not to come to the wedding. Now I’m of the mindset that you cannot invite half of a couple. I told my husband that it’s hurtful and I don’t support him going without me. He asked me to just let it go this one time. I told Anna the same thing but she just says she has anxiety now. I’m pretty set on I can’t stop my husband from going without me but I’m not going to encourage him or support it. I told Anna she is being rude and my husband that he is failing to stand up for our marriage.	1643203695.0	sd5z9u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd5z9u/aita_for_not_supporting_my_husband_going_to_his/	AITA for not supporting my husband going to his daughters wedding without me and telling her she’s being rude?
j1hdjda0	I know this sounds bad but here me out. I (23F) live with a close friend (24F), let's call her Amy, while we both finish College. Generally I'm regarded as very independent, but everyone knows I will be there for them when they need it, no matter the time or situation. Over the course of the winter vacation I went home to spend time with my family, and took a break from my phone. Before leaving college I politely asked that I only be contacted if people really needed me, and Amy agreed, encouraging me to spend time with family and away from social media.   Flash forward to the first week of winter vacation and I get a few messages from Amy saying she was stressed out. I help her with the situation and wish her luck and continue on with my day. From then on she kept messaging me, not anything serious, just messages about tinder dates and saying what she did during the day. I responded at first but eventually stopped opening the messages because I was trying to spend time with my family. She kept up with the messaging, just having a conversation with herself in our chats. I muted it and looked at it every few days, giving simple but respectful replies. She continued messaging, and at one point had sent me 80 messages over the course of an hour - again not a serious message, just her talking randomly. I muted the chat and a few days went by.   Then she started sending me things in my social media. Instagram, discord, snapchat were all filled with messages from her, just random videos and memes. I didn't look at them for days and they built up to the hundreds. Eventually I snapped and asked her to stop because I'm tired of my phone constantly blowing up with messages. She simply told me that's just what she does and I should appreciate all the messages, effectively just laughing off my request. The messages continued but albeit at a reduced amount.   We are now back living together and I've been purposefully very quiet around her - I don't really speak to her past small talk and have ignored many of her random messages, though still offer help and support when she talka or asks about serious things. She has just told me I'm acting like a bitch and I explained that she is overwhelming when I asked her not to be but she argued that's just her personality and I'm being rude by ignoring that.   Now I'm wondering if I've gone to far? AITA?	1643204060.0	sd63cz	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd63cz/aita_for_being_cold_and_distant_towards_a_friend/	AITA for being cold and distant towards a friend?
4cqtw4ar	Hey so my (m15) mom (f44) fell into a trap made by an electricity company, they suddenly a few months ago raised their prices alot, and the electricity contract is fixed-term. (sorry it's the wrong word I used google translate) So she has to pay it for the next 1.5 years. The electricity is from what I know 3-6× as expensive than before mayby 30cents/kWh. The electricity company is putting the prices up and down quite randomly, i think it's to make people accidentally use electricity (like the sauna as an example) when it's expensive.   Well I've tried to do my research on how many kWh laptops use and all the info I found says it doesn't use much at all and it costs only less than 15€ in a year. So even with the expensive electricity it shouldn't be that much.  My mom has custody of all us (me, my brother (4),and my sisters (12 and 13) and my dad doesn't pay child support.  I get that the electricity costs alot but I'm trying to ask her like what if I dont eat candy for the time being so that saves money for my laptops electricity. She is really stressed out and when I even mention it she just says "can you not understand that it's really expensive".  Also my mom isn't in a super bad job or anything she just has all of us 4 kids/teens so that's why the electricity is such a bad thing.  We are already often not using lights, chargers, TV, and anything electric except things we must (like the freezer), We don't even use our fridge since its cold enough outside for food to be in containers on our backyard)    So AITA?	1643204759.0	sd6bnu	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6bnu/aita_for_wanting_to_be_online_since_most_of_my/	AITA for wanting to be online since most of my life is there?
j1hr0ux1	Forgive my grammar, english is not my first language.  It's a long one but bear with me.  5 years ago, my mother (F53) was not paying my phone bill when I (F23) started college in another city so I was often unable to make phone calls or to use GPS so I went and got my own phone line.  I managed to get a very good plan and when my mom knew, she told me to get the same offer for my little brother (M20). Mine was limited in time so I found one for 12$. When I told my mom, she basically told me to put my own bank info for now and that will she put hers later and pay me back. But here's the thing : she is super irreliable when it comes to money and she always have a negative balance despite never providing for anything in our family. My father (M79) did all that. But because he was already paying everything despite being retired, I took it upon myself and paid without telling him and so my brother could use his phone with no interruption.  Every month I often reminded my mom to pay me back but she would always say that she has no money and would give me partial refunds months later. So, I just told my brother that I would pay his phone bill until he gets to college and after that it's no longer my problem. I had no income so I was already short on money. When he got to college, my brother dropped out after a month and did nothing but he needed his phone number to look for a job or to apply to another university. When my mom FINALLY got a job 2 years ago I told her that she had to take his phone bill and refund me everything that she didn't pay or I would cancel his line.  She dragged it around for a while, so I threatened my brother to cancel his line if he didn't do anything so they got an arrangement. So I got in touch with the phone company to do so and they told me that me and my brother both had to make the call together. The problem was that I was living in another city and couldn't met them both until the next holidays. After more than an hour of my brother reluctanttly making the call just to in the end leave to see his friends, we finally managed to do the transfer.  Or so I thought... A month later when I looked at my bill his phone line was still there, so I called the phone company and they said that the change didn't get taken into account and that I have to redo it again. The problem is I am currently living in another city than my brother and he went NC due to this issue. I do know that atm he have a job so he can handle the bill so I asked my mom a month ago to tell him to make arrangement to get a new line so I can cancel his and to refund me the unpaid bills that top up to nearly 100$.  As of today, he didn't do anything, still uses his line so I just want to cancel his phone line without another warning because I think I have been very patient with this whole situation.  So WIBTA if I cancel his phone line ? I know that doing this will put him in a tough situation because it will take few days if not a week to get a new line.	1643204609.0	sd69vr	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd69vr/wibta_if_i_cancelled_my_brothers_phone_line/	WIBTA if I cancelled my brother's phone line without prior notice ?
g3r7c8c6	This is a throaway acc because I don't want this issue link to my main. Also, English is not my first language.     So my fiancé (M28) has a best friend (M28), well call him 'Alex'. Alex is married to Anne (F29) and they have a 2 and a half years old son called 'Nate'. Alex and my fiancé are best friends since childhood but unfortunately Anne and I haven't connected. We're civil around each other but that's it. I really like Alex tho. The issue is, I'm not close to their son AT ALL. But I don't stop my fiancé from being close to that kid. I mean, I can't love a kid I don't have a relationship with but whenever we're going to see him I'll bring a treat and it's always me thinking about that because my fiancé is super forgetful.    My fiancé also has 3 nephews I love as my own and I'm always getting small details for them and my SIL's love that. I also have two cousins (9M & 8F) I love as my own and I always get them the same things I get from my nephews. But ofc, I can't get 'Nate' the same things because Nate is not even in my life. I see him once every 3-4 months (they live 1 hour away from us) but I won't stop my fiancé from getting gifts for him if he wanted to.     I also must mention, Anne has had very nasty and awful details towards me. I always shut up and suck it up because I know how important Alex is for my fiancé.       This christmas I got gifts for my nephews and my cousins and I also got a gift for my bestie (we usually don't gift each other but she was going trough a hard time) and my bestie got one for me (I'm still waiting for it due to international shipping). The issue is, last weekend I mentioned this while we were hanging out with Anne and Alex because my best friend (lives far away) texted me saying the gifts were in her house and she was packing them cute and sending them to me on monday. I was super excited. That's when Anne made a passive-agressive comments saying how 'childish' it is to get gifts for the adults and to forget kids that are like family.    I was like 'WTF?' I like your kid but it's not def like family to me. I told her, my best friend is like my sister and she's not one to judge other people's gifts. The situation was super tense and after an awkward silence my fiancé and Alex started talking about sports and I and Anne went to our phones.     AITA for not getting her kid a gift? I feel like that's on my fiancé not on me and she doesn't even say happy bday on my birthday even tho her husband does and she has me on every social media. It's not like we're even friends.	1643205173.0	sd6gpx	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6gpx/aita_for_not_buying_a_xmas_gift_to_my_fiancés/	AITA for not buying a Xmas gift to my fiancé's best friend's daughter?
j1imor5z	MIL and I used to have a bad relationship. I’d say it’s neutral now. We don’t really see her much but we don’t fight anymore.  Around the time we got married MIL lost her fucking mind. She began behaving very erratically, not sleeping or eating. Then she realized our wedding was a month after her 40th birthday and decided she was going to outdo our wedding.  It became a really toxic competition. I was young at the time and got hurt pretty easily and it out a damper on my wedding planning because everything I got she got something better. Her birthday dress was so much prettier than mine and at the time I was a broke 21 year old and it was devastating.  The day of her party I went to check on her and found her cutting her dress up. I asked what the fuck she was doing and she just said she didn’t want to wear it anymore. I was in shock but not my dress so not my problem.  She met some guy a few years later and moved. We don’t really talk anymore and visit maybe every other year for like three days. Well on our last visit I found out that she had told her sister at the time that I cut up the dress and that’s why her sister hates me. I found this out because her sister was joking about how she wants my house to burn down and how she wants to make me suffer for the dress.  I told her sister that was a lie and MIL did that herself. The sister confronted MIL who cried and said she couldn’t remember who cut it. Finally she admitted she cut it and lied because she couldn’t explain why she did it. To be honest I think she did it because she was mad she couldn’t be the bride. She was super weird with her own wedding dress.  Anyway her sister shrugged it off and I said it was embarrassing and asked her for an apology. Her husband snapped at me and said why would I embarrass her and I have no empathy. Her sister said i need to let it go because obviously she was embarrassed. I did but I don’t think I was an asshole for asking.	1643205537.0	sd6l2y	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6l2y/aita_for_asking_for_an_apology_when_mil_was/	AITA for asking for an apology when MIL was caught lying about me to family?
j1im9n6y	My husband has his office and I have my library. When we were first WFH I suggested we sit in the same room for some of the work day but he didn’t want to.  I stopped working this month as I’m pregnant and it’s been rough. I still spend most of my time in my library reading since I don’t have the energy to do much else right now. My husband has decided to work from the library instead of his office now, which would be fine but he’s on calls practically all day long and I can’t focus on my book while he’s talking.   I asked him if he could sit in his office while he had calls multiple times but he promised to be quieter but he hasn’t been. Yesterday I finally got fed up and told him he was banned from my library while he’s working.  I made him leave and go back to his office. He thought I wasn’t serious and tried to come in again today but I had locked the door. Now he’s upset with me because I wouldn’t let him in.

j1jkx5vx	  Hello.   I have been married to my husband for 3 years, and we're expecting a baby boy together.  When I married my husband I kept my maiden name which he was perfectly okay with. We already disgusted and agreed that any future kids we have will automatically take his last name. His family considers this huge deal and I decided to keep to just go with it.   But recently I started thinking about it a lot more and figured that it would be unfair for my unborn son to take my husband's family name and not mine. I talked to my family and they said my husband and inlaws are rudiculous to push this on me without a compromise expecting I go with it. So I went home and told my husband that I've changed my mind about the last name thing and want to either have both our last names combined or my last name to be given to our son. He was confused saying we had an agreement and asking what the cause of this sudden change on mind. I told him and he said I can't just do that and called me selfish when I pointed out that I'm the mother I get a say too.  We went back n forth on this and he said no way he and his family will let me do this to his son as if my last name is a disgrace. We had a fight and we stopped talking after this. He said that I broke and violated my part of the deal and I should just deal with it now but I won't accept it.

j1jmipfo	People involved:   My maternal grandmother, my maternal grandmother's brother (I'll call him grandfather below), grandfather's wife (I'll call her grandmother 2), my own aunt(call her A) , my second aunt (grandfather's daughter, we'll call her S) and my uncle(A), second uncle (S)   Backstory:   Aunt S (27f) is a self sufficient woman. She earns well and most expenses of the house run on her and uncle S's (29m) earning. Uncle S doesn't have a very high education as grandfather send him away to earn at an early age. Aunt S is doing her PHD currently. Before everything Aunt S is a very obedient daughter. She's someone who puts her father before everything. Unfortunately for her father she's just a burden who needs to be married off before her fertility expires. Aunt S wanted to do love marriage but she always knew this wasn't a thing grandfather would accept so she never tried to date anyone. When she started her PHD last year in February, grandfather promised until and unless she has completed her PHD he'll not say a single word about marriage. Well, he started looking for a groom in August.  First, they forced her a ton to get married to the first guy he found. And let me tell you the reasons, first and only, they are relatives so he can have a control over their lives. After a lot of drama and crying she finally accepted that okay I'll marry him but I need a year to mentally prepare myself. Everytime they talked anything remotely about marriage she said the same thing, that she needs a year at least. Turns out he fixed the marriage in April this year without telling her anything. He came today handed her the banquet hall reservation card and said "here, I fixed your marriage on 27th April" That's it. No explaining.  I don't know what they discussed but from what I heard from her is that when she refused he told her to die. She came to our house crying and I don't know why I am the only one who's actually taking her side. When I started talking Aunt A told me to shut up because it's not something children should discuss. I understand. In our culture children,speacially daughters dorhave a say in things. Aunt S told grandmother 2 several times to convince grandfather to atleast give her a year but I don't think she ever tried. Literally no one is in favor of grandfather but no one is having the guts to not agree with a word he says. Aunt A is furious and she's literally spitting fire for her family.. I won't blame her. I'd do the same. Or even worse.   Here's the part where they called me an ass hole:  I supported her. I literally just said, "if my father did something like this I'd run away. I don't care if his image is ruined."	1643205647.0	sd6mrd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6mrd/aita_for_standing_up_for_my_aunt_whos_not_willing/	AITA for standing up for my aunt who's not willing to marry?
j0t6uj1n	This was done on mobile so please ignore the formatting. I’ve already posted this to AITAH So I (18f) and my friend Cassy (18f), named changed for privacy, have gotten into an argument over prom dress color. Nearly 2 weeks the drama began. My friend (Maddie) and I had been discussing the color prom dress we were thinking, when Cassy came over to us. She said “I heard that you were thinking of getting red, because well red is one of my colors and I don’t want us to have the same colors,” and I said I get that but I’m not even sure if I’ll end up going with red, and Cassy ended up coming up with the idea that whoever got their dress first gets dibs on the color; I thought it was kinda goofy to do that, but I agreed to appease her. A few days later, I went prom dress shopping and ended up finding a green dress that I fell in love with. I waited a few days before I showed my friends my prom dress. Cassy relied to my prom dress and goes “YOU BITCH, green was going to be my color prom dress” and I made a joke about how I guess green was my prom color and laughed it off a bit. This set Cassy off. She began yelling at me for getting a green dress and that she wanted to be the only one with a green dress. In the heat of the moment I said that the strapless dress she showed me might not even work for her. This caused Cassy to send her friends to text me with berating messages about my dress. The first message I received from one of her friends said “You fucking did NOT. Says the slut who looks like she’s going to a green house. Cassy would look a thousand times better than you ever could so shut your trap.” I got annoyed at this said replied “Wow. That was kinda rude and pathetic of you”. Then they continued on with trying to berate me and make me feel self conscious of my prom dress color. I messaged Cassy and asked if she could make sure her friends stop with the berating, and she said she would. I said I was sorry if my comment was a bit out of line, I didn’t mean for it to be taken in a rude way, but I was just telling it from my perspective of a strapless dress. Cassy said that she understood that I didn’t mean it in a mean way and said that she didn’t take it that I meant it in a mean way. Later that night, however, I find out that Cassy is posting about a different version of events on her Snapchat story. I didn’t say anything to her, but I was a little hurt she pretended to understand to my face but then say all that behind my back.         Coming to school a week later, I come to find out that Cassy is telling our friend group a different version of events, even though I have text proof of the whole conversation. I thought this drama had been dropped since she is acting like my friend to my face, but behind my back she’s telling a lie. I’ve been trying to stay out of this drama, but she keeps dragging me into it even as she claims she wants to still be my friend.         So Reddit, am I the a?	1643205532.0	sd6l0s	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6l0s/aita_over_prom_dress_drama/	AITA Over Prom Dress Drama?
j1k08lmh	So, my boyfriend (26m) and I (27f) have been together for two years and moved in together about two months ago. When we first started talking about moving in together, I was in a very tough professional situation, having only a part-time job. Because of this, I told him that since I would be half-unemployed, I didn't mind if we didn't share the housework equally as I'd be home more and it would be my way of contributing to our household as he would be contributing more financially. He said he didn't want that and thought we should contribute equally with the housework, however I told him I really preferred it that way.  Flashforward to when we actually moved in together. By this time, I had found not one, but two other jobs and was working 35-45 hours a week, as I have a fixed schedule at my main part-time job, but not at the others. So when we sat down to divide up our housework, I said that since we were both working full-time, I thought we should do things 50-50 and then if one of us had more free time we would just cover the others' chores. He agreed and this was all good... but in theory only. Because after we moved in together and he stopped having to make time to see me after work, he started working 50-60 hours every week. He loves his job, he makes a lot of money (like, more than double what I make) and has no ability to enforce boundaries, hence the amount of works worked. Therefore, none of his chores would get done and he would ask me to pick up most of them because I was working fewer hours than him that week.. The thing is that no matter how many hours I work, it was always fewer hours than him. And it was leaving me really drained to do ALL of the work at home while also having a full-time job, so I finally told him that he would either have to manage his time better or start working less hours because I'm not gonna be picking up all of the housework. And that's when the fight started, because he says that he makes way more money than me and can't just "stop working" (the money he makes is for 40h a week, not 50 or 60, his extra time is unpaid) and that I have more free time. The problem is that I am in healthcare, he's in IT, he will forever be making much more money than me. But I still work a full-time job and still need rest. So I flat-out told him that I just would not do his housework and he said that I was being unreasonable, specially because the only reason we can afford our lifestyle is because of what he makes (we both contribute with the same % of our income, but he ends up contributing with a lot more).   In the heat of the moment I thought he was being unreasonable because it's not my fault his industry pays more than mine (and at one point he agreed we should share equally), but then I started feeling bad because should I really be helping out more since he works more? Was I the asshole in refusing, Reddit?	1643206395.0	sd6w0r	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd6w0r/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_im_not_gonna_do/	AITA for telling my boyfriend I'm not gonna do more housework just because he works more hours and makes more?
8z0bty8d	This may seem simple, but hear me out :   Recently my sister and I have had some weird little spats about my daughter watching cocomelon. My sister was a daycare teacher for a bit, and likes to do research on early child development for fun.   Recently I saw some tik toks about cocomelon being addictive and bad for kids. The comments on the video were full of moms who agreed and said cutting cocomelon out of their toddlers lives improved their toddlers attitude, they saw an upward trend in their kids learning speed, etc. I looked up some articles and while nothing was definitive, I noticed my kid wasn’t super interested in cocomelon anymore anyways, so we agreed no more cocomelon. We switched to Miss Rachel on YouTube, and other educational videos that teach her sounds, colors, words, etc. and she’s actually come quite far with her speech and ability to identify things.   The issue is that every time my daughter asks my sister for cartoons, my sister tries to put on cocomelon. It’s gotten to the point where my sister says “You’re being authoritarian for no reason.” And I say “I don’t care what you think about, I’m telling you no cocomelon for toddler.”  She says she doesn’t care that I don’t like cocomelon, and that the issue is I’m being “authoritarian.” My daughter hasn’t asked for cocomelon since we stopped playing it for her, so she doesn’t care either way.

tsng0m5	So back in February 2019, I (19 NB, at the time) gave birth to my daughter. Very few people knew I was pregnant as I was embarrassed and ashamed, being a student in their second year of university. I was originally planning to put my baby up for adoption and never tell my family about it but once I had her, I didn't want to let her go. My mother (40-ish F) agreed to take her in (after I'd asked a number of family members) and I was ecstatic; I'd be able to keep my daughter in my life, finish university and eventually take her in one day.  Now, my grandma (father's mother, 70-ish F) didn't know about my daughter. After I'd sorted out my daughter's living situation with my mother, I was visiting my aunt's and grandma's place with my dad. I was planning to tell her about my daughter and was very nervous. When I revealed this plan to her kids (my dad and aunt) and her son-in-law (aunt's husband) they did NOT want me to tell her.  I refused to continue lying to my grandma and wanted to go inside and tell her regardless. They wouldn't let me until I agreed to not say anything. So, I started to walk back to my father's. They tried to get me to come back and see their point of view but I refused. On my walk back, I called my grandma and told her about my daughter and how she was going to live with my mother. My grandma lost her mind at me, telling me she never wanted to see me again and that I was dead to her.  Since then, I've attempted to reach out to her (happy birthday messages etc.) but not received any response. My dad said she still asks about me but that's about it.  Present day me (22 NB) understands why my grandma was so disappointed. This isn't what she wanted for me, she would even tell me to use protection constantly before I went off to uni, I think she wanted me to wait until I'd secured my future before having kids. But I still think she's a massive hypocrite. She got married to my abusive af, drunkard grandfather (now divorced) and had my dad at age 19. I get that it was a different time and all but I thought if anyone could understand my situation, she would.  The reason I want to post this here is because I've had both my mother and father (long divorced) tell me I should reach out to her. I don't think it's my place. My aunt hasn't talked to me in years. I didn't so much as get a happy birthday message from them (and my birthday is the same day as my aunt's youngest so there's literally no way they 'forgot'). Sometimes I wonder if I'm being petty and I need to step up and be the bigger person. My mum thinks I should just show up with my daughter and my grandma will HAVE to talk to us - I personally think this is a terrible idea but tbh I still harbour resentment towards my father's side of the family.  So, Reddit, AITA?

j1clsjec	We are three roommates- me (20F), Josh(22M) and Sammy(24M). Everyone has their own bedroom and I am mostly close with Josh. Sammy is a friend of Josh, not mine.   Sammy refuses to clean common spaces, bathroom, buy simple things like toilet paper (he would just throw some change on my bed with a note ‘for wiping ass’). Josh came in one day and told me Sammy was depressed (according to Sammy never been diagnosed) and asked me to be patient.  I agreed. I soon after got a puppy with everyone’s blessing (landlord, roommates). I put the dog’s crate in my room and the puppy is now 3-months-old. He is at the stage where if he gets out of his crate he NEEDS to go out. He goes potty immediately, every time. I told this to Sammy and Josh and they both said they will take out the puppy first if they wanna take it out to play with. (I am not making them take care of the puppy. IF they wanna spent time with it when I am out they gotta walk it. It’s optional.)  I come back one day and the puppy is in the living room, on the carpet, covered in sh*t. I found Sammy playing LoL and he absolutely refused to come help because he was busy playing. (He confirmed he did not walk it ‘because it’s cold) I started cursing and called him ‘a lazy piece of sh*t’. Next day the dog had an eye infection.  I demanded Sammy apologize, but he just said I was triggering his depression? What? He called me insensitive and controlling. I told Josh to kick him out nicely because I am at my wit’s ends with Sammy. Whether he has depression on not, in my opinion he is an a-hole.  Josh says he understands but I can also see him avoiding talking to Sammy. I think he is afraid. AITA for wanting Sammy out the house?  I don’t wanna ask Sammy myself to move out (lease is in my name) because I don’t think I can be nice.

1db1b4kb	I know I sound controlling and awful but I've been talking to him about his phone use and it's not getting any where.   We are both 26 with a 1year old. He doesn't go into work until later in the day so we usually get to spend our mornings together, however, we do not. He spends HOURS reading reddit or on his laptop either listening to music or making music. He says it's fine cuz he's right there sitting on the couch scrolling his phone or right there on his laptop, but it's genuinely not. I can't talk to him if he's doing either and when I do finally get his attention he's snapping at me demanding to know what I want. 90% of the time I want help. I am slightly disabled so doing simple things can be super hard for me and he knows this. I've tried telling him that I think we both have addictions to our phones.  He says mhm and continues. I ask him to please put your phone away you've been on it for hours and you're about to go to work. He then will flip it around on me.  WHY DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH ME LOOKING FOR A BETTER JOB? LOOKING AT MY EMAIL. ITS LIKE YOU DON'T WANT US TO DO BETTER. Since the first time that happened I decided I'd ask what he was doing first and again most of the time he's not looking for a job he's reading reddit. So then even when I know he's not job searching and I ask him it's the same thing. I've decided to not even turn my phone on till 11 and asked him to do the same. This was unacceptable for some reason.  To be honest I think it would be different if I felt like I was being supported in what I'm doing for our family but almost every fight we have He brings up how I'm a sahm and he's making all the money so he needs more rest than I do. He needs to decompress more then I do.  I have asked him to do ONE chore a day and he always half asses it. Do the dishes? You must mean wash 4 dishes pile them up on the ones drying in the rack and claim it was too full to keep going? Got it. You want me to do chores with you? Let me just take over sweeping even though you're already over half way done with it. You want me to sit here with our baby and keep him entertained so you can cook? Let me just pull out my phone let the baby get bored start screaming and then tell you than I just can't do this it's too hard.  I'm so exhausted every day I can barely move my arms and bending over hurts more every time I do it, he knows this and yet he still throws his trash directly to the floor instead of the can. 100% I wouldn't mind the phone usage if he wasn't blatantly ignoring us while on it and made an effort to make sure we feel loved before spending his day doing what ever he wants.  I wouldn't keep the phone hidden all day. I'd hide it till 11 when I turn my own phone on, I'd make sure it was charged and everything I just want to know if I'm overreacting.	1643207158.0	sd75gd	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd75gd/wibta_if_i_hid_my_boyfriends_phone/	WIBTA if I hid my boyfriend's phone?

So then the special needs kid looked up at him and asked "what are you looking at?" and the bully said "a mistake" and I happened to hear that and I yelled at him "HOW BAD CAN YOU GET, DO YOU HAVE NO HEART?"(and I know what I said was mean and F-ed up but I was super mad). everyone in the class looked around bc I don't usually lose my temper like that. when I talked to diff ppl they told me diff things. when I asked my friends they said it was amazing but when I asked his friends they said I was really rude so AITA?	1643207004.0	sd73k1	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd73k1/aita_for_yelling_at_my_classmate_because_he_had/	AITA for yelling at my classmate because he had been mean?
3yxgm9xe	Hey everyone. So I do regular runs for Dungeons and Dragons for my own Discord Server, and things have been pretty good so far. It's become my second job, and my calendar is literally booked an average of 5 days a week up until the next six months (no exaggeration). I put a ton of heart and effort in my games. Complete with custom made maps, background music, sound effects, voice changers, all the Digital D&D sourcebooks, and I even make visual novels to make role-play interactions with NPCs seem more realistic.  I have a group of friends who commissioned a game from me a few months ago, and scheduled a game for today. Our game time was at 8:00pm (take note that this is all online. So timing is crucial). Three players came on time. Great! One person came 10 minutes late...okay, reasonable.   Another said she'd be arriving in a bit (she came at almost 8:30, and the other overslept and arrived at around 8:45). Okay fine. Delays happen, it's not too bad. When we were about to begin, two people suddenly had to go afk... Okay. Fine. We waited a bit more. Then FINALLY we were able to begin a little after 9pm.  The game began with a quick combat, that lasted about 20 minutes. The players seem to have had a blast, and look like they enjoyed. I set the next scene, and told the players what was happening. To my surprise, one of the players suddenly disappeared (connection issues maybe?). I was tilted on so many levels at that point. Two others had to go AFK shortly after (the late ones), and another had was working while playing.   I tried to stay composed, but I just couldn't run the game anymore with all the disruptions. So I said "It looks like majority of the players aren't up for a game tonight. We're gonna have to reschedule". I basically told them that the session was a pretty heavy one, and if they played with only 2-3 players, they wouldn't have a fun time on my table. I fully intend to let them either rebook or get a refund for their game.  One of the \[layers managed to jump back in, while the two others hopped in a bit later. But I was already gone. In fairness, we really could have continued the game. But I was really tired, and running on fumes at this point, and I just felt really bad especially since several of the players on the table are good friends of mine. I messaged the two players who were attentive, and apologized for not being able to run the game, and two of my other friends (who were late) messaged me to check up on me and explain what happened/apologize. So I plan on messaging the late ones tomorrow after I process everything to let them know how upset I was that they didn't even give a heads up that they were gonna be this late so that we could have adjusted the start time later, and I could have rested up a bit before the session. But part of me thinks that I might just be blowing this out of proportion. Delays do happen, and if this is a second job, I should be the one to adjust right?

j1jjkcc0	Sorry if my english is not perfect, is not my native language.   When I was 12 years old I read Jupiter's travels, since that moment my biggest dream is to travel around the world with a motorcycle. For the first time in my life I have the money to do It and because I've been on my work for more than 5 years I have the right to take one year off and then come back to the same job, so that would not be a problem.   When I told my girlfriend what I wanted to do this she said that she would love to do it with me and when I told her that I wanted to do it alone we had a massive fight, she told me that I don't love her and things like that but that is not the case, the reason why I want to do this alone is because one of the biggest reasons why I want to do this trip is to know myself better, in a couple of years I want to get married and have kids and I just feel like I need some time for myself before this happens. I wouldn't mind If she comes to visit me and she does with me part of the trip, I would actually love that but the main part I want to do it alone. I've told her all of this and she doesn't care.   Am I the asshole for not wanting my girlfriend to travel with me? I'm planninig on leaving in September (if covid lets me, I hope that by then most of the coutries will let people in with a negative PCR test) so we still have a lot of time to talk about it, it's not like I'm telling this to her one month before plus I  I have always told her that one day I want to do something like this.	1643207224.0	sd769p	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd769p/aita_for_not_wanting_my_girlfriend_to_travel_with/	AITA for not wanting my girlfriend to travel with me?

wrdi2	I have a couple of college girlfriends who I still keep in touch with. Before covid, we'd go on trips now and then. For their birthdays, some member of the group will ask others for $ so they can buy a group gift for the birthday girl. I've always contributed and have probably spent something like $300 over 2 years on these group gifts. At the time, I was happy to see friends get a nice spa gift card and that they got to do some self-care, which is more necessary than ever in these pandemic times.  However, they have never reciprocated for me. I don't publically advertise my birthday on social media or anything but I know for a fact they know when it is because I've celebrated joint birthdays with one of the friends whose birthday is a week after mine. Yesterday was my 31st and even though my lovely boyfriend and hometown friends wished me happy birthday and sent some lovely gifts, I still felt hurt that my college friends forgot yet again.  It'll be one of their birthdays soon and I know they're going to hit me up for $ for her birthday gift. AITA if I tell them that I don't want to contribute to group gifts anymore because it's never reciprocated?

ahb27ojw	I (21f) lost my aunt and my grandfather had a heart attack on the same day (not related). When I went into work that night I asked if I could leave early if we had the people and explained to my managers what happened and BOTH of them said yes. Well my grandfather woke back up after being on life support (he passed the day after he woke up) and I was talking to my coworker about how I was happy he woke back up. My manager overheard me saying this and came up to me asking when the funerals would be so I could get the dates covered as I live as out state from them. I told her my aunts wouldn’t be until July and my grandfather woke back up!  She the accused me of making up  my aunts death and my grandfathers heart attack to go drinking. I am not a very reactive person so I just turned around and said “No. i was honestly upset about my aunt dying and my grandfather having a heart attack.”. After that she pulled me aside and apologized and gave me a hug. I asked her to go to the bathroom after and when I got out she was standing there and she then accused me of faking my grandmother falling out of her wheelchair and breaking both of her legs and needing brains surgery while in the hospital.

I went to sit down, and seen that a girl around my age was looking at the seats too, and i sat down 1 second before her. Then she said out loud: I wanted to sit down there and walked away. I left the seat next to me clear tho. While riding home, i glimpsed over and seen that she was literally staring at me.   **AITA for sitting down when she was about to sit too?**  *(i know this is nothing serious but i’m honestly kinda curious if is it likely that she thought that i was a AH or not)*	1643207971.0	sd7g2a	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7g2a/aita_for_sitting_down_on_the_bus_where_a_girl_was/	AITA for sitting down on the bus, where a girl was just about to sit?

c60db8wy	My(F) friend Lizzie(F) have been basically family since we were babies. We see each other as like sisters or cousins. As a result to being so close we were compared a lot due to our closeness in age. Lizzie often got the short end of the stick so she is very self conscious now. Lizzie and I were always “best friends” but that as in only when she needed me, then she’d leave me for someone she literally just met. When I asked her about it she had always talked bad about them to me only to leave me for them again. I was hurt and confused; I ended up thinking this was normally and had my personality shaped a lot by this.    Now we were estranged for a few years because I was done with her behavior. Last January we reconciled and she apologized and I was just excited to have my best friend back.    Now onto the issue, her boyfriend has been a red flag since they met. He never respected boundaries because he would “forget,” was overly intimate when she wasn’t ready, and has fboy tendencies. He is also a terrible friend to my boyfriend. So, I hate him. I had told the bare minimum to a mutual friend and just told them that her boyfriend was a bad friend. I never said anything bad about her. Friend told Lizzie and she blew up on me. Saying that she isn’t an “idiot” or “dumb bitch” (I never said that ever). 98% of what she texted were pure assumptions. She has only known her boyfriend for 7 months and she would easily choose him over me. I understand how I could be TA but everything she accused me of, I didn’t do, but she did? She was very hypocritical. I could see that I could be spiteful and TA because I just feel as if it’s the same situation. She’s going to leave me for someone she hardly even knows. I understand I’m still a third party in this, but even his FRIENDS said she was only with him to feel confident. I just feel so many icks from him.

3msuakct	Okay so I can not believe I'm posting this, like at all.  Im a junior in high school, and I am obviously part of a junior biology class. Second semester just started and the first unit we're starting to talk about is genetics. Of course to start things off the teacher just asks everyone basic questions like "do you have your mother or father's hair? Do you have freckles?" Etc. Well he asked a show of hands of students who didn't have one of their parents hair color. I was the only one who raised their hand.   I'm a red head and my mom is a blonde while my dad has dark brown hair. I mentioned this and the teacher asked me my parents eye color as well. I have hazel green eyes, my mom has blue, and my dad has brown.   Well appearently a kid in the back thought this was hilarious and suddenly said "Your mom might have some explaining to do."  This irked me and without thinking much I retorted. "Yeah it's not like my grandmother or anyone had red hair, although I think your mom has more explaining to do considering you turned out a Muppet with a mullet."  Well everyone just kinda paused and there was some laughter but my teacher stopped it and sent me out of the room for the comment. I was told it was uncalled for and that I shouldn't have said anything. I asked if he was going to get told off for insinuating that my mother had an affair. He was not.  I told my parents about this and they thought it was absolutely hilarious while some classmates and teachers mentioned I was an asshole for insulting the kid.

j1hreu06	In our house we are a family of 5 members. Me 18 my older sister(S)(21) my mother(45) my father(51) and my little sister(12). So we have a maid N(20). And a driverJ(25). So while the contract with both of them is unavailable to me. Ik for a fact that each gets 2 to 4 thousands per month.    So one day I was with J and we were chatting while on our way to college. One of the things that he mentioned was to watch out and not to over trust N. That stuck with me. I wanted to ask him about it, but we were already in uni.   Later that day I kinda wanted to know everything I can put my fingers on. I made an alt account on every social media. And searched for N's accounts. After several tries I found it. In the account I found about an onlyfans account. I was too curious. I just made an account and subscribed. What I found wasn't anything pleasing. I found some pictures of her in S's clothes and Some pictures of her in my S's bed.  I was mad I just felt betrayed. However how am I going to tell my father about her without mentioning that I subscribed to an only fans??(he's very mortally judging)  I then thought that J can do it. I called him and he didn't answer. I waited for the next morning. And talked to him. He was very fishy about it. Dismissing my questions and When I asked him if he likes to tell my father, his immediate response was no.  So I thought about it. I then decided that for the sake of my sister. I most tell her. She has every right to know. In the next time I encountered my sister I tried to just give hints and let her figure it out on her own. But she demanded that I tell her. I then just showed her the pictures. She turned into the Devil. She immediately grabbed ever bit of clothes she had and put them near the front door. And asked for N to come downstairs. As soon as N came in. She was in absolute fear she was shaking. As my sister asked her. If she likes her clothes. Telling her to take whatever she wants. N wasn't speaking at all. My dad came in at this situation and asked what's happening. My sister told him. My dad then ordered that N points out every single piece of clothes she used. She did. And my dad told her that tomorrow she's unemployed. She went in tears and asked for forgiveness. But my dad just walked past her.  My dad called me later asking for every single detail. I told him everything. He was MAD at me saying that I'm a piece of shit who doesn't respect his employee's rights of privacy. That I should be ashamed of what I did. He then called J and told him not to let me get in car no matter what. My dad ended the contract with N. Now she doesn't really have a job.  Now Ik that what my father told me was absolutely right.  And rn N sent me a text saying that I destroyed her dream of ever entering college. She said that she wishes that I die the most horrible death ever because I'm a person who deserves it.	1643209340.0	sd7yer	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7yer/aita_for_doing_this_to_our_worker/	AITA for doing this to our worker
j1k43yid	My friend, Lauren, has this really bizarre habit of contradicting herself, even things she said a few seconds ago. Sometimes I feel like she's just really desperate to oppose whatever I just said...but the way she does it is so illogical? At first I thought I was going crazy thinking I just don't understand English because English isn't my first language.   But for instance, she used to intern for a luxury brand and she told me how "toxic" it was. A few days later, the topic came up again, and I mentioned how toxic it must have been, and she goes "WELL, it's not *toxic*" And I was like girl, you literally told me how toxic it was not too long ago?? That's only one example of many other times she's done this, and it was slowly getting on my nerves.   Anyway, yesterday I was getting lunch with her, a few girlfriends, and her crush, Danny. And she does it again. Lauren says, "Restaurant __ is really well-known for their lobster rolls." I said, "Oh wow, I didn't know they were well-known for lobster rolls! I want to try them." And she responds, "WELL, they're not *well-known* for their lobster rolls."   I was like huh?? And for some reason, I felt a little wronged? And so I blurted out, "Wait, what. Didn't you just say like two seconds ago that they were well-known for that?" The other girls and Danny burst into laughter, which is when I knew I wasn't crazy for not understanding her.   Lauren gave me a really upset and annoyed stare, but didn't say anything. Later though, she confronted me about it through text and said how I shouldn't have embarrassed her in front of everyone, especially not Danny. She accused me of being an awful friend because I could have pulled her aside and asked her in private about her comment, but instead I went out of my way to point out her contradiction. She also said I probably wanted to embarrass her on purpose. I asked one of my other friends about the situation, who told me I didn't do anything wrong intentionally, but maybe it was a little AH-ish of me to do it knowing Danny was there.   I haven't replied yet because I'm really confused, and am still kind of convinced maybe I am just not understanding her because of my English. I do feel sorry for embarrassing her in front of Danny, that wasn't my intention.	1643209379.0	sd7yx7	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd7yx7/aita_for_pointing_out_how_my_friend_contradicted/	AITA for pointing out how my friend contradicted herself in front of her crush?
j1jvs0o2	I (f31) am the youngest of three. I have a brother (36) and a sister (33). Our house had three large bedrooms, two upstairs, one down, and then a small box room that you could just about fit a bed in. My parents put my brother in the downstairs room, and my sister and I shared the other large room.   My sis and I are very different people. I was always a neat freak, and she's messy. I'm an introvert, she's extrovert. I tend to go a bit more alternative in my style, she's girly. I could go on. Naturally this lead to a lot of tension growing up because we were always in each others space.   As I got older I asked if I could move into the box room, but they said it wasn’t big enough, but really it was kinda my dad's "man cave". Didn't argue, its their house.  When I was in secondary school my bro moved to the other end of the country for uni. Because it was so far, he took all his stuff with him and only ever came home for Christmas, spring and summer holidays.   I begged to have his room, and said I would move upstairs on an airbed when he came home, but my mum said no because it wouldn't be fair for him to lose his room at home.   As teenagers my sis and I stressed each other out at lot. Then she went off to uni when I was 16 and it got better. Except that only lasted until the spring when she dropped out.   At this point my parents finally took pity and let me move into my bros empty room, as he was barely coming home.  My sis and I do get along now, but only so long as we don't have to live together. If we're in the same house for more than a few days, things start to get tense. Not like arguing, just you can tell we're getting on each others nerves a bit.   I've got two boys under the age of three, and one of mum's friends asked recently if I'd try for a girl. My response was "no, I wanted 2, I wanted boys, I got very lucky" (for the record I would love them regardless of gender, they're my babies). They thought it was odd and I joked "if you'd shared a room for 16 years like me and sis did, you'd understand". She laughed, sis laughed, I laughed. Asked if sis and I didn't get on, and we both replied "we do now."  Afterwards my mum pulled me aside and said why had I implied me and sis don't get along? And why did I blame her for making us share a room? I responded that we she knew we hadn't gotten along as kids, and that sharing a room was a big part of it. I never said it was her fault, just that sharing a room did cause the majority of the tension and she knew that.   She said I had embarrassed her, but I don't see what's embarrassing about kid siblings not getting on. It's a common thing. Now I'm sat here like aita for saying it? Did it imply she was a bad mum when she wasn't?	1643210083.0	sd885h	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd885h/aita_for_embarrassing_mum_by_admitting_sister_and/	AITA for embarrassing Mum by admitting sister and I didn't get on?
9huzkze1	The title basically says it all.   A little bit of background:  I get sick very easily, like to the point I miss school at least one day a week due to illness. I have a friend "Rob" and we have a friend "Tay". I've known them for about a year. Rob and I are closer than I am with Tay. We are all in high school btw.   Onto the story:  Rob has made it a habit to text me everyday about how he doesn't want to be at school and that everyone in his classes are out. I tend not to mind since I used to understand the feeling of not wanting to be at school. Well, I ended up getting really sick two days ago and have been at home. I told Rob that I wasn't going to be at school again because I was sick.   He said, "get me sick so I can stay home. I wish I was like you."   I told him, "Its not fun being sick and your ignorance annoys me. People are dying from being sick and I've been hospitalized multiple times. If that is a joke, it's not a funny one." I was thoroughly mad that he wanted my medical issues to stay home from school. I'm barely at school and miss hanging out with friends, it's been really hard.   Well, he did not like that. He proceeded to get mad at me, telling me that his mother and Tay wanted to get sick as well so they didn't have to work and how I was lucky. I stopped replying after that.  Now he is calling me an asshole for not considering his feelings and his mental health.

g8jaax6w	My mom has a bad habit of not doing small things when she's supposed to. (Ordering groceries, putting away food, cleaning dishes she used, ect) If I ever bring it up I end up mothering her and she makes it well known I do so, however this time I'm absolutely disgusted. We recently got an air fryer and it's only been used a few times, she made fries I don't know how long ago and that's fine. However I just went to go use the air fryer and found the MOLDY FRIES STILL IN THERE. In my opinion there are no excuses to not put away food you made before putting up an appliance. I sent her messages telling her such and that I know have to deep clean the air fryer before I can use it. I just want to know before she responds, AITA?	1643210161.0	sd8964	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8964/aita_for_mothering_my_mother/	AITA for mothering my mother?
8xvkf06q	My ex, we'll call him B, of 6 years and I broke up in September 2021. My best friend, A, and I met about a year ago and became fast friends.   Initially B was peripheral to my friend group but since we broke up has really become a part of it on his own. Just for reference, the friend group is fairly new. It was kinda put together over the pandemic.    Around October, B asked if it was okay if he and A lifted together at the gym. I said it was fine as long as there was an end date and she agreed. At the time, it didn't seem like a bad idea because B was subletting near a gym that they were both close to and it seemed like he would move soon so I wasn't concerned. A told me that she mainly befriended B out of pity.   Since October they've actually become somewhat close friends and I'm super not okay with this. They used to lift with a third person, V but some events went down such that V no longer lifts with them. V also left the friend group. This has somewhat led to B distancing himself from the friend group but continuing to lift with A. I occasionally talk to B but B has made it clear that he's keeping certain stuff close to the chest.   Basically I don't feel that B and I are actually friends and thus I'd like to fully go out separate ways, and that includes my best friend not hanging out with him. We do have a few other mutual friends but I would not ask them to not hang out with Ben because 1) we became friends with them after we were a couple and 2) they are not as close to me.   Also, just for context, A called me in late October and was like can I fuck B and i was like, sure. They did not have sex, but later I found out from a mutual friend that they did make out. Then a few weeks later, B asked A out on a date (mid December). I only found this out maybe 2 weeks ago from the same mutual friend. A says she "forgot" but the mutual friend says that A begged her not to tell me.   To be fully frank, I honestly don't care if they banged or B asked A out. I would still be super uncomfortable with them being friends even if those things hadn't happened.   Early December, we did reach a compromise on A and B being friends, but this was when B was still somewhat part of the friend group. Recently he has been distancing himself from the friend group so I feel more uncomfortable with the arrangement. Am I the asshole to ask A and B to just go their separate ways?	1643210270.0	sd8amf	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8amf/aita_for_asking_my_27f_best_friend_27f_to_stop/	AITA for asking my [27F] best friend [27F] to stop hanging out with my ex of 6 years [30M]
fgootvbw	Okay for context I (F25) used to work at a local hospital in the pharmacy where I met a lot of really cool people. Stuff went sour with management and the commute I had to do every day so I left. Before I left I tried ti get everyone of my work friends snapchats to keep in touch.   Anyways I got the Snapchat of my coworker “Amy” (F22) and we hit it off right away. We have a lot of the same interests and she’s really nice to me. She quickly became a good friend of mine. Amy is also a lesbian but she’s not my type and the only thing I really like about her is her tattoos beyond that she’s just a friend (added this because for an explanation on why my fiancée doesn’t like her).  But the problem is that according to my fiancée (F32) Amy wants to date me even though Amy has a gf of 5 years. So my fiancée told me to delete Amy from my Snapchat, I did but I regretted it immediately because Amy didn’t do anything that could be considered flirty. I still regret because I miss her friendship and I’m considering reaching out to her again. But I don’t know how to talk to my fiancée about wanting to be friends with her again.   So would I be the asshole if I try to become friends with Amy again?	1643210308.0	sd8b67	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8b67/wibta_for_reaching_out_to_a_friend_that_my/	WIBTA for reaching out to a friend that my fiancée doesn’t like?
j1l6ocrb	My (18m) mother (49f) has recently caught a rather nasty cold (not covid, we tested.) And I've been taking care of her. I have 2 older brothers (27 and 29) who live with her and have recently been laid off from their respective jobs and for lack of a better term, is now spending their time doing nothing. I myself have been trying to work and have quite an alright online job (alright for an 18yo) which I still have today.   My mom sometimes goes on tangents about how she's the only one who cleans the house and whatnot and we're all lazy nobodies (she works 9am-8pm on weekdays). When she's at work and I'm home, I try to do household chores to the best of my abilities, I also cook for everyone when she works. Of course, I know that my standard of clean isn't up to hers, but I do try my best.  A lot of times, because my brothers spend their time either outside the house or inside their bedrooms, my mom has nobody to rant to except for me, and I became the subject of a lot of scoldings. I've always thought it was a bit unfair since I try to do my best to lift some weight off her shoulders and help with some financial stuff (albeit not a lot) I never spoke back and just noted what she was angry about to try and do better (I admit some of the stuff I do aren't perfect or good, but God fucking knows I try my best.)  Back to the topic. My mom's sick, and I've been nursing her all day while my middle brother's upstairs playing games and my eldest brother's out with friends (they know she's sick) and my mom suddenly gets in a fit of anger and starts viciously berating me and my brothers for being such bad children, it went on for around 10 minutes before she moved over to me and repeated all the things she said, except solely to me.  Now, I'll admit I wasn't in the best of moods and all, but something inside me decided enough was enough and I told her that I do clean the house, I still have a job, I cook for 3 people every day and I try my best to get some weight off my shoulders and woul've been happy to do some more stuff if she had asked, and said I just felt like it was unfair that I was ever the only one to get yelled at and endure all the verbal abuse while my brothers never got anything, as well as the fact that I love her, but I just can't take it anymore. I didn't raise my voice at all, but my choice of words might've been a bit abrasive and just had a "I'm fucking done" attitude.  Well, she yelled at me some more and tore into me deeply. Brought up a few of my past traumas and whatnot and told me I could go to hell with my entitledness. So, yeah.  She's currently in her room while I'm writing this tearing up about everything.  I love her, still do, but I still feel like I get the unfair end of the stick. I'll admit that maybe it was a bad time for me to have that talk with her and I might be TA because of that. Thanks in advance.	1643210258.0	sd8ag9	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8ag9/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_i_always_try_and_help/	AITA for telling my mom that I always try and help?
j1lhfwm4	So I (29M) own my house and my girlfriend of 2 years Molly (28F) stays over frequently. So our situation is that molly doesn’t like her apartment so she stays most of the week at my house. I’m cool with it as I love having her around obviously. I pay for all the bills and have never asked molly to contribute. She does buy groceries for us and will buy crafty items for the house. But she’s never been asked financially to contribute as she still has her own apartment she stays at about once or twice a week. I’d say the cooking and cleaning is split at my place pretty fair with us each doing about 50/50. We haven’t discussed moving in together or anything like that.   So I have a finished basement that isn’t really being used but is a great space. Molly has always had these plans to make it into something. I’ve always wanted to make it my man cave but molly wanted to make it like a basement living room and dining space. She would always watch HGTV and say things like “see we could turn that basement into this”. But we haven’t made any sort of decision in over a year and the space was being left unused. So molly left last week for a week long trip to see her parents. During that time my best friends Shea stayed for a week due to some housing issues at her place. One night I was scrolling through tik tok and saw this badass man cave set up. I talked to shea about the idea and she was down too. We went to Home Depot that night and started the project. We designed everything and over the course of a week finished everything. Painted, designed the bar, built a bar, found an old ping pong table on marketplace, got all my sports memorabilia out of boxes, hung a ton of pics, hooked up a speaker and a projector screen. We created this really badass man cave. Shea works in construction so she offered a lot of experience and I wouldn’t have been able to do it on my own.   When molly got home on Sunday she flipped out. Saying she couldn’t believe I did this without consulting her. I was kinda ticked off because it looked awesome and she didn’t even say anything positive. Just got offended she wasn’t consulted. I said she doesn’t pay for the house, didn’t have any real plans for the space, it’s my house and I don’t see why I need to consult her to make a decision on my house. She’s been acting all standoffish since and won’t even hang out in the basement while I’m spending a lot of my time here. My friends say that I’m right and it’s my place. That were not married or even living together so it’s my choice what happens to my house. But my mom called me an idiot.

j1ky607w	Ok, so I (27M) make custom garments. A few months ago I got a request from a bride (28F, who I will be calling ‘Maddie’), she was really nice and wanted to see if I did alterations as she wants to wear her mother’s wedding dress but wanted it altered to fit her and wanted some changes done to the dress.  She sent me a pic of her in the dress as well as descriptions and image descriptions of what she wanted and we agreed on a price, normally I would ask her to ship the dress to me but she actually lived a few towns over so we set up a date to meet up, so she can give me the dress and I could show her the sketches and mockups.  (just to clarify, the dress belonged to her mother that passed when she was 15, the mother I mention in this story is her stepmother)  I get to the cafe first and sit down, about 15 mins after we were supposed to meet Maddie and her mother walks in, Maddie is really apologetic and started explaining that she and her mother were coming here after they had gone shopping for wedding jewellery and her mother didn’t want to leave when they had to. I said it was fine.  She pulled out the dress and showed it to me, it’s a beautiful vintage dress, her alterations aren't too difficult, the biggest change is that she wanted to change the neckline and style of the sleeves. The thing is, every time I would tell Maddie something about the process or suggest something and no matter how Maddie reacted, I always got huffs and eyerolls from her mother. Maddie went to the bathroom before leaving and her mother came up to me, told me that she didn’t like a few of the ideas I proposed and wanted to suggest something herself and pulled out a list, I stopped her and told her that any suggestions or changed would need to be told to me by the bride, so she would have to tell Maddie her ideas.  She got visibly annoyed and told me that I ignored her the whole time and as the mother of the bride she should have an opinion, I told her that Maddie was my customer not her. She then tried to tell me that it's her old dress, I told her that I know it's not, it’s Maddie’s dead mother’s old dress, not hers, she left in a huff. When Maddie came back from the bathroom, I told her what happened she didn't seem too surprised but was frustrated, she apologised and thanked me for telling her and that she cant wait to see her finished dress.  I was talking about this to a fellow designer who specialises in bridal wear and she told me that I should have involved the mother in the beginning and that I was just being rude to her, is should have taken the list and tried to pitch the ideas to Maddie. I really didn't think what I did is wrong but I don't get wedding commission often so im more used to working with cosplayers, maybe there are some unspoken rules I didn’t know about, so AITA?	1643210585.0	sd8f2o	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8f2o/aita_for_ignoring_the_opinions_of_the_mother_of/	AITA for ignoring the opinions of the mother of the bride?
eqherhap	I'm rewatching a UK singing competition show about these 10 girls trying to win the role of Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, that I loved with my daughter who is 11. She's really into music and theatre and really liking the show surprisingly. However last night, she snapped at me last night about my comments about a contestant in the show.  There's this blonde Scottish girl who I really just don't like in it. Her voice is so strained and soft and not really strong, her dancing and movements are really awkward. She also does a really cheesy wink and grin at the camera during the group performances which makes me cringe.  Anyway on one of the interviews before her performance, she mentions being overweight and being bullied for it, I didn't believe this and told my girlfriend she likely is just saying it for sympathy votes as in the previous week on the judges feedback she didn't appear to take the feedback  well based on her facial reactions. Probably gonna get shit for this but I've so many girls pull this card on talent shows that I doubt it's validity, as well as my own personal experience. I didn't press on it but my daughter took offence and questioned me on it and we argued a bit and I basically conceded to her point that I wasn't there.  On the next show during the opening song, I pointed out to my girlfriend how the Scottish girl looked noticeably chubbier than the other girls when they were in a lineup. It was slightly noticeable but I pointed it out just to my girlfriend and she agreed. My daughter heard me say this shouted that I was being awful and said she wasn't watching anymore with me. I asked her what was wrong and she said that she actually really liked the blonde Scottish girl, I told her I won't say a thing about her anymore but she's refusing to watch.  I'm expecting an asshole verdict but I'm just clarifying I never said my opinions out loud only to my girlfriend and I only wanted her to enjoy it and I'm scared I ruined it.	1643210693.0	sd8git	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8git/aita_for_being_overly_critical_towards_a_singer/	AITA for being overly critical towards a singer
erryq25l	First time posting & on mobile.   Context: I (early 20s F) live in a small-ish European country with an official language that is Indo-European but not Germanic, my boyfriend (late 20s) is American with an English-only background. We’ve been dating for few years now, long distance because of school/work and the pandemic. He’s a great guy but there is one problem.   Ever since we first became friends we’ve been talking exclusively in English. This wasn’t an issue for me since I’ve been studying English from a young age (as you do here), but when we started dating I expected him to learn a little of my language (and then more as we got more serious). I let him know, he said he wanted to do it too. Thing is, he didn’t really.   When he first came to visit here he knew how to say “hi” and that was it. I found it a little disrespectful but whatever, I know it’s the norm for English natives. Over the time he got a bit better, he knows few phrases, some super basic words and grammar, but he still isn’t able to hold even the smallest of talks. He does make some effort, he uses a language app (yeah it won’t teach you a language but it helps a little), and at one point I was kinda teaching him for few weeks, he made progress and had fun but we had to stop because of conflicting schedules. Overall though I feel like he could do more. He has the time, he spends hours with the other languages he knows, last year he even took a class to learn an entirely different one.  I’ve been trying to be patient but it’s been years now and frankly it’s exhausting having to translate every single aspect of my life for him (and don’t get me started on words that don’t have an equivalent in English). When I ask him if there’s any progress he always says “soon” or something like that.   So, to get to the point: I am thinking about mentioning this to his mother and asking her to push him about it a little. (I talk with her sometimes and would wait for an opportunity to raise the subject naturally without making a huge deal out of it.) I think it might help since my boyfriend cares for her a lot but I worry I might be an AH for going behind his back. What do you think?  (Also in case it’s not obvious, here are the reasons I would like him to learn: him being able to talk to my family-me sharing my culture, books, songs, etc. without half of it being lost in translation-him having some independence next time he comes here-him having a starting point for fluency should we ever raise children together or live in my country)	1643211234.0	sd8nws	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8nws/wibta_if_i_asked_my_bfs_mother_to_push_him_a/	WIBTA if I asked my bf’s mother to push him a little about learning my first language?
j1j83xv4	By boyfriend (23) and I (21) have been together since my senior year of high school. Right before I graduated we moved in together and right after I started working. A couple of months later he got problems with his health that caused him to not really be able to do any housework, like cleaning, cooking etc. He had a bigger income than I and a longer and more successful career than I, and we decided it'd be the best for me to quit working and start doing all the housework, even though this meant all his family and friends saw me as a gold digger. After this his career took up very fast, and he started earning a lot more money. No one knew where his new determination and extra energy came from. He would brag about how easy work was, and that he only had to work maybe an hour and then he'd just spend time with his friends for the rest of the working day. The housework took me all day, everyday to get done. He'd buy himself expensive designer things and expensive presents to people, while if I needed makeup or new shoes he'd get picky and whine about being stressed about money. Every time I needed something, he'd take up how it was his money and he worked so hard to get it. Recently he got an award at work, including a trip with his friends, money and a party. I wanted to join on the trip, but he didn't want to be embarrassed in front of his friends by bringing his girlfriend. I finally got enough of him getting so much praise, and told him it felt bad he kept getting rewarded for an achievement I felt was ours together. He got really mad at me for saying that, saying how I'm an ungrateful brat that he has to provide for and he works hard every day to achieve the things he's gotten. I know I chose to stay at home and he technically does work completely by himself for the money, but it just bugged me so bad. So, AITA for telling him I don't like that he gets awarded for his success?	1643211223.0	sd8nrq	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8nrq/aita_for_not_being_happy_for_my_boyfriends_success/	AITA for not being happy for my boyfriend's success?
3xb28anp	For context- a cat is considered a “guest” in our apartment. Per the lease, Tenants have rights to bring guests over whenever they want (as long as they don’t have a criminal record or a restraining order).  I told her that just as much as she is allowed to bring guests over (her boyfriend practically lives here), I am allowed to bring guests over too.   She is trying to tell me I can’t get the cat now because of her allergies. However, I’m getting the cat anyways.   She told me two months before we moved in together and signed the lease she was fine with a cat, and loved animals. Now she is going back on her word.   From my perspective, if she didn’t want to live with a cat because of allergies, she shouldn’t have signed a lease with me in the first place! I was as upfront as possible months before we signed, and she told me multiple times she was ok with getting the cat…until the moment I decided to go out and get one.	1643211364.0	sd8pp2	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8pp2/aita_for_getting_a_cat_even_thought_my_roommate/	AITA for getting a cat even thought my roommate is allergic?
imktldjm	I honestly think this is the stupidest thing ever but I am genuinely interested to hear another opinion.  Last night I went for a drive with 3 of my friends. A, B and C. We were all in my car and at some point I wanted to get something to eat from a certain place. We went there but I only find a parking spot some distance away.   Anyway, it was a cold night and B and C said they'd stay around the car cuz otherwise they'll freeze to death if they'd come with me and A. They remained outside the car tho, because you know that feeling when you want to get a breath of fresh air but have a warm place to get back to. So I thought I might as well give them the keys because my car has the bad habit of locking itself (it's not supposed to do that) so that would have left them outside in the cold while A and I ate.   Half an hour later or so, we get back to the car and B is in the driver's seat and as he got out he proudly told me how he took my car out of its spot and parked it better (in the same spot). I honestly failed to notice any difference in the parking, in my opinion it was the same way I left it, but nonetheless I was impressed.   B doesn't have a licence but is set to take the exam soon tho and idk I was happy for him. I only he managed to do it without killing the engine, because my clutch is kinda dumb and it surprises everyone except me :) and if he changed the seat or the mirrors but he said no to both and that was that.   It was all good imo, but A decided to scold B for this saying that he shouldn't have done it give that he didn't even have a licence or asked me first. He wasn't aggressive or using a harsh tone or anything but I told him it's ok, I've known B for a long time and it really doesn't bother me.  And he went ballistic on me, screaming louder and louder in the parking lot, accusing me of being a coward and a bitch and a fucking pussy and I should have never allowed B to do something like that in my car, especially without permission. I was like "bro, calm down, he just (tried to) reposition the car, that's all".   But A was having none of it. He screamed some more, insulted me and B and left. I don't know what the fuck is his problem and why it bothers him so much.   Anyway, back to the matter at hand. Was A right and I should make sure something like this will never happen? Aita? Because imo it was no big deal.  Also sorry for the wording and possible typos, english is not my first language.	1643211413.0	sd8qau	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd8qau/aita_for_not_getting_mad_at_my_friend_after_he/	AITA for not getting mad at my friend after he parked my car without my permission?
e5xhjo4s	Throw away account. I (F) and my boyfriend (M) have been together for a little over two years now. I’ll be blunt, we have somewhat of a rocky relationship, he tries to get me to become someone I’m not, and he always mishears everything I say (and misinterprets it). I have some online businesses (which he knows about), however I stopped asking him to look at that (because he would always make weird comments to me about them). So recently he asked me if I wanted a book for my collection (which is pretty catered to), I said sure (I don’t really like surprises that much and usually gifts are somewhat known he knows this), but then he starts questioning if he should buy me the book (though he initially offered), and makes me promise to never sell it. I get the book and the book is more so for him than it is for me, so after about a couple of weeks of contemplating, I quietly decided to list it, I would prefer someone to enjoy it than for it to just not be touched or anything. I never told him I did or anything, without me really getting into it, he kinda pressured me into telling him I did, he then goes and checks my site, he sees it, and then got upset with me telling me that I “disrespected him” (but still acknowledged it was a gift and I could do anything I wanted with it). I personally don’t really believe that I did anything wrong per se and he kind of overreacted, but do understand where he’s coming from (I personally think we both somewhat suck here).

ivzgm80d	I am 14f. My mom is 39f. Her friend "Maya" is 38f. Maya's daughter, "Taryn", is 14f. I have seen her in school a couple of times. We aren't close.   Maya used to bring Taryn over when she came over. I was expected to entertain her. I don't hang out with her anymore.   My mom keeps hassling me about spending time with Taryn, who apparently has no friends. So I went to Taryn's for a sleepover (my mom planned it) two weeks ago. I did not have fun.   She wanted to watch movies from 7pm to 1am. She insisted on watching the Kung Fu Panda trilogy, plus all those short stories. She didn't give me a say.   After the movies, we went to her room to figure out the sleeping arrangement. I assumed I'd sleep downstairs on the couch.   But Taryn literally dumped two pillows, a blanket and a stuffed dog on the (carpeted) floor next to her bed and insisted I sleep there. She wouldn't let me go downstairs and take the couch.   I woke up at 8. I know that's early, but it's what I do.   I waited until 10, then went downstairs by myself to have an apple or something. Her mom was in the kitchen and said "Oh, is she not awake yet? She always sleeps late on weekends. When she wakes up, you can both have breakfast together."   I went back to her room and read my book until she finally woke up at 11:30. For breakfast, she got out that Golden Puffs cereal. It's so sweet, it's disgusting. Sugar in a cereal box.   I asked if she had any other cereal or fruit or anything, and she was like "Is Golden puffs not good enough for you?" so I had a bowl with her. She used the milk first, and when I got some, there was about 2 tablespoons left. I asked if there was any more milk in the fridge. She said no, but I could add some water. (These people are not poor, I want to add. They live in a huge house, Taryn gets $20 a week allowance, and they have house cleaners come in every other week.)   We went on a walk with Taryn's dog, Lila. But Lila pooped in someone's yard. Taryn handed me a bag and asked me to pick it up, which I did. Taryn then had me carry it back to her house.   When I got home, I told my mom that I didn't ever want to do that again. She said that I was being a baby, it wasn't that bad, and there's another one planned in two weeks so suck it up. I said nope. She said "Okay, Veruca Salt." I thought that was the end of it.   But no. Now she wants me to go to another one. I said no way. She said "How do you think Taryn feels? No one wants to hang out with her, you  keep snubbing her because you wake up early. You're a bad friend to Taryn, I feel bad for her." She keeps trying to get me to go to Taryn's in a few days.

cbwa7g24	 My(20f) co-worker (18f) told me, one of these days, that she had a crush on one of our coworkers (let's call him F) from another section. It was one of those very naive crushes but I still warned her that F might be older than he looks (she thought he was like mid 20s and I told her that he was most likely mid 30s). To confirm my suspicions, I asked another co-worker and, not only he told that F was almost in his 40s, F was also married and had kids. I told her and she backed off, as everyone should. The thing is, they live close to each other so F, since we all got out at the same hour, decided to escort her home one day (which is something that I usually do, because her neighbourhood is known to have a lot of drunk people during the night and I always wanna make sure she gets home safe). She was cool about it, he waited for her and they went on their way. She asked me if I was ok with it since I was the one who usually do it and I said that I was ok with it, that I just wanted to get home, get something to eat and get some rest. It had been a rough day but still, for some reason, my "mom instinct" didn't kicked in.    Has I was getting home, she texts me, in panic because he kissed her out of nowhere, without her permission. She was crying and completely disgusted by it. It got so bad that she started having panic attacks during the night and next day (on that same day she had find out she, most likely, had Cov1d, so she was overwhelmed with everything). I tried my best to calm her down by telling that she never had to see him again (she was already leaving the job anyways) or talk to him or whatsoever.    She's more calm now, but there was something bothering me. I mean this guy... He had a predator behaviour. Maybe this wasn't the first time. And I wasn't wrong. F had hit on at least 3 co-workers in my job (that I Know of) with disrespectful pickup lines, but since most of them are older women who already have some experience with man like him, it leads nowhere. I felt sorry for the woman who decided to marry him, because she probably didn't even knew. No woman deserves this.   And it was like fate that two days after this happen, I met her. A beautiful strong woman. My primary instinct was to tell her everything but I got scared because honestly it's none of my business. Still what this men does its just so gross. I mean what kind of men goes hit on 18 year old?   I really wanna tell her. But I would be intruding in something that I have nothing to do with and I don't want to be like the bad guy in the story or at least the girl that got her nose where it doesn't belong. And let's be honest I don't wanna get in trouble but knowing this and not being able to do anything, it's k*ll*ng me.  So...

gpk7zt6b	The title I think may be self explanatory but to give some context I (26F) have a God Child (12M) who is really close to me right from his younger days.... he likes talking to me and share his random stories with me... there was also a phase where he wouldn't eat food if I was not on video call with him! I'm very protective about him and love him to death... now here the catch...  I'm technically from his Dad's side... his mom lost all contact with my side of the family once they both got separated (it's been a while don't know exactly how long but definitely more than 4 years I guess) the only person she is in contact with me and somewhere I feel it is cause of my God Child  Now she has finally found someone whom she has decided to get married to soon, I'm really genuinely happy for her cause her relationship with God Childs Father was no where good and it was the best decision for her to be separated!   The soon to be husband .. Step Dad has a good relationship with the kids (they are 2 one my Godchild and he has a younger brother) they like him as well but still call him by his name, or sometimes sir ... step Dad was originally okay with it, but now since they getting married he keeps insisting that they start calling him Dad...  God Child was not comfortable, he called me the other day and spoke to me, he asked me if it was mandatory for him to start calling step dad "Dad" and if it was okay he didn't... I assured him that if he didn't feel comfortable calling him Dad yet he can stick to calling him whatever he addresses him as of now and can start calling him Dad when he feels ready  Post call like within a couple of hours I get angry messages from his mom! That I shouldn't but my nose in their business, and her fiance is upset and feels we don't welcome him in the family, while she thinks I'm just upset cause she has moved on and I think she is trying to replace the ex as father figure in Godchilds life  She has told me she is going to stop Godchild from contacting me cause apparently I'm brainwashing him against step-dad... but I don't think I said anything wrong?

ioyhdfhg	I’ll try and keep it brief but want to avoid being too bias towards my pov. I love my partner dearly and just want a way to resolve our issue.   I (24M) work at a corporate HQ and studying for a masters so I am stuck to a screen for most of my waking day. My partner used to help out around the house a lot but since she’s got a new job, she’s been really engulfed in it. It’s great to see her with so much passion for something but she’s constantly working which has left me with all the household duties added to my workload (cooking, washing up, tidying and laundry).  She says she’s trying her best but she’s tired all the time, citing that the addition of commuting to work is tiring - something which I don’t have to endure. I admit that I have the benefit of working from home and flexible working hours so it does make sense for me to do more. However I work like a horse. She thinks it’s relaxing for me to work at home but it really isn’t, and I wake up incredibly early to manage my workload.   She’ll come home drained and if she’s not got work to finish off, she’ll eat and watch tv. But I’ll still be working. I appreciate that she needs a rest after a long day, but it’s a hard pill to swallow when I feel the same, yet someone needs to do it. She does do chores when she has the time, but I consider them as non essential (wiping the windows and scrubbing the bath) as I just really need help with the daily duties.  I try not to ask for too much but I’ve always been an advocate of sharing duties. I’ve said that although it does make sense for me to do more, I’d appreciate that she help out a little as I’m feeling a little burnt out. I want to help her reach her full potential, but at what cost? It’s become a delicate topic between us which has led me to wonder if IATA.  AITA? Is she right to accuse me of trying to enforce my unnecessarily high expectations on her/projecting my own work stress or should I just man the fuck up? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	1643212224.0	sd90ys	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd90ys/aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_help_out_more/	AITA for asking my partner to help out more?
j1myu5to	My (15F) parents wanted to start watching a movie at 11:30pm with me and my older brother. However, I excused myself because it was late at night and although I did not have school the next day, I did not want to sleep after 1. (The run time of the movie is about 2+ hours) My parents said that they could pause the movie halfway and continue watching it on another day but I protested against that because I prefer watching movies in one sitting. My brother is now mad that I ruined a family movie night and my parents say that I'm just missing out. I feel kind of bad now and I'm having second thoughts about my decision. After all it's just a once in a blue moon thing and I don't usually sleep that late. Furthermore I do not have to wake up early for school the next day.

55rrg4sb	I’ll keep this short. Moved in with my gf a couple months ago and everything was great, except for the fact the cat was misbehaving like crazy. It started with meowing and has evolved into peeing. It started peeing on my gfs clothes in the bedroom, then my dogs bed, then our bed. I said until he can prove he doesn’t pee in our room he’s not allowed in there, and she agreed. However, a day after we agreed he’s not allowed in the room, she’ll let him back in because she’s “watching him” but she’s not. Then maybe a week later she leaves the door open, the cat gets in, and pees in our room. Repeat this cycle about 5 times and this has been the last month and a half. I’ve tried to put my foot down but she gets really sad about not being able to let him in the room and caves after a day. AITA for not wanting to let him in the room?	1643213245.0	sd9f4i	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9f4i/aita_for_not_wanting_my_gfs_cat_in_the_room/	AITA for not wanting my gfs cat in the room?
ebb13miq	A while back I received a very cryptic text message from my Aunt, asking if she can talk to me about the pandemic, and quoting something from Tucker Carlson talking about a book. I don't really keep up with what Tucker Carlson says and the whole text read like copypasta so genuinely wondered if somebody hacked or stole my Aunt's phone.  &#x200B;  I chose not to respond at the time because I hadn't spoken to my Aunt in like two years and breaking the ice with a light "pandemic discussion" over text wasn't how I wanted to spend a regular workday. I figured I'd talk to her later when I had more time. My Mom called me later that day and immediately asked if my Aunt had contacted me. I said yes, and she apologized, said my Aunt has been contacting multiple family members and she thinks the reason I was contacted was my daughter receiving the vaccine, which everyone saw on Facebook. I shrugged it off.  &#x200B;  About a week later I miss a call from my Aunt and she leaves a short voicemail saying she would like the opportunity to talk to me and to please call her back. At that point I figured it had been a bit since her text, she's not mentioning it, maybe she genuinely just wants to catch up. So I waited until my drive home and gave her a call during my commute. She then proceeded to blast me with global conspiracies, and I'm not saying that to make my Aunt sound crazy, she literally called them "global conspiracies" - how the government won't let doctors use proven cures that could actually help people, COVID is just a cold, and etc.  &#x200B;  I was really shocked. I hadn't contacted her about this at all. I told her I was in favor of the vaccine, but she was welcome to live her life as she pleases. I tried to change the subject. She said it was important to expose myself to differing viewpoints and to debate about topics. I told her this was all very off putting to me, who is just trying to go to work and come home and live my life at the moment. She went on for about thirty or so minutes. I ended the call rather contentiously. I considered that conversation done.  &#x200B;  The next morning I received another text from her demanding to know my position on the pandemic, which I had already told her about the night before. I consulted some friends and they all indicated I should really take a "block/delete" stance on this. I didn't want to DELETE, but I did block her number because it was really upsetting to me to keep getting messages about topics I had already told her I was unwilling to discuss with her.  &#x200B;  Later that week I heard from my Mom that my Aunt apparently called her very angry that I was ignoring her, and essentially told both my parents that they and I are not going to be featured in her Will any longer. I'm really at a loss on this one. I didn't think I had done anything unreasonable but I'll acknowledge I'm questioning how I handled this as I think it is causing my Mom some grief, which I never wanted.

edwl78fg	I know this woman(I am not calling her my friend she’s too unlikable for that),who is something like a Helicopter-Dogparent.She spends over half her income on some dog gadgets to track her dog‘s health,and always does everything perfectly on an atomic scale to make sure her dogs are fine.I don’t have a problem with that,it’s her money and time, not mine.The Problem is,she annoys the f out of everyone around her.She,let’s call her Patricia,will never leave you without a critique or some another advice you never asked for.She will deadass walk up to other people and tell them their dogs should lose weight,even if she doesn’t know them and the dog is just two pounds overweight.Everytime anybody talks to her,she just starts lecturing you about everything you need to do better.Patricia once randomly asked what I fed my dog,and when I answered,she almost evaporated.Then she held a lecture about how the food industry is trying to poison our dogs,that it needs to be free of this and free of that,and that if I can’t afford holistic bs that costs 100$ for a bag I don’t deserve a pet.I was sick and tired and snapped at her in public “Nobody gives a f about your bs advice.You don’t help,all you do is annoy the duck out of everybody around you.My dog is perfectly fine.Btw,everybody at the dog park talks smack about you,since you feel like you’re the epitome of a good dog owner and everybody looks up to you.” She was really embarrassed,another person around us giggled.She then never talked to me again.Another day,a person that heard me when I snapped at Patricia came up to me and told me I should have just talked to her in private instead of embarrassing her in public.Every dog owner in my town is laughing at her.(I live in a small town) She keeps talking smack about me behind my back.This woman says that she just tried to help and that she doesn’t deserve what I did to her,from what I hear.My friend send me a screenshot of her IG Story that read “When people are to arrogant to accept help and take it as a personal attack😔”Do you guys think I was in the wrong ?	1643213729.0	sd9lt0	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9lt0/aita_for_telling_her_nobody_gaf_about_her_bs/	AITA for telling her nobody GAF about her bs advice?
eyjseaf7	My friend (Let’s call him A), has really bad mental stability. He’s a really good friend and I only want the best for him.  The other week, I asked A why he won’t get help. He has told me before that he wants help but it’s not that easy to ask.   Me, wanting the best for him, decided to let that go for a while until A messaged me about life problems completely randomly which caught me off guard.  I know he’s not in a good mental state so I ask him “would you please get help?” again, to which he replied the same thing so I offered to help him get help.  He told me no and that he doesn’t need it (which we both know isn’t true) and told me to stop asking.  About a week ago, he was struggling with something in school and told me how much school has took a toll on his mental health.  After he told me that, I asked one more time “please try and get help, being able to tell someone your problems will make you feel much better” and he told me again that he won’t get help. So when he said that, I told him that “if he wasn’t going to get help, I’ll get it for him”.  He told me that if I did that I would be an a-hole and he would never speak to me again. He also said again that he doesn’t need help and to stop worrying about him.   I know I asked too many times but I’m worried that he’ll do something bad if he doesn’t get help.

j1msarsk	My mom got remarried to her current husband 14 years ago. He's an okay man but my dad will always and forever be my number 1. When they announced to me that a baby was on the way I freaked out. Told them there and then that I don't want to ever be involved in this kid's life. I find it super weird that he's 22 years my junior, I'm old enough to be his damn dad. Why did my mom even need to have another child at 42? That baby fever was strong apparently. I found the entire thing disgusting to say the least.   The years go by and when my half-brother was around 10 years old he started saying how much he wanted to meet me. After a lot of nagging from my mother I said, whatever, fuck it, alright, I'm gonna do it. From our first encounter he basically clinged onto me. For the past 3 years he has constantly tried to make me like and accept him but I just can't do it. He's a nice person and all but I still find my mom's actions nasty so I involuntarily associate him with that. I can't help it. I never wanted a sibling.   Yesterday, he was over at my place and kept on asking me to watch a movie with him, which I didn't want to do. I ended up going off on him and told him that I don't want to be his friend and actually want nothing to do with him at all. He immediately started crying and apologizing to me, saying that he doesn't have any friends and gets bullied at school for his introverted nature and that he just doesn't understand why I despise him so much. He said that he's so tired of feeling rejected all the time when all he does is being good to everyone. He said sorry one more time, told me that despite my huge hatred toward him he still loves, admires and respects me a lot, then he runs out of the house. He hasn't reached out to me ever since.	1643213904.0	sd9o5x	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9o5x/aita_for_telling_my_35m_halfbrother_13m_that_i/	AITA for telling my (35M) half-brother (13M) that I don't want to be his friend and actually want nothing to do with him at all?
5tqnqyg5	My grandma had a little dog, that unfortunately passed away very suddenly on Sunday night.  She has already started looking at new dogs, but the dogs shes looking at are big dogs. This wouldnt be a problem but shes 75, has diabetes and will over feed it. Her other dog was at least 15 pounds overweight.  I am in school, taking veterinary medicine classes and so animals are very dear to my heart. I have explained to my grandma my concerns, as well as my mom. They are saying it's her choice, and nothing can be done.  She started by looking at coonhounds, and then boxers, and now a 2 year old hound. I worry that this dog would have a better life with a different family, and I believe if it got too much she would put it down. I also believe that she is only looking at what's available and not what is right for her and her lifestyle.  I think she should stick with small dogs and get something a little older.

5jwkzzv4	My partner can't work, so they sell crafts and figures online to help bring in some money. They also have a YouTube channel they're trying to get off the ground as well. We live together and I work two part time jobs coming out to about full time total.   Sometimes they have me package and ship out the items for them, since they'd otherwise have to wait until I'm done with work and by then the post office is closed. Lately though, they just have me take care of the packaging and shipping entirely by myself. They'll hand me the item and send me the email with the shipping info and it's my job from there. Almost a year ago I was jobless, so I had no issue with helping out with shipping and with the channel. But once I got a job, their expectations that I'd help so much with their stuff never really changed. Sure it changed a little, but a lot of their responsibilities fall onto me still.  They get upset when I fail to support their dreams.   They had me ship out a wand they made the other day on my way to work, and from what I recall the instructions were vague. The last time I shipped out a wand, I packaged it poorly and it arrived broken, so we lost the sale and had to refund the money. I took extra precautions this time and made sure it was labeled fragile, but I guess I still did it wrong. This morning while I was at work, I got a text from my partner- this wand was also broken upon arrival. Them being upset I understand, but in their text they said "don't even fucking look at me until you put 50 dollars into my PayPal." We live together, we share a bed. I have 5 dollars to my name until Friday, and I have to put it in my gas tank.   I may be the AH because you'd think shipping fragile shit correctly is a common sense thing, and I agreed to help them out but failed anyways. But I think their reaction is harsher than it needs to be. This is their job, too, but they shoved all the work onto me. Am I the asshole?

4nsvo339	  So  there’s this girl that I’ve been casually talking to for a little bit. Now she and I are also both talking to other people, so it’s not really serious. We’ve hung out a few times so I thought it would be cool to bring her to a party with my friends. Now we get there and it turns out she knows one of my friends through another person and they met a few years ago. (Which is perfectly normal) Now we all go to dance and my friend takes her and they start dancing( grinding is how we dance here) at  first I thought it was a miscommunication so I tapped him on the shoulder and tried to talk to him a bit to understand his reasoning. I was ignored. This had caught me fully off guard since he has never done anything to me ever and has in fact looked out for me previously. At this point , I was pretty torn up. And I tried tapping his shoulder harder to get his attention but i was ignored again. FIRSTLY, I am not entitled to anyone’s attention and I have no issue with the girl at all. Had she been the one to initiate with him, while unfortunate, would’ve been completely understandable. My issue is with the intentions of a person I put a great amount of trust in to consider my feelings and who ended up just caring about their own enjoyment. All I did after that was just stand there looking upset while trying to enjoy the music. AFTERMATH: Now after the party, I ended up taking a cab with the girl and her friend, we chatted a bit on the way home and that was it. Next day, I try talking to the friend to understand their thought process and they were completely unapologetic, even after explaining how I felt being ignored, they just blamed me for killing the mood, now I did apologize for tapping on his shoulder twice to get his attention but that was the entirety of my outburst. I didn’t yell or insult or try to fight anyone. I basically just stood there, upset. He stayed in his position saying that what I did killed the mood for others too. (Now this was a huge party, with a few hundred people there. So it wasn’t a huge spectacle. ) After explaining my thoughts in a few different ways, ultimately, I knew I wasn’t going to get him to acknowledge how I felt, so I dropped it. A few people from that night are mad at me for the night cause they felt I was chasing the girl after being rejected. In actuality, none of that was about the girl, and we still talk and are cool. My whole thing was with the friend and the decisions they made.  So am I the asshole for expecting consideration of my feelings or was I asking for too much? 😔	1643214409.0	sd9v5u	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sd9v5u/aita_for_getting_pissed_at_my_friend_for_picking/	AITA for getting pissed at my friend for picking up a girl I was trying to talk to?
j1axx1i9	I am a young, right out of grad school professional in a “fancy” job. I make a pretty good salary but I’ve got crazy student loan debt ($250k). My minimum monthly loan payment is $2,400 and I try to pay as much as I can on top of that. Because of this, I live in a not great apartment with roommates and budget pretty much everything. Well my office apparently pools money from the professional staff to buy the admins holiday gifts. First, I think that’s ridiculous in principle, our company has so much money, why can’t it just buy gifts or pay bonuses to the admin staff. Second, I had like no wiggle room in my budget for this. I got my own family $20 and under presents, I couldn’t afford $50 per admin (5 admins!), plus $100 for my assistant. (I was told this has been the standard from each professional staff for years.) I just told my boss I couldn’t do it, but I would contribute $50 total. I genuinely feel horrible about it bc I think the admin staff count on this money for the holidays and I found out that my assistant got less than she was expecting bc I didn’t contribute much. She’s very nice and hasn’t (and won’t) say anything to me, but I feel so guilty. She probably thinks I purposefully chose not to give her that money even though my salary is probably four times greater than hers.

9as2igwr	My (50f) mom moved to the US in 15 years ago and still till this day she can't speak a single sentence of English without struggling. I (18m) move here 11 years ago, I did go to school and had time to develop my English language. My whole issue with my mom isn't that I don't want to help her but it's that she doesn't want to help herself. She makes me feel like I'm only here to serve her by say "if you can't help me then what are you here for?" Or she'll say "why do people have children if it's not to help their parents?". This really annoys but I just rather not argue with them about their strange views. This week my mom is doing her job orientation over zoom and she asked me to help her. Okay now here's another problem that annoys me, my parents never put any effort to learn how to do important things like: applying for jobs, writing their resume, checking important emails and learning to use other apps besides Facebook and WhatsApp. Anyways back to the zoom meeting. When my mom said help her what she means is pay attention and participate for her. I am not a stingy person and if my mom actually tried to understand what her manager and supervisors were saying by asking me questions and writing things down I wouldn't be mad at all but all she's doing it dropping everything on me. Knowing my parents if something goes wrong I'll get the blame because I did everything. The meeting lasted two days, the first day I annoyingly did everything but the second I gave up trying and just answered once and awhile but I kept telling my mom she should try and type something. In the end she was very upset with me.    I didn't just sit around acting all high and mighty because she can't speak English. My mom can read English so I got her a conversational book to help her build her skills but I haven't once seen her read it or ask me any questions about it. My siblings and I got her some English learning app to help but when I check her progress she hasn't made any because she doesn't go ok the apps. It's so frustrating being told to do something that you have no experience doing and being yelled at for not knowing, for example my dad asking me to pay bills, apply for job for him and read legal documents but they won't show me how to do any of these. They believe American schools teach us everything. This is getting way to long so I'mma get to the point. I'm just going to give up on help my mom because she isn't trying to be independent but just using me. I don't want to be in the middle of anything important that she has to do cause I rather not be blamed. Would that make me an asshole if I don't help her?	1643215361.0	sda8y8	/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sda8y8/aita_for_not_helping_my_mom_with_her_zoom_meeting/	AITA for not helping my mom with her zoom meeting even though I know she doesn't speak English?
ghyjtzvn	Hello, I'm holding a wedding recently and my friend has RSVP with a +1 months ago. Just yesterday, about a month from the wedding, she told me that she and her husband cannot make it to my wedding as they had booked a wrong date for a short travel. I asked if they could reschedule the trip but they declined, saying that they do not want to spend the additional cost to reschedule.  However, my wedding is a banquet and the food is catered for each individual. With COVID, my minimum and maximum guaranteed seats are the same and fixed, meaning any dropouts will cost me money as I still have to pay. As such, I have requested for my friend to pay for her and her husband's share.
