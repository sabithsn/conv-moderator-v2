hzqdd7f2	I've read through all of the posts on here and still can't figure it out. A few years ago, I traveled to Moscow and had trouble getting a cab from the airport. Uber had been replaced with Yandex, which wouldn't accept my US-based credit card even if I entered it through Apple Pay; it wasn't being declined by my bank. I'm flying to Moscow soon and just tried to add my card to Yandex again - same problem. Gett did let me add my card, but I'm not confident it'll work until I actually try. At that point it'll of course be too late to ask you all for help.

w0mh6zi	I live in Switzerland, and my best friend is a Russian girl. Last night we were out partying and she asked “have you guys ever had sex with a Nigger?”  We were astonished, including 2 black girls in the house. Nobody said anything, because we understood she didn’t have any bad intention, but the air became a bit awkward. Makes me wonder if N word (with derogatory connotation and historical baggage) is an exclusively a western(Euro-American) thing? How’s it perceived in Russia? Is it considered neutral?

aiqzuzme	Hello all, I’m living in Yekaterinburg for a year, and I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights. I probably won’t have another chance for a long time and wanted to plan a few day long trip to somewhere I can see them. I was thinking Murmansk, but I know there are a lot of options. I also know that they don’t show up every night, so I wanted to get an idea of where and when the odds would be in my favor.   Where and when would be my best bet?

iggj62j1	To clarify what I mean,   How did Russia go from meh in 1917 to owning nukes/biggest army and winning WW2?     Russia is almost an anomaly in world politics, you can't go from eliminating the Tsar to being the second country with nukes in just 5 years after the war and being feared by the entire western world.     Was it thanks to spying, and stealing german tech?   Educational system?   Mass production of weapons?   Wtf happened?     Also, I know that the system wasn't very efficient (famines, gulags, etc...) I am talking about the becoming a superpower within 1-2 decades, how the hell did this happen?

Ukrainian historiography claims that during the holodomor  these eastern Ukrainians in kuban(but in donbass and dniepr region as well) were genocided and russians were put in their place. Is this all Ukrainian propaganda? On the Wikipedia page on kuban Ukrainians all sources are from Ukrainian history books. What is the take of Russian and western  ethnohistoriography on this?

Do you think Ukraine should be independent or not ? Are Ukrainian violenting Russian minorities  ? Should an intervention be conducted by Russia ? Is nato aggressive toward Russia ? Again, those questions may be sensitives and I don't want to sparkle a debate but to get real Russian point of views on the events .  I just want views of real Russians , by definition it's not something right or wrong, it's just how you see those points. I really try to be as humble as possible in my question but maybe I'm not posing it right or I'm offensive in the Russian culture. If yes, I can only apologize and tell you it's not my intention.  Thanks to all the respondents !  Edit: I should reformulate: I don't care what side you are on any question. It's just your personal advice on the subjects.

aiqzuzme	Hello all, I’m living in Yekaterinburg for a year, and I’ve always wanted to see the Northern Lights. I probably won’t have another chance for a long time and wanted to plan a few day long trip to somewhere I can see them. I was thinking Murmansk, but I know there are a lot of options. I also know that they don’t show up every night, so I wanted to get an idea of where and when the odds would be in my favor.   Where and when would be my best bet?

iggj62j1	To clarify what I mean,   How did Russia go from meh in 1917 to owning nukes/biggest army and winning WW2?     Russia is almost an anomaly in world politics, you can't go from eliminating the Tsar to being the second country with nukes in just 5 years after the war and being feared by the entire western world.     Was it thanks to spying, and stealing german tech?   Educational system?   Mass production of weapons?   Wtf happened?     Also, I know that the system wasn't very efficient (famines, gulags, etc...) I am talking about the becoming a superpower within 1-2 decades, how the hell did this happen?

22gkf453	Context: My wife is Russian, one of my colleagues (Scottish) has an ушанка given to him "By a Russian-speaking Kazakh" 10 years ago.   This colleague is wearing this hat here (in Hungary, which looks super weird) because he says "this is fashionable. My wife laughed when I told her and she said she hasn't seen or heard of anyone wearing these in modern Russia - not even that much when she was a kid in Moscow back in the 80s.  Another colleague (American) likes this guy so she jumps in and supports him, that yes, she's seen "people on instagram" that wear these hats in Russian cities. I didn't, quite, laugh in her face (I mean, come on, it's Instagram; not exactly a representation of life anyway, right?).  So, thought I'd ask here! For those living in Russia in various places, anyone really wearing ушанка anymore? Is my wife right, and haha, no way? Or these two right and yes, it's high fashion and lots of people wear them?

9i3foo5m	I heard some years ago that the Russian government wanted to reduce / ban online pornography in Russia as it was detrimental to population growth. Then I only recently learned that vk was not a porn site but a Russian fb...  So the question arised (if I can say so) : How does the Russian society perceive the pornography in general and it's consumption ? Also how do you view people producing porn ?  For exemple:  I m belgian and at last in public, most aged people will tell you that porn is bad even thought most people watch at least some. It would be highly unusual for a teenage not to watch it from time to time (up to a point a teenageboy tellingyou he doesn'twatch porn is highly improbable). It's pretty common for teenage boys to speak about it sometimes even thought it's between close friend they do so. In couple it's not uncommon to have at least one partner watching some porn sometimes.  On the other doing porn is badly seen and nobody would want it's daughter or son to do it.	1642738630.0	s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/	How does Russian perceive pornography ?

I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.

However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places? Is there more of an awareness of germs and bacteria over there? Is it part of the daily discussion?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians?

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

22gkf453	Context: My wife is Russian, one of my colleagues (Scottish) has an ушанка given to him "By a Russian-speaking Kazakh" 10 years ago.   This colleague is wearing this hat here (in Hungary, which looks super weird) because he says "this is fashionable. My wife laughed when I told her and she said she hasn't seen or heard of anyone wearing these in modern Russia - not even that much when she was a kid in Moscow back in the 80s.  Another colleague (American) likes this guy so she jumps in and supports him, that yes, she's seen "people on instagram" that wear these hats in Russian cities. I didn't, quite, laugh in her face (I mean, come on, it's Instagram; not exactly a representation of life anyway, right?).  So, thought I'd ask here! For those living in Russia in various places, anyone really wearing ушанка anymore? Is my wife right, and haha, no way? Or these two right and yes, it's high fashion and lots of people wear them?

9i3foo5m	I heard some years ago that the Russian government wanted to reduce / ban online pornography in Russia as it was detrimental to population growth. Then I only recently learned that vk was not a porn site but a Russian fb...  So the question arised (if I can say so) : How does the Russian society perceive the pornography in general and it's consumption ? Also how do you view people producing porn ?  For exemple:  I m belgian and at last in public, most aged people will tell you that porn is bad even thought most people watch at least some. It would be highly unusual for a teenage not to watch it from time to time (up to a point a teenageboy tellingyou he doesn'twatch porn is highly improbable). It's pretty common for teenage boys to speak about it sometimes even thought it's between close friend they do so. In couple it's not uncommon to have at least one partner watching some porn sometimes.  On the other doing porn is badly seen and nobody would want it's daughter or son to do it.	1642738630.0	s91uxn	/r/AskARussian/comments/s91uxn/how_does_russian_perceive_pornography/	How does Russian perceive pornography ?

Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.

However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places? Is there more of an awareness of germs and bacteria over there? Is it part of the daily discussion?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians?

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

Or is one fake, and I applied to the second one and got a supposed “acceptance”, but I noticed that the person/company mailing me was called “Edugain Overseas”, and I’m not sure if it’s real or not, and they require me to pay 500 USD + first year tuition fees in order to send me an invitation letter, is that the normal procedure? I also was not asked to do any exams or nothing whatsoever. Please help me in this case.  EDIT: I’ve emailed the office/company edugain, and they informed me that the second link is for locals only and first is for international students? Could someone confirm or deny this? Thanks again  EDIT 2: When I applied through the first website, i received an email saying that I’ll be forwarded to the official representative “Edugain Overseas” which I thought at the time was an actual representative. However I searched the name on google and the company was located in India and it seems that they help students get into Ukrainian and Russian universities.

18npgz9d	From what I know it is very niche and not very famous, and for myself it is pretty much the "politically correct" version of Fascism.  But what interests me (as a concept, I'm by no means fond of authoritarianism) is the defense of the concept of multipolarity as a means to help the self-determination of peoples. Latin America has historically struggled to fulfill its objectives mostly due to U.S. interference. A multipolar world would surely be in our interests, as our northern neighbour would have to turn its eyes elsewhere, or nowhere at all, and I believe, for different reasons, that a new geopolitical organization such as this one would also be in Russia's interests.	1643119604.0	scejcl	/r/AskARussian/comments/scejcl/opinions_on_the_4th_political_theory/	Opinions on the 4th Political Theory?

2y5iebtw	Currently in the process of learning the Russian language and I've come to the point that I can start writing sentences to help commit words/phrases to memory better. So I'm wondering, should I just jump straight into learning cursive for writing? Is writing in "print" a thing? For example, most English speakers (at least here in the U.S.) are taught cursive in school but never actually use it. Everyone I know writes in "print" except for very rare occasions. I'm wondering if the same is true at all for Russian or if it would be best for me to just get used to it.	1643146262.0	scohp0	/r/AskARussian/comments/scohp0/how_common_is_cursive/	How common is cursive?

40qqp96b	The EU just passed a law that [makes it mandatory](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/statistics-and-analysis/statistics-and-analysis-archive/esafety/black-boxes-vehicle-data-recorders_en) for car manufacturers to install hardware, something like a "black box" that will track your movement and log every handling you make and it will make sounds and flashing lights when you surpass the maximum speed limit. It will be enforced within two years from now.  They say this is being done to minimize traffic-death toll and although obviously I think every causality is one to many, I just assume the real reason is to maximize the amount of control governments and companies will have on you is to maximize profits and to strive for something ~~we~~ they call prosperity.  Because to the general public, laws are being developed to eradicate terrorism, child porn, drugs and unnecessary death from the face of the earth, but since I'm closer to forty than thirty I start to understand that all of these phenomena's are just part of life, so you either have to cope or install totalitarian regime in where they can implement all the necessary tools to follow your every footstep, measures so drastically, it will interfere with the way you flow into daily life, as for instance we currently see in parts of China, which obviously does not exterminate illicit drug manufacturing or terrorism, but it will fuck up your life.  This might be quite a rant - the vibe I get from the current situation alongside the border of Ukraine and Russia is that, in the Western media that is available around me, everyone has something to say, except for Russia. The voice of Russia is never to be heard in our newspapers, so the only thing I get is that the West somehow is anxious about something that Russia does.  And because we, as kids, were raised with the narrative that 'the West' is of superior quality than the regimes in 'the (far) East', because regimes are baaaad and communism is baaad and everyone in the East is being suppressed and you people are poor and healthcare sucks and totalitarianism is awful. North Korea is shit and China right now is shit because of it's surveillance-state and sweatshops. Russia and the far East should shut the fuck up because you are always drunk fucks and let the Great West decide that you are shit and we are amazing, fuck you. If you plan to invade a country, we will fuck you up, goddamnit.  I have the feeling I'm missing out big time on some great cultural feats that reside in Russia and the Eastern part of the world and your woman are absolutely stunning and your food is great, you have great art and music and architecture and the way you people socialize is beyond how I grew up and what I observe. No random person in my vicinity ever invited me to lunch together while we were going down the same path.  People in the West are absolute entitled asshole individuals with a great arrogance, always looking at their phones, not giving a shit about the world around them, thinking they are amazing until they develop pancreatic cancer, then obviously it's the fault of someone else and Russia still sucks. Everything is focussed on maximizing efficiency and to get rid of that what is holding them down. If you don't have money or resources, you are a fucking loser, holy shit.  Now Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and all the other major platforms are making sure you will see what *they* want. Because instead of censoring like 'they' do in the East, locking people who are slightly criticizing the government, 'we' just flag it as 'fake news' and we ban you from the platform, effectively doing the same without locking up our people.  Google and Facebook are tracking you every moment of the day. They know where you are, what meds you take, your preferred snack and how many teeth you have. And that's no fucking joke. Because everything is linked to each other, every company is harvesting massive amounts of data. Not for your favour, to win the war on drugs or to downplay terrorism, but to maximize profits and to try and generate the maximum amounts of control they have on the citizens.  And now you might think "What the fuck does this has to do with Russia?"  Well, for ages I've been taught that everything about Russia and China is total shit, complete fucked up waste of space. You people completely suck at what ever you are doing and you are the scum of the Earth and we in the West are fucking amazing, right?  All while this fucked up indoctrination is turning itself against me and the only observation I make is that the European Union and USA is no fucking different and is implementing the same fucked-up doctrine that the West is accusing the East from doing so and it pisses me off.  The EU and USA will do everything they can to develop a system in where they are able to observe and track your sorry ass to see if you do what they demand from you. This is just the same as a Stalinist five-year plan but in the current day and digital age and they will fuck you up if you plan to steer away from their intentions.  I have a few questions and it revolves around how you as a Russian perceive this as being true or false in the way you've been raised as a kid. Do you share similar sentiment and observations but opposed to the West? Is Russia also doing its best to hoard as much as data from their civilians to try and suppress your ass with the belief it's against drugs abuse, child porn and terrorism?  Or am I making just a whole bunch of uneducated stupid assumptions and is this all just me being a paranoid schizo, drunk with resentment for something I can not get?  I would love to read bunch of your stories and viewpoints and thank you for reading.   TL;DR   Being raised by the doctrine that Pro-EU is great and Russia is bad, because oligarchic communism  is bad, because everyone is spying on each other and you are drunk fucks that are being suppressed by your totalitarian regime and you live in a surveillance state and you will get exterminated if you don't follow orders.   Of course that is a bunch of bullshit and according to new laws, Europe is doing exactly that what they accuse Russia and China for doing, by implementing laws that makes it possible to spy and hoard as much information about you only to be that slightly more secure with a shit argument that it's against terrorism or any other shitty reasoning while all they really want is control over your sorry ass so they can maximize profit that they call prosperity and EU is in no way better or worse than the East or what they want you to believe.   	1643182098.0	sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/	Cultural differences, narrative, privacy, and the current day and age governing the peoples

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.  I know the 25th is soon, I just thought it would be nice to know if this was true.  Thank you to anyone who answers.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything.

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system. We have an extensive and thorough process, so it's satisfied them all for the most part-- excluding one client's brother who refuses to step into our facility because he insists it cannot possibly be clean enough. It happens enough that I'm making a post here, wondering whether this is something cultural? Is there a particular interest in cleanly measures taken in public places? Is there more of an awareness of germs and bacteria over there? Is it part of the daily discussion?

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians?

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).  The only side we hear of is the Canadians, especially the pair who still feel they deserved the medal better but we never hear much of the Russian side of the story  Do you think the Canadians deserved to settle for silver or gold?	1643048893.0	sbstwx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbstwx/what_do_the_russians_think_of_the_2002_olympic/	What do the Russians think of the 2002 Olympic pairs skating debacle?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

4izqwn1a	I work at a float center in the NorthWest of America. Recently we have seen an uptake of Russian clients, which is awesome! However, much to my amusement, I've found our Russian clients seem to have endless questions when it comes to our cleaning methods and filtration system.

2th6gqmm	**Edit: to clarify, when I say 'the global West', I'm not referring to EU/NATO/Western Europe, I'm talking about the cultural and historical West rooted in christian traditions (which includes most of the Americas and Oceania), as opposed to the Muslim World, China and its cultural sphere, ... I'm sorry for formulating it in the wrong manner.**  I'm wondering whether Russians are more likely to consider themselves as a part of Europe, or as an entire separate part of the world. I know your country has often been excluded and isolated from other European countries.  Yet, Europe is incredibly diverse as well. Germany, Bulgaria and Spain are three very different countries, yet all three consider themselves "western" and "European". You're a mostly christian nation like Europe, have lots of shared history with Europe, speak a European language, have shaped Europe in many ways, your customs and art look quite European, Russians look like Europeans (for what it's worth) ...  Should Russia be considered a part of the broader western culture? Or do you feel closer to Asia? Or do you consider yourself an entirely separate part of the world first and foremost?  (I'm not trying to push an agenda; I'm just interested in hearing your perspectives. Also, please leave politics aside - I'm talking about Europe as a continent, not the EU or NATO.)  Edit: I know there are big political divides between Russia and European/western countries. I know you have been excluded from being called European many times during history. But does that really make you *that* different from the West? It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds. Can this be correct?	1642955070.0	saxaku	/r/AskARussian/comments/saxaku/do_russians_consider_themselves_as_part_of_the/	Do Russians consider themselves as part of the global West?

ef4mq2qm	Made a friend from Russia.  Then last month they said we couldn't talk for a while because non essential businesses were going to close for a month, due to the new COVID variant.  They could only talk at work because of internet, which is a little strange but I understood.  Didn't think much of it at the time but different questions popped into my head, so I tried to look it up myself.  I can't find anything saying that things have closed in Russia due to COVID right now.  I was wondering if anyone can confirm or deny that this is the case.  It's not a big deal that we aren't talking because that it their choice but I was just hoping I'm not being lied to.  They said things will be closed from Dec. 25 to Jan. 25.  I know the 25th is soon, I just thought it would be nice to know if this was true.  Thank you to anyone who answers.

wqtvu	I am a American and I may have a very biased view of Stalin. I have read that many Russians have a favorable opinion about the leader. However, In the west he is a figure that highlights the atrocity's associated with socialism.  He is seen as a ruthless leader because of death toll, gulags and the great famine. Is he seen favorably because of the nationalism associated with war time? Is my viewpoint of him based on western ideologies?

49ch2mub	Greetings! I live in a town here in Germany where there are quite a few Russia-Germans. Russia-Germans is probably a German term but i am talking about native Germans who followed the call of Catherine the great in the late 18th century and setteled in Russia. I know that they was seen as "inner enemy" during WW1 and WW2 and Stalin even deported them to Sibira, if im correct and after Stalin a lot of them even went to Kazakhstan. In the early 1990s the new formed Bundesrepubik Deutschland invited them back to Germany and again hundreds of thousands followed the call. So now here, back in Germany in the year 2022 i have met and known quite a few of those Russia-Germans, in school i even was friends with one Russia-German child and it seems that all of them see themselves as true russians but i also met a natvie Russian living in Russia one day and he again said, that the native Russians dont think that they belong to their people... They mostly have German lastnames like Schneider, Huber, Sperling, Müller, etc. But some of them dont even speak German after almost 30 years of beeing here and only stay with eachother and talk Russian and refering to themselves as "real Russian" they decorate their homes with Russian flags celebrate all the Russian festives like Russian new years, for their children comes  Дед Мороз and  Снегурочка and not like for German Children St. Nikolaus and the Christkind. I also once saw a German Documentary about them and the speaker said very harshly: Russian-German are poor souls without identity. Germans dont see them as fellow Germans and Russians dont see them as fellow Russians. So is that true? Do native Russians really dont see them as fellow Russians? As for the German part i can say its kind of true, especially in the south some especially older people still see them as foreigners and dont accept them and they mainly stay with eachother and dont seem to seek german friends or anything. How do you native Russians see this?	1642864404.0	sa4jwy	/r/AskARussian/comments/sa4jwy/what_do_native_russians_living_in_russia_think_of/	What do native Russians, living in Russia, think of Russia-Germans?

5884w30v	I'm asian and my best friend of over ten years is from russia.   A bit of background is that I was raised very traditionally in asian culture. In regards to gender roles, all this time I was raised I was taught by my parents: females are meant to be house wives, I listen and obey my parents and until they approve a man to me, get married, and obey him. This changed, of course, when I moved to the US and when I met my best friend.   On her side, she was raised by a single mother. Her biological father dumped her mom when she was pregnant. Her mom has been working hard ever since, starting her own business, moving to the US, working 70 hours week, etc. Because of my best friend, I also get to interact with other slavic women who are more or less in similar situations.   I've always looked up to her mom since she has so much experience and strength in her, it molds her moral compass in a way that is very logical and independent, no bullshit like: blood thicker than water, women stays home, obey your parents'/husbands' authorities, etc. She is also very kind, generous, and welcoming under her tough shell, comparing to people I've met coming from asian, mexican, indian, and other cultures.   Other than that, there's always a stereotype saying slavic women are tough in terms of stature and personality. So I want to ask why? What is the reason? I assume it has a lot to do with the soviet union and womens' roles back then(?)  Update: forgot to mention this earlier that I’m also aware that In well rounded Slavic families, even both parents teach their kids (especially daughters) to be independent. Comparing to other cultures I’ve seen, Asian, American, Hispanic, etc with such traditional teachings.	1642904992.0	saiw9r	/r/AskARussian/comments/saiw9r/why_are_slavic_women_so_tough_and_independent/	Why are slavic women so tough and independent?

It's just my impression that Russia and the West are very similar in many ways, and that the biggest gap between Russia and Europe is in people's minds.

bakftrjt	I have been reading a bit about the old "empire" Kievan Rus and was wondering what meaning it has to todays Russia and todays culture in Russia. So my questions are e.g.:  * Do you see the Kievan Rus as the "cradle" of Russia? Or is "the cradle" more seen later, i.e. what Ivan the Great did when he ended the dominance of the Tatars. * Do you learn in school that the Kievan Rus is the beginning of Russia? Or is is teached like the beginning of Russia, Belorussia and Ukraine? Or simply as a separate medieval empire? * Is there any interest in the Viking sagas in Russia because of the Varangians? If yes, which specific topics are important for Russians?  Thanks a lot for all responses!	1642962381.0	sb05qx	/r/AskARussian/comments/sb05qx/киевская_русь/	Киевская Русь

I made my research and the author don't like the song either, I think because it was too popular and it became on one-hit wonder or something like that  and he wanted to be recognized for more of his works than actually that song, but still the lyrics seemed so cool to me, not talking about whooping some nibba's ass, or paying a girl to do some sexual work, no actually is political but with a good critic like when he says "*И люди*, *стрелявшие в наших отцов*, *Строят* планы на наших детей."  want to know your opinions and if you cringe as well hahaha  Edit: maybe they weren't cringing but actually surprised I was singing it haha thanks for your thoughs.	1643030456.0	sbm2v9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbm2v9/is_поезд_в_огне_cringe/	Is поезд в огне cringe?

abap2hfz	Lenin is responsible for Russia no longer being a superpower, he did more damage to Russia than any person in history reversing 1000+ years of territorial expansion in 1 day. Lenin took the Autonomous Republics of the Russian Soviet Republic, 30 percent of the territory and turned them into autonomous countries in order to dismantle "Russian Chauvinism". Basically weakening Russia in order to strengthen the others. Stalin argued against this saying that this would encourage separatism but he eventually gave in to Lenin's arguments, not to mention the soviets destroying many Russian churches and holy sites + killing Russia's last tsar and his family.  https://preview.redd.it/b99hb6pjgnd81.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=0912b93f02011a9115ac7196557ce956c84c8e63	1643036531.0	sbo5js	/r/AskARussian/comments/sbo5js/why_are_their_still_lenin_statues_and_street/	Why are their still Lenin statues and street names in Russia?

q9mahuc	Might be almost 20 years ago but considering nobody asked and yet, it is seen as one of the worst scandals in figure skating and in Olympic history, I thought it is better to ask now. What do the Russians think of the outcome of the result and the entire debacle?  I won't go into too much of it considering there is so much that a Wikipedia article about it exists (2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal).   TLDR for the impatient; the Russians (Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze) ended up finishing ahead of the Canadians (Jamie Salé and David Pelletier). Many felt the latter deserved gold better than the former. Not long later, a French judge become impicated, then a scandal broke out...What is said to have done was to have overhauled the scoring system into the one we have today.  It is big enough that, in the run-up to the Beijing games, there have been documentaries about it. 1) On Netflix, an episode of Bad Sport called [Gold War](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15528098/?ref_=ttep_ep4) (very biased to you know who). 2) Recently, a miniseries called [Meddling](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt16825564/) (not seen it yet).

Or is one fake, and I applied to the second one and got a supposed “acceptance”, but I noticed that the person/company mailing me was called “Edugain Overseas”, and I’m not sure if it’s real or not, and they require me to pay 500 USD + first year tuition fees in order to send me an invitation letter, is that the normal procedure? I also was not asked to do any exams or nothing whatsoever. Please help me in this case.  EDIT: I’ve emailed the office/company edugain, and they informed me that the second link is for locals only and first is for international students? Could someone confirm or deny this? Thanks again  EDIT 2: When I applied through the first website, i received an email saying that I’ll be forwarded to the official representative “Edugain Overseas” which I thought at the time was an actual representative. However I searched the name on google and the company was located in India and it seems that they help students get into Ukrainian and Russian universities. This has all made me too suspicious and made me post this here.  EDIT 3: I’ve decided that I’ll not be paying and I’m the meanwhile I’ll email the second link which is real one about the issue and whether the office (edugain overseas) has actually got me an acceptance or not.

18npgz9d	From what I know it is very niche and not very famous, and for myself it is pretty much the "politically correct" version of Fascism.  But what interests me (as a concept, I'm by no means fond of authoritarianism) is the defense of the concept of multipolarity as a means to help the self-determination of peoples. Latin America has historically struggled to fulfill its objectives mostly due to U.S. interference. A multipolar world would surely be in our interests, as our northern neighbour would have to turn its eyes elsewhere, or nowhere at all, and I believe, for different reasons, that a new geopolitical organization such as this one would also be in Russia's interests.	1643119604.0	scejcl	/r/AskARussian/comments/scejcl/opinions_on_the_4th_political_theory/	Opinions on the 4th Political Theory?

40qqp96b	The EU just passed a law that [makes it mandatory](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/road_safety/statistics-and-analysis/statistics-and-analysis-archive/esafety/black-boxes-vehicle-data-recorders_en) for car manufacturers to install hardware, something like a "black box" that will track your movement and log every handling you make and it will make sounds and flashing lights when you surpass the maximum speed limit. It will be enforced within two years from now.  They say this is being done to minimize traffic-death toll and although obviously I think every causality is one to many, I just assume the real reason is to maximize the amount of control governments and companies will have on you is to maximize profits and to strive for something ~~we~~ they call prosperity.  Because to the general public, laws are being developed to eradicate terrorism, child porn, drugs and unnecessary death from the face of the earth, but since I'm closer to forty than thirty I start to understand that all of these phenomena's are just part of life, so you either have to cope or install totalitarian regime in where they can implement all the necessary tools to follow your every footstep, measures so drastically, it will interfere with the way you flow into daily life, as for instance we currently see in parts of China, which obviously does not exterminate illicit drug manufacturing or terrorism, but it will fuck up your life.  This might be quite a rant - the vibe I get from the current situation alongside the border of Ukraine and Russia is that, in the Western media that is available around me, everyone has something to say, except for Russia. The voice of Russia is never to be heard in our newspapers, so the only thing I get is that the West somehow is anxious about something that Russia does.  And because we, as kids, were raised with the narrative that 'the West' is of superior quality than the regimes in 'the (far) East', because regimes are baaaad and communism is baaad and everyone in the East is being suppressed and you people are poor and healthcare sucks and totalitarianism is awful. North Korea is shit and China right now is shit because of it's surveillance-state and sweatshops. Russia and the far East should shut the fuck up because you are always drunk fucks and let the Great West decide that you are shit and we are amazing, fuck you. If you plan to invade a country, we will fuck you up, goddamnit.  I have the feeling I'm missing out big time on some great cultural feats that reside in Russia and the Eastern part of the world and your woman are absolutely stunning and your food is great, you have great art and music and architecture and the way you people socialize is beyond how I grew up and what I observe. No random person in my vicinity ever invited me to lunch together while we were going down the same path.  People in the West are absolute entitled asshole individuals with a great arrogance, always looking at their phones, not giving a shit about the world around them, thinking they are amazing until they develop pancreatic cancer, then obviously it's the fault of someone else and Russia still sucks. Everything is focussed on maximizing efficiency and to get rid of that what is holding them down. If you don't have money or resources, you are a fucking loser, holy shit.  Now Google, Facebook, Youtube, Twitter and all the other major platforms are making sure you will see what *they* want. Because instead of censoring like 'they' do in the East, locking people who are slightly criticizing the government, 'we' just flag it as 'fake news' and we ban you from the platform, effectively doing the same without locking up our people.  Google and Facebook are tracking you every moment of the day. They know where you are, what meds you take, your preferred snack and how many teeth you have. And that's no fucking joke. Because everything is linked to each other, every company is harvesting massive amounts of data. Not for your favour, to win the war on drugs or to downplay terrorism, but to maximize profits and to try and generate the maximum amounts of control they have on the citizens.  And now you might think "What the fuck does this has to do with Russia?"  Well, for ages I've been taught that everything about Russia and China is total shit, complete fucked up waste of space. You people completely suck at what ever you are doing and you are the scum of the Earth and we in the West are fucking amazing, right?  All while this fucked up indoctrination is turning itself against me and the only observation I make is that the European Union and USA is no fucking different and is implementing the same fucked-up doctrine that the West is accusing the East from doing so and it pisses me off.  The EU and USA will do everything they can to develop a system in where they are able to observe and track your sorry ass to see if you do what they demand from you. This is just the same as a Stalinist five-year plan but in the current day and digital age and they will fuck you up if you plan to steer away from their intentions.  I have a few questions and it revolves around how you as a Russian perceive this as being true or false in the way you've been raised as a kid. Do you share similar sentiment and observations but opposed to the West? Is Russia also doing its best to hoard as much as data from their civilians to try and suppress your ass with the belief it's against drugs abuse, child porn and terrorism?  Or am I making just a whole bunch of uneducated stupid assumptions and is this all just me being a paranoid schizo, drunk with resentment for something I can not get?  I would love to read bunch of your stories and viewpoints and thank you for reading.   TL;DR   Being raised by the doctrine that Pro-EU is great and Russia is bad, because oligarchic communism  is bad, because everyone is spying on each other and you are drunk fucks that are being suppressed by your totalitarian regime and you live in a surveillance state and you will get exterminated if you don't follow orders.   Of course that is a bunch of bullshit and according to new laws, Europe is doing exactly that what they accuse Russia and China for doing, by implementing laws that makes it possible to spy and hoard as much information about you only to be that slightly more secure with a shit argument that it's against terrorism or any other shitty reasoning while all they really want is control over your sorry ass so they can maximize profit that they call prosperity and EU is in no way better or worse than the East or what they want you to believe.   	1643182098.0	sd0b5s	/r/AskARussian/comments/sd0b5s/cultural_differences_narrative_privacy_and_the/	Cultural differences, narrative, privacy, and the current day and age governing the peoples

4rsb8161	The question derived from previous post. I'm Russian myself,  anytime someone brings up the discussion on "How are you?" being a form of a greeting and not a literal question - it puzzles me.   For one thing the concept was explained in "Brat 2" movie over 2 decades ago. Has been ridiculed by Zadornov for a while. And keep coming up in every youtube video titled "10 cons of living in the US". Wasn't there enough time to connect the dots? Secondly, even in the movie it was actually insulting to intelligence to assume that Russian can not understand that words do not always have to be taken literally. Have you ever bitten a granite (грызли гранит) or have your arms ever walked (руки доходили)? Thirdly, i'm pretty sure Russians are able to read the context. While in Russia, have you ever been asked "Как дела?" by a guy you barely know, say at a new workplace? Did you let him in on your medical record?  Furthermore, besides the context, tone needs to be considered, because "how are you?" can be a genuine inquiry.  How is this still considered a cultural barrier and why is this stereotype being perpetuated?	1643231516.0	sdgkc6	/r/AskARussian/comments/sdgkc6/how_are_you/	How are you?

orwx5	Hi guys, first post here, I want to be respectful just genuinely curious about this. My Russian roommate just moved out (we are friends too, or I thought we were haha). She left 4 things here that I gave to her as gifts. Like I went to a store and bought them specifically for her for different occasions.  Her reason is "I don't need them now, you can use them if you want!"   (She is moving into a completely empty apartment not so far away, so technically she does need them, but I guess doesn't like them.)  My first reaction is of course to get offended lol. But I'm wondering if this is just a cultural difference? Does she legitimately think she's doing me a favor by giving back gifts? Among American girl friends this would definitely be a very passive aggressive move, but I wanted to Ask a Russian before I get offended.

Or is breakfast more of just a snack to have before work? I ask this as an American who loves breakfast. Many of the countries I’ve visited in Europe were not big into breakfast/restaurants with exception of a few.  What do you commonly eat for breakfast? Coffee or tea? I’m assuming it’s a lot of similar food to what I normally eat. I made syrnikis a few time and enjoyed them as they were like a cheesy pancake.

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.  I have heard sketchy things about Avito (unfortunately), so a trustworthy intermediary would be preferable...if possible.  I know this isn't a cheap item, so I don't want to lose coin to a scam. I've tried searching this item on other sites and I can't find it, so I'm assuming that it is only on Avito.  That being said, it would be immensely appreciated if anybody can find the seller on a more accessible source.  I'm aware that this is a long shot, but I am trying my best to obtain this storied item.

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)  In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc   NOT our Pilsners like Jupiler and Stella. Which are very popular, but not the reason people say Belgium has the best beer in the world. They're not even Belgian style and I've had better pilsner in Prague  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)  We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet  So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)  How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)  I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

I have no doubt that he was, but him emphasizing it for several times makes me curious if there is something interestingly implicit behind it?  We also chatted about my Russian friends. Because all the people I know from where used to be Soviet Union are from Russia. he seemed to be a bit offended by me talking about only Russian and really wanted to identify himself as from the Soviet Union.	1643475472.0	sfm9s4	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfm9s4/what_do_people_really_mean_when_they_say_they_are/	What do people really mean when they say they are from the Soviet Union?

I know that the KPRF has a *very small* level of power compared to the United Russia Party. How close is their ideology to that the of the Russian National Front?      My basic understanding of Putin is that he is a strong a pluralist between Tsarist and Soviet tradition.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?   I am writing an article on the Russian-Ukraine conflict for academic purposes, specifically how Russian and Ukrainian Canadians view the conflict. If you are Russian Canadian, would you be willing to provide your first name, and the city that you are in? Thank you for your time.  &#x200B;  Full disclosure.

9xcluxkb	To sum up the whole case : in October 2017, former olympic artistic gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused her compatriot and former olympic-winner gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of having raped her when she was 15.  She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :  >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*  By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*  Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.  Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.  Personally I doubt rape rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.

Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.   Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

39egznkl	It seems to me that in Russia, men are allowed to hit their wives and girlfriends  - but they aren’t allowed to punch random women they encounter at the shops, or female coworkers, or even female friends (and I mean friends, not “friends”).  So, why would a Russian woman marry or form a serious relationship at all? It seems to me that doing so reduces her to less than she is single.	1643625487.0	sgybm9	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgybm9/is_there_a_big_anti_marriage_movement_among/	Is there a big anti marriage movement among Russian women?

744atkfk	Hi guys,  I am doing a masters in translation studies (ru>eng) and writing a paper on how lgbt people are represented through translation. I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

The Russian economy isn't in a great spot right now and the one sector where they are successful and have real influence in the world is gas, but most of the world's biggest contries are all headed towards decarbonising their economies. Most of the biggest nations in the world have made some kind of agreements to get to net zero but 2050/60/70 or something like that.   Now whether or not they reach net zero by those target dates is besides the point, the point is the world is gonna be moving away from fossil fuels.

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.  I have heard sketchy things about Avito (unfortunately), so a trustworthy intermediary would be preferable...if possible.  I know this isn't a cheap item, so I don't want to lose coin to a scam. I've tried searching this item on other sites and I can't find it, so I'm assuming that it is only on Avito.  That being said, it would be immensely appreciated if anybody can find the seller on a more accessible source.  I'm aware that this is a long shot, but I am trying my best to obtain this storied item.  Thank you very much!	1643363303.0	sen682	/r/AskARussian/comments/sen682/need_help_buying_something_off_of_avitoru/	Need help buying something off of Avito.ru - American buyer

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)  In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc   NOT our Pilsners like Jupiler and Stella. Which are very popular, but not the reason people say Belgium has the best beer in the world. They're not even Belgian style and I've had better pilsner in Prague  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)  We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet  So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)  How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)  I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

41b642kp	I don’t know where I should post this question so I apologize if this is the wrong place.  I recently come across a 50-year man in the US. When I asked where he is from he always said he is from the former Soviet Union and he emphasized it several times. I have no doubt that he was, but him emphasizing it for several times makes me curious if there is something interestingly implicit behind it?  We also chatted about my Russian friends. Because all the people I know from where used to be Soviet Union are from Russia. he seemed to be a bit offended by me talking about only Russian and really wanted to identify himself as from the Soviet Union.	1643475472.0	sfm9s4	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfm9s4/what_do_people_really_mean_when_they_say_they_are/	What do people really mean when they say they are from the Soviet Union?

I’m a 14 year old American, and iv been learning Russian a little over a year, and very interested in Russia and other CIS countries, and the potential to study abroad there in the next few years before graduating and going off to college, but through just some preliminary google searches, I’m having trouble finding actual running programs for highschool students, compared to places like Japan, Spain, Mexico which iv been able to find loads of opportunities for. So does anyone have any recommendations for programs/companies/organisers to look into?

If a candidate from the KPRF became president (no that I think it it will ever happen); does anyone here think that  many Soviet traditions return, influence of the Russian Orthodox Church decline, and would the economy become socialized.  I know that the KPRF has a *very small* level of power compared to the United Russia Party. How close is their ideology to that the of the Russian National Front?      My basic understanding of Putin is that he is a strong a pluralist between Tsarist and Soviet tradition.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?   I am writing an article on the Russian-Ukraine conflict for academic purposes, specifically how Russian and Ukrainian Canadians view the conflict. If you are Russian Canadian, would you be willing to provide your first name, and the city that you are in? Thank you for your time.  &#x200B;  Full disclosure. I have posted here before about the same topic,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/s81zik/looking\_for\_perspectives\_of\_russian\_canadian\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/s81zik/looking_for_perspectives_of_russian_canadian_on/)  Since I did not get as much participation as I would have liked, I have decided to ask more direct questions.	1643491794.0	sfs7s7	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfs7s7/what_is_your_opinion_of_putin/	What is your opinion of Putin

9xcluxkb	To sum up the whole case : in October 2017, former olympic artistic gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused her compatriot and former olympic-winner gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of having raped her when she was 15.  She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :  >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*  By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*  Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.  Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.  Personally I doubt rape rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.

1zviqa	Serbian actor who apparently made a solid career in Russia and also had a main role in one of the most highly grossing Russian films, Holop.   Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.  So i just wanted to make some things clear and distinguish his bullshitting from reality.

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.   Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

rr1ry	Hello!  To preface, I'm an antique buyer who is interested in warship items.  I've been looking into purchasing Russian / Soviet warship stuff and I stumbled upon this beauty: a plaque for the aircraft carrier Baku - [https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya\_doska\_takr\_baku\_on\_zhe\_gorshkov\_rrr\_2325972006](https://www.avito.ru/arhangelsk/kollektsionirovanie/zakladnaya_doska_takr_baku_on_zhe_gorshkov_rrr_2325972006)  Words can't describe how much I wish to add this to my collection, but I have a problem: it is really hard for me to communicate that desire through Avito.ru's system.  I need a Russian number and am having issues getting through the site.  I'm wondering if there is an intermediary service I can use to get the item and have it sent to the United States.  For the Japanese, there are sites like Buyee and Zenmarket - I was wondering if there is something similar to Avito.  If not, what is a good way for me to get through the site so I can interact with this seller?  I have an account, but it isn't registered under a Russian number.  I have heard sketchy things about Avito (unfortunately), so a trustworthy intermediary would be preferable...if possible.  I know this isn't a cheap item, so I don't want to lose coin to a scam. I've tried searching this item on other sites and I can't find it, so I'm assuming that it is only on Avito.  That being said, it would be immensely appreciated if anybody can find the seller on a more accessible source.  I'm aware that this is a long shot, but I am trying my best to obtain this storied item.  Thank you very much!	1643363303.0	sen682	/r/AskARussian/comments/sen682/need_help_buying_something_off_of_avitoru/	Need help buying something off of Avito.ru - American buyer

kdtfg	Yes, vodka. I know. I'm Belgian. We also have that stereotype but with beer. Ironically the most popular beer in Belgium is Pilsner. A Czech style. And they're good pilsners we have, but not the "best beer in the world". Our Pilsner is about as good as the Czech one (I've been to Prague and pretty much tasted as much different kinds of Pilsner)  In Belgium the beer you want is Trappist beer. That's why our beer is the best in the world, because Westvleteren, Chimay, Westmalle, etc   NOT our Pilsners like Jupiler and Stella. Which are very popular, but not the reason people say Belgium has the best beer in the world. They're not even Belgian style and I've had better pilsner in Prague  But Belgians also drink A LOT of wine. Even though our climate is not suitable for growing grapes. My grandfather used to make wine. If you call it "wine" as it was made from bananas. Because he had a connection in Congo still he'd got old bananas (they were HUGE, much bigger than regular banana) to make his own yeast from scratch (none of that pre-packaged stuff) He insisted on making his wine from fruit to wine, no shortcuts. So he imported bananas to make yeast (this takes several years)  We also like something called Jenever (or Dutch Gin); Although it is as Belgian as much as it Dutch. Predates Belgian independence. The oldest recipe found is from 12th century and from what is now Belgium, but in that time Belgium wasn't a thing anymore/yet  So Russians friends, what do you guys drink? Besides vodka (and if you do, what brands? I like vodka. My favourite brands are Beluga, Russian Standard (€17) & Stoli (€19). But even the cheapest Beluga (€35) is very expensive. All standard 70cl bottles. Cheapest is Smirnoff (€14 or 1217.97 RUB)  How much does vodka cost in your country? And other drinks? A decent bottle of wine (75cl) is about €6 here (522.59 RUB)  I also know of Kvass, but I never had it.

8eidtjdv	Hello,   May I ask you three questions about your opinions of Vladimir Putin?  &#x200B;  1. How would you describe the difference between Yeltsin's reign in 90s, and Putin's reign since the 2000? How has Russian society changed since Putin came to power in 2000? 2. One of Putin's grievances against NATO has been the broken promise to not expand further into Eastern Europe. Do you believe that he has a legitimate grievance, and that NATO has broken their promise? 3. As the threat of war between Russia and Ukraine remains a possibility, it is important to remember that Putin took military action in 2008 to prevent the Republic of Georgia from aligning itself with the West, and possibly becoming a NATO member. How would you describe Putin's actions? How do you justify, or condemn, his actions?   I am writing an article on the Russian-Ukraine conflict for academic purposes, specifically how Russian and Ukrainian Canadians view the conflict. If you are Russian Canadian, would you be willing to provide your first name, and the city that you are in? Thank you for your time.  &#x200B;  Full disclosure. I have posted here before about the same topic,  [https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/s81zik/looking\_for\_perspectives\_of\_russian\_canadian\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskARussian/comments/s81zik/looking_for_perspectives_of_russian_canadian_on/)  Since I did not get as much participation as I would have liked, I have decided to ask more direct questions.	1643491794.0	sfs7s7	/r/AskARussian/comments/sfs7s7/what_is_your_opinion_of_putin/	What is your opinion of Putin

9xcluxkb	To sum up the whole case : in October 2017, former olympic artistic gymnast Tatiana Gutsu accused her compatriot and former olympic-winner gymnast Vitaly Scherbo of having raped her when she was 15.  She claimed it happened in Germany in 1991 while their comrade Tatiana Toropova was present or at proximity and did nothing back then nor defended Gutsu later. Rustam Shapirov, a teammate, was also accused to have known of it without never calling out nor support Gutsu.  There were many backlashes to Gutsu following answers contradicting her claims, from many people in the FSU countries but also :  By Scherbo's mother Valentina :  >*“This is complete rubbish! The most unpleasant thing in this story is that now my son will need to explain himself and, as they say, prove that two plus two isn’t five. After all, to accuse someone after almost 30 years – nothing is easier. And here is the question: did Tatyana Gutsu not have time to give such a “confession” before? Why did she wait? Why did she not give the “news” right after? And now she presents a “sensation”. Of course, the desired effect will be achieved – Gutsu will again be in the focus of media attention. It is much more difficult to clear the name of the one who was accused. What is the point of accusing Vitaly? Perhaps, Tanya, knowing that my son has a business in America, wants to “strip” him of his money? But I’m sure that he will defend his good name.”*   >   >*“What relationship did Vitaly have with Tatyana at the time when they were athletes? Purely friendly. They attended the training camps, competitions together… My son was friends with Tanya and with the rest of the female gymnasts. Perhaps, Vitaly Scherbo raped the whole women’s team? Nonsense! And somehow I haven’t heard any of the other former athletes confirming Tatiana Gutsu’s story.  I think, my son will also speak out in the near future. He will not remain silent when he is dragged through the mud. ”*  By the former national coach at that time Lydia Ivanova :  >*“I do not want to talk in details about this and I think that this unseemly. Either she wants to earn money on this or get media attention, nothing more than that.  It was unpleasant to suddenly hear about it. I’ve never seen any immodesty from this girl before. She was a good gymnast, at the high level. If there is a good, strong training session, what kind of sexual urges can there be? They \[the gymnasts\] would only want to drag their legs \[to their beds\], rest and then go to training again. I have very good memories of the life in sports during the Soviet Union period. The best. Discipline was at the highest level back then.”*  And here are answers from former Scherbo and Gutsu teammates :  Tatiana Toropova :  >*“I want to say that I have no idea about any rape that occurred on my watch. I did not see it, nothing like that happened. They were friendly and that’s it.  I was a kid at that time just as she was. Excuse me, we are athletes! I am sure that there was no crime. We were doing sports, and specifically at that time came to compete, and not, pardon my French, to fuck, right? In general, I can not say anything bad about her or about him.”*   >   >*“I’m shocked! Why would she make such a statement?  I remember that at that time men’s competitions were over, and the women were competing the next day. They \[Vitaly and Tatiana\] came \[to the room where Toropova and Gutsu lived\] to celebrate the competition results. We were just staying up till late! We had to go to bed, and I asked Vitalik to go to his room. Of course, maybe he tried to make out with her a little, but rape? No! I also don’t remember that she was stressed because of something like this happening, honestly. Yes, many years have passed, but rape… No, not with me in the room – nope.”*  Svetlana Boginskaya :  >*“I am very sorry to hear this story about Tatiana Gutsu, breaks my heart to know what she went trough … I am a Woman who will stand up for people i know and care about. One of the people in Tatiana’s story who i personally know for 28-29 years is Rustam Sharipov who i been with in many trips as a gymnast , many shows after Olympics, who personally stood up not only for me but many others who need it help in any situation . Rustam is one of the greatest people i ever met, he is good friend,coach,father and a husband to his wife. I just want to let others know that HE would NEVER stay and do nothing in situation like this.”*  In 2018, Vitaly Scherbo told his was suing Tatiana Gutsu for defamation.  Of course, many articles in western countries wanted to deal with the rape culture in Soviet union / current FSU, implying if we should trust the official datas according to the lawsuits rates, there's almost inexistant acts like this. And some of them went so far implying *only 1 on 3 reported rapes result in a law case*.  Personally I doubt rape rates would be extremely low in Russia or FSU countries but it's easy to be partial towards them when my own country knows similar issues and you learn each day how many reports would be merely put aside voluntarily or not then forgotten if not for the insistance of real victims and their relatives. As I can't overlook the fact some mischievous people have tried to use it as a weapon over someone with the deep consequences it could result.

1zviqa	Serbian actor who apparently made a solid career in Russia and also had a main role in one of the most highly grossing Russian films, Holop.   Back in Serbia, opinion on him is pretty divisive. No one thinks of him as a serious quality actor, and many people think he has been appearing a bit too much everywhere in the past few years, in roles more suited for other actors. But on the other hand, his supposed success abroad has been very respected and there's a picture being perpetuated here that he is some kind of a big shot womanizer star in Russia.  So i just wanted to make some things clear and distinguish his bullshitting from reality.

n8qlnhy	Russia borders near a dozen seas and innumerable  lakes and rivers with plentiful and diverse fish species. Since the time of the founding of novgorod, fishing has been an integral trade of the slavic rus peoples, not to mention other ethnicities in Russia.  Yet, seafood dishes in Russia are surprisingly  few,unpopular and simple compared to french, korean, Scandinavian,  dutch, or chinese cuisines to name a few.  The only complex russian seafood dishes I know are ukha and baked sudak, but those are very hard to find  in restaurants  and very few people eat them.  It's also ironic that  iconic fish in russia such as Okun', whitefish, cod, haddock,sturgeon isn't  cooked much in russian cuisine.   Despite having access to large amounts of crabs, mollusks and shellfish through the white sea and sea of okhotsk, there are few to no russian dishes with crabs, Japan?, octopus or clams.   I'm especially  disappointed  in russian marinated fish. They're all extremely  bland, salty and oily, and aren't as flavorful as Swedish herring in mustard for example, and don't use as many diverse herbs as Dutch and Scandinavian  marinated fish.   Is seafood just not popular  in Russia, or russian cuisine itself doesn't have much of it? Is seafood just too expensive  in Russia compared to say Korea or japan?	1643590364.0	sgnvi0	/r/AskARussian/comments/sgnvi0/why_does_russian_cuisine_have_such_a_poor_variety/	Why does russian cuisine have such a poor variety of seafood dishes?

I’m looking at a particular article on MT that was published in English then Russian. The articles talk of a young non-binary person called Саша. In the English version they are referred to with the correct pronoun of ‘they’ but the Russian omits the pronouns altogether and just refers to them as Саша throughout. I’m just wondering why they have chosen not to use они...is that a choice of the journalist or would that not be how you referred to a gender neutral person...as in it’s not commonplace? I unfortunately don’t know any Russian LGBT people to ask so hoping someone here can shed some lights.   Just to note I am not looking to open up a discussion on what your feelings on non binary people are...I am just interested in wondering if они is used for their pronouns in Russian?

lni5ckt	Hello  I'm originally from the UK. For the life of me I can't seem to find Doner Kebab just like you'd find in Turkey or the UK in Russia. I know you have shawarma - it's not the same, but nowhere sells the Lamb Doner meat that you'd get from Turkish Kebab shops in the UK or Turkey. There must be somewhere that sells this :P  Does anyone know where I can find this in Sochi or St Petersburg?  Thank you :)  https://preview.redd.it/ri8sbhn288f81.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c838b9ec189c641310ac8bcc65be76cdd8192593	1643723525.0	shvfiz	/r/AskARussian/comments/shvfiz/where_can_i_find_lamb_doner_meat_in_russia_just/	Where can I find Lamb Doner meat in Russia - Just like in Turkey?

5bcuqo8p	Also posted on  r/russia.    I attend a creative writing class and they recently told us to write a story within 50-80 pages set in a country that they randomly picked for each one of us, and I was assigned Russia. Now, I've never visited Russia nor I know much about the country or it's way of living, traditions... I was looking for answers online but I'm pretty sure many of them are generic and/or stereotypes. So I thought I'd ask some Russians instead! Here are some of the things I'd need (sorry if they are too vague):  1. What are some known but not too popular cities/locations? And if possible, some background/stories from there? 2. How is childhood in Russia? (kids games, school time, popular stories told to children...). 3. What are some cute but not too popular Russian baby names? And if possible, what do they mean? (for boys, girls or neutral). 4. How are holidays there? How do you (if you do) celebrate Christmas and such? 5. How are homes there, usually? Do more people live in houses or apartment buildings? Do families live together or do kids move out for college/work soon? 6. What are some cool names that people can give their pets? Like, cats or dogs.  You don't have to answer all of them but a little help would be more than enough. If you can provide an answer even if it's just for one of the questions it'd be appreciated. Thank you! :)   P.S: flair might be wrong.	1643740802.0	si24gd	/r/AskARussian/comments/si24gd/writing_a_story_set_in_russia_for_my_creative/	Writing a story set in Russia for my creative writing class, need some perspective and advice!

14mytb	Putin has brought every Russian region under his control with almost all of the presidents of the republics belonging to Putin's "United Russia" party....all apart from the Chechen Republic, an outpost of radical Islam in the middle of Putin’s Russia, why? ill break it all down for you.  So if we look to history then Russia had a huge problem with Chechnya in terms of terrorism all over Russia. Yeltsin could not handle it so Putin came in and offered Akhmad Kadyrov the then head of the republic a deal, Putin showers him in money, weapons, gold, power plus lets him rule Chechnya as he sees fit as his own personal kingdom in exchange for no more wars and no more terrorism or separatism, Akhmad agrees and used the money and weapons provided by the kremlin to smash all other Chechen warlords who were still organizing terrorist attacks on Russia. Things went well until Akhmad Kadyrov was killed, he was then replaced by his son Ramzan Kadyrov.  Under Ramzans control almost all of the Chechen terrorists vanished in Russia. Ramzan then organized a military parade at Grozny football stadium with tanks, bombs and 6000 Chechen troops supposedly according to him "as a show of loyalty to Putin" but in reality this parade served a duel message, it said "My troops are at your command best friend" but it also said "Hey Putin, if you ever stop being my best friend then come and get me if you dare".  On top of that enemies of the Chechen regime disappear no matter who they are and no matter where they are in Russia from journalists living in Moscow to political opponents hiding in St Petersburg all of his opponents have been killed, again no matter where they are in Russia. This means that Kadyrov has his own personal KGB situated all across the entire country that can be activated at any moment further deterring Putin from touching him or his kingdom and keeping the money from the Kremlin flowing in (90 percent of the Chechen budget comes directly from the Kremlins coffers).  Any serious attempt to challenge Ramzan Kadyrov’s position will lead to a third war only this time the Chechens have far more money and firepower provided by Russia itself. Putin created Ramzan Kadyrov and now his creation has grown big enough to look him in the eye.  I hope this has helped you understand why Putin fears the Chechen leader, why he cannot touch him and why the Kremlin pretends that it doesn't see the gay concentration camps and child marriages in Chechnya.

Ukraine is preparing for an attack on Donetsk and Lugansk. And so that it does not work out as in Georgia 08.08.08, the information ground is being prepared to intimidate Russia. After all, if Russia starts defending the DPR, then the whole world will scream - that's it, Russia has treacherously attacked Ukraine. They're trying to tie Russian hands. The Olympiad has already begun. The President of Ukraine has already salted and peppered his tie, just in case.

n1o39kg	I have two questions here.. first of all where do I even go to find information? I can only get some surface level stuff from websites like studyinrussia.ru, and from watching youtube videos. I don’t know where to go to get answers for my questions :/ So, that’s why I’m here.  Second, I read on the studyinrussia website that according to Russian law, universities do not accept transfer students. Which is fine… but the problem is that I have an associate’s degree from an American university. So.. would I need to start over as a freshman and do an entire 4 year bachelor’s program? Or would it be possible to have a year of the preparation courses to learn the language and such, then go into my junior year?   Any advice is much appreciated.

14mytb	Putin has brought every Russian region under his control with almost all of the presidents of the republics belonging to Putin's "United Russia" party....all apart from the Chechen Republic, an outpost of radical Islam in the middle of Putin’s Russia, why? ill break it all down for you.  So if we look to history then Russia had a huge problem with Chechnya in terms of terrorism all over Russia. Yeltsin could not handle it so Putin came in and offered Akhmad Kadyrov the then head of the republic a deal, Putin showers him in money, weapons, gold, power plus lets him rule Chechnya as he sees fit as his own personal kingdom in exchange for no more wars and no more terrorism or separatism, Akhmad agrees and used the money and weapons provided by the kremlin to smash all other Chechen warlords who were still organizing terrorist attacks on Russia. Things went well until Akhmad Kadyrov was killed, he was then replaced by his son Ramzan Kadyrov.  Under Ramzans control almost all of the Chechen terrorists vanished in Russia. Ramzan then organized a military parade at Grozny football stadium with tanks, bombs and 6000 Chechen troops supposedly according to him "as a show of loyalty to Putin" but in reality this parade served a duel message, it said "My troops are at your command best friend" but it also said "Hey Putin, if you ever stop being my best friend then come and get me if you dare".  On top of that enemies of the Chechen regime disappear no matter who they are and no matter where they are in Russia from journalists living in Moscow to political opponents hiding in St Petersburg all of his opponents have been killed, again no matter where they are in Russia. This means that Kadyrov has his own personal KGB situated all across the entire country that can be activated at any moment further deterring Putin from touching him or his kingdom and keeping the money from the Kremlin flowing in (90 percent of the Chechen budget comes directly from the Kremlins coffers).  Any serious attempt to challenge Ramzan Kadyrov’s position will lead to a third war only this time the Chechens have far more money and firepower provided by Russia itself. Putin created Ramzan Kadyrov and now his creation has grown big enough to look him in the eye.  I hope this has helped you understand why Putin fears the Chechen leader, why he cannot touch him and why the Kremlin pretends that it doesn't see the gay concentration camps and child marriages in Chechnya.

Ukraine is preparing for an attack on Donetsk and Lugansk. And so that it does not work out as in Georgia 08.08.08, the information ground is being prepared to intimidate Russia. After all, if Russia starts defending the DPR, then the whole world will scream - that's it, Russia has treacherously attacked Ukraine. They're trying to tie Russian hands.

Спасибо!	1644188489.0	smacii	/r/AskARussian/comments/smacii/как_большинство_русских_живущих_в_россии_смотрят/	Как большинство русских, живущих в России, смотрят на тех кто уехал на запад после развала СССР, или на из детей? Вообще какое отношение к русским живущим за границей?
679ypt	Over where I live on the pacific northwest coast, despite the Russian imports like chocolate bars and Kvass, it's near impossible for me to find Zefir as an import. So I was thinking, why not ask the source of these delightful marshmallows. Because I've only had them once without the chocolate and I for the life of me, can't find them here again. So if it's not too difficult to make them at home. How would I go about it? Because I've been wanting to learn how to make more then just banana bread, brownies, etc.	1644188629.0	smaeiq	/r/AskARussian/comments/smaeiq/is_it_difficult_to_make_zefir_at_home/	Is it difficult to make Zefir at home?
