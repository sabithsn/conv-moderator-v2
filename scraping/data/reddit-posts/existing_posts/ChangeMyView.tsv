6xcqb	I'll preface this by saying I'm a college grad, with a degree from a public university in my late 20's. I'm the first in my family to graduate college, and come from a working class background, with an immigrant parent.   I oppose the cancelation of student debt:  1. 31.2% of Americans over 25 hold a bachelors degree ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/22/new-from-us-census-bureau-number-of-americans-with-a-bachelors-degree-continues-to-grow/?sh=686a87027bbc)  2. College graduates earn on average 30k annually more than non-college graduates.   Effectively, student debt cancellation asks American taxpayers, most of whom do not have a college education to subsidize the education they themselves did not benefit from, to benefit higher income earners. Should a cashier making 35k pay for the college debt of someone making 50k? or 70k? How is this not effectively a regressive tax?  There are public universities in every state that provide a fine education. Between federal grants for lower income households and low(er) tuition rates, the average public school graduate can leave school with modest debt, or debt free. (My tuition as an in state student was 6k/year and rose to 7.5k/year by graduation). This isn't always accessable to everyone, and I realize that, but the average in state tuition is not out of reach for the average American family. I can't shake the feeling that the advocates of debt cancellation are disproportionately the graduates of expensive, second-tier private colleges that provided no better of an education than a public university, for which they borrowed heavily to attend because they wanted the textbook "college experience", paid 200k for it, only to realize their somewhat unmarketable degree was not able to generate the income needed to repay that debt.   I DO support free public college for all, as well as debt forgiveness programs for government service or teaching, etc, but I can't get behind what seems to be a regressive tax to subsidize the poor decision making of higher income earners.

8tah12m8	People often equate being able to cry when their loved ones die as a form of love and empathy, but think about it, are you crying out of “empathy”, or for yourself only?   If you truly love them and care about them, you can see that they’re in a better place with no more pain and suffering. Or if you’re religious, you May wasn’t k believe in eternal life in heaven which is full of joy (for them, not you on earth)   Children who cry over a parents death are sad because their parent is no longer there to provide them with what they need. It doesn’t have to be money or food, could be emotional support and time spent together. They’re not thinking “my mum is in a bad state now, I feel bad FOR HER”, no, they are thinking “i want my Mum to be here so I can taste her cooking again”.   People who cry after breakup are sad because they want their boyfriend to still be beside them, giving them the attention they like. They don’t feel happy when their ex boyfriend is happy. Same goes for death of a significant other. People are not happy that they’ve gone to live a happier life elsewhere, just sad that “I cannot get the affection and attention I want”.   Any counter examples where grief is beyond just “me me me”?	1642395977.0	s5vmg8	/r/changemyview/comments/s5vmg8/cmv_people_who_feel_grief_and_heartbreak_when/	CMV: People who feel grief and heartbreak when they lose someone they “love” are selfish, because it’s all about THEIR LOSS, not about the feelings of the person leaving them.
13skb5	The pandemic and prior self reflections made me come to this conclusion. Whenever I ask teachers why some students are failing in school - pre university - the most common answer is that students home environment explain students performance. In other words, schools have little impact on a student achievements. It’s their home environment and their genetics that drive performance   This study [linked here](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1266643.pdf)seems to validate what I heard.   The homeschooling industry often presents statistics that homeschooled students do better than public school students, like [here 1](https://admissionsly.com/homeschooling-statistics/), or [here 2](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/)  If schools are indeed not adding much value, everyone who can afford to homeschool should be encouraged to do so. If you can’t afford that, the public system should quickly split kids based on ability as early as the 3rd grade so that kids who are predisposed to succeed do so, and other kids are babysat accordingly. Additionally, since schools don’t add much value, we might as well have 50 kids per teacher and reduce taxes.  I’d love to be convinced otherwise. I’d love to be convinced that schools play a key role on someone’s academic performance. I know it is a provocative opinion but I’d love to get good arguments to go against my point of view here.   PS: I’m willing to hear all sort of arguments but I’m more concerned about academics   Thank you!	1642396418.0	s5vr8l	/r/changemyview/comments/s5vr8l/cmv_primary_and_secondary_schools_are_essentially/	CMV: Primary and Secondary schools are essentially babysitting centers
1gl8ozs3	I have plenty of people draw certain parallels to real life of the stupidity of whether it be: the mundane or political, or generally an attempt to be amusing to the movie of Idiocracy.   It annoys me, that say a person points to the Former POTUS and criticizes or jokes about the pinhead sentences or actions he does, they say, "well, it is Idiocracy" or "we are at Idiocracy". No, that guy claims this, but also this in order to flare up tensions. That isn't something to disregard, that is *fascism*.   If somebody does something stupid on say a public street, whether irl, or on reddit, there is at least one comment that says something to idiocracy. Nooooo, that guy is or was in a certain way, high, mentally ill, etc. Yes being stupid could be described as an action or characteristic, but it is not proof for some arbitrary parallel that we are at or moving toward a Satirical Movie.  Most of the time, it comments on the government or politics. In which I say, do you think theres a difference of *playing* dumb to have a higher political leverage, or *being* dumb. 90% of the time, it is *playing* to score political power.   I know there are some "winners" like that one represenative from colorado who married a very unsavory person, but the person im talking about didn't win idiots, they won over exploiting those peoples feelings and "ism's".   We have to stop thinking that people are naturally stupid when we see the news, or somebody on the front page of reddit. It is not comparable to mid-2000s movie, we actually have a lot of people who are completely complex, with complex motivations, with complex relations and lives. Some people are playing stupid, some are, and some aren't.   Whatever the news or statements say, it is done for a purpose, and it isn't because what we perceive as stupid, it is done for something much deeper (most of the time).	1642408577.0	s5z79k	/r/changemyview/comments/s5z79k/cmv_no_we_arent_living_in_a_idiocracy_or_anything/	CMV: No, we aren't living in a Idiocracy or anything similar to that.
9u3vm	On August 29, 2020, Aaron "Jay" Danielson was ambushed, shot and killed in Portland. Shortly thereafter, there was [celebration in the streets](https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1299960350226358272?lang=en). As one person joyfully explained to the crowd, the man who had died was a member of the opposing protest group. Someone they believe deserved to die. They crowed cheered when they said that "the community had held its own and taken out the trash".   The attack on Aaron "Jay" Danielson is part of a long pattern of unprovoked attacks on conservative leaning, pro-trump and anti-Black Lives Matters protesters. *  Consider [this case](https://twitter.com/mrandyngo/status/1267003300131385348) where a man was sucker punched for standing on a street corner with an American Flag. I've had sever personal exchanges with left wingers I know personally, and on Reddit saying that he had it coming to him. How he should have 'read the room'. How he should have never been there, that his mere presence there to register his opposition was an example of 'fucking around and finding out'. The man who punched him never faced charges.   * Consider [this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUd-PQLMujg). In Minnesota, a truck driver narrowly avoids hitting a crowd as speed, apparently surprised to find the highway blocked in front of him. The crowd pulls him from the truck with shouts of 'kill him' and is beaten so badly so as to require hospitalization. The Truck driver is the only one to face criminal charges from the incident, and media widely describe this as a vehicular ramming attack.   * Consider [NPR's softball interview of the author of 'In Defense of Looting'](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting) where the author defends property destruction and theft as not just a protest tactic, but a net benefit to the world.   * Consider the left-wing claims about Kyle Rittenhouse. That he was somehow a white supremacist. That he had a moral obligation to allow his attackers to beat him to a pulp.  Consider the mockery of his tears on the stands.   * Consider [this piece](https://theintercept.com/2021/05/13/riot-squad-right-wing-video-journalists-black-lives-matter-antifa/) which condemns conservative media efforts to cover riots and suggests that violence against those producing such content has been brought about by their own acts in cover the riots, offering only the tepid condemnation of violence possible in the process:  > Violence against journalists, even ones operating in bad faith, is inexcusable. Unfortunately, videographers like D’Almeida have contributed to an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust, making assaults on journalists more frequent. And this has also made the work of scrupulous and fair reporting on the politics that plays out on our streets much harder, and more dangerous.  I think that this attitude is common among the folks who actively identify themselves as 'leftists', to the point that I think that the majority of self-identified 'leftists' and even many mainstream democrats would approve of not only our dear activist's words but the killers actions. Moreover, I believe that they would actively support further acts of unprovoked violence. **To put this another way, the Democrats and leftists want me dead, or at least beaten to a bloody pulp so I learn the lesson to not engage in political activism again. **  I believe this for a few reasons:  1. There has *never* been an unequivocal condemnation from DNC leadership, nor from any notable ideological thought leaders on the left about any of these cases. Sure, there were Biden statements condemning 'the violence', but never mentioning the political identity of those doing the the violence. Given that the very same people didn't accept Donald Trump's 'bad actors on all sides' condemnation in Charlottesville, I'm not going to accept similar statements from the other side.   2. In cases where there is a statements by a left-wing politician on the subject, they always include language that blames either the victim or the right more broadly for the violence.   3. There has been many cases where even relatively mainstream folks have been openly welcoming of such violence. We've gone from 'punch a NAZI' to 'punch a High school kid in a MAGA hat' with some pretty frightening speed.   Things that will not change my view:  1. "But the right..." Yeah, I know there's thugs on the right too. They don't get the kind of institutional cover that the left-wing thugs do. There's no right-wing version National Lawyer's Guild coming to bail out right-wing thugs (and fund Terrorist attacks, but that's another decade).   2. "But someone did condemn all the violence..." Not good enough. They have to condemn their side explicitly and without mention or comparison to their opponents in these kind of cases.	1642410833.0	s5zse7	/r/changemyview/comments/s5zse7/cmv_mainstream_democrats_and_the_mainstream/	CMV: Mainstream Democrats and the mainstream American left generally either supportable or indifferent to left-wing violence in the US
c8ay6	It could be argued that capitalism is already a form of feudalism, though that argument would require a fairly loose interpretation of the term.  It seems to me that capitalism is really an evolution of feudalism.  Instead of serfs providing labor to a lord that owns capital in return for security, justice and redistributed resources, capitalists divorce themselves from their subjects' needs and accumulate capital, eschewing responsibility for the care of their laborers, only redistributing resources (in the form of wages) as necessary.  As consolation for the lost security, anyone with means may count themselves amongst the capitalists which dulls, but does not eliminate, issues of class in society.  It may seem like small consolation for anyone that lacks the resources to join the capitalist class, but privately-controlled cryptocurrencies threaten to erode even this basic privilege.  Recently, some savvy corporations are being tempted by the successes of Bitcoin and the NFT economy (and, let's be honest, giftcards) to begin exploring the idea of selling digital products, including proprietary currency, to customers.  Among them, the Gap and Walmart have begun the process of filing for patents and trademarks to secure early-adopter status in the metaverse market.  They're openly exploring this new way to make money, and I see this going one of three ways.  1) Their attempts are ultimately rejected by the public.  Bland but unlikely.  Buying Walmart-bux wouldn't be too far removed from buying a giftcard, or digital tokens as seen in oh-so-many videogames these days, so I don't see the public being outraged by the idea.  2) It is successful in some iteration (if at first you don't succeed, try, try again) and the government decides to regulate cryptocurrency markets.  This is far more likely, but I'm not sure if government would put its foot down and outlaw businesses creating currency out of nothing, or just set up firewalls to prevent decentralized cryptocurrencies from threatening the dominance of "legitimate" currencies ("legitimate" being those that are created by government or legal corporation).  3) It is successful and because of calls for liberty and freedom, the public will encourage their representatives in government to leave its regulation to market forces.  This is where I see things going wacky.  At some point, maybe in 50+ years, one of these corporations is going to insist that they will no longer accept any currency but their own.  You'll be able to do a currency exchange with reputable outfits, or through the stock market.  But they won't be taking government-issued moneys any more.  Naturally, employees will be compensated at least partially with their employer's play money.  At first, it'll just be seasonal bonuses.  But one day it'll creep into wages.  And at that point we're back to feudalism, but lacking security, justice, and now even redistributed resources or the ability to join the capitalist class.  Cuz they'll be paying folk with something they invented out of thin-air and can create on-demand and not even people with means will be able to create a competing cryptocurrency, because the mega-corporation won't accept it.  Dun, dun, dun!  So I'm looking for responses that assuage my concerns.  I  dunno: convince me that private-cryptocurrencies can't be a thing because of some technical reason.  Failing that, explain why crypto will ultimately be a good thing for mankind.  Show how the obsolescence of "the peoples' currency" (government-issued notes) will lead to a better, fairer, and ultimately more robust society.  Or just convince me that private fiefdoms dominating international markets isn't like feudalism.  There's lotsa ways to tackle this one.	1642419732.0	s6253d	/r/changemyview/comments/s6253d/cmv_if_corporations_successfully_launch_their_own/	CMV: If corporations successfully launch their own cryptocurrencies and NFT products, a system that more closely resembles feudalism will result.

4zu8u	I think that camping in (shooter) games is perfectly OK. For some reason it’s considered to be an unholy sin to lay in wait for another player. I think it’s absurd for a few reasons;  1) gameplay balances almost everything out. There are trade offs for most elements of games. If you pick a long range weapon you’re not going to have rapid fire. If you pick a strong character you might move more slowly. etc. These calculated trade offs are incorporated into the fabric of the game.  Likewise there is a cost/benefit with camping. Perhaps you get fewer absolute kills but a better K/D ratio, which brings me to the next point  2) Different games have different tactics. Camping may be appropriate for certain games/certain conditions. For example, having 2 of 3 locations in Domination. The effective tactic is to hunker down and hold the 2 locations (ie “Camp”). Let the opposing team come to you, get killed, and you maintain advantage by maintaining position. It’s akin to having a large lead in football and running the ball....it’s situational. Under those conditions the way you play likely (should) change.  3) which relates to a larger point....your job is to frustrate/surprise your opponent. Why in goodness name “should” you run out to meet your opponent on a “fair” battleground? If they want/expect a battle in open field, you fight them in the trees, if they want to battle on horseback, you run them into a marsh, and so on. “Come fight me where I expect in the way I expect” doesn’t hold much weight with me.  (Perhaps that last point undermines the notion that camping is considered wrong in video games. Perhaps the vocal minority complaining about it are simply expressing their frustration at being outwitted).	1642437639.0	s68an8	/r/changemyview/comments/s68an8/cmvcamping_in_video_games_is_ok/	CMV:Camping in video games is OK
62kyxam2	For the record I wish I was in this system.  Grades K-4 are the same everyone is in the same institutions. After which time your performance is tested and your overall grades or test scores put you into one of 3 school systems.  **Hauptschule or Basic school**- which continues till 9th or 10th grade and then graduates them. Its for people who performed under satisfactory in Reading/German (English) and or Math.  **Realschule or Satisfactory secondary education** This goes beyond what they teach in tier 1 and people are finished at 11th grade and graduated. This is for people who performed satisfactory in both Reading and Math.  **Gymnasium or Advanced** These are for students who performed Proficient in both Reading and Math and they go through the full 12 years and have a chance to get into University and beyond.  The reason I would have prefered this is I would have been in Tier 1 due to being almost illiterate (couldn't read or spell for shit) until 8th grade, would have been finished at 9th or 10th and been able to start working without attempting college and failing and not wasting years I didn't need to.  **Why I think this is the best system** is because it puts children schools teaching at their level. The top students get the education they can handle without being board as the teacher slows down for the rest. Those in the middle get taught at their pace those as the bottom are taught their pace.  The percentages of who make which are about 55% tier 1 34% tier 2 and 11% tier 3.	1642438843.0	s68rqx	/r/changemyview/comments/s68rqx/cmv_the_united_states_should_switch_to_the_german/	CMV: The United States should switch to the German school system.
4denqooa	I’m a 26 year old guy and I haven’t dated anyone yet. Someone mentioned I should just date a single mother. I personally wouldn’t want to date a single mother because she already loved someone else. She loved someone else enough to conceive a child with him at one point, and I think I wouldn’t be loved as much as he was/is. If I got into a relationship with a woman who already has a child, I feel like I would always be competing with her ex. Plus I don’t like the idea of raising a child that isn’t mine. That we didn’t create together.  I was discussing this topic with a friend and he provided a different perspective: single mothers 9 times out of 10 despise the father of their child. He changed my view somewhat, but I’m still thinking that that hatred was admiration at some point.  Because I haven’t dated anyone, I just want a woman who has the same relative experience that I have. I want to be someone’s first option. Maybe it’s because I’m young and haven’t had any experience that I feel this strongly about it. Anyway, am I wrong for wanting to date a woman who doesn’t have kids?

7wq79cx1	TW// disordered eating/eating disorders  I'm not saying that dieting is a bad thing in and of itself, just to clarify, but I do think we desperately need to take a far more nuanced view, especially in the face of mainstream media. Having so much focus on the extremes of being overweight or underweight perpetuates disordered eating, especially as long as mainstream media and companies continue to promote and make a profit from it. Generally speaking, as long as you eat balanced meals and exercise frequently, you should be fine.  However, I may be misguided in calling diet culture toxic because there is obvious evidence that we must consider the extremes when the extremes are present. However, I think the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in general are almost as, if not as, dangerous, and it has become almost as big as an issue as obesity. I wish more people would treat it as just as important.  Lastly, though I don't have an eating disorder or disordered eating myself, this is an issue I feel is very important to me, but I don't want to speak over anyone who has or is struggling with one and their lived experiences. If that is the case ever in either this post or my replies to any comments, please point it out and I will shut up as and when it is necessary to do so.	1642449936.0	s6debi	/r/changemyview/comments/s6debi/cmv_dieting_culture_is_toxic_because_it_shouldnt/	CMV: Dieting culture is toxic because it shouldn't be so much about whether you are fat or thin, but whether you are healthy for your body weight.

Then during the dry season that overgrowth catches fire. Good job nature!  Boring tunnels under the Sierra Nevadas will let us pipe excess water into the eastern slope. From there it will evaporate and meander into the parched West. Arizona Nevada Utah etcetera will get increased rain allowing greening of the deserts.  Start the tunnels about halfway up the west face of the Sierras. Slope them down to emerge out the eastern face 2/3 the way down. Collect water in giant bins on the western face and let gravity do all the work sending the water to the eastern face.

11sm4p8v	The argument against "race fishing" to my understanding is that, minorities sometimes get made fun of for certain features, while there's the assumption that those same features are praised when white people appear to have them. This is something that people of color feel unhappy about, not every minority feels the same way about this as everyone has their own experiences and personalities, but it is reasonable and valid to be upset about this. It is undeniably unfair.  Some people feel saddened by this (I'm one of those people), and others feel envious to the point where they want to prevent "white people" from granting themselves these certain features. It's the "I don't have it, so neither can you" mentality that is toxic and pointless. It's a mentality that has ridiculous implications.  When it comes to envy, it should never be anybody's job to make sure that you're not envious of them. This whole "race fishing" idea implies that minorities can't face their own envy, and it's a white persons responsibility etc. to make sure minorities are not envious of them. Do white people hold themselves to this low standard too or do they only hold minorities to that standard? Isn't that weird?  This inherently bad trait that some people in have in general is excused in this instance as if minorities aren't capable of dealing with it themselves. Hence, the idea of "race fishing" unintentionally perpetuating bigotry of low expectations towards minorities.  The reason why there's not this unanimous agreement when it comes to this topic between minorities, is that just like white people (obviously) minorities are individuals, with their own personality types and experiences.   Not everyone in general has the "I don't have it, so neither can you," mentality. It seems like the people that have the most extreme and insane positions have the loudest voices.  When it comes to the issue of minorities being discriminated against because of their natural features, instead of calling out random people just because they have lip fillers and a tan, or calling out people because they did their eyeliner a certain way... How about calling out the schools banning certain hair styles? (This is actually a real problem that exists but nobody is talking about!) or apply pressure to make sure certain facial features are represented more? etc.  This whole "race fishing thing" really is just an excuse for certain women that people don't like to get bullied via body shaming... really disgraceful if you ask me. I've also been seeing mixed people or racially ambiguous people getting called out for simply existing... because people think certain features can only be ascribed to certain races. so cringe.

131xqs	My argument is very simple:   1. If someone sincerely believed that Christianity is true, then Christianity would be the most important part of their life.   2. If Christianity were the most important part of someone's life, they would (at a minimum) attend church on a weekly basis, be more familiar with basic Biblical teachings than atheists, and have an evangelistic conversation in order to share their faith with a nonbeliever at least once a week.   3. The overwhelming majority of people who profess Christianity [do not attend church on a weekly basis](https://sci-hubtw.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00288.x), [atheists generally outperform Christians](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/07/23/what-americans-know-about-religion/) in tests of religious knowledge, and [about 1 in 10 churchgoers (10 percent)](https://www.godreports.com/2019/04/most-churchgoers-rarely-share-their-faith/) average at least one evangelistic conversation *a month*.   4. Therefore, to whatever extent that Christians should place Christianity at the forefront of their lives, the overwhelming majority of people are not sincere Christians.   5. An extremely insincere Christian is not actually a Christian, just as someone who does not believe in Islam is not a Muslim, and a person who does not believe in evolution is not someone who believes in evolution.   6. Therefore, American Christians are extremely rare.   **Response to Objections**  **You may counter:** how can a Christian be insincere if they do not believe in **2)**, that church attendance is expected of devout Christians?   My response is that a) there is strong evidence (see the paper I linked) that Christians lie about their church attendance, implying that they know better, and b) a sincere Christian would read the Bible enough in order to understand that [church attendance is strongly advocated in the New Testament](https://www.gotquestions.org/church-attendance.html).  Pew Research Center conducts a religious knowledge test which heavily emphasizes facts about monotheistic religions any Christian should know. On the test, *all* Christian denominations underperform atheists. Moreover, according to Pew, "Among Christians, knowledge of the Bible and Christianity is closely linked both with the amount of effort respondents say they invest in learning about their faith and with their religious background. Christians who say they regularly spend time learning about their own religion (for example, reading scripture, visiting websites, listening to podcasts, reading books or magazines, or watching television) answer more questions correctly about the Bible and Christianity than do those who say they make such efforts to learn about their faith less often."   What this means is that religious ignorance is a choice Christians make because other things are more important to them than the study of scripture.   **As for church attendance,** I think it's fair to say that, during years with high church attendance, Christians are more sincere; during years with low attendance, they are less-so. This is because I would expect sincere Christians to view their faith as the most important part of their lives, and the least such a person could do is attend church for an afternoon every week. That being said, do Christians generally do that today?   In one study published in 2005 by the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, it was found that if you correct self-report measures (where 40% of Americans claimed to attend on a weekly basis) by checking them against attendance reports by the churches themselves, just 22% of Americans attend weekly. That is, when Christians told the National Social Survey how often they attended (where one is required to actually name the church or synagogue), researchers can take a random, representative sample of reportees and track down which churches they claimed to attend.   Then, they can do head counts or ask for bookkeeping and estimates from church administrators, which results in severely deflated figures. When we account for the fact that many of these attendees are going to be the children of the reporting families, the percentage is likely even lower--probably much lower.   I think this methodology is actually very forgiving, considering that it allows church leaders to report the total weekly congregation size before subtracting that from the National Social Survey reported total, rather than ensuring that the same people attending one week are the same people the next week (if we corrected for this, perhaps it would be much lower; I will call this the "continuity" problem below), and 2) because, when they created their own estimates, they allowed the inclusion of children above the age of 5. What percentage of your congregation is made up of children? A quarter? A fifth?   The reason this matters is that, broadly speaking, I doubt children attend church services because of their belief in Christianity. They attend primarily because the kinds of parents who are sincere enough to attend weekly probably just take them to church. I'm not saying that they don't believe; only that, when trying to assess the effects of religious belief on church attendance, it's best to look at people who attend church when they have other options readily available, as most adults do. Recall that these are numbers on 2005 church attendance; if you share my belief that Christianity has declined significantly since then in the United States, you may also think that the numbers are even lower.   If want to hazard a wild guess, I'll say the percentage of Americans who attend church with ready alternatives available to them (adults), after accounting for the continuity problem and the fact that a significant proportion of church congregations is probably made up of the children of visiting families (and, remember, religious people have larger families), is around 12-15%. What do you think?  **As for faith sharing,** [evangelism is so emphatically urged by the Bible,](https://www.gotquestions.org/why-evangelize.html) one would have to have never picked up a New Testament and read three pages in either direction ever in order to miss this. Note that this is Biblically mandated, even if one does not believe in the doctrine of Hell. However, how much worse must it be to be a Christian who *does* believe nonbelievers are punished with infinite suffering in the afterlife, but fails to regularly share their faith? If you believed an eighteen-wheeler was on a collision course with your friend, at a *bare minimum* you would be expected to shout "get out of the way!"   There are five criteria we apply in order to gauge the sincerity of someone's beliefs:  **Explicit avowal:** Ask a person whether P is the case. If they say “yes”, that’s a sign that they believe P. If they say “no” or “I don’t know”, that suggests that they don’t believe P. (Slight variant: ask a person whether they believe that P.)  **Grounds:** Typically, if S believes that P, S will have some justification for P that S could explain, and vice versa. For instance, if Jon is standing in front of a table, in plain view, his eyes are open, he isn’t blind, etc., then you can pretty well assume that Jon believes there is a table in front of him, even if he hasn’t said anything about it. At the same time, if there is no porcupine in front of Jon, you can pretty well assume that Jon doesn’t think there is a porcupine in front of him.  **Implications:** Typically, if S believes that P, then S will believe the reasonably obvious and direct implications of P (including implications that follow when P is combined with other things S believes). E.g., if Jon thinks there is a porcupine in front of him, then he probably thinks there is at least one animal nearby. If Jon doesn’t think there are any nearby animals, then he probably does not believe there is a porcupine in front of him.  **Behavior:** Typically, if S believes that P, then S will perform the sort of actions that would make sense if P were the case, or at least not do things that would be wildly irrational. For instance, assuming Jon is not suicidal, if Jon drinks from a glass of water, one can assume that Jon does not believe that the water is poisoned.  **Emotional reactions:** Typically, a person will have emotional reactions that would be apt if their beliefs were correct. For instance, if Jon believes that his child was just killed, then Jon will be distraught. If he isn’t, then he probably does not believe that.   I have noticed that Christians generally only exhibit the first criterion: they avow their faith in words. On all four other criteria, however, I think a clear case can be made (such as the one I gave above) that Christians do not behave in the ways one would reasonably expect them to if they really believed it.   With respect to "Implications" and "Behavior," Christians show little interest in knowing more than nonbelievers about their religion's theology and cultural heritage, in sharing their faith with nonbelievers, and in attending church despite strong biblical prescriptions to do so. Regarding "Emotional Reactions," I will incidentally add that Christians are bizarrely afraid of and bereaved by death, even though they should regularly express excitement and forward-looking enthusiasm about the infinitely positive experience of heaven, and familial loss is the best thing that will ever happen to one's Christian loved ones. Sure, a momentary separation (a flicker in the eternal time-scale) is a little sad--but there's a difference between grieving over a friend's annihilation and their departure to a cruise ship. Despite this, I have never met a Christian who was a least a little bit excited to die, and I have never met a Christian who was unusually resilient after losing a loved one.   Furthermore, when it comes to Christians who believe in Hell, I notice that few seem upset by the whole thing. I mean, presumably most of the people one sees in their everyday lives is going to suffer infinitely for all of eternity for the finite sins committed within this life; where's the sense of urgency and, dare I ask, panic? Wouldn't it be a little traumatizing if you genuinely believed that your pizza deliveryman, for example, was going to be kidnapped by a serial and brutally tortured and executed in his basement? In the same way, if we are taking Jesus and the Apostle Paul's words to the early churches seriously in the New Testament, we should expect most humans to suffer estrangement from God.   > “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few” (Matthew 7:13–14).  > Someone asked Jesus, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” He replied, “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able” (Luke 13:23–24).  Also, where's all the Christian martyrdom?   > Jesus said, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (Luke 9:23–24).  Concerning "Grounds," Christians are quick to show fluster when asked the most basic questions about their beliefs (i.e. "why do you believe you will survive your bodily death?"). Imagine someone saying "I believe that evolution is true, but for no particular reason that I can explain--I just feel it in my heart that I should think so." What I would suspect of such a person is that they are merely claiming to believe in evolution for social rewards, since they are not comfortable with producing reasons for their belief.	1642458165.0	s6gr8u	/r/changemyview/comments/s6gr8u/cmv_american_christianity_is_generally_insincere/	CMV: American Christianity is generally insincere, and therefore extremely rare
as7q913	The legalisation of drugs in sport may be fairer. People do well at sport as a result of the genetic lottery that happened to deal them a winning hand. There’s even genetic tests to identify those with the greatest potential for success in sports. Example, in track and field, If you have one version of the ACE gene, you will be better at long distance events. If you have another, you will be better at short distance events. The same goes for bodybuilding and powerlifting, if you’re genetically predisposed to hold more muscle mass you will perform better than someone who isn’t.

4z7z5zzc	I’ve been thinking about cultural theories and criticism a lot and the more I think about it, more I come to conclude that theres nothing wrong with consuming escapist media.   The world is crazy out there, so a Marvel or a Star Wars movie presents to me a story where everything goes just fine. Why would anyone NOT want that or think that theres something wrong with wanting to escape.   I never bought Adorno’s theory that every piece of pop culture is inherently bad. I think that these films and games and books may be lowbrow, but they are what we want.   At the same time I understand that some highbrow films and books can make us more empathetic.

b0n6x1uw	There seem to be two prevailing opinions here-- the one I stated in the title, and the idea that whoever asked the other out ("Hey, do you want to go to X place on Y day?") should pay for both parties. There are a few people who think the man should pay everything no matter what, but they're a minority and this isn't r/FemaleDatingStrategy, so we won't spend any more time on that.  No one owes me anything just because they asked me to go out. If we're dating, and we're doing so with the intention of possibly being together eventually, we're both in this equally. I want to be there on the date just as much as you, no matter who asks who out. My time and effort is no more valuable than yours-- I'm not doing you a favor by showing up even though you asked me out. We're in this together. Neither of us is more valuable than the other. This is mutually beneficial.  Why should one party pay for everything when the goal for both of us is to go out together eventually? It's not like it's some radical idea for one person to ask the other to meet up for coffee or a meal, or one person would be content to never go out when the other person desperately wants to go out.  That being said, communication is also where many people err in this situation. Every conversation should go something like "Do you want to go X place? Is that within your budget?" If it's not, pick a different place. If they don't want to spend any money at all, do something that's free. If you can't agree on who should pay or anything like that, move on, you're probably not compatible.  This also avoids either party feeling like they've been taken advantage of, or that they owe the other person anything, which is a major problem on both sides.	1642470138.0	s6l5lw	/r/changemyview/comments/s6l5lw/cmv_in_dating_before_an_official_relationship_is/	CMV: In dating, before an official relationship is agreed upon by both parties, all dates should be split 50/50, no matter who asks who out
mwrtr	I see consciousness not as a/non-person dichotomy, but a spectrum from very simple minds to us on the far end (who knows if there are even more conscious aliens?). Pigs and chickens are very smart, and have a certain amount of emotional intelligence. Here's part of an article from Mercy for Animals:  "From anticipating future events to recalling the trajectory of a hidden object, chickens are incredibly smart. They even possess self-control, holding out for a better food reward, and can assess their own position in the pecking order—both characteristics of self-awareness."  https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/chickens-are-intelligent-and-sensitive-so/#:~:text=From%20anticipating%20future%20events%20to,both%20characteristics%20of%20self%2Dawareness.  If I remember right, pigs, too, are smarter than some human children. In my opinion intelligence alone, other qualities of near-sapience notwithstanding, makes many animals deserving more of respect than predation. They're too much like us.

gw92lk27	If you're not familiar with the black pill, it's basically a belief that looks are everything and that nothing matters as much as your appearance. In the eyes of black pillers if you're not a 7-8/10 your life is basically over. There are women who have swallowed the black pill, but most black pillers seem to be men.   My problem with the black pill, aside from how damaging it can be to one's psyche, is that I think it spits out hypotheses which cannot be disproven and then uses the fact that nobody can disprove them to argue for their legitimacy. For example, a black piller might say women only love Chad (very attractive man.) Somebody else will say "well that's a lie because I've seen attractive and unattractive women with unattractive men" to which the black piller responds "that's because they're rich" or "he's an orbiter" or "they aren't a couple" or any number of other things. Things which, notably, nobody would know.   If somehow a black pill detractor does know a lot about a relationship, the black piller will typically respond with "well then that's the one woman in the world like that." It doesn't make sense, but it's highly unlikely that the black pill detractor is going to have many more examples to disprove that. My issue isn't that the hypotheses are difficult to disprove, my issue is that they're set up that way. It seems to me like you can apply the black pill to any situation and find some possible explanation that supports the black pill.  If the black pill were correct, it would still be a very dark philosophy about the world, but at least it would be true. But I question many of the claims black pillers make, especially when they're hostile towards and dismissive of counterevidence.  Do I believe life is easier if you're very attractive? All else being equal, probably- although being a very attractive man or woman with social anxiety might not be fun. But do I believe life is over if you're unattractive-no, I don't. But I'm open to changing my view if the evidence suggests I'm wrong.  Edit: After thinking about everything some more, my view on this subject has been changed. Thank you to all who responded!	1642472506.0	s6m0bo	/r/changemyview/comments/s6m0bo/cmv_the_black_pill_is_an_overly_cynical_view_of/	CMV: The Black Pill is an overly cynical view of the world that goes to great lengths to protect itself from criticism-like some critical movements.

6nua1	I don't understand what stay at home parents do once their children are old enough to go to school, in my opinion *you simply do not require a full-time person to manage and clean a house*. Before you say things like "I do the washing, I cook dinner, etc" - this doesn't take 8 hours a day, you can do all of these things while also having a part-time job. Hell, you can do this with a full-time job!  The opportunity cost of not working is huge:  * You could setup your family and children's financial future instead of spinning your wheels at home. With compound interest, that extra 20-40K per year will be worth hundreds of thousands by the time you retire. * You are setting yourself up to be financially dependent on another person. If the relationship falls apart, suddenly you don't have the skills or experience needed to support yourself. The way that alimony works in some places means your partners "reward" for supporting your sedentary lifestyle is to continue to support you after you break up. * It's simply unfair on the working partner, the division of labour is skewed. One partner works full-time to support the family, while the other partner does far less. it's not the 1950's anymore, both partners can and should be contributing towards the maintenance and upkeep of the house, including the emotional labour.	1642476172.0	s6n9sv	/r/changemyview/comments/s6n9sv/cmv_stay_at_home_parents_with_kids_who_go_to/	CMV: "Stay at home parents" with kids who go to school are just lazy

4akx077	**I say this for a number of reasons, as an avid (former) user of Goodreads who would come across inaccuracies on author profiles as an almost daily occurence:**  \#1) Authors and publishers are the copyright-holders of the works themselves, not Goodreads or Amazon, and to that extent, they would know their own work better than anybody. The GR moderators (called "Librarians") often butcher the accuracy of book metadata records based on whether or not a title was ever listed on Amazon. They don't check copyright registries, they don't check to see who listed the book on Amazon in the first place, and they don't check to see if there's any context as to why a title should be removed. If it has an ISBN and was ever sold on Amazon, they consider it valid.  \#2) Self-publishing has muddied the waters too much. There are self-published authors who assign ISBN numbers to rough drafts of books, self-published authors who plagiarize books, and situations in the past where self-publishing companies released unpublished books prematurely against the author's wishes due to mere technical errors (which could start another whole argument in itself, but I digress)... there's no possible way for any Goodreads Librarian or Goodreads staff member to be able to determine what makes a book record an accurate book record anymore.  \#3) Goodreads is the primary search result that arises in most cases on web browsers, unless an author is famous enough to generate better search results first, like an official webpage or a properly catalogued resource.   \#4) Goodreads gets a lot of its records from user input and Ingram/Amazon, and only some from reputable sources like The Library of Congress or WorldCat. Ingram will bring in anything with an ISBN, and sometimes doesn't even spell the titles or author names correctly.  \#5) Goodreads itself deletes and segregates book records for arbitrary reasons all the time, and it would cause to great social ill to give authors the same power over their own works. Goodreads is a social metadata website, not a bookstore or a library, and metadata can be subject to change for various reasons. Unlike Goodreads, which will delete/segregate books for the purpose of outright censorship (see "The Turner Diaries"), there's really no reason for an author to do this, except for the purpose of having some control over invalid/inaccurate information. An author whose book is already common knowledge *can't* really hide its existence anyway, and so authors could at least keep their records accurate with more power to do so.  \#6) It doesn't serve Goodreads or Amazon to have a bunch of inaccurate/false data stored on its servers. If the goal is to accumulate metadata for readers, why would Goodreads want it to be so flimsy?   \#7) Goodreads clearly can't manage its own data inaccuracies anymore. The Librarians Group and contact support links to staff are oversaturated with requests pouring in from both readers and authors to fix up bad metadata, and it's left to the discretion of Goodreads and these moderators to remove it.  \#8) Goodreads will continue to display deadnames against an author's wishes. This is in spite of Amazon's other big metadata acquisition, IMDb, allowing people like Elliot Page to change their name on all metadata records after coming out as transgender, and there's no reason why Goodreads can't do this, too.   **TL;DR: The only reason these giant book metadata platforms are allowed to get away with displaying bad metadata is because no class-action authors' collective has challenged them on it. Goodreads makes Wikipedia and Fandom look like university-grade secondary sources.**	1642485780.0	s6qdax	/r/changemyview/comments/s6qdax/cmv_goodreads_should_allow_authors_to_delete_book/	CMV: Goodreads should allow authors to delete book records from their author bibliographies, or at least segregate them to the Goodreads "NOT A BOOK" page.
s0gom	A little bit of set-up before I begin. I'm 28 years old (M) and I've never held a job in my (thus far) useless life. I also didn't go to college (due to how astronomically costly it is here in the US) and I still live with my parents, but desperately want to move out as soon as possible. All that said, let's begin.  I'll now discuss the basis of why I hold this view. It has to do with the fact that employers value candidates who have marketable skills. In this department I'm at an immediate disadvantage. That isn't because I don't think I have any skills (I certainly do). Since I've never worked before, I have no evidence that I can point an employer to. Without said evidence, I have no hope of convincing an employer to hire me. In addition, my lack of job experience, which I can't explain away, doesn't help at all. I don't know how teenagers manage to get jobs despite being in the same position as me. Many of the people I see working service jobs near me are the aforementioned teenagers and college age people. Very, very rarely do I see anyone older than that. Yes, I know that age discrimination is illegal, but that doesn't mean businesses don't try to do it anyway.  I also have what I can only describe as "performance anxiety." Typically that term is applied to sexual situations but I think it fits my situation with respect to jobs. I just don't know if I could meet a boss's expectations enough that won't be fired in a week. I'll be expected to hit the ground running and I don't think I could do that. Intertwined with this is that I'm socially awkward, making it impossible to even pass a job interview.  I could go on but I think you get the picture. If you were a employer/hiring manager, given all that I've described above, would you hire me?	1642486549.0	s6ql36	/r/changemyview/comments/s6ql36/cmv_no_employerhiring_manager_would_ever_touch_me/	CMV: No employer/hiring manager would ever touch me with a 100-foot pole

I've never had a period cramp but blue balls is horrible mainly bc it lasts a long time, a few seconds would be nothing. and sharts are more of a betrayal than actual irritation, as long as you can run to the bathroom it's more about the embarrassment and cleanup.   no- i submit that for the brief few seconds that you cannot sneeze and you know it's not going to happen - those are intense. purgatoric if not hellish. I maybe succeed inducing a real sneeze from a false sneeze 1/100x , which makes it worse tbh.   the only silver lining i can think of is that false sneezes at least make you appreciate how satisfying real ones are, but i appreciate orgasms without ruining them and farts without false ones.    so idk man, this will be a hard one to change tbh, good luck.   edit: words   edit: apologies to the differently abled. i meant to include that i meant only the most shared human experiences of bodily functions, didn't mean to feign ignorance to the pain of those with diseases/injuries or provoke a battle of the sexes.	1642487734.0	s6qx4p	/r/changemyview/comments/s6qx4p/cmv_that_feeling_you_get_when_you_start_to_sneeze/	CMV: That feeling you get when you start to sneeze but then can't is the most irritating bodily function in existence for a few seconds
g8azu	Towards the end of the previous administration after Donald Trump's election loss, Nancy Pelosi sought assurance from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the exiting president would not be able to use nuclear weapons in the interim period before he was replaced by Biden. While General Mark A. Milley sought to reassure her, and planned around the possibility, he may not be able to do so in the future. This, paired with Trump's pattern of grandstanding about the US nuclear arsenal, increasing tension towards China, and his resistance to any sort of external control, makes me worry that should he become President again, he will make a pre-emptive strike on a perceived enemy of the US (most likely China) and, in doing so, endanger the county and/or world through nuclear armageddon either via retaliatory destruction of economic centres within the United States, mutually assured destruction, or nuclear winter.

No. A tiny bit of research shows that he has a PhD in *theology*, this was never specified, yet I see the same video circulating quite a bit around the internet (between anti-vaxxers) because he was called "Dr.", anybody that doesn't do research would therefore assume that he has some sort of medical or at least scientific background which is not the case.

2gs3lqse	People end decade long relationships over sexual affairs, but there are worse, more insidious types of cheating as well. If you are going behind someone's back, and hiding substantial information, distorting the truth, it's cheating and that person has gone dark. Nobody will be safe with someone who is comfortable subverting situations into his or her own advantage. Real cheating is dishonesty. Real cheating is calling someone "mine" and then turning around and giving priority access to (i.e spending your birthday with) someone else. That is a morally corrupt decision to deliberately distort reality and disrespect the person's best intentions and is worse than sexual cheating.  If you are giving someone else more compassion, understanding, sympathy, time and attention, it's cheating. Making another female feel like she's got a chance is cheating. If they end up receiving more of your emotional resources that's even worse than a one-off physical affair or a mistake in the heat of the moment. If they get priority on special days it's cheating. If they start feeling like you're into them it's cheating.

ewngos3d	Basic geometry and algebra? Sure. But in my opinion, focusing entire sections of mathematics on advanced algebra and geometry means you’re learning a section of mathematics 90% of us will never use again, and that’s replacing mathematical functions that we should be learning and might be of good use to us down the line.   If you want to do maths at a higher level, pick it at a higher level where you *will* learn advanced algebra and geometry.  As far as I’m concerned, these subjects should be minimised. If you have an exam of let’s say 30 questions, no more than 4 total should be on these two subjects. The rest should be things like advanced multiplication/division applied to real world problems, like finance, appreciation/depreciation, taxes (incremental rates on different numbers within the same sum to get those marginal rates), mortgage rates, fractions, etc.   If you can’t find a common, real world application of a mathematical problem, save it for third level education. Kids will get their share of algebraic & geometric calculations in physics & chemistry class anyway.   Addressing the argument of “most subjects aren’t applicable to real life, should we drop those too?”: No. maths is a core, generic subject meant to be a basic necessity. Those other subjects are elective and exist to give you some freedom to pursue subjects that you’re either good at or interested in. Elective subjects (more focused subjects you choose) should, by definition and necessity, be more focused to the subjects as a vocation. But maths and English are core, mandated subjects meant to instil the basics because these are both seen as essential to functioning in society. If the basis for teaching something is “you NEED this for the real world”, why would you teach anything other than problems that have real world application?	1642511180.0	s6x4ce	/r/changemyview/comments/s6x4ce/cmv_theres_no_good_reason_to_learn_advanced/	CMV: There’s no good reason to learn advanced trigonometry, geometry or advanced algebra before third level education
5n84017l	Like all of it. The combined value of all the worlds inclusive wealth, and taking it and redistributing it to every single person on the planet.     I  did the math, comes out to about 1.625 million a human.     There is approximately US$ 40 trillion in circulation: this includes all the physical money and the money deposited in savings and checking accounts.  Money in the form of investments, derivatives, and cryptocurrencies exceeds $1.3 quadrillion.

151v1k	Like the title says, i belive microsoft buying bethesda and now activistion/blizard is a possative thing.   If you look at what happend in 2021 with gaming it was mostly a blood bath for AAA titles. look at battlefield for example, it wasnt ready but they release it anyway to get the christmas launch and most companys are like this, in contrast look at halo infinite the game wasnt ready for there launch window before christmas so they pushed it and its a great game.  Last year the only good big games released were made by microsoft and for a long time now we have been on a trend of release it at a time where it will make the most sales then wory about how the game is broken after.  I think that AAA titles were going to die when everyone realised that there just going to be released and not be playable for a few months or more, but microsoft seems to be the good guy when it comes to big titles, not being affraid to push it when they need to and when it releases its in a playable stait.  Before i get the comments saying im a xbox fanboy and all of that, no i play pc with 2 mates on playstation and i used to be on playstation aswel.  So change my view microsoft buying a bunch of AAA companys is a posative, maybe cod will become good again.   I wana add aswel that i garuntee that the activision/blizard offices will become a much better place for women to work because if your not aware there has been many sexual harrasment cases buried by the bosses of the company and that came out recently and microsoft wont want that image as part of there company.  So even if the games dont change at least the prick will be gone.	1642520779.0	s70h80	/r/changemyview/comments/s70h80/cmv_microsoftxbox_buying_a_bunch_of_aaa_game/	CMV: Microsoft/xbox buying a bunch of AAA game companies is a posative thing.
p4kou	"Autonomous" because I'm considering a future when self-driving vehicles become cheaper and more reliable (hence the future tense), and because many women are still harassed/assaulted by taxi/Uber drivers. "Taxis" doesn't refer literally to taxis but to an Uber-like service that may be operated by the government, as those "taxis" are better than personal cars for the person not needing to own or drive it and because they don't require as much parking space (as they roam around the city making trips instead of staying in a parking lot all day). "Local" because trains, buses, water vessels and airplanes (depending on the trip) will still be better in transporting a lot of people from one city to another. "Transit" means buses, trains, trams, monorails, streetcars, subways and other public vehicles designed to transport a lot of people at once. "Almost" because transit is still better in carrying efficiency: one bus carrying sixty people takes up less space than twelve cars carrying the same amount of people (although cars doing commutes are rarely at full capacity, so more than twelve cars). Bringing up transit because cities can't handle everyone using light personal transportation like bicycles, skateboards and scooters (abbreviated as LPT from now on).  \- Elderly and disabled people: some of these people can't walk a few tens of meters between the transit stop and the final destination/trip start. And some can't drive nor ride LPT either. When self-driving technology becomes reliable, self-driving cars will become a lifesaver for elderly and disabled people who can't have a car and can't walk between the bus stop and the places they are in/want to go. Much of this CMV is because of this point because it can't be solved with LPT  \- Diseases: sharing the same vehicle with a lot of strangers may risk transmitting some respiratory diseases. In the current circumstances, this is a huge deal. Because of those diseases, people end up buying cars for safety. Autonomous public taxis (alongside the forementioned LPT) would be preferred to transit by some people during the next pandemic (if they can't work from home, of course). It's not very common for transit to be the focus of mass infections (as long as everyone takes the necessary precautions) but someone must win the lottery.  \- Women: women aren't inherently incapable of taking transit, but there are two issues many of them face in public transit: sexual harassment and sexual assault. Frotteurism, unwanted stares, unwanted sexual comments, and even guys literally ejaculating on women are issues a lot of women face in transit. Subways and intraurban trains deal with it with women-only cars but if a city's only transit option is the bus, many women will prefer taking a car or LPT.  \- Convenience: cars access more places than transit (although not as many as motorcycles, helicopters, LPT or simply walking), so most people would prefer a car over transit. Transit is good for commuting, but recreational trips may be an issue depending on how much the "ticket" costs.	1642524690.0	s71x5m	/r/changemyview/comments/s71x5m/cmv_autonomous_taxis_will_be_better_than_local/	CMV: Autonomous taxis will be better than local transit in almost every way.
4jd1qejv	Many people make a list of reasons for why going to an easy to get into school is a better option than attending a prestigious school. I rebut the common points (by the way, I classify prestigious or hard to get into for schools with below a 50% acceptance rate) —  • “Going to a public state school saves money.”  This is the most common argument and while I understand why people may think this, there needs to be more research done. I am in a state with no prestigious colleges and only three public schools that accept anyone with a pulse. I applied and received a scholarship from them, but I found out that most private colleges that are hard to get into would give me a full ride just because we make less than 80k after taxes. It also starts at a sliding scale for incomes above that. It simply takes a google search to find out colleges that meet full need based aid.  • “Prestigious colleges are too far from home.”  - I live in a rural town, and the closest four-year colleges are actually closer to me than my state ones, they are also prestigious. This is anecdotal though, so in general people should check out which colleges are near them instead of defaulting to close ones that are easy to get into. Additionally, living on campus or nearby helps you be more independent, which is needed for when you start life after college. Grants/scholarships cover housing costs.  • “Education at all colleges are the same.”  - Most fields value prestige, the only ones that I’m aware of that don’t really are a major common for the pre-med track (undergrad) and computer science. However, even for computer science, being a student at a prestigious university allows for more companies to pick out students to recruit for internships. Most other fields do take into account for the overall school. For some fields like finance, prestige is absolutely the most important thing you need in a college. Aside from that, professors and students at top colleges are generally more interested in being there because of the environment with a bunch of productive brains working together. Many non-prestigious schools have a low graduation rate, so many of the peers you started with won’t even be there to work with in your last semesters of college and it could be tougher. Since it is harder to get into some colleges, the students typically don’t drop out because they aren’t overwhelmed by college due to their rigorous HS experience or they don’t want to lose out on a prestigious title once they graduate. The starting salaries at grads from prestigious colleges are much more than easy to get in to schools. There a few exceptions to prestige with rankings, for example Purdue overall has a high acceptance rate but the engineering program has a very low acceptance rate and is top-ranked.  Overall, if you have the opportunity to attend a prestigious school, you should do it because it is better than attending a big state school that lets in anybody that put in no effort in high school. In my experience, people who say who going to an easy college and a prestigious one are the same are people who are jealous and don’t want to accept that their peers are going to be more successful, so they say that to make themselves feel better.	1642545800.0	s7a53g	/r/changemyview/comments/s7a53g/cmv_attending_a_more_prestigious_school_is/	CMV: Attending a more prestigious school is virtually always a better idea than attending an easy-to-get-into school
5co25j2h	This came to mind with Disney and now again with Microsoft’s acquisitions.  First off, there are for sure bad monopolies. Like if an electric company controls all the power lines and they have no competition, then they can shoot up the price and in our society we are sufficiently reliant that we would sort of have to just deal with it.  Disney has bought a ton of different studios like Marvel, Fox, Hulu, and Pixar. Which in America especially we’ve been taught monopolies can only be bad. However in an entertainment industry, I just don’t see much wrong with it.   Like Disney has more access to marketing dollars, but with access to the internet and reviews they still have to make good content for people to go see it. Then you have indie films while there are awareness barriers to entry, as a consumer I can still choose to watch indie films if Disney wasn’t giving me what I want.  Now I realize that the word monopoly might not fit for Disney or Microsoft. I more so use it because it gets thrown around every time there’s a new acquisition. But in a world where they bought any studio that popped up, I can’t really see any negative ramifications for consumers.	1642550584.0	s7bz5j	/r/changemyview/comments/s7bz5j/cmv_monopolies_in_industries_that_dont_have_a/	CMV: Monopolies in industries that don’t have a high barrier to entry aren’t necessarily bad.
c3l3v	First of all, I'm not a covid denier. I'm fully vaccinated and boosted, and wore a mask in public, indoor settings until the vaccine was universally available.     That said, I'm extremely skeptical that COVID-19 causes long-term symptoms more than any other viral illness that can cause a post-viral syndrome. The primary symptoms include (but are not limited to), fatigue, brain fog, GI issues ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html)), which are the exact sort of non-specific symptoms commonly caused by anxiety or depression (as a sufferer of somatization since well-before COVID, I'm pretty familiar with this, and don't belittle people who suffer from it).     I've done research using PubMed, PLoS and my university's library, and I can't find anything explaining why COVID is more likely to cause a post-viral syndrome than other viruses. I can't find much that even seriously asks the question of whether there is a psychiatric etiology. I do frequently see Eric Feigl-Dings apparently outlandish claims about long covid, including today's "airborne HIV" claim.     So, change my view. Convince me that long-covid is more often than not a unique post-viral syndrome that is unlike and more severe than those caused by influenza, Epstein-Barr, etc.	1642554614.0	s7dfmx	/r/changemyview/comments/s7dfmx/cmv_most_but_not_all_cases_of_long_covid_are/	CMV: Most (but not all) cases of long covid are psychosomatic
95y0cp71	I literally just don't understand how these two separate identities could coexist in one. I've been having discussions with others about it, but I'm struggling to actually get their perspective without things getting volitile. If the definition for bi lesbian, for example, is a woman/woman-aligned person who is attracted to multiple woman-aligned genders, isn't that just a lesbian? And how on earth does a straight lesbian/gay make sense? I just really want to make sense of why someone might identify this way, because with my understanding of the terms gay and lesbians it means exclusive same-gender attraction which does not conflate with multigender attraction.

4jd1qejv	when i first saw fully online degrees for positions like nurses and physician assistants, i was confused about how they exist. i’m not talking about the ones that require students to attend clinical and labs, but the ones that are totally on a computer watching videos and stuff.  real life experience is crucial for these students to gain a firm understanding of how to apply their knowledge to patients. while reading information is useful to gain knowledge, it’s not useful if you get a job and have no idea how to use it. personally, i would not visit a healthcare professional who never had any in-person training because it simply seems too unsafe to have someone work on my body parts with no hands-on training and potentially do some medical malpractice.  the lack of human interaction is also a pitfall with fully online programs. these allied healthcare professionals need to talk to different kinds of patients constantly on the job and a lack of communication irl is not going to help with that, much like the issue with students in general lacking social competence after being online for so long.  Another potential drawback that is sometimes applicable is that some of these fully online schools are for-profit, which most employers will take as a scam education and disregard the “degree” in the first place.

6v6b3	Basically, the title says it all. I truly believe Tobey Maguire is the best Peter Parker. While I go back and forth between Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland being the best Spiderman, I don’t believe anyone could convince me that Tobey’s Peter Parker is not the best  The go-to argument is always that Tobey’s Peter was weak and a crybaby, but that’s exactly what I think makes him the best. The juxtaposition between mild-mannered Peter and confident web-slinger is so clear with him. Garfield barely changes his personality when he puts on the suit. He’s way too cool and confident as Peter. Other than spouting some science babble, we barely even see that he’s intelligent.   And with Tom, he’s nerdy and awkward, but there’s so much charm in him. He had friends who love him and crave his company. Everyone gets upset when he leaves the math team. He’s loveable and his peers respect him.   This isn’t Peter Parker! In the comics, Peter is a loser who gets dumped on constantly. People look through him. People don’t respect him. That’s why he gets to live out his altar ego as Spider-Man.   I’m looking forward to hearing some opinions and hopefully changing my view.	1642558733.0	s7ev67	/r/changemyview/comments/s7ev67/cmv_even_if_not_the_best_spiderman_tobey_maguire/	CMV: Even if not the best Spiderman, Tobey Maguire is the best and most faithful Peter Parker
632m9lwu	When I say the "in-person" equivalent, I mean specifically approaching someone in-person and flirting with them/asking them out, most likely in a bar, park, or some other such setting.  One of the biggest advantages of online dating is the fact that it's a space that's designated for making romantic (or sexual) connections; when you log onto Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, Bumble, PoF, etc., you essentially know exactly what everyone else is on there for. If someone wants something (that they assume to be) beyond the norm, it's easy enough to add it in a profile (i.e.: no hookups, just looking for friends, nothing serious, etc.).   Meanwhile, meeting people in person and asking for a date/showing your interest in someone requires a lot of "cold-calling;" approaching people in the hopes of scoring a date when they're just trying to live their lives. I've read that women hate the feeling that they can't move about in public spaces without some guy hitting on them. This leads to anxiety and fear, as many men don't gracefully accept rejection.   Of course, not everyone looking for a date and/or relationship does so through so-called "cold-calling." In fact, one of the advantages of in-person dating is that it allows for prior relationships and exposure in a way that online dating cannot. But from experience, I know that having a prior friendship with someone doesn't make it any more likely that they'll be open to dating you; in fact, I've found it to be quite the opposite. When someone enters into a friendship with you, it isn't predicated on the belief that they'll ask you out down the line. They might not have any interest in being anything more than friends with you, so if you make it known you want more, even if you back off, it can cause undue strain on the friendship. Again, it's a problem of two people expecting different things, leading to anxiety and grief.  Thus, I find online dating more ethical because you aren't putting undue anxiety on stress on someone who doesn't want to be romantically approached. Online dating's more ethical because almost everyone on a dating site is there for the same thing, unlike in a bar.  And to be completely clear, even as someone who thinks online dating is a lot less awkward, unethical than the alternative, I hate it, so I'm very open to the idea that it's not as black-and-white as I believe.	1642562642.0	s7g6hr	/r/changemyview/comments/s7g6hr/cmv_online_dating_is_more_ethical_than_the/	CMV: Online Dating is More Ethical than the In-Person Equivalent
qotaigt	There's this test that has been done on different kids every year from 2011 that measures their IQ. It's about 650 kids that are tested, and a [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261846v1.full.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=4_TDkskPZpMQ6tBUwcm0xQIhLnkb6RNrE4oKkDCIHvU-1642565765-0-gaNycGzNB2U) tabulated these results on a graph.

gk12urbh	Hey guys! One of the common "unpopular opinions" on Reddit is saying that you don't like/support neopronouns. I believe that there is not problem with them and the degree that they are "forced" on people is overexaggerated. I will go down the list of common objections to neopronouns and give my opinion on why the argument is BS in my opinion.  &#x200B;  **It's not a real word/grammatically correct**  This is the weakest argument in my opinion, it assumes that language is some static thing that will stay exactly the same now and forevermore, when it's simply not true. Language changes as new concepts need to be expressed and the current words don't do it, or if groups of people are separted fro a long time. The english of the 1700s is still readable to modern speakers, but is subtly in a LOT of ways. And frankly the standards for being a "real" word aren't that high anyway, I mean if "D'oh", an entirely fictional word invented in a cartoon can be in the Oxford Dictorary, I don't think adding neopronouns is a huge stretch  **It ain't broke, don't fix it**  This argument basically states that they/them is good enough for LGBTQ+ people so we don't need neopronouns. I disagree because they/them is too vague. Is "they" 1 person or a group? There is also not "formal" version of they/them like he/she have sir and ma'am. Neopronouns make pronouns for LGBTQ+ people more in line with the more specific he/she instead of the somewhat vague they/them.  **It's too obsurce**  This is another very weak argument in my opinion, it basically claims that LGBTQ+ people are so rare that it doesn't make sense to dedicate a whole word to it, my objection is that a LOT of obsurce words exist that nobody is clamering to say aren't valid. In fact iirc english has the world's largest vocabulary, I mean when was the last time you said idk "balter". Does it's obsurity mean that it should be cut from the english langauge?  **It's too inconvienent**  This argument claims that neopronouns are basically too difficult and inconvienent to use so we shouldn't use them. This is pretty BS in my opinion. The average person reading this post has a vocabulary of around 20,000 to 30,000 words, and adding 1 more isn't really *that* difficult. And frankly if it's too inconvienent for you to take 5 minutes out of your day to learn a simple set of words to address someone properly, that's kind of a personal problem in my opinion.  Anyway, Please CMV on why neopronouns are bad!	1642566881.0	s7hlem	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/	CMV: There is no problem with neopronouns
7utgomtn	I believe some people are more selfish than others and that is why we can’t solve for inequality. If everyone had access to food and a comfortable home all the time, I think many people would coast when they could contribute more.  People who work harder deserve more. Homeless shelters should be the base line. And then if you want to work harder, standard of living goes up from there. So we will never solve poverty.  I definitely want someone to change my view on this because I feel like a bad person. But my leftist friends seem to think everyone is equally selfish and there is no evil in the world.

4b0aw5oa	I rate myself near C1 after studying the English language for more than a decade. It has been a truly remarkable journey, especially seeing how far I progressed. As such, are there any benefits to dedicate another year or so to reach C2? It would be quite an arduous task since I would need a strict regimen of reading and writing on a daily basis.  It is already a massive undertaking forcing myself to read a couple chapters of a book every night, let alone release a writing sample and ask for feedback. Would you say that most people can get by in the U.S. with just C1 proficiency, or would they need to aim for C2 if they want a high-paying office position?  After sending out copious amounts of job applications for a government position, many of which asked for a writing sample, I have started to see dramatic improvements in my English writing skills. From what I have heard, many applicants detest a writing sample requirement in job applications, so quite a few would avoid these positions outright. That gives me an advantage because I see writing samples as killing two birds with one stone. I get to improve my writing skills while having a higher chance of scoring an interview.  English skills are important, and my views had been reinforced after seeing how poor many people write, even at a professional workplace. This is the reason why I am redoubling my efforts to strengthen my literary vocabulary and sentence structure in my writing.  That being said, I am still pondering whether to commit the time and resources to reach C2, which is considered to be god-level of English proficiency. Can I even do it alone? Would I need academic precision to achieve such a daunting goal?   There are so many questions currently on how to proceed.  I had worked with many Chinese immigrants during my last two years of employment, and they are quite situated with their current level of English. I gauged their English level to be a high B2 to low C1, and they mostly have plateau due to lack of effort or motivation to improve.	1642570591.0	s7iqch	/r/changemyview/comments/s7iqch/cmv_for_a_foreigner_there_is_little_benefit_to/	CMV: For a foreigner, there is little benefit to investing the amount of time and effort to get their English level to a C2 level.
4wxs10iy	I believe most political issues are too complex for the majority of people to understand and weigh the pros and cons properly. I’d say this for politics on a federal level and probably even at a local level to a lesser degree (In the US at least).  For example, lots of political conversations revolve around the economy but I’d wager most people have a very basic understanding of economics. This is likely true of many topics such as military spending, health care, etc.  Additionally, a substantial amount of  media personalities engage in rhetoric to market ideas to you, so it’s easier than ever to be manipulated into taking a position on a topic that you don’t fully understand.  With limited understanding how can we be expected to know how much money the government can afford to spend, what impact military spending may or may not have on preventing or causing war, etc?  Now this may seem like an appeal to futility, and perhaps it is, but idk how we can possibly expect good societal results from a population that doesn’t understand issues or the costs associated with the strategies we use to deal with them.   I have never voted and have bounced around different political ideologies the last several years so I’d like to think I’m open minded.

9hmvwt6z	As you might know, there's a bit of an issue with insider trading in Congress. Until 2012, it wasn't even illegal since congressmen were government officials and not official corporate insiders.  But it's not just insider trading. In fact, it's probably not even the biggest issue. The real issue at hand is the conflict of interest. If Congressmen are concerned with how their stocks are doing, they may be deterred from passing any kind of regulatory law which will affect them, making our country a bit closer to a corporatocracy. Presidents are expected to put their assets into blind trusts upon taking office to avoid conflicts of interest.

Even here on Reddit there is loads of people passing judgement about how roma's are thieves and lazy bums sitting at home, living off welfare while popping out kids (see any similarities of this stereotype to the "welfare queen"). Seriously if you replaced "roma" with "black" with some of this stuff, it would fit right in place at a KKK rally! To my understanding this is a very common attitude, especially in Eastern Europe, personally I find this disgusting and quite hypocritical consider these are often the same people who are very quick to pass judgement on America's race issues. I knew a roma person once and I can attest to the fact that roma's need help and support, not discrimination! Please CMV!  EDIT: I've conceded the point about hypocrisy.	1642580594.0	s7lekd	/r/changemyview/comments/s7lekd/cmv_the_discriminatedhatred_of_roma_people_in/	CMV: The discriminated/hatred of Roma people in Europe is disgusting and hypocritical
h1bqrq2y	**Full CMV: Service Workers and anyone who interacts with the general public for a living should be able to rate customers or anyone that receives service and those with higher ratings should be entitled to special discounts, benefits, perks etc.**   Ok, I know how this sounds, but please hear me out.   I've worked as a service worker most of my life in somewhat rough neighborhoods and have experienced a slew of abuse from customers. From what I hear from other service workers in my industry (retail) and across other industries, customer abuse is a significant and systemic problem. A lot of the "customer is always right" culture gives too much power to the customers and often time troublesome customers can aggressively complain and lead to the termination of staff who really weren't at fault in the situation. This can turn the work enviornment hostile and uncomfortable for those that work there, possibly leading to workers leaving and a decrease in productivity.  What I'm proposing is that companies should opt into a third-party system or create their own system that tracks worker satisfaction with particular individuals that interact with the company. In other words, services workers get to directly rate their customers similar to how ride-sharing app drivers can rate riders. (however, I'm not entirely sure whether riders who have lower ratings pay any penalties or whether rides that have higher ratings gain any benefits)  At first, this system should not penalize bad customers but instead reward consistently well-behaving customers who are also frequent shoppers/diners/customers. This wouldn't be too far from how some department stores already work where they reward dedicated/loyal customers. The only difference is that customer conduct in-store will also be an avenue of earning more rewards.    I think this best use case for this would be either in fast food, restaurants and hotels, where customer/worker interactions are likely more frequent, repeatable and often used on a wide scale. For example, a customer who wants to stay at a Marriott hotel could get a lower rate if they have a history of proper conduct at past Marriott hotel stays. Proper conduct could be defined as, leaving the room they last stayed in relatively orderly, being kind/getting a good rating from how they treated room service, tipping the valet, etc, and would likely be defined by the company or worker representatives in the company.  Eventually, the system should grow large enough to the point where customers with low reviews could be charged penalties/extra charges because of the inherent risk they could pose to workers and property. Businesses should be able to outright refuse service to anyone with a score that is too low or has too many low ratings.   Before going forward: I want to be clear on some limitations,   * this should ***not*** apply to essential services like healthcare, groceries/food items, water/electricity, cable/internet services etc. This extends to pharmacies as well. * This should ***only*** apply to luxury services such as restaurants, bars, luxury hotels, resorts, cruise ships, luxury car dealerships, retail, flying planes etc.  * This system should also ***not*** be government-mandated, government-sponsored, or government-endorsed in order to avoid any issues with freedom of speech/association issues.  * Workers' ratings should be given the same weight. No worker's rating should matter more than the other in order to keep rating's more fair * There should be limits to how far your rating can fall in a day (or over a given time period)    * Alternatively, consecutive negative ratings should be weighed less (for example, if you recieved two 1 star ratings within a short period of time, the second 1 star rating should be weighed less (affect your overall score less) than the first 1 star rating) * Positive ratings should weight slightly more than negative ones * Ratings cannot be done outside of a strictly transactional context, i.e, only when you are interacting with a worker directly to make a purchase, or request a service etc. * Workers cannot make any changes to their ratings once they are submitted * Each worker rating is anonymous to prevent retaliation from customers.  * You, as a customer, can directly view comments and reviews about yourself, and you also have the power to leave reviews about your own customer experience (this is already a thing, we have yelp and google reviews). * Your rating should increase overtime naturally if you go without incident for a long time.  Benefits:  * This will give workers more power to decide which customers are worth dealing with and which ones aren't. * I hoping this barres some customers from certain places and creates classes of customers by their social conduct by enforcing/promoting pro-social behaviors. * It will create certain classes of people: those who largely engage in pro-social behavior with employees and those who don't. I see this as a good thing or at least a relatively normal human behavior. [We already seek to punish certain anti-social behaviors](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/help-with-anti-social-behaviour-for-social-housing-tenants/help-with-anti-social-behaviour-for-social-housing-tenants) (and I don't just mean crimes). * This type of social policing system could very well help keep other well behaved customers safe. For example, people who protested wearing masks at resturaunts (at the resturarunt they tried eating from) would be effectly banned from the premises or have to pay a lot higher prices for a while after until their behavior changes.  * It can benefit companies because workers who feel safer and are happier with their job are less likely to leave and are more productive. This can help increase the bottom line for companies.  Possible Cons and my responses (based on when I pitched this idea to a couple of friends):   * **"It's just like that episode of Black Mirror."**: There are a couple key differences.     * Employee customer interactions are the only context in which either person can be evaluated. You can't just downvote a stranger for the hell of it. Employees can only rate customers that they have interacted with. This also includes anti-social behavior on the premises of an establishment (if possible).    * Secondly, the effects of your rating (at first) are limited to the company/industry that you interact with. Your rating at Marriott does not necessarily correlate with your rating at Wyndam Hotels (eventually it should -- but at first this won't be the case) * **"It's totalitarian social credit system!":** It's a social credit system, but it's not totalitarian as it isn't built on rules passed down from a central governing body. This is not going to be implemented by the US Congress, nor should it be. That would be a clear infringement on our rights/liberties.  * **"It's a social credit system"**: Yes, what of it? This type of social credit system is just a reflection of how much of humanity already rewards pro-social behavior and penalizes anti-social behavior. It quantifies it, narrows the context in which judgement can take place, and protects workers at the same time. I think the hump for those who use this argument is that now they don't have to speculate about their social value, it's right there on display for them to see. * **"It will only create another avenue for inequality."**: Yes, and it should. Those who engage in pro-social behavior with employees of certain companies should be rewarded. Those who don't (ie cause loud disruptions, anger, physical violence, or general aggressive behavior) should be punished/barred from certain luxury places, or recieve less because of their behavior.  Conclusion:  To be honest, I'll probably have my view changed one this, but as someone who's worked in customer service, and knows plenty of people who had to deal with anti-maskers/vaxxers over the past two years, this type of social enforcement would definitely help curb bad behaviors in public and make people a lot more polite.

6xcqb	I'll preface this by saying I'm a college grad, with a degree from a public university in my late 20's. I'm the first in my family to graduate college, and come from a working class background, with an immigrant parent.   I oppose the cancelation of student debt:  1. 31.2% of Americans over 25 hold a bachelors degree ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2021/02/22/new-from-us-census-bureau-number-of-americans-with-a-bachelors-degree-continues-to-grow/?sh=686a87027bbc)  2. College graduates earn on average 30k annually more than non-college graduates.   Effectively, student debt cancellation asks American taxpayers, most of whom do not have a college education to subsidize the education they themselves did not benefit from, to benefit higher income earners. Should a cashier making 35k pay for the college debt of someone making 50k? or 70k? How is this not effectively a regressive tax?  There are public universities in every state that provide a fine education. Between federal grants for lower income households and low(er) tuition rates, the average public school graduate can leave school with modest debt, or debt free. (My tuition as an in state student was 6k/year and rose to 7.5k/year by graduation). This isn't always accessable to everyone, and I realize that, but the average in state tuition is not out of reach for the average American family. I can't shake the feeling that the advocates of debt cancellation are disproportionately the graduates of expensive, second-tier private colleges that provided no better of an education than a public university, for which they borrowed heavily to attend because they wanted the textbook "college experience", paid 200k for it, only to realize their somewhat unmarketable degree was not able to generate the income needed to repay that debt.   I DO support free public college for all, as well as debt forgiveness programs for government service or teaching, etc, but I can't get behind what seems to be a regressive tax to subsidize the poor decision making of higher income earners.

8tah12m8	People often equate being able to cry when their loved ones die as a form of love and empathy, but think about it, are you crying out of “empathy”, or for yourself only?   If you truly love them and care about them, you can see that they’re in a better place with no more pain and suffering. Or if you’re religious, you May wasn’t k believe in eternal life in heaven which is full of joy (for them, not you on earth)   Children who cry over a parents death are sad because their parent is no longer there to provide them with what they need. It doesn’t have to be money or food, could be emotional support and time spent together. They’re not thinking “my mum is in a bad state now, I feel bad FOR HER”, no, they are thinking “i want my Mum to be here so I can taste her cooking again”.   People who cry after breakup are sad because they want their boyfriend to still be beside them, giving them the attention they like. They don’t feel happy when their ex boyfriend is happy. Same goes for death of a significant other. People are not happy that they’ve gone to live a happier life elsewhere, just sad that “I cannot get the affection and attention I want”.

13skb5	The pandemic and prior self reflections made me come to this conclusion. Whenever I ask teachers why some students are failing in school - pre university - the most common answer is that students home environment explain students performance. In other words, schools have little impact on a student achievements. It’s their home environment and their genetics that drive performance   This study [linked here](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1266643.pdf)seems to validate what I heard.   The homeschooling industry often presents statistics that homeschooled students do better than public school students, like [here 1](https://admissionsly.com/homeschooling-statistics/), or [here 2](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/)  If schools are indeed not adding much value, everyone who can afford to homeschool should be encouraged to do so. If you can’t afford that, the public system should quickly split kids based on ability as early as the 3rd grade so that kids who are predisposed to succeed do so, and other kids are babysat accordingly. Additionally, since schools don’t add much value, we might as well have 50 kids per teacher and reduce taxes.  I’d love to be convinced otherwise. I’d love to be convinced that schools play a key role on someone’s academic performance. I know it is a provocative opinion but I’d love to get good arguments to go against my point of view here.   PS: I’m willing to hear all sort of arguments but I’m more concerned about academics   Thank you!	1642396418.0	s5vr8l	/r/changemyview/comments/s5vr8l/cmv_primary_and_secondary_schools_are_essentially/	CMV: Primary and Secondary schools are essentially babysitting centers
1gl8ozs3	I have plenty of people draw certain parallels to real life of the stupidity of whether it be: the mundane or political, or generally an attempt to be amusing to the movie of Idiocracy.   It annoys me, that say a person points to the Former POTUS and criticizes or jokes about the pinhead sentences or actions he does, they say, "well, it is Idiocracy" or "we are at Idiocracy". No, that guy claims this, but also this in order to flare up tensions. That isn't something to disregard, that is *fascism*.   If somebody does something stupid on say a public street, whether irl, or on reddit, there is at least one comment that says something to idiocracy. Nooooo, that guy is or was in a certain way, high, mentally ill, etc. Yes being stupid could be described as an action or characteristic, but it is not proof for some arbitrary parallel that we are at or moving toward a Satirical Movie.  Most of the time, it comments on the government or politics. In which I say, do you think theres a difference of *playing* dumb to have a higher political leverage, or *being* dumb. 90% of the time, it is *playing* to score political power.   I know there are some "winners" like that one represenative from colorado who married a very unsavory person, but the person im talking about didn't win idiots, they won over exploiting those peoples feelings and "ism's".   We have to stop thinking that people are naturally stupid when we see the news, or somebody on the front page of reddit. It is not comparable to mid-2000s movie, we actually have a lot of people who are completely complex, with complex motivations, with complex relations and lives. Some people are playing stupid, some are, and some aren't.   Whatever the news or statements say, it is done for a purpose, and it isn't because what we perceive as stupid, it is done for something much deeper (most of the time).	1642408577.0	s5z79k	/r/changemyview/comments/s5z79k/cmv_no_we_arent_living_in_a_idiocracy_or_anything/	CMV: No, we aren't living in a Idiocracy or anything similar to that.
9u3vm	On August 29, 2020, Aaron "Jay" Danielson was ambushed, shot and killed in Portland. Shortly thereafter, there was [celebration in the streets](https://twitter.com/stillgray/status/1299960350226358272?lang=en). As one person joyfully explained to the crowd, the man who had died was a member of the opposing protest group. Someone they believe deserved to die. They crowed cheered when they said that "the community had held its own and taken out the trash".   The attack on Aaron "Jay" Danielson is part of a long pattern of unprovoked attacks on conservative leaning, pro-trump and anti-Black Lives Matters protesters. *  Consider [this case](https://twitter.com/mrandyngo/status/1267003300131385348) where a man was sucker punched for standing on a street corner with an American Flag. I've had sever personal exchanges with left wingers I know personally, and on Reddit saying that he had it coming to him. How he should have 'read the room'. How he should have never been there, that his mere presence there to register his opposition was an example of 'fucking around and finding out'. The man who punched him never faced charges.   * Consider [this case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUd-PQLMujg). In Minnesota, a truck driver narrowly avoids hitting a crowd as speed, apparently surprised to find the highway blocked in front of him. The crowd pulls him from the truck with shouts of 'kill him' and is beaten so badly so as to require hospitalization. The Truck driver is the only one to face criminal charges from the incident, and media widely describe this as a vehicular ramming attack.   * Consider [NPR's softball interview of the author of 'In Defense of Looting'](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2020/08/27/906642178/one-authors-argument-in-defense-of-looting) where the author defends property destruction and theft as not just a protest tactic, but a net benefit to the world.   * Consider the left-wing claims about Kyle Rittenhouse. That he was somehow a white supremacist. That he had a moral obligation to allow his attackers to beat him to a pulp.  Consider the mockery of his tears on the stands.   * Consider [this piece](https://theintercept.com/2021/05/13/riot-squad-right-wing-video-journalists-black-lives-matter-antifa/) which condemns conservative media efforts to cover riots and suggests that violence against those producing such content has been brought about by their own acts in cover the riots, offering only the tepid condemnation of violence possible in the process:  > Violence against journalists, even ones operating in bad faith, is inexcusable. Unfortunately, videographers like D’Almeida have contributed to an atmosphere of paranoia and mistrust, making assaults on journalists more frequent. And this has also made the work of scrupulous and fair reporting on the politics that plays out on our streets much harder, and more dangerous.  I think that this attitude is common among the folks who actively identify themselves as 'leftists', to the point that I think that the majority of self-identified 'leftists' and even many mainstream democrats would approve of not only our dear activist's words but the killers actions. Moreover, I believe that they would actively support further acts of unprovoked violence. **To put this another way, the Democrats and leftists want me dead, or at least beaten to a bloody pulp so I learn the lesson to not engage in political activism again. **  I believe this for a few reasons:  1. There has *never* been an unequivocal condemnation from DNC leadership, nor from any notable ideological thought leaders on the left about any of these cases. Sure, there were Biden statements condemning 'the violence', but never mentioning the political identity of those doing the the violence. Given that the very same people didn't accept Donald Trump's 'bad actors on all sides' condemnation in Charlottesville, I'm not going to accept similar statements from the other side.   2. In cases where there is a statements by a left-wing politician on the subject, they always include language that blames either the victim or the right more broadly for the violence.   3. There has been many cases where even relatively mainstream folks have been openly welcoming of such violence. We've gone from 'punch a NAZI' to 'punch a High school kid in a MAGA hat' with some pretty frightening speed.   Things that will not change my view:  1. "But the right..." Yeah, I know there's thugs on the right too. They don't get the kind of institutional cover that the left-wing thugs do. There's no right-wing version National Lawyer's Guild coming to bail out right-wing thugs (and fund Terrorist attacks, but that's another decade).   2. "But someone did condemn all the violence..." Not good enough. They have to condemn their side explicitly and without mention or comparison to their opponents in these kind of cases.	1642410833.0	s5zse7	/r/changemyview/comments/s5zse7/cmv_mainstream_democrats_and_the_mainstream/	CMV: Mainstream Democrats and the mainstream American left generally either supportable or indifferent to left-wing violence in the US
c8ay6	It could be argued that capitalism is already a form of feudalism, though that argument would require a fairly loose interpretation of the term.  It seems to me that capitalism is really an evolution of feudalism.  Instead of serfs providing labor to a lord that owns capital in return for security, justice and redistributed resources, capitalists divorce themselves from their subjects' needs and accumulate capital, eschewing responsibility for the care of their laborers, only redistributing resources (in the form of wages) as necessary.  As consolation for the lost security, anyone with means may count themselves amongst the capitalists which dulls, but does not eliminate, issues of class in society.  It may seem like small consolation for anyone that lacks the resources to join the capitalist class, but privately-controlled cryptocurrencies threaten to erode even this basic privilege.  Recently, some savvy corporations are being tempted by the successes of Bitcoin and the NFT economy (and, let's be honest, giftcards) to begin exploring the idea of selling digital products, including proprietary currency, to customers.  Among them, the Gap and Walmart have begun the process of filing for patents and trademarks to secure early-adopter status in the metaverse market.  They're openly exploring this new way to make money, and I see this going one of three ways.  1) Their attempts are ultimately rejected by the public.  Bland but unlikely.  Buying Walmart-bux wouldn't be too far removed from buying a giftcard, or digital tokens as seen in oh-so-many videogames these days, so I don't see the public being outraged by the idea.  2) It is successful in some iteration (if at first you don't succeed, try, try again) and the government decides to regulate cryptocurrency markets.  This is far more likely, but I'm not sure if government would put its foot down and outlaw businesses creating currency out of nothing, or just set up firewalls to prevent decentralized cryptocurrencies from threatening the dominance of "legitimate" currencies ("legitimate" being those that are created by government or legal corporation).  3) It is successful and because of calls for liberty and freedom, the public will encourage their representatives in government to leave its regulation to market forces.  This is where I see things going wacky.  At some point, maybe in 50+ years, one of these corporations is going to insist that they will no longer accept any currency but their own.  You'll be able to do a currency exchange with reputable outfits, or through the stock market.  But they won't be taking government-issued moneys any more.  Naturally, employees will be compensated at least partially with their employer's play money.  At first, it'll just be seasonal bonuses.  But one day it'll creep into wages.  And at that point we're back to feudalism, but lacking security, justice, and now even redistributed resources or the ability to join the capitalist class.  Cuz they'll be paying folk with something they invented out of thin-air and can create on-demand and not even people with means will be able to create a competing cryptocurrency, because the mega-corporation won't accept it.  Dun, dun, dun!  So I'm looking for responses that assuage my concerns.  I  dunno: convince me that private-cryptocurrencies can't be a thing because of some technical reason.  Failing that, explain why crypto will ultimately be a good thing for mankind.  Show how the obsolescence of "the peoples' currency" (government-issued notes) will lead to a better, fairer, and ultimately more robust society.  Or just convince me that private fiefdoms dominating international markets isn't like feudalism.  There's lotsa ways to tackle this one.	1642419732.0	s6253d	/r/changemyview/comments/s6253d/cmv_if_corporations_successfully_launch_their_own/	CMV: If corporations successfully launch their own cryptocurrencies and NFT products, a system that more closely resembles feudalism will result.

4zu8u	I think that camping in (shooter) games is perfectly OK. For some reason it’s considered to be an unholy sin to lay in wait for another player. I think it’s absurd for a few reasons;  1) gameplay balances almost everything out. There are trade offs for most elements of games. If you pick a long range weapon you’re not going to have rapid fire. If you pick a strong character you might move more slowly. etc. These calculated trade offs are incorporated into the fabric of the game.  Likewise there is a cost/benefit with camping. Perhaps you get fewer absolute kills but a better K/D ratio, which brings me to the next point  2) Different games have different tactics. Camping may be appropriate for certain games/certain conditions. For example, having 2 of 3 locations in Domination. The effective tactic is to hunker down and hold the 2 locations (ie “Camp”). Let the opposing team come to you, get killed, and you maintain advantage by maintaining position. It’s akin to having a large lead in football and running the ball....it’s situational. Under those conditions the way you play likely (should) change.  3) which relates to a larger point....your job is to frustrate/surprise your opponent. Why in goodness name “should” you run out to meet your opponent on a “fair” battleground? If they want/expect a battle in open field, you fight them in the trees, if they want to battle on horseback, you run them into a marsh, and so on. “Come fight me where I expect in the way I expect” doesn’t hold much weight with me.  (Perhaps that last point undermines the notion that camping is considered wrong in video games. Perhaps the vocal minority complaining about it are simply expressing their frustration at being outwitted).	1642437639.0	s68an8	/r/changemyview/comments/s68an8/cmvcamping_in_video_games_is_ok/	CMV:Camping in video games is OK
62kyxam2	For the record I wish I was in this system.  Grades K-4 are the same everyone is in the same institutions. After which time your performance is tested and your overall grades or test scores put you into one of 3 school systems.  **Hauptschule or Basic school**- which continues till 9th or 10th grade and then graduates them. Its for people who performed under satisfactory in Reading/German (English) and or Math.  **Realschule or Satisfactory secondary education** This goes beyond what they teach in tier 1 and people are finished at 11th grade and graduated. This is for people who performed satisfactory in both Reading and Math.  **Gymnasium or Advanced** These are for students who performed Proficient in both Reading and Math and they go through the full 12 years and have a chance to get into University and beyond.  The reason I would have prefered this is I would have been in Tier 1 due to being almost illiterate (couldn't read or spell for shit) until 8th grade, would have been finished at 9th or 10th and been able to start working without attempting college and failing and not wasting years I didn't need to.  **Why I think this is the best system** is because it puts children schools teaching at their level. The top students get the education they can handle without being board as the teacher slows down for the rest. Those in the middle get taught at their pace those as the bottom are taught their pace.

4denqooa	I’m a 26 year old guy and I haven’t dated anyone yet. Someone mentioned I should just date a single mother. I personally wouldn’t want to date a single mother because she already loved someone else. She loved someone else enough to conceive a child with him at one point, and I think I wouldn’t be loved as much as he was/is. If I got into a relationship with a woman who already has a child, I feel like I would always be competing with her ex. Plus I don’t like the idea of raising a child that isn’t mine. That we didn’t create together.  I was discussing this topic with a friend and he provided a different perspective: single mothers 9 times out of 10 despise the father of their child. He changed my view somewhat, but I’m still thinking that that hatred was admiration at some point.  Because I haven’t dated anyone, I just want a woman who has the same relative experience that I have. I want to be someone’s first option. Maybe it’s because I’m young and haven’t had any experience that I feel this strongly about it. Anyway, am I wrong for wanting to date a woman who doesn’t have kids?

7wq79cx1	TW// disordered eating/eating disorders  I'm not saying that dieting is a bad thing in and of itself, just to clarify, but I do think we desperately need to take a far more nuanced view, especially in the face of mainstream media. Having so much focus on the extremes of being overweight or underweight perpetuates disordered eating, especially as long as mainstream media and companies continue to promote and make a profit from it. Generally speaking, as long as you eat balanced meals and exercise frequently, you should be fine.  However, I may be misguided in calling diet culture toxic because there is obvious evidence that we must consider the extremes when the extremes are present. However, I think the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in general are almost as, if not as, dangerous, and it has become almost as big as an issue as obesity. I wish more people would treat it as just as important.  Lastly, though I don't have an eating disorder or disordered eating myself, this is an issue I feel is very important to me, but I don't want to speak over anyone who has or is struggling with one and their lived experiences. If that is the case ever in either this post or my replies to any comments, please point it out and I will shut up as and when it is necessary to do so.	1642449936.0	s6debi	/r/changemyview/comments/s6debi/cmv_dieting_culture_is_toxic_because_it_shouldnt/	CMV: Dieting culture is toxic because it shouldn't be so much about whether you are fat or thin, but whether you are healthy for your body weight.
6arn3gq4	To understand why the American west is so desert just study [this picture.](https://snrs.ucmerced.edu/natural-history/climate)  The Sierra Nevadas take all the rain for California causing floods and overgrowth. Then during the dry season that overgrowth catches fire. Good job nature!  Boring tunnels under the Sierra Nevadas will let us pipe excess water into the eastern slope. From there it will evaporate and meander into the parched West. Arizona Nevada Utah etcetera will get increased rain allowing greening of the deserts.  Start the tunnels about halfway up the west face of the Sierras. Slope them down to emerge out the eastern face 2/3 the way down.

11sm4p8v	The argument against "race fishing" to my understanding is that, minorities sometimes get made fun of for certain features, while there's the assumption that those same features are praised when white people appear to have them. This is something that people of color feel unhappy about, not every minority feels the same way about this as everyone has their own experiences and personalities, but it is reasonable and valid to be upset about this. It is undeniably unfair.  Some people feel saddened by this (I'm one of those people), and others feel envious to the point where they want to prevent "white people" from granting themselves these certain features. It's the "I don't have it, so neither can you" mentality that is toxic and pointless. It's a mentality that has ridiculous implications.  When it comes to envy, it should never be anybody's job to make sure that you're not envious of them. This whole "race fishing" idea implies that minorities can't face their own envy, and it's a white persons responsibility etc. to make sure minorities are not envious of them. Do white people hold themselves to this low standard too or do they only hold minorities to that standard? Isn't that weird?  This inherently bad trait that some people in have in general is excused in this instance as if minorities aren't capable of dealing with it themselves. Hence, the idea of "race fishing" unintentionally perpetuating bigotry of low expectations towards minorities.  The reason why there's not this unanimous agreement when it comes to this topic between minorities, is that just like white people (obviously) minorities are individuals, with their own personality types and experiences.   Not everyone in general has the "I don't have it, so neither can you," mentality. It seems like the people that have the most extreme and insane positions have the loudest voices.  When it comes to the issue of minorities being discriminated against because of their natural features, instead of calling out random people just because they have lip fillers and a tan, or calling out people because they did their eyeliner a certain way... How about calling out the schools banning certain hair styles? (This is actually a real problem that exists but nobody is talking about!) or apply pressure to make sure certain facial features are represented more? etc.  This whole "race fishing thing" really is just an excuse for certain women that people don't like to get bullied via body shaming... really disgraceful if you ask me. I've also been seeing mixed people or racially ambiguous people getting called out for simply existing... because people think certain features can only be ascribed to certain races. so cringe.

131xqs	My argument is very simple:   1. If someone sincerely believed that Christianity is true, then Christianity would be the most important part of their life.   2. If Christianity were the most important part of someone's life, they would (at a minimum) attend church on a weekly basis, be more familiar with basic Biblical teachings than atheists, and have an evangelistic conversation in order to share their faith with a nonbeliever at least once a week.   3. The overwhelming majority of people who profess Christianity [do not attend church on a weekly basis](https://sci-hubtw.hkvisa.net/https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-5906.2005.00288.x), [atheists generally outperform Christians](https://www.pewforum.org/2019/07/23/what-americans-know-about-religion/) in tests of religious knowledge, and [about 1 in 10 churchgoers (10 percent)](https://www.godreports.com/2019/04/most-churchgoers-rarely-share-their-faith/) average at least one evangelistic conversation *a month*.   4. Therefore, to whatever extent that Christians should place Christianity at the forefront of their lives, the overwhelming majority of people are not sincere Christians.   5. An extremely insincere Christian is not actually a Christian, just as someone who does not believe in Islam is not a Muslim, and a person who does not believe in evolution is not someone who believes in evolution.   6. Therefore, American Christians are extremely rare.   **Response to Objections**  **You may counter:** how can a Christian be insincere if they do not believe in **2)**, that church attendance is expected of devout Christians?   My response is that a) there is strong evidence (see the paper I linked) that Christians lie about their church attendance, implying that they know better, and b) a sincere Christian would read the Bible enough in order to understand that [church attendance is strongly advocated in the New Testament](https://www.gotquestions.org/church-attendance.html).  Pew Research Center conducts a religious knowledge test which heavily emphasizes facts about monotheistic religions any Christian should know. On the test, *all* Christian denominations underperform atheists. Moreover, according to Pew, "Among Christians, knowledge of the Bible and Christianity is closely linked both with the amount of effort respondents say they invest in learning about their faith and with their religious background. Christians who say they regularly spend time learning about their own religion (for example, reading scripture, visiting websites, listening to podcasts, reading books or magazines, or watching television) answer more questions correctly about the Bible and Christianity than do those who say they make such efforts to learn about their faith less often."   What this means is that religious ignorance is a choice Christians make because other things are more important to them than the study of scripture.   **As for church attendance,** I think it's fair to say that, during years with high church attendance, Christians are more sincere; during years with low attendance, they are less-so. This is because I would expect sincere Christians to view their faith as the most important part of their lives, and the least such a person could do is attend church for an afternoon every week. That being said, do Christians generally do that today?   In one study published in 2005 by the Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, it was found that if you correct self-report measures (where 40% of Americans claimed to attend on a weekly basis) by checking them against attendance reports by the churches themselves, just 22% of Americans attend weekly. That is, when Christians told the National Social Survey how often they attended (where one is required to actually name the church or synagogue), researchers can take a random, representative sample of reportees and track down which churches they claimed to attend.   Then, they can do head counts or ask for bookkeeping and estimates from church administrators, which results in severely deflated figures. When we account for the fact that many of these attendees are going to be the children of the reporting families, the percentage is likely even lower--probably much lower.   I think this methodology is actually very forgiving, considering that it allows church leaders to report the total weekly congregation size before subtracting that from the National Social Survey reported total, rather than ensuring that the same people attending one week are the same people the next week (if we corrected for this, perhaps it would be much lower; I will call this the "continuity" problem below), and 2) because, when they created their own estimates, they allowed the inclusion of children above the age of 5. What percentage of your congregation is made up of children? A quarter? A fifth?   The reason this matters is that, broadly speaking, I doubt children attend church services because of their belief in Christianity. They attend primarily because the kinds of parents who are sincere enough to attend weekly probably just take them to church. I'm not saying that they don't believe; only that, when trying to assess the effects of religious belief on church attendance, it's best to look at people who attend church when they have other options readily available, as most adults do. Recall that these are numbers on 2005 church attendance; if you share my belief that Christianity has declined significantly since then in the United States, you may also think that the numbers are even lower.   If want to hazard a wild guess, I'll say the percentage of Americans who attend church with ready alternatives available to them (adults), after accounting for the continuity problem and the fact that a significant proportion of church congregations is probably made up of the children of visiting families (and, remember, religious people have larger families), is around 12-15%. What do you think?  **As for faith sharing,** [evangelism is so emphatically urged by the Bible,](https://www.gotquestions.org/why-evangelize.html) one would have to have never picked up a New Testament and read three pages in either direction ever in order to miss this. Note that this is Biblically mandated, even if one does not believe in the doctrine of Hell. However, how much worse must it be to be a Christian who *does* believe nonbelievers are punished with infinite suffering in the afterlife, but fails to regularly share their faith? If you believed an eighteen-wheeler was on a collision course with your friend, at a *bare minimum* you would be expected to shout "get out of the way!"   There are five criteria we apply in order to gauge the sincerity of someone's beliefs:  **Explicit avowal:** Ask a person whether P is the case. If they say “yes”, that’s a sign that they believe P. If they say “no” or “I don’t know”, that suggests that they don’t believe P. (Slight variant: ask a person whether they believe that P.)  **Grounds:** Typically, if S believes that P, S will have some justification for P that S could explain, and vice versa. For instance, if Jon is standing in front of a table, in plain view, his eyes are open, he isn’t blind, etc., then you can pretty well assume that Jon believes there is a table in front of him, even if he hasn’t said anything about it. At the same time, if there is no porcupine in front of Jon, you can pretty well assume that Jon doesn’t think there is a porcupine in front of him.  **Implications:** Typically, if S believes that P, then S will believe the reasonably obvious and direct implications of P (including implications that follow when P is combined with other things S believes). E.g., if Jon thinks there is a porcupine in front of him, then he probably thinks there is at least one animal nearby. If Jon doesn’t think there are any nearby animals, then he probably does not believe there is a porcupine in front of him.  **Behavior:** Typically, if S believes that P, then S will perform the sort of actions that would make sense if P were the case, or at least not do things that would be wildly irrational. For instance, assuming Jon is not suicidal, if Jon drinks from a glass of water, one can assume that Jon does not believe that the water is poisoned.  **Emotional reactions:** Typically, a person will have emotional reactions that would be apt if their beliefs were correct. For instance, if Jon believes that his child was just killed, then Jon will be distraught. If he isn’t, then he probably does not believe that.   I have noticed that Christians generally only exhibit the first criterion: they avow their faith in words. On all four other criteria, however, I think a clear case can be made (such as the one I gave above) that Christians do not behave in the ways one would reasonably expect them to if they really believed it.   With respect to "Implications" and "Behavior," Christians show little interest in knowing more than nonbelievers about their religion's theology and cultural heritage, in sharing their faith with nonbelievers, and in attending church despite strong biblical prescriptions to do so. Regarding "Emotional Reactions," I will incidentally add that Christians are bizarrely afraid of and bereaved by death, even though they should regularly express excitement and forward-looking enthusiasm about the infinitely positive experience of heaven, and familial loss is the best thing that will ever happen to one's Christian loved ones. Sure, a momentary separation (a flicker in the eternal time-scale) is a little sad--but there's a difference between grieving over a friend's annihilation and their departure to a cruise ship. Despite this, I have never met a Christian who was a least a little bit excited to die, and I have never met a Christian who was unusually resilient after losing a loved one.   Furthermore, when it comes to Christians who believe in Hell, I notice that few seem upset by the whole thing. I mean, presumably most of the people one sees in their everyday lives is going to suffer infinitely for all of eternity for the finite sins committed within this life; where's the sense of urgency and, dare I ask, panic? Wouldn't it be a little traumatizing if you genuinely believed that your pizza deliveryman, for example, was going to be kidnapped by a serial and brutally tortured and executed in his basement? In the same way, if we are taking Jesus and the Apostle Paul's words to the early churches seriously in the New Testament, we should expect most humans to suffer estrangement from God.   > “Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few” (Matthew 7:13–14).  > Someone asked Jesus, “Lord, will those who are saved be few?” He replied, “Strive to enter through the narrow door. For many, I tell you, will seek to enter and will not be able” (Luke 13:23–24).  Also, where's all the Christian martyrdom?   > Jesus said, “If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it” (Luke 9:23–24).  Concerning "Grounds," Christians are quick to show fluster when asked the most basic questions about their beliefs (i.e. "why do you believe you will survive your bodily death?"). Imagine someone saying "I believe that evolution is true, but for no particular reason that I can explain--I just feel it in my heart that I should think so." What I would suspect of such a person is that they are merely claiming to believe in evolution for social rewards, since they are not comfortable with producing reasons for their belief.	1642458165.0	s6gr8u	/r/changemyview/comments/s6gr8u/cmv_american_christianity_is_generally_insincere/	CMV: American Christianity is generally insincere, and therefore extremely rare

b0n6x1uw	There seem to be two prevailing opinions here-- the one I stated in the title, and the idea that whoever asked the other out ("Hey, do you want to go to X place on Y day?") should pay for both parties. There are a few people who think the man should pay everything no matter what, but they're a minority and this isn't r/FemaleDatingStrategy, so we won't spend any more time on that.  No one owes me anything just because they asked me to go out. If we're dating, and we're doing so with the intention of possibly being together eventually, we're both in this equally. I want to be there on the date just as much as you, no matter who asks who out. My time and effort is no more valuable than yours-- I'm not doing you a favor by showing up even though you asked me out. We're in this together. Neither of us is more valuable than the other. This is mutually beneficial.  Why should one party pay for everything when the goal for both of us is to go out together eventually? It's not like it's some radical idea for one person to ask the other to meet up for coffee or a meal, or one person would be content to never go out when the other person desperately wants to go out.  That being said, communication is also where many people err in this situation. Every conversation should go something like "Do you want to go X place? Is that within your budget?" If it's not, pick a different place. If they don't want to spend any money at all, do something that's free. If you can't agree on who should pay or anything like that, move on, you're probably not compatible.  This also avoids either party feeling like they've been taken advantage of, or that they owe the other person anything, which is a major problem on both sides.	1642470138.0	s6l5lw	/r/changemyview/comments/s6l5lw/cmv_in_dating_before_an_official_relationship_is/	CMV: In dating, before an official relationship is agreed upon by both parties, all dates should be split 50/50, no matter who asks who out
mwrtr	I see consciousness not as a/non-person dichotomy, but a spectrum from very simple minds to us on the far end (who knows if there are even more conscious aliens?). Pigs and chickens are very smart, and have a certain amount of emotional intelligence. Here's part of an article from Mercy for Animals:  "From anticipating future events to recalling the trajectory of a hidden object, chickens are incredibly smart. They even possess self-control, holding out for a better food reward, and can assess their own position in the pecking order—both characteristics of self-awareness."  https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/chickens-are-intelligent-and-sensitive-so/#:~:text=From%20anticipating%20future%20events%20to,both%20characteristics%20of%20self%2Dawareness.

gw92lk27	If you're not familiar with the black pill, it's basically a belief that looks are everything and that nothing matters as much as your appearance. In the eyes of black pillers if you're not a 7-8/10 your life is basically over. There are women who have swallowed the black pill, but most black pillers seem to be men.   My problem with the black pill, aside from how damaging it can be to one's psyche, is that I think it spits out hypotheses which cannot be disproven and then uses the fact that nobody can disprove them to argue for their legitimacy. For example, a black piller might say women only love Chad (very attractive man.) Somebody else will say "well that's a lie because I've seen attractive and unattractive women with unattractive men" to which the black piller responds "that's because they're rich" or "he's an orbiter" or "they aren't a couple" or any number of other things. Things which, notably, nobody would know.   If somehow a black pill detractor does know a lot about a relationship, the black piller will typically respond with "well then that's the one woman in the world like that." It doesn't make sense, but it's highly unlikely that the black pill detractor is going to have many more examples to disprove that. My issue isn't that the hypotheses are difficult to disprove, my issue is that they're set up that way. It seems to me like you can apply the black pill to any situation and find some possible explanation that supports the black pill.  If the black pill were correct, it would still be a very dark philosophy about the world, but at least it would be true. But I question many of the claims black pillers make, especially when they're hostile towards and dismissive of counterevidence.  Do I believe life is easier if you're very attractive? All else being equal, probably- although being a very attractive man or woman with social anxiety might not be fun. But do I believe life is over if you're unattractive-no, I don't. But I'm open to changing my view if the evidence suggests I'm wrong.  Edit: After thinking about everything some more, my view on this subject has been changed.

6nua1	I don't understand what stay at home parents do once their children are old enough to go to school, in my opinion *you simply do not require a full-time person to manage and clean a house*. Before you say things like "I do the washing, I cook dinner, etc" - this doesn't take 8 hours a day, you can do all of these things while also having a part-time job. Hell, you can do this with a full-time job!  The opportunity cost of not working is huge:  * You could setup your family and children's financial future instead of spinning your wheels at home. With compound interest, that extra 20-40K per year will be worth hundreds of thousands by the time you retire. * You are setting yourself up to be financially dependent on another person. If the relationship falls apart, suddenly you don't have the skills or experience needed to support yourself. The way that alimony works in some places means your partners "reward" for supporting your sedentary lifestyle is to continue to support you after you break up. * It's simply unfair on the working partner, the division of labour is skewed. One partner works full-time to support the family, while the other partner does far less. it's not the 1950's anymore, both partners can and should be contributing towards the maintenance and upkeep of the house, including the emotional labour.	1642476172.0	s6n9sv	/r/changemyview/comments/s6n9sv/cmv_stay_at_home_parents_with_kids_who_go_to/	CMV: "Stay at home parents" with kids who go to school are just lazy

4akx077	**I say this for a number of reasons, as an avid (former) user of Goodreads who would come across inaccuracies on author profiles as an almost daily occurence:**  \#1) Authors and publishers are the copyright-holders of the works themselves, not Goodreads or Amazon, and to that extent, they would know their own work better than anybody. The GR moderators (called "Librarians") often butcher the accuracy of book metadata records based on whether or not a title was ever listed on Amazon. They don't check copyright registries, they don't check to see who listed the book on Amazon in the first place, and they don't check to see if there's any context as to why a title should be removed. If it has an ISBN and was ever sold on Amazon, they consider it valid.  \#2) Self-publishing has muddied the waters too much. There are self-published authors who assign ISBN numbers to rough drafts of books, self-published authors who plagiarize books, and situations in the past where self-publishing companies released unpublished books prematurely against the author's wishes due to mere technical errors (which could start another whole argument in itself, but I digress)... there's no possible way for any Goodreads Librarian or Goodreads staff member to be able to determine what makes a book record an accurate book record anymore.  \#3) Goodreads is the primary search result that arises in most cases on web browsers, unless an author is famous enough to generate better search results first, like an official webpage or a properly catalogued resource.   \#4) Goodreads gets a lot of its records from user input and Ingram/Amazon, and only some from reputable sources like The Library of Congress or WorldCat. Ingram will bring in anything with an ISBN, and sometimes doesn't even spell the titles or author names correctly.  \#5) Goodreads itself deletes and segregates book records for arbitrary reasons all the time, and it would cause to great social ill to give authors the same power over their own works. Goodreads is a social metadata website, not a bookstore or a library, and metadata can be subject to change for various reasons. Unlike Goodreads, which will delete/segregate books for the purpose of outright censorship (see "The Turner Diaries"), there's really no reason for an author to do this, except for the purpose of having some control over invalid/inaccurate information. An author whose book is already common knowledge *can't* really hide its existence anyway, and so authors could at least keep their records accurate with more power to do so.  \#6) It doesn't serve Goodreads or Amazon to have a bunch of inaccurate/false data stored on its servers. If the goal is to accumulate metadata for readers, why would Goodreads want it to be so flimsy?   \#7) Goodreads clearly can't manage its own data inaccuracies anymore. The Librarians Group and contact support links to staff are oversaturated with requests pouring in from both readers and authors to fix up bad metadata, and it's left to the discretion of Goodreads and these moderators to remove it.  \#8) Goodreads will continue to display deadnames against an author's wishes. This is in spite of Amazon's other big metadata acquisition, IMDb, allowing people like Elliot Page to change their name on all metadata records after coming out as transgender, and there's no reason why Goodreads can't do this, too.   **TL;DR: The only reason these giant book metadata platforms are allowed to get away with displaying bad metadata is because no class-action authors' collective has challenged them on it. Goodreads makes Wikipedia and Fandom look like university-grade secondary sources.**	1642485780.0	s6qdax	/r/changemyview/comments/s6qdax/cmv_goodreads_should_allow_authors_to_delete_book/	CMV: Goodreads should allow authors to delete book records from their author bibliographies, or at least segregate them to the Goodreads "NOT A BOOK" page.
s0gom	A little bit of set-up before I begin. I'm 28 years old (M) and I've never held a job in my (thus far) useless life. I also didn't go to college (due to how astronomically costly it is here in the US) and I still live with my parents, but desperately want to move out as soon as possible. All that said, let's begin.  I'll now discuss the basis of why I hold this view. It has to do with the fact that employers value candidates who have marketable skills. In this department I'm at an immediate disadvantage. That isn't because I don't think I have any skills (I certainly do). Since I've never worked before, I have no evidence that I can point an employer to. Without said evidence, I have no hope of convincing an employer to hire me. In addition, my lack of job experience, which I can't explain away, doesn't help at all. I don't know how teenagers manage to get jobs despite being in the same position as me. Many of the people I see working service jobs near me are the aforementioned teenagers and college age people. Very, very rarely do I see anyone older than that. Yes, I know that age discrimination is illegal, but that doesn't mean businesses don't try to do it anyway.  I also have what I can only describe as "performance anxiety." Typically that term is applied to sexual situations but I think it fits my situation with respect to jobs. I just don't know if I could meet a boss's expectations enough that won't be fired in a week. I'll be expected to hit the ground running and I don't think I could do that. Intertwined with this is that I'm socially awkward, making it impossible to even pass a job interview.  I could go on but I think you get the picture. If you were a employer/hiring manager, given all that I've described above, would you hire me?	1642486549.0	s6ql36	/r/changemyview/comments/s6ql36/cmv_no_employerhiring_manager_would_ever_touch_me/	CMV: No employer/hiring manager would ever touch me with a 100-foot pole
h9cqpgm0	Just happened to me and I'm still upset we evolved to not be able to sneeze on command   i tried the bright light trick, the fake sneeze to trick my nervous system and sniffing pepper just makes it worse. the whole shabang, but god simply enjoys my suffering.    i know what you're thinking - " but brain freezes , but cramps but sharts".   but i said - for those few SECONDS.   to those people i say- can you imagine if the false sneeze irritation lasted minutes?? or hours ??!    the problem with brain freezes is that they last a painfully long time, if it was only as long as a false sneeze no problem. I've never had a period cramp but blue balls is horrible mainly bc it lasts a long time, a few seconds would be nothing. and sharts are more of a betrayal than actual irritation, as long as you can run to the bathroom it's more about the embarrassment and cleanup.   no- i submit that for the brief few seconds that you cannot sneeze and you know it's not going to happen - those are intense. purgatoric if not hellish. I maybe succeed inducing a real sneeze from a false sneeze 1/100x , which makes it worse tbh.   the only silver lining i can think of is that false sneezes at least make you appreciate how satisfying real ones are, but i appreciate orgasms without ruining them and farts without false ones.    so idk man, this will be a hard one to change tbh, good luck.   edit: words   edit: apologies to the differently abled. i meant to include that i meant only the most shared human experiences of bodily functions, didn't mean to feign ignorance to the pain of those with diseases/injuries or provoke a battle of the sexes.	1642487734.0	s6qx4p	/r/changemyview/comments/s6qx4p/cmv_that_feeling_you_get_when_you_start_to_sneeze/	CMV: That feeling you get when you start to sneeze but then can't is the most irritating bodily function in existence for a few seconds
g8azu	Towards the end of the previous administration after Donald Trump's election loss, Nancy Pelosi sought assurance from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that the exiting president would not be able to use nuclear weapons in the interim period before he was replaced by Biden. While General Mark A. Milley sought to reassure her, and planned around the possibility, he may not be able to do so in the future. This, paired with Trump's pattern of grandstanding about the US nuclear arsenal, increasing tension towards China, and his resistance to any sort of external control, makes me worry that should he become President again, he will make a pre-emptive strike on a perceived enemy of the US (most likely China) and, in doing so, endanger the county and/or world through nuclear armageddon either via retaliatory destruction of economic centres within the United States, mutually assured destruction, or nuclear winter.  Are there reasons why Donald Trump, given his unpredictability beyond supporting his ego and business interests, would NOT do such a thing? Note that this is not a thread on whether Trump will become president again, but on whether his actions can be at all predicted or certain possibilities can be disregarded.	1642492762.0	s6s9fl	/r/changemyview/comments/s6s9fl/cmv_if_donald_trump_is_president_for_a_second/	CMV: If Donald Trump is President for a second term, he will use nuclear weapons on impulse and jeopardize global stability and possibly the world.

y1qmm	This comes directly from something I saw earlier about somebody complaining about COVID etc., I'm all for the vaccination so as you can imagine when I hear somebody introduced as "Dr. \[surname\]" with a different opinion to me, it could imply that he actually knows what he's talking about.  No. A tiny bit of research shows that he has a PhD in *theology*, this was never specified, yet I see the same video circulating quite a bit around the internet (between anti-vaxxers) because he was called "Dr.", anybody that doesn't do research would therefore assume that he has some sort of medical or at least scientific background which is not the case.  I don't disagree with people being *allowed* to introduce themselves as "Dr." because a PhD does take a long time and it is a big thing etc. but it's very immoral  EDIT: When I refer to a "doctor" in this post I mean a licensed physician/MD, I've said "person with a PhD" any other time, I'm aware that they're both considered "doctors" by definition.	1642506250.0	s6vnxe	/r/changemyview/comments/s6vnxe/cmv_people_with_a_phd_in_an_unrelated_field/	CMV: People with a PhD in an unrelated field shouldn't be allowed to introduce themselves as "Dr." when presenting medical facts
ggw5fsyd	the premise of my whole view is very simple, it is always a loud minority that drives change. the best advice people give on social media is to avoid the crazy bunch but that doesn't really work when jobs are impacted because the companies are looking at the social media being manipulated but the voices of the crazy. it's the loud minority, the crazies that drive those clicks, it's these  crazy voices whose voices are amplified by media as the mainstream narrative.  let's take an example,  Contrapoints and Jessie Gender are two trans creators whom I tend to go to when i have to hear the perspective of trans people when it comes to gender debate. while i disagree with some opinions they put up, i still find them reasonable and feel that I can extend that same reasonability to majority or trans folks. The problem occurs when you hear how crazies from the trans community and TRAs drag folks like Natalie across the platform when she doesn't toe the line.  these crazies are the loudest voices and these are the same folks that fuel the whole culture war. you need 2 hands to clap and while the alt right is definitely one of those hands, the others are the crazies.  the same can be said for any topic that's a dumpster fire these days. it's the loud minority that drives the narrative and ignoring them is disastrous.	1642507500.0	s6w0ak	/r/changemyview/comments/s6w0ak/cmv_the_whole_oh_its_just_a_tiny_minority_dont/	CMV: the whole "oh it's just a tiny minority, don't pay them attention" is a disastrous proposition.
2gs3lqse	People end decade long relationships over sexual affairs, but there are worse, more insidious types of cheating as well. If you are going behind someone's back, and hiding substantial information, distorting the truth, it's cheating and that person has gone dark. Nobody will be safe with someone who is comfortable subverting situations into his or her own advantage. Real cheating is dishonesty. Real cheating is calling someone "mine" and then turning around and giving priority access to (i.e spending your birthday with) someone else. That is a morally corrupt decision to deliberately distort reality and disrespect the person's best intentions and is worse than sexual cheating.  If you are giving someone else more compassion, understanding, sympathy, time and attention, it's cheating. Making another female feel like she's got a chance is cheating. If they end up receiving more of your emotional resources that's even worse than a one-off physical affair or a mistake in the heat of the moment. If they get priority on special days it's cheating. If they start feeling like you're into them it's cheating. IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GOTTA LIE ABOUT IT, it's cheating!!!	1642508494.0	s6wae0	/r/changemyview/comments/s6wae0/cmv_offering_someone_else_more_time_and_emotional/	CMV: Offering someone else more time and emotional compassion is cheating.
ewngos3d	Basic geometry and algebra? Sure. But in my opinion, focusing entire sections of mathematics on advanced algebra and geometry means you’re learning a section of mathematics 90% of us will never use again, and that’s replacing mathematical functions that we should be learning and might be of good use to us down the line.   If you want to do maths at a higher level, pick it at a higher level where you *will* learn advanced algebra and geometry.  As far as I’m concerned, these subjects should be minimised. If you have an exam of let’s say 30 questions, no more than 4 total should be on these two subjects. The rest should be things like advanced multiplication/division applied to real world problems, like finance, appreciation/depreciation, taxes (incremental rates on different numbers within the same sum to get those marginal rates), mortgage rates, fractions, etc.   If you can’t find a common, real world application of a mathematical problem, save it for third level education. Kids will get their share of algebraic & geometric calculations in physics & chemistry class anyway.   Addressing the argument of “most subjects aren’t applicable to real life, should we drop those too?”: No. maths is a core, generic subject meant to be a basic necessity. Those other subjects are elective and exist to give you some freedom to pursue subjects that you’re either good at or interested in. Elective subjects (more focused subjects you choose) should, by definition and necessity, be more focused to the subjects as a vocation. But maths and English are core, mandated subjects meant to instil the basics because these are both seen as essential to functioning in society. If the basis for teaching something is “you NEED this for the real world”, why would you teach anything other than problems that have real world application?	1642511180.0	s6x4ce	/r/changemyview/comments/s6x4ce/cmv_theres_no_good_reason_to_learn_advanced/	CMV: There’s no good reason to learn advanced trigonometry, geometry or advanced algebra before third level education
5n84017l	Like all of it. The combined value of all the worlds inclusive wealth, and taking it and redistributing it to every single person on the planet.     I  did the math, comes out to about 1.625 million a human.     There is approximately US$ 40 trillion in circulation: this includes all the physical money and the money deposited in savings and checking accounts.

151v1k	Like the title says, i belive microsoft buying bethesda and now activistion/blizard is a possative thing.   If you look at what happend in 2021 with gaming it was mostly a blood bath for AAA titles. look at battlefield for example, it wasnt ready but they release it anyway to get the christmas launch and most companys are like this, in contrast look at halo infinite the game wasnt ready for there launch window before christmas so they pushed it and its a great game.  Last year the only good big games released were made by microsoft and for a long time now we have been on a trend of release it at a time where it will make the most sales then wory about how the game is broken after.  I think that AAA titles were going to die when everyone realised that there just going to be released and not be playable for a few months or more, but microsoft seems to be the good guy when it comes to big titles, not being affraid to push it when they need to and when it releases its in a playable stait.  Before i get the comments saying im a xbox fanboy and all of that, no i play pc with 2 mates on playstation and i used to be on playstation aswel.  So change my view microsoft buying a bunch of AAA companys is a posative, maybe cod will become good again.   I wana add aswel that i garuntee that the activision/blizard offices will become a much better place for women to work because if your not aware there has been many sexual harrasment cases buried by the bosses of the company and that came out recently and microsoft wont want that image as part of there company.  So even if the games dont change at least the prick will be gone.	1642520779.0	s70h80	/r/changemyview/comments/s70h80/cmv_microsoftxbox_buying_a_bunch_of_aaa_game/	CMV: Microsoft/xbox buying a bunch of AAA game companies is a posative thing.
p4kou	"Autonomous" because I'm considering a future when self-driving vehicles become cheaper and more reliable (hence the future tense), and because many women are still harassed/assaulted by taxi/Uber drivers. "Taxis" doesn't refer literally to taxis but to an Uber-like service that may be operated by the government, as those "taxis" are better than personal cars for the person not needing to own or drive it and because they don't require as much parking space (as they roam around the city making trips instead of staying in a parking lot all day). "Local" because trains, buses, water vessels and airplanes (depending on the trip) will still be better in transporting a lot of people from one city to another. "Transit" means buses, trains, trams, monorails, streetcars, subways and other public vehicles designed to transport a lot of people at once. "Almost" because transit is still better in carrying efficiency: one bus carrying sixty people takes up less space than twelve cars carrying the same amount of people (although cars doing commutes are rarely at full capacity, so more than twelve cars). Bringing up transit because cities can't handle everyone using light personal transportation like bicycles, skateboards and scooters (abbreviated as LPT from now on).  \- Elderly and disabled people: some of these people can't walk a few tens of meters between the transit stop and the final destination/trip start. And some can't drive nor ride LPT either. When self-driving technology becomes reliable, self-driving cars will become a lifesaver for elderly and disabled people who can't have a car and can't walk between the bus stop and the places they are in/want to go. Much of this CMV is because of this point because it can't be solved with LPT  \- Diseases: sharing the same vehicle with a lot of strangers may risk transmitting some respiratory diseases. In the current circumstances, this is a huge deal. Because of those diseases, people end up buying cars for safety. Autonomous public taxis (alongside the forementioned LPT) would be preferred to transit by some people during the next pandemic (if they can't work from home, of course). It's not very common for transit to be the focus of mass infections (as long as everyone takes the necessary precautions) but someone must win the lottery.  \- Women: women aren't inherently incapable of taking transit, but there are two issues many of them face in public transit: sexual harassment and sexual assault. Frotteurism, unwanted stares, unwanted sexual comments, and even guys literally ejaculating on women are issues a lot of women face in transit. Subways and intraurban trains deal with it with women-only cars but if a city's only transit option is the bus, many women will prefer taking a car or LPT.  \- Convenience: cars access more places than transit (although not as many as motorcycles, helicopters, LPT or simply walking), so most people would prefer a car over transit. Transit is good for commuting, but recreational trips may be an issue depending on how much the "ticket" costs.	1642524690.0	s71x5m	/r/changemyview/comments/s71x5m/cmv_autonomous_taxis_will_be_better_than_local/	CMV: Autonomous taxis will be better than local transit in almost every way.
4jd1qejv	Many people make a list of reasons for why going to an easy to get into school is a better option than attending a prestigious school. I rebut the common points (by the way, I classify prestigious or hard to get into for schools with below a 50% acceptance rate) —  • “Going to a public state school saves money.”  This is the most common argument and while I understand why people may think this, there needs to be more research done. I am in a state with no prestigious colleges and only three public schools that accept anyone with a pulse. I applied and received a scholarship from them, but I found out that most private colleges that are hard to get into would give me a full ride just because we make less than 80k after taxes. It also starts at a sliding scale for incomes above that. It simply takes a google search to find out colleges that meet full need based aid.  • “Prestigious colleges are too far from home.”  - I live in a rural town, and the closest four-year colleges are actually closer to me than my state ones, they are also prestigious. This is anecdotal though, so in general people should check out which colleges are near them instead of defaulting to close ones that are easy to get into. Additionally, living on campus or nearby helps you be more independent, which is needed for when you start life after college. Grants/scholarships cover housing costs.  • “Education at all colleges are the same.”  - Most fields value prestige, the only ones that I’m aware of that don’t really are a major common for the pre-med track (undergrad) and computer science. However, even for computer science, being a student at a prestigious university allows for more companies to pick out students to recruit for internships. Most other fields do take into account for the overall school. For some fields like finance, prestige is absolutely the most important thing you need in a college. Aside from that, professors and students at top colleges are generally more interested in being there because of the environment with a bunch of productive brains working together. Many non-prestigious schools have a low graduation rate, so many of the peers you started with won’t even be there to work with in your last semesters of college and it could be tougher. Since it is harder to get into some colleges, the students typically don’t drop out because they aren’t overwhelmed by college due to their rigorous HS experience or they don’t want to lose out on a prestigious title once they graduate. The starting salaries at grads from prestigious colleges are much more than easy to get in to schools. There a few exceptions to prestige with rankings, for example Purdue overall has a high acceptance rate but the engineering program has a very low acceptance rate and is top-ranked.  Overall, if you have the opportunity to attend a prestigious school, you should do it because it is better than attending a big state school that lets in anybody that put in no effort in high school. In my experience, people who say who going to an easy college and a prestigious one are the same are people who are jealous and don’t want to accept that their peers are going to be more successful, so they say that to make themselves feel better.	1642545800.0	s7a53g	/r/changemyview/comments/s7a53g/cmv_attending_a_more_prestigious_school_is/	CMV: Attending a more prestigious school is virtually always a better idea than attending an easy-to-get-into school
5co25j2h	This came to mind with Disney and now again with Microsoft’s acquisitions.  First off, there are for sure bad monopolies. Like if an electric company controls all the power lines and they have no competition, then they can shoot up the price and in our society we are sufficiently reliant that we would sort of have to just deal with it.  Disney has bought a ton of different studios like Marvel, Fox, Hulu, and Pixar. Which in America especially we’ve been taught monopolies can only be bad. However in an entertainment industry, I just don’t see much wrong with it.   Like Disney has more access to marketing dollars, but with access to the internet and reviews they still have to make good content for people to go see it. Then you have indie films while there are awareness barriers to entry, as a consumer I can still choose to watch indie films if Disney wasn’t giving me what I want.  Now I realize that the word monopoly might not fit for Disney or Microsoft. I more so use it because it gets thrown around every time there’s a new acquisition. But in a world where they bought any studio that popped up, I can’t really see any negative ramifications for consumers.	1642550584.0	s7bz5j	/r/changemyview/comments/s7bz5j/cmv_monopolies_in_industries_that_dont_have_a/	CMV: Monopolies in industries that don’t have a high barrier to entry aren’t necessarily bad.
c3l3v	First of all, I'm not a covid denier. I'm fully vaccinated and boosted, and wore a mask in public, indoor settings until the vaccine was universally available.     That said, I'm extremely skeptical that COVID-19 causes long-term symptoms more than any other viral illness that can cause a post-viral syndrome. The primary symptoms include (but are not limited to), fatigue, brain fog, GI issues ([https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html)), which are the exact sort of non-specific symptoms commonly caused by anxiety or depression (as a sufferer of somatization since well-before COVID, I'm pretty familiar with this, and don't belittle people who suffer from it).     I've done research using PubMed, PLoS and my university's library, and I can't find anything explaining why COVID is more likely to cause a post-viral syndrome than other viruses. I can't find much that even seriously asks the question of whether there is a psychiatric etiology. I do frequently see Eric Feigl-Dings apparently outlandish claims about long covid, including today's "airborne HIV" claim.     So, change my view. Convince me that long-covid is more often than not a unique post-viral syndrome that is unlike and more severe than those caused by influenza, Epstein-Barr, etc.	1642554614.0	s7dfmx	/r/changemyview/comments/s7dfmx/cmv_most_but_not_all_cases_of_long_covid_are/	CMV: Most (but not all) cases of long covid are psychosomatic
95y0cp71	I literally just don't understand how these two separate identities could coexist in one. I've been having discussions with others about it, but I'm struggling to actually get their perspective without things getting volitile. If the definition for bi lesbian, for example, is a woman/woman-aligned person who is attracted to multiple woman-aligned genders, isn't that just a lesbian? And how on earth does a straight lesbian/gay make sense?

4jd1qejv	when i first saw fully online degrees for positions like nurses and physician assistants, i was confused about how they exist. i’m not talking about the ones that require students to attend clinical and labs, but the ones that are totally on a computer watching videos and stuff.  real life experience is crucial for these students to gain a firm understanding of how to apply their knowledge to patients. while reading information is useful to gain knowledge, it’s not useful if you get a job and have no idea how to use it. personally, i would not visit a healthcare professional who never had any in-person training because it simply seems too unsafe to have someone work on my body parts with no hands-on training and potentially do some medical malpractice.  the lack of human interaction is also a pitfall with fully online programs. these allied healthcare professionals need to talk to different kinds of patients constantly on the job and a lack of communication irl is not going to help with that, much like the issue with students in general lacking social competence after being online for so long.  Another potential drawback that is sometimes applicable is that some of these fully online schools are for-profit, which most employers will take as a scam education and disregard the “degree” in the first place.

6v6b3	Basically, the title says it all. I truly believe Tobey Maguire is the best Peter Parker. While I go back and forth between Andrew Garfield and Tom Holland being the best Spiderman, I don’t believe anyone could convince me that Tobey’s Peter Parker is not the best  The go-to argument is always that Tobey’s Peter was weak and a crybaby, but that’s exactly what I think makes him the best. The juxtaposition between mild-mannered Peter and confident web-slinger is so clear with him. Garfield barely changes his personality when he puts on the suit. He’s way too cool and confident as Peter. Other than spouting some science babble, we barely even see that he’s intelligent.   And with Tom, he’s nerdy and awkward, but there’s so much charm in him. He had friends who love him and crave his company. Everyone gets upset when he leaves the math team. He’s loveable and his peers respect him.   This isn’t Peter Parker! In the comics, Peter is a loser who gets dumped on constantly. People look through him. People don’t respect him. That’s why he gets to live out his altar ego as Spider-Man.   I’m looking forward to hearing some opinions and hopefully changing my view.	1642558733.0	s7ev67	/r/changemyview/comments/s7ev67/cmv_even_if_not_the_best_spiderman_tobey_maguire/	CMV: Even if not the best Spiderman, Tobey Maguire is the best and most faithful Peter Parker
632m9lwu	When I say the "in-person" equivalent, I mean specifically approaching someone in-person and flirting with them/asking them out, most likely in a bar, park, or some other such setting.  One of the biggest advantages of online dating is the fact that it's a space that's designated for making romantic (or sexual) connections; when you log onto Tinder, OkCupid, Hinge, Bumble, PoF, etc., you essentially know exactly what everyone else is on there for. If someone wants something (that they assume to be) beyond the norm, it's easy enough to add it in a profile (i.e.: no hookups, just looking for friends, nothing serious, etc.).   Meanwhile, meeting people in person and asking for a date/showing your interest in someone requires a lot of "cold-calling;" approaching people in the hopes of scoring a date when they're just trying to live their lives. I've read that women hate the feeling that they can't move about in public spaces without some guy hitting on them. This leads to anxiety and fear, as many men don't gracefully accept rejection.   Of course, not everyone looking for a date and/or relationship does so through so-called "cold-calling." In fact, one of the advantages of in-person dating is that it allows for prior relationships and exposure in a way that online dating cannot. But from experience, I know that having a prior friendship with someone doesn't make it any more likely that they'll be open to dating you; in fact, I've found it to be quite the opposite. When someone enters into a friendship with you, it isn't predicated on the belief that they'll ask you out down the line. They might not have any interest in being anything more than friends with you, so if you make it known you want more, even if you back off, it can cause undue strain on the friendship. Again, it's a problem of two people expecting different things, leading to anxiety and grief.  Thus, I find online dating more ethical because you aren't putting undue anxiety on stress on someone who doesn't want to be romantically approached. Online dating's more ethical because almost everyone on a dating site is there for the same thing, unlike in a bar.  And to be completely clear, even as someone who thinks online dating is a lot less awkward, unethical than the alternative, I hate it, so I'm very open to the idea that it's not as black-and-white as I believe.	1642562642.0	s7g6hr	/r/changemyview/comments/s7g6hr/cmv_online_dating_is_more_ethical_than_the/	CMV: Online Dating is More Ethical than the In-Person Equivalent
qotaigt	There's this test that has been done on different kids every year from 2011 that measures their IQ. It's about 650 kids that are tested, and a [study](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.10.21261846v1.full.pdf?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=4_TDkskPZpMQ6tBUwcm0xQIhLnkb6RNrE4oKkDCIHvU-1642565765-0-gaNycGzNB2U) tabulated these results on a graph.

Language changes as new concepts need to be expressed and the current words don't do it, or if groups of people are separted fro a long time. The english of the 1700s is still readable to modern speakers, but is subtly in a LOT of ways. And frankly the standards for being a "real" word aren't that high anyway, I mean if "D'oh", an entirely fictional word invented in a cartoon can be in the Oxford Dictorary, I don't think adding neopronouns is a huge stretch  **It ain't broke, don't fix it**  This argument basically states that they/them is good enough for LGBTQ+ people so we don't need neopronouns. I disagree because they/them is too vague. Is "they" 1 person or a group? There is also not "formal" version of they/them like he/she have sir and ma'am. Neopronouns make pronouns for LGBTQ+ people more in line with the more specific he/she instead of the somewhat vague they/them.  **It's too obsurce**  This is another very weak argument in my opinion, it basically claims that LGBTQ+ people are so rare that it doesn't make sense to dedicate a whole word to it, my objection is that a LOT of obsurce words exist that nobody is clamering to say aren't valid. In fact iirc english has the world's largest vocabulary, I mean when was the last time you said idk "balter". Does it's obsurity mean that it should be cut from the english langauge?  **It's too inconvienent**  This argument claims that neopronouns are basically too difficult and inconvienent to use so we shouldn't use them. This is pretty BS in my opinion. The average person reading this post has a vocabulary of around 20,000 to 30,000 words, and adding 1 more isn't really *that* difficult. And frankly if it's too inconvienent for you to take 5 minutes out of your day to learn a simple set of words to address someone properly, that's kind of a personal problem in my opinion.  Anyway, Please CMV on why neopronouns are bad!	1642566881.0	s7hlem	/r/changemyview/comments/s7hlem/cmv_there_is_no_problem_with_neopronouns/	CMV: There is no problem with neopronouns

If everyone had access to food and a comfortable home all the time, I think many people would coast when they could contribute more.  People who work harder deserve more. Homeless shelters should be the base line. And then if you want to work harder, standard of living goes up from there. So we will never solve poverty.  I definitely want someone to change my view on this because I feel like a bad person. But my leftist friends seem to think everyone is equally selfish and there is no evil in the world. It’s just not accurate.

4b0aw5oa	I rate myself near C1 after studying the English language for more than a decade. It has been a truly remarkable journey, especially seeing how far I progressed. As such, are there any benefits to dedicate another year or so to reach C2? It would be quite an arduous task since I would need a strict regimen of reading and writing on a daily basis.  It is already a massive undertaking forcing myself to read a couple chapters of a book every night, let alone release a writing sample and ask for feedback. Would you say that most people can get by in the U.S. with just C1 proficiency, or would they need to aim for C2 if they want a high-paying office position?  After sending out copious amounts of job applications for a government position, many of which asked for a writing sample, I have started to see dramatic improvements in my English writing skills. From what I have heard, many applicants detest a writing sample requirement in job applications, so quite a few would avoid these positions outright. That gives me an advantage because I see writing samples as killing two birds with one stone. I get to improve my writing skills while having a higher chance of scoring an interview.  English skills are important, and my views had been reinforced after seeing how poor many people write, even at a professional workplace. This is the reason why I am redoubling my efforts to strengthen my literary vocabulary and sentence structure in my writing.  That being said, I am still pondering whether to commit the time and resources to reach C2, which is considered to be god-level of English proficiency. Can I even do it alone? Would I need academic precision to achieve such a daunting goal?   There are so many questions currently on how to proceed.  I had worked with many Chinese immigrants during my last two years of employment, and they are quite situated with their current level of English. I gauged their English level to be a high B2 to low C1, and they mostly have plateau due to lack of effort or motivation to improve.	1642570591.0	s7iqch	/r/changemyview/comments/s7iqch/cmv_for_a_foreigner_there_is_little_benefit_to/	CMV: For a foreigner, there is little benefit to investing the amount of time and effort to get their English level to a C2 level.
4wxs10iy	I believe most political issues are too complex for the majority of people to understand and weigh the pros and cons properly. I’d say this for politics on a federal level and probably even at a local level to a lesser degree (In the US at least).  For example, lots of political conversations revolve around the economy but I’d wager most people have a very basic understanding of economics. This is likely true of many topics such as military spending, health care, etc.  Additionally, a substantial amount of  media personalities engage in rhetoric to market ideas to you, so it’s easier than ever to be manipulated into taking a position on a topic that you don’t fully understand.  With limited understanding how can we be expected to know how much money the government can afford to spend, what impact military spending may or may not have on preventing or causing war, etc?  Now this may seem like an appeal to futility, and perhaps it is, but idk how we can possibly expect good societal results from a population that doesn’t understand issues or the costs associated with the strategies we use to deal with them.   I have never voted and have bounced around different political ideologies the last several years so I’d like to think I’m open minded.

60yo2ph4	i’m in my early twenties. i graduated with a BA in 2020 from a decent school i guess.   i haven’t been able to find full time well paying employment.   i changed my name and moved to a large city (think LA, NYC, London, etc) to run from my old life. Left everyone behind.   i can’t stand that i’ve been unemployed for nearly two years. two years of stress and searching and coming up so dry. i’ve gotten freelancing stuff and a job at a restaurant but nothing in my field which brings me to the point…  i don’t even care what field i work in anymore. i’m so unhappy that all my passion for everything is gone. all i care about is making money.   i daydream constantly about a better life where i’m richer, skinnier, have a SO, have a normal family instead of my toxic mom and absent dad.   i was assaulted and can’t build normal relationships anymore.   i can’t stand my life. i feel like a loser and a failure. i wish i could be someone else or at least be in less pain. i’m barely avoiding debt and everyone else seems to be fucking thriving with purpose and all. i’m so unhappy.   please help me get outside my head and CMV about this. i know i am in a rut and need other perspectives.	1642571350.0	s7iya6	/r/changemyview/comments/s7iya6/cmv_i_am_a_loser/	CMV: i am a loser.
9hmvwt6z	As you might know, there's a bit of an issue with insider trading in Congress. Until 2012, it wasn't even illegal since congressmen were government officials and not official corporate insiders.  But it's not just insider trading. In fact, it's probably not even the biggest issue. The real issue at hand is the conflict of interest. If Congressmen are concerned with how their stocks are doing, they may be deterred from passing any kind of regulatory law which will affect them, making our country a bit closer to a corporatocracy. Presidents are expected to put their assets into blind trusts upon taking office to avoid conflicts of interest. Maybe congressmen should be expected to do the same.	1642571401.0	s7iysd	/r/changemyview/comments/s7iysd/cmv_congressmen_should_not_be_able_to_trade/	CMV: Congressmen should not be able to trade stocks period
gk12urbh	Hey guys! I was watching a documentary about the discrimination of roma people and decided to do some extra research online, I didn't like what I found. Even here on Reddit there is loads of people passing judgement about how roma's are thieves and lazy bums sitting at home, living off welfare while popping out kids (see any similarities of this stereotype to the "welfare queen"). Seriously if you replaced "roma" with "black" with some of this stuff, it would fit right in place at a KKK rally! To my understanding this is a very common attitude, especially in Eastern Europe, personally I find this disgusting and quite hypocritical consider these are often the same people who are very quick to pass judgement on America's race issues. I knew a roma person once and I can attest to the fact that roma's need help and support, not discrimination! Please CMV!

I dont know why people say "There are worse illness out there, be grateful" but this feels like hell on earth. I mean I am not underestimating other illness, I am just triyng to see how its better to think about this counter argument such as "You are lucky you dont have x or y" even though this is really bad.

5as6eho4	Ok hear me out, and stop typing "PEDO" or whatever in the comments, I know you wanna.  I don't know how I went down this rabbit hole but I decided to look into the porn industry, not for me but just out of fascination. But their lack of regulation and the horror stories that almost every pornstar told, just made me genuinely sick. Hearing things about how much non-consensual activity goes on and about how it destroys the actor/actresses careers later in life, is just not okay.   The porn industry is just not acceptable in its current condition.  But it's also something I've become accustomed to having in my life so, while it didn't feel great consuming standard porn, I wanted some kind of substitute.  Enter hentai... God I feel horrible saying this, BUT ITS TRUE. Hentai manages to eliminate the unusually high chance of sexual assault in the industry by well... getting rid of the people, and allows for anonymity for the aritist(s), making it a lot less destructive for them.  However, I also can't deny that hentai has its own problems. It tends to be a lot more kinky, in the sense that it allows more extreme fetishes. Naturally this might emphasis the already large problem with standard pornography, that it romanticizes unrealistic experiences.   I'm sure it has other problems that I can't think of, and I'm sure the artists aren't treated great in a lot of cases, but sadly that tends to be the case with artists in any situation. But I feel the pros outweigh the cons.  TL:DR I believe hentai eliminates a lot of problems with the porn industry by not having actors/actresses.  Edit: A lot of people made good points, though I still believe I'm correct. I've got to go now, so expect fewer replies.  Edit 2: OK so, here is how my view has changed. A lot of the discussion shifted towards how porn is consumed rather than my intention which was to talk about how its produced. Still there were some great subjects brought up. I think the main takeaway is that we should all be aware of what we consume, in regards to how it effects both ourselves and those who produce it.  However, I still believe in a watered down less clickable version of my title which is: Animated porn is more ethically produced than standard real life porn.	1642601840.0	s7r2vr	/r/changemyview/comments/s7r2vr/cmv_hentai_is_ethical_porn/	CMV: Hentai is ethical porn
epae7	Race is a protected class. It is illegal to discriminate on hiring, school, and housing based on race. So I don't understand why the race question is legally allowed on these types of applications. They certainly don't ask for religion. Having a race question on the application officially unblinds the process. Receivers of the applications might be be able to figure out the race anyway based on the name, but at a minimum, it increases the cost of doing of doing so. We should not make it easier for institutions to be racist.  Posting from the USA.  EDIT - my OP is about making it illegal to put on all applications, not specifically about job applications.  EDIT - adding my personal experience. I was recently asked to put down my race for a mortgage application. Since it was covid and done over the phone, the banker (apologetically) read the disclaimer that if I choose not to answer, a selection would be picked for me based on other information on my application, or physical apperance.

68693pnz	I'm mostly talking about the U.K. and Japan of which I know it is done there, but I'm sure there are other cases.  I grew up in the Netherlands, where there were no school uniforms, and certainly no bare legs. Almost everyone wore trousers. The idea of not only requiring this, but onnly requiring it for half the students based on their sex seems outright barbaric to me:  - It is cold - To me, it appears as needless sexualization of often very young students to require them to expose this much of their skin - It is impractical as the skirts generally lack pockets  I cannot understand how this can occur in a modern nation; perhaps in a country without unisex suffrage. Such a thing would only happen in very religious towns in the Netherlands where the opinion is indeed in against unisex suffrage. Outside of it, if a school were to require such a thing, both student and parent alike would not have it, and the courts would surely shut it down immediately as both cruel and sexist.  Of course, similar arguments can be raised against the practice of requiring very short trousers, which are less common. — I do not understand how the adults in charge with a straight face can tell the children they are required to expose their legs for no good reason when full length trousers exist.	1642622967.0	s7z7eu	/r/changemyview/comments/s7z7eu/cmv_i_cannot_understand_how_a_modern_developed/	CMV: I cannot understand how a modern developed nation can require skirts with bare legs as part of a school uniform, and only for some students
7mp3u5u	On Privacy  TLDR: Give your partners some privacy, if you trust them.  All too often we treat private and reserved individuals as suspicious, especially if we feel that we have a close relationship with them. Some assume they are entitled to all details of the person's personal life since, given the close relationship, they should have nothing to hide. This idea, which may appear healthy and conducive to a good relationship, turns out to be a bit toxic. I can only imagine that this idea,  that “One should/would be open, if they have nothing to hide”, is the NSA’s motto. It's what the FBI agent tracking your activity tells himself to justify his work. It's probably written in latin somewhere on the Patriot Act. We are entitled to privacy in our platonic and romantic relationships because we will not wield it maliciously, we understand and respect one another's personality/character and it gives us room to grow as individuals.  This idea is known popularly as the Nothing to hide argument and one of the earliest instances of this argument being made is by Henry James. In his novel he states “If these people had done bad things they ought to be ashamed of themselves and he couldn’t pity them, and if they hadn’t done them there was no need of making such a rumpus about other people knowing.” Although not explicitly stated, the idea that “One should/would be open, if they have nothing to hide” implies that something hidden is inherently wrong. This is mistaken. Just because something is hidden does not mean it is malicious, nor harmful. In fact, there are often many things that are hidden that are good. Parties, new skills, and gifts all retain this air of mystery yet they are all ultimately beneficial and appreciated. Besides the “good hidden” another viable possibility for hidden things is complete neutrality to the curious party. Why must I disclose information that is irrelevant to you? Ultimately, it is just as likely for something “bad hidden” to be something “good hidden” or something “neutral hidden”. It is up to the curious party to determine where they perceive the hidden lies, and their determination is a reflection of what they believe will happen if privacy is granted. If they trust you, they should have nothing to worry about and should cease to pry once that boundary is laid.  Being private is a quality of a person’s character and the opposite of which is being an open book. Their dichotomy has no moral/ethical implications. It is not wrong to be private any more than it is wrong to be an open book. There are some qualities that do have moral implications. Being dirty is wrong compared to being clean which is good. Being selfish is wrong versus being considerate which is good. The characteristics of Private versus Open, however, do not share this moral feature just as being passive vs being aggressive do not.  Reserved, open, passive or aggressive can be either good or bad given the right context. If the people around you claim to love and understand you, they will respect attributes of your personality. Given people’s ardent faith in their ideals we may grant them the leeway to try to change your personality into theirs, but to antagonize your reserved character, to label it as inherently wrong, is vile.  It isn’t uncommon to lose oneself in a relationship. You and your partner begin to share everything and there is hardly a moment of separation. Even if there is a moment your partner may feel entitled to an explanation of how you spent the separation because the two of you are so close and, as stated, share everything, including information. We conjoin with one another and sacrifice pieces of ourselves, particularly privacy, in order to form a close bond, but if we “stay merged… you’ll end up losing yourself in your relationship”. (Muzik) The process of separating from one another to understand who we are as individuals within the relationship is called “individuation”. Individuation is critical to any profound relationship and requires giving each other the privacy necessary to find ourselves over and over again. In a perfect world, individuation always works out and the result is a new kind of love for the evolved person that your partner has developed into given the privacy you granted one another; it can be the greatest surprise.  If the info is important to your partner and their circumstances then it should not be withheld. If the info is not important and they believe its not important you are not obligated to disclose anything. Some partners may argue “if it’s not important, why don't you just tell me?” but they contradict themselves. They say its not important, but its important enough for them to ask you; its important enough for them to continue trying to pry; its important enough for them to judge and label you if you don’t acquiesce.  Lastly, I’ll explain how this notion that you are even “hiding” something is mistaken. If you walk into your room looking for a stapler, but it is not in plain sight, then it is hidden. Just because it is hidden, doesn't mean you were hiding it; you just like to keep your stapler inside your desk. To take the example a bit further, say it's not your room. Now, in order to find the stapler, you have to ask the room’s owner where it is, and they’ll probably tell you because they understand that the stapler is most likely important for whatever they’re doing. But let's say you’re looking for something you have no business with, why must the owner reveal its location to you? Why must you be told something you have no business knowing? They are not hiding anything that wasn’t already hidden, but you are prying, invading their privacy to satisfy your curiosity. Behavior like this does not contribute to a positive and healthy relationship. Privacy is critical and builds upon the foundation of trust you should already have with your partner.  https://www.loveatfirstfight.com/relationship-advice/privacy-secrecy/ - Muzik  Let me know if you disagree and why.	1642626308.0	s80imm	/r/changemyview/comments/s80imm/cmv_you_and_your_partner_should_have_privacy/	CMV: You and your partner should have privacy.

5qilhdwo	So the YMCA where I live (and according to the staff there) is the standard at all of locations to base membership fees on age or last years tax returns is insanely invasive and should not be allowed. So I walked in last year to my local YMCA it’s a very nice facility. One Olympic sized pool. A smaller heated pool. Indoor small track. Full suite of gym stuff two basketball courts, workout classes that come with the membership and a sauna and steam room. (The steam room is what got me excited about joining)  So I walk in I ask to be a member they ask me how old I am? I say 30 they say okay so it’s $65 a month. I was concerned so I said what if I was 29? “Oh then it would be $40” I was puzzled he went on to say “because you’re 30 we assume you make more $ than you did at ages 20-29 so we charge more. I was like okay what if I don’t tell you my age? He said oh then we would need a copy of your w9 and we can base your fee on that. If you make <60 as a household it’s $75 a month. This is madness I can understand helping those that can’t afford it or don’t have income.

Your life has been decided from the very beginning thanks to many circumstances you can't control such as: Your sex, your race, your social status, your nationality, your religion (if you have any), your appearance, your health, etc. You didn't choose any of these circunstances and yet they affect every part of your life. This is the reality of things: Many good people will be born with horrible circumstances and they will suffer their entire lives while the exact opposite is true for many evil people.

I was reading up and the CIA black sites and all that and I am of the opinion that torture, in all it's forms is completely and totally unacceptable no exceptions, I also believe that everyone who was complicit/participated in torturing people, from the president(s) all the way down to the lowest enlisted person should be charged.   I don't believe its really effective as if someone is so zealous to become a terrorist and risk their life in the first place, torture likely won't convince them. I also believe that it gives the president wayyyy too much power to be able to torture people, especially when the rules for declaring someone a "terrorist" are *extremely* loose in the first place. What would stop the president from declaring some political rival  a "terrorist" an having them tortured in a black site without even a trial!  Just being declared a "suspected terrorist" should not mean the constitution doesn't apply, I would abolish black sites and extraterritorial rendition (it's obvious their only purpose is to skirt around the 8th amendment).

sygzk	Losing weight is simple, but not easy. It’s simple because all you have to do is eat less calories. It’s not easy because we lie to ourselves and/or fail to perform this feat.  I’ve always been on the fence about this issue because I’ve heard convincing arguments that sometimes weight is just natural or there is a “homeostasis” where the body maintains it’s weight. I’ve also heard arguments around decreasing consumption lowering metabolism leading to no change in body.  However as a recent new dog owner whose puppy was “overweight” according to the vet, making my dog lose weight has been incredibly simple, and I am seeing the results 2-3weeks later. All I’ve done is give her less food. Nothing else. Is the human body so different from a dog’s that this process doesn’t work?  So CMV: if you eat less calories you will lose weight.   Edit1: so far seems like most people are saying this is simply a fact so perhaps I have set up a strawman here. However the absolute beast that is the weight loss and nutrition industry as well as 40% obesity are hints to me that not everyone really believes this fact?  Edit2: still, no one arguing against the view. Just statements about how hard it is mentally, physically. Does no one think that there are any other factors? Where are all the people who I’ve seen argue that eating less does not lead to weight loss? Did I just create these people up in my mind? This thread telling me everyone internally understands this concept but just can’t execute? Maybe I should close this thread, really doesn’t seem like any controversy around it. I guess the answer is everyone knows what to do but can’t do it, so go to the weight loss industry for easier (but fake) solutions?  Edit3: “Losing weight is simple BUT NOT EASY” “BUT NOT EASY” “BUT NOT EASY”. Do people even read the OP? Stop telling me it’s not easy! I’ve already said it’s not easy.

eji8mzr7	I’ve seen this a lot in the past few months, regardless of how you feel, I feel like it’s very easy to understand why anyone with empathy would feel like this kid is on his way to becoming another symbol of hatred.  The biggest argument his supporters use to claim he isn’t a white supremacist is that he shoot 3 white guys, which is a grossly fallacious argument. The intent of confronting those men who were at that time associated with BLM, real or perceived, is the reason why people insist he is a white supremacist. We accept the confederacy is built on white supremacist ideals despite the fact their body count is mainly of white men. It’s the intent behind killing those white men, seeing them on the “Wrong side” with those “Pesky” blacks and natives, that makes them bigots. Even if you feel like Rittenhouse is not that, it shouldn’t be hard to understand why someone would feel that way.  So insisting that the mere idea is ridiculous, rather than saying it’s incorrect, is unconstructed and trollish. Many of these types like to deny being racist or bigoted in face of clear evidence that they are with the goal of pushing those intolerant ideas. Anyone truly concerned about elf defense or the media would try to use logical arguments to explain why Kyle isn’t one, not claim anyone who thinks he is is fucked in the mind. Those guys are the monsters that Rittenhouse's opponents are afraid of. And a lot of them were just happy to see who died.  Many white supremacists have done the exact same thing, for different reasons. The idea that he is one, right or wrong, is not completely insane.  Edit: Someone here brought up a perfect analogy. Imagine you're caught with your pants down in front of a child, someone catches you and you claim it's not what it looks like. Even if it truly isn't, anyone who hears about it has a right to assume the worst and they have a right to be disgusted.

jdqhe	I came across this [poll](https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/jan_2022/crosstabs_heartland_covid_january_5_2022), in which of Democrats surveyed:  1. 45% strongly favored or somewhat favored having federal or state governments require that citizens temporarily live in designated facilities or locations if they refuse to get a COVID-19 vaccine. 2. 48% strongly favored or somewhat favored a proposal for federal or state governments to fine or imprison individuals who publicly question the efficacy of the existing COVID-19 vaccines on social media, television, radio, or in online or digital publications. 3. 29% strongly favored of somewhat favored a proposal to temporarily remove parents’ custody of their children if parents refuse to take the COVID-19 vaccine.  Now I am very much in favor of getting as many people as possible vaccinated, and abhor anyone spreading covid misinformation. I hold both of these positions because I believe it is in society's best interest to beat covid, and I genuinely wish for as many people as possible to thrive. In the same vein, I am horrified that concentrating unvaxxed, denying first amendment rights, and separating children from parents is seen as an acceptable solution to anyone. If it was just a few small percentages I would dismiss these as fringe views, but I am shocked at how prevalent these views seem to be.  So please CMV. As a proud member of the Democratic Party I do not want to believe that so many of my ilk are driven by hate of the unvaccinated. I would most like to be convinced that I am not understanding this polling well, or that I should not trust the results. But otherwise please convince me that the positions I listed above are not as vindictive and harmful as I believe.	1642634743.0	s83tox	/r/changemyview/comments/s83tox/cmv_the_vitriol_democrats_have_to_the/	CMV: The vitriol Democrats have to the unvaccinated is terrifying.
8iskmbxm	In browsing r/space and the like there seem to be some issues with humans being in space that are going to need to be addressed by either selectively breeding or by more direct genetic modifications of humans.  We already have to be very selective about who goes into orbit for any significant length of time. Travellers to other planets will have to be even more specialised.   ISS crew have adverse health outcomes due to no gravity and probably other unusual environmental factors that we simply haven’t evolved to deal with. Interplanetary travel is only going to worsen these and add more issues.   While these issues may be able to be addressed using technology within space craft, I think the easier path will be to modify the humans to cope.   So it’s arguably whether normal humans will ever step on the surface of another planet. There’s no need to ship a whole bunch of fragile humans to other planets when you can send a smallish number of altered humans and get them breeding.  Edit: fixed grammar  u/seanflyon given delta as reminded me that ISS trips are as long as the transit to Mars so that blows my theory apart. It was mainly the concern of zero G during the trip which is a risk but an already tolerated risk.   I feel dumb now but also more excited that I might get to see humans on Mars in my lifetime.	1642640431.0	s85vka	/r/changemyview/comments/s85vka/cmv_humans_will_not_travel_to_other_planets/	CMV: Human’s will not travel to other planets without being genetically modified.
he7a2yma	The average life expectancy for a male in the U.S. is what, 75 years old? That means if a man has children at age 55 he'll potentially have 20 years with them - assuming he's in good health. He might be able to squeeze out an additional 10 - 15 years old life which means that he'll be leaving his kids behind when they're in they're 30's which is still far too young.  Men having children beyond the age of 50 limits the length of their interaction with their kids. It is also a burden for the children because having an elderly parent means that they likely lack the energy to do fun, engaging activities.  If a man has a child at age 30 then there is no guarantee that he will live long enough to see his kids reach their 40's. However, he is definitely more likely to see that than a 50 year old man is.  I understand that it's "not about how much time you spend with your kids here on Earth, but how much love you show them while you're here" but I think it's unfair to put them in a predicament in which they more than likely have a limited amount of time with you.	1642646218.0	s87v8l	/r/changemyview/comments/s87v8l/cmv_men_having_children_after_the_age_of_50_is/	CMV: Men having children after the age of 50 is unfair to the child
49ibpg2e	I don't see what 'modesty' is going to achieve. I'm not saying there isn't any reason, I'm saying all the reasons are reasons I don't care for. For example, some claim god wants us to be modest. And I am going to use this as an example because I don't want you to convince me out of this. Any reason but this, since it will turn into a discussion about the existence of god.  So yes, I'm willing to change my mind, I just think anything about religion is gonna do it.  What can convince me: if it's demonstrated for example, as I often hear, that women covering up will deter rape. It doesn't. I can't think of any reason to care if people are 'modest' or not.  What is it you are trying to avoid? What is the goal? For example, dress codes in construction sites, ie hard hats, prevent your head from getting even more hurt than without a hat.  If modestly dressed, then...?  I obviously can't list my entire likes and dislikes on here, so I'm gonna leave it a bit more open, but I've heard plenty that just aren't convincing. If modestly dressed, then rape decrease. I do care about decreasing rape, however, no evidence show clothes matter. And even if it did, that is not the ideal solution. I believe the ideal solution is life in prison for them to never reoffend. And even if that doesn't work, I still don't think clothes prevent rape or even deter.	1642649221.0	s88vz6	/r/changemyview/comments/s88vz6/cmv_there_isnt_any_convincing_goal_that_should_be/	CMV: There isn't any convincing goal that should be achieved by policing or caring about people's clothes in terms of modesty
9hmvwt6z	As you probably already know, we don't vote in the president directly but rather through the electoral college. There are actually 50 presidential election for who the electors are. On December 14, the electors cast their votes and the new president is chosen.  I am going to list my reasons for opposing this system:  **1. It's undemocratic**  A lot of people say that the US is not a democracy but rather a republic. However, that just means that we vote for people to make laws on our behalf. Directly electing the president would not change that. The founding fathers wrote about their fears of democracy but we've come a long way since then. Back in the day, only property owners could vote. Over time, suffrage was expanded to other groups like women and non whites. This is actually an argument against ballot measures, not for the electoral college.  **2. Winner take all**  Probably the most commonly cited reason in favor of the EC is that it protects states with smaller populations. It does not do that.  Roughly half of Americans live in 10 states. In a worst case scenario for a national popular vote, 10 states would get half of the attention. In the 2020 election, 12 states got 96% of the attention  [https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/map-general-election-campaign-events-and-tv-ad-spending-2020-presidential-candidates](https://www.nationalpopularvote.com/map-general-election-campaign-events-and-tv-ad-spending-2020-presidential-candidates)  This was actually worse in previous elections in which just four states would receive 2/3 of the attention.  Every state except Maine and Nebraska allocate their electors on a winner-take-all basis. This means that regardless of margin, the winning candidate gets every single elector. It's even worse than that when you remember that we live in a first past the post voting system, meaning that you don't even need to receive a majority of the votes to win every single elector. Perhaps the reason why Trump won the EC but lost the popular vote was because of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Trump didn't win a majority in any of those three states but he still got more votes than Hillary.  Because of this, presidential campaigns are incentivized to focus a lot of attention on what are referred to as swing states. This means that for whatever reason, the state switches sides every so often. Safe states are ignored because no amount of attention will change them or it would be a waste of time. It's either a guaranteed win or a lost cause. You don't really need to spend time convincing your supporters to actually turn out unless they live in swing states. This has a few implications. One implication is that candidates often seek to court the midwest because that's where a lot of swing states are concentrated. This means promising to bring the manufacturing jobs back in an era of globalization. Another implication is keeping the Cuba embargo because Cuban Americans (who tend to support it) are clustered in Florida (a swing state). Back in 1835, there was a minor skirmish between Michigan and Ohio over a disputed region. President Andrew Jackson personally sided with Michigan but ultimately remained neutral because Ohio was (and continues to be) a swing state.  Swing states ultimately make the EC less equitable than a simple popular vote  **3. So what**  A big deal is made over the possibility of a popular vote leaving out small states like Wyoming and Vermont. Our current system already does this but that's beside the point. The argument seems to rest in the idea that states are people and representing some states over others is unfair. The purpose of government is to improve the welfare of its citizens. If more citizens live in one state, it makes sense that it would receive more attention. If all men should have an equal voice, maybe 10 states getting half of the attention wouldn't be such a bad thing after all.  Land doesn't vote, people do.  We're also presuming that the president has absolute power and we're completely ignoring Congress which is made up by people from every single state.	1642650052.0	s8960f	/r/changemyview/comments/s8960f/cmv_we_should_abolish_the_electoral_college/	CMV: We should abolish the electoral college

Cutting class may have a bad rep, but in their case, I don't think it would be a bad thing. They are essentially adults, so they can make their own decisions.

4fif06la	I live in a country that acknowledges multiple religions, and does not side with any.    Back at the creation of the country they declared alegience to one major religion (let's call em X), but due to the eastern part of the country threatening to secede (the majority of the eastern part is not of X religion), the country decided not to take sides.   The reality now is (although technically not an X-religious country by the books) 80% of the country's leader had been from said religion (and of one specific ethnicity, coming from the same region). Folks of the eastern part had barely any representation in media, and their economics are in the dirt. Life has been difficult for people other than X religion, because certain laws just don't apply to folks of X religion (thanks to corrupt officials).   It's been nothing but miserable for religious minorities, because the country and it's officials would not uphold equality, despite ignoring oppression (and terrorism done in the past by certain goverment parties) done by that very religion/culture.    As a victim of this phenomenon, I feel strongly that the government and its bodies has to either be secular, or admit itself of being a certain religion. I'd rather my government admit to being of X religion, rather than pretend to be protecting the minorities	1642653115.0	s8a67l	/r/changemyview/comments/s8a67l/cmv_any_nation_that_declares_its_acknowledgment/	CMV: any nation that declares its acknowledgment of more than one religion has to either state itself as a religious nation, or a secular nation.
1twb4yd7	Basically the title. Low minimum wage means businesses are not as driven to find efficiencies and be innovative, at least in terms of HR costs. I think that this lack of a forcing function is having a stagnating effect on business practices in general. I know this is a gross oversimplification but I cannot help but dwell on this. If there was a clone of America where the minimum wage had increased at least with inflation then I believe that place would have a much more efficiency oriented business sense. By keeping wages low, business's can afford to have unorganised and inefficient labour. In the long term this could be detrimental as instead of developing gradual or incremental efficiencies companies are forced to deal with sharp increases in labour such as we have seen lately but without the internal mechanisms or culture to address it.	1642654937.0	s8ar5g	/r/changemyview/comments/s8ar5g/cmv_by_failing_to_raise_the_minimum_wage_american/	CMV: By failing to raise the minimum wage, American business (as a whole) is optimising for cheap labour and not efficiency which will be harmful for long term business practices/culture.
gw92lk27	This is not a view that I originally held, but after looking at the mountains of evidence supporting this view my stance has changed. My new view is that so much of dating and relationships is based on appearance that if you are an unattractive man it might be better to give up, as difficult as it is, and accept that you will probably never find love. It's sad and it brings me no joy to say it, but reality doesn't conform to fantasy.  If women approached men, things might not be so bleak, but because that generally isn't the case especially if you're an unattractive man, you are forced to chase (if you want a partner.) How much rejection a person can handle depends on the person, but it's hard to be rejected over and over again when the chances of finding love are so low.  I would like this view changed, because it's depressing. Even typing this I feel depressed. I can come up with counter explanations to black pill studies all day, but the idea that hypothetically a finding could mean something else if I jump through enough mental hoops is not enough to dissuade me from the idea that black Pillers are correct-at least one of their primary claims, that looks matter most.  Past studies that I've seen seem to find that women are more in agreement about which men are attractive and which are not than men are about women. So unfortunately even "different people find different things attractive" doesn't really seem to apply.  I look forward to hearing your responses. If a CMV post could change my mind about this, it can change again. I'm hoping it does.	1642662252.0	s8cxd9	/r/changemyview/comments/s8cxd9/cmv_a_mans_looks_are_the_most_important_thing_in/	CMV: A man's looks are the most important thing in dating and relationships.

4n5huvo3	Lets focus on the environmental impacts of using cotton tote bags compared to single use plastic bags.  1. Less plastic pollution. If you are using tote bags, the only plastic waste you eliminate is plastic bags used for shopping and  groceries. However, in a developed country, with efficient/effective waste management, this plastic will not (or at least should not) make it to the natural environment. Every plastic bag thrown into a rubbish bin should end up either in a landfill or incinerated, and not in the seas or forests. Less developed countries of Asia and Africa generate most of the worlds ocean plastic waste, and Europe, Oceania and North America are the three smallest contributors. The Philippines contribute more than 30% alone.   2. Larger carbon footprint. Oil/plastic is far denser than cotton, so much more can be transported for the same amount of fuel by sea/land. In terms of production, you can produce hundreds of single use plastic bags for the energy used to produce one reusable cotton bag. Even if the plastic bag ends up burned in an incinerator, the carbon produced is still insignificant compared to that needed to produce one cotton tote. The figures differ based on where you live, but cotton tote bags are minimally 100x more carbon intensive than plastic. Cotton tote bags must be reused hundreds if not thousands of times to displace cumulative carbon footprint of plastic bags.   3. Higher water usage. Cotton production is immensely water intensive, and most of the worlds cotton is produced in water scarce regions such as Xinjiang. (I am exclusively talking about the environmental impact so the human rights aspect is just another reason to cut down on cotton tote bags, but it is out of the scope of discussion) 4. Biodegradable. However, in a developed country with effective waste management, plastic bags should be processed and end up in a proper landfill, where yes it is bad for the environment, but its is minimally bad for the environment. If the country incinerates its trash, such as Denmark or Singapore, then biodegradability makes absolutely no sense since both products would end up burned and turned into carbon dioxide at the end of its useful lifespan.  Although 7000 times (according the the Danish Ministry of Environment) may be an exaggeration, based on data on the city state of Singapore, one tote bag must be used 2000 times, or an individual must use one and only one tote bag with zero plastic bags used for 1.5 years to match at least.  If cotton tote bags are only better in the sense that it is biodegradable if a nation did not manage to capture it in its waste management system, it makes no sense to promote cotton tote bags in developed countries.   The best way to save the environment across the table is to consume less and reuse more, and no bags is always better than plastic/cotton bag. But if necessary, single use plastic, or better yet reusable plastic bags, are wayyyy better than cotton tote bags.	1642663790.0	s8dbrp	/r/changemyview/comments/s8dbrp/cmv_in_developed_countries_cotton_tote_bags_are/	CMV: In Developed countries, cotton tote bags are bad for the environment.
3oyg60md	This is just my own speculation, which is why I'm posting it here so you can explain how I'm wrong in the likely case that I am.  My argument: The reason we still haven't gotten rid of the virus is because we don't have proper restrictions, people are still meeting people all over the world, every day, and spreading the infection.   The reason for this is partly because some of us have to for work and errands, but also because most of us don't fear for our lives to get sick, and are okay with the risks that come with living our everyday lives. But if the virus would have super deadly consequences, people would not want to risk it and they'd stay isolated as much as they could. And this would halt the virus spread much faster, only killing the first people before the news came out and some unlucky ones.  But now that it feels like a gray zone whether or not you will really suffer from getting infected, people and governments don't care enough to enforce and maintain strict enough restrictions, because it's just not worth it, for the economy and the comfort of our current lifestyles, etc.  EDIT: There are plenty of delta’s I want to give out but it is currently 3am, will get back to it in the morning. I wrote this post on a whim and did not expect to get so many replies, and I admit my argument wasn’t that deep, just something I thought about recently. Hopefully it has still spurred some interesting discussion!  EDIT EDIT: As I expected, people are pointing out that my argument is oversimplified as there are many factors affecting the amount of deaths resulting from a virus, it doesn't just come down to the restrictions. Even if it's true that a deadlier corona virus would cause less deaths, there are many factors at play here.  I wrongly blamed improper restrictions for the reason why the virus still around. I feel like technically this IS true, but it is at the same time impossible to have perfect lockdowns and restrictions.  Another thing I didn't take into account is that not every country has the resources to enforce restrictions like we do in the west, and they would suffer from a lot of deaths regardless.  Another argument was that the public response to a deadlier virus might be panic, and that could result in deaths in many other ways. Perhaps there exists a sweet spot where the virus is deadly enough to have people take it seriously but not so deadly it wipes out the population?  People don't seem to think it's wrong to assume a deadlier virus would cause people to take it more seriously. I think, even if there would still be doubters, most people would stay home if the virus was a serious health risk to them personally.  I realize that presenting an imaginary scenario invites to many alternative scenarios with altered details to fit different arguments. “If it was like that then this would happen.” “Ok, but what if it was like this, then this would happen.” It's kind of hard to avoid, but I don't think it's a big deal. There's nothing wrong with theorizing and discussing ideas.   I'd like to add that English isn't my first language and I apologize for any grammar mistakes.	1642681359.0	s8hryl	/r/changemyview/comments/s8hryl/cmv_covid_would_have_killed_less_people_if_it_was/	CMV: Covid would have killed less people if it was more deadly
3ey83	This is excluding the "Hey, send me a text so I have your name and number" situations when you first meet someone where the point is just to exchange information easily.   If you exchange numbers and then someone texts you "Hey, this is Joe, we met at the event the other night. How are things?" and you respond "Great, how are you?" the expectation is that you get a response sometime in the next day or so.   Even more of an issue is if you're having some kind of repair or other service and you are texted by a technician or other service provider "This is Bill with XYZ Plumbing, I'll be there in 20 minutes". If 30 minutes have gone by, and I text back "What is your ETA?" you should be responsive.   Now, obviously if someone is driving they shouldn't text, and if a repairman has his hands halfway down a toilet drainage pipe they can't text, but in general if they make a commitment and then receive a request for an update to that same text, they should be able to reply a second time with that update.   It shouldn't be necessary to make a call to follow up to a text. If you are using the convenience of asynchronous communication to contact me with time-sensitive information, you should be willing to continue to use that type of communication going forward.   (The opposite is also potentially true: if someone calls you and leaves a message, unless they specify that you can reply by text, I think you should call them back, but that's a different discussion probably)  Edit: To be clear, I'm not suggesting a person should text back IMMEDIATELY. I understand that texts are asynchronous. But with a tradesperson, I'd expect some kind of response within an hour or so, two at the most. With a friend or acquaintance, I'd expect something within a day or maybe two.	1642688773.0	s8k65i	/r/changemyview/comments/s8k65i/cmv_if_a_person_especially_when_providing_a/	CMV: If a person (especially when providing a service) initiates contact through text, they should be responsive to texts in return
gb3xu7s4	I've often heard the notion that if we take money from the rich, society will suffer because people will lose incentive to work hard and innovate. This is often centered around taxing. The idea is sort of like if we tax people harder, they will lose incentive to make new inventions or invest in things that are good for society. I disagree. I think most people do it for reasons beyond money, they do it because they care about their invention/company/project/cause. Money definitely helps, but say uncle Sam takes an increasing cut from every dollar you make, I simply don't believe people who are actually innovating will stop just because every additional dollar is harder to earn.   I don't know what the ideal scale is, I'm not an economist/accountant, but even if it were very severe (for example every dollar after your first billion gets taxed 90%), I think it will not significantly slow progress or innovation. The argument that it will remove the incentive for progress/innovation is crap. I'm not saying money is a absolute non-factor, but at best its a small factor, whereas the *real* reason people resist this is because people with wealth and power want to keep it and grow it.  Almost every self-made billionaire story, the person says "it wasn't about the money". And the biggest billionaires retire as philanthropists because they have so much they don't know what to do, may as well give it away so they can help the world (or if you're more cynical, so they can feel good about themselves). This adds to my belief that removing the financial incentive will not stop progress or innovation.	1642692384.0	s8lfzu	/r/changemyview/comments/s8lfzu/cmv_wealth_gain_should_have_diminishing_returns/	CMV: Wealth gain should have diminishing returns and innovation will not stop as a result
5km3t	Programs like Energy Star aim to help consumers choose energy efficient products that will be less expensive to operate and have lower environmental impact than other choices.  However, decision-making would be far better if we knew how long to expect a model to last and how environmentally expensive it is to produce.  After all, an energy saving feature may lead to early failure and would be a net negative even though it's a positive on current ratings systems.  And people are often told it's environmentally/economically friendly to replace perfectly good appliances from a decade or two ago - this could help answer such questions.  The weakest point as I see it is that companies may be wrong about how long their products will last.  But surely they must have a decent idea if they're subjecting the products to all the Energy Star testing... and at worst, it can be tied to manufacturer warranty.	1642694005.0	s8m18f	/r/changemyview/comments/s8m18f/cmv_efficiencyenvironmental_ratings_like_energy/	CMV: efficiency/environmental ratings like "Energy Star" should take into account the impact of manufacture and the likely product lifespan
6dpp1o3l	OnlyFans is how the rich take advantage of young girls who are sold a false hope of being rich from selling their body and dignity. It's fucking sad. You see 17-year-old girls turn 18, conditioned to instantly create an OnlyFans and sell their nudes to old men for $5 a pop and not make nearly as much money as the false promise they are sold. Most of these girls if they are not desperate for money would never do this in person, it's just a gateway to take advantage of young women.  The whole thing is sad and indicative of an unfair society on both sides. It cannot be good for social relationships.  This is why I only meet women in person and would never do it through regular social media or dating apps.  I personally think paying for sex says a lot about someone. And having girls feeling like they should make an OnlyFans and compromising their dignity only to have to compare themselves to the subscription amount and attention of other women and have them spend their lives like that is the saddest shit I ever heard. Site should be banned just like the porn industry should for the people it takes advantage of. Never should've been commercialised.  People have distorted the view to the point that it is seen as powerful and normal to gain an addiction to attention and compare yourself to other women and show your body to random men around the world.  Obviously I hope this never comes up as an issue or point of contention in any of my relationships, and it thankfully hasn't so far as I've made my views clear to every girlfriend I've had that I'm not okay with it, but I still feel bad for society and can only imagine the attention-addicted, anxiety-ridden depressed women and instant-gratification addicted woman-objectifying (and hateful) men that we are creating.  I will admit that the fact I even needed to make these views clear around a year ago saddened me to some extent, so while I wouldn't say this is fully personal, it has had some form of impact.	1642694903.0	s8mddg	/r/changemyview/comments/s8mddg/cmv_onlyfans_is_a_disease_on_society/	CMV: OnlyFans is a disease on society
3kvb5ak3	Hollywood's Ghost in the Shell, as many of you may already know, had received criticism upon its release due to casting Scarlett Johansson as the lead instead of an Asian actress. However, I believe this outrage was misguided.  The American producers of the movie did what Japanese copyright holders and audience wanted them to do, and the Japanese reception of the movie was not too bad. Because this is Japanese culture than "Asian American culture" (which does not really exist, and is more correctly described as "cultures of Asian American groups"), I believe that Asian Americans' views on casting and race have as much validity as those of non-Asian Americans, which is much less compared to what actual Japanese people think.  The original source material was made by Japan, not Asian American diaspora, and as such, it cannot be considered to be taking away from Asian American representation.  Asian American activists (very correctly) say that not all Asians are the same. However, the same Asian Americans who decry casting choices for a movie based on Japanese (not even Japanese American) media are hypocritically engaging in this homogenization of Asian cultures, treating them as interchangeable on the basis of skin color and skull shape. I see it as not very different from, say, white Americans getting offended on behalf of Irish people for celebrating St. Patrick's day, when actual Irish people are not offended.	1642696187.0	s8musd	/r/changemyview/comments/s8musd/cmv_whitewashing_of_live_action_japanese_media_by/	CMV: "Whitewashing" of live action Japanese media by Hollywood with non-Asian actors is not racist, because Japanese culture is not Asian American culture

I don't  like them because:  (1) I find them visually unappealing.  (2) they look clumsily built, heavy and very awkward to hold.  (3) the string to finger ratio is so ridiculous that I just don't  see the practicality or playability of a guitar that has more strings than humans have fingers.  (4) I've never seen a decent youtube video of this instrument being played in any way that can make a decent song. Its usually just a short improvosation piece.  (5) the bass strings are usually so heavy that they sound dissonant.  (6) its so wide that you can't wrap your fretting hand around it, nor can you strum across 14 strings.   For all of the above , I find it highly impractical. Like the ridiculous cars shown in car shows that would never be road worth.  But please....change my view....I would love to understand the appeal of such a weird instrument.	1642702321.0	s8p68s	/r/changemyview/comments/s8p68s/cmv_extended_range_guitars_are_silly_and_mostly/	CMV: extended range guitars are silly and mostly impractical.
hkcykjj2	I will say that I don’t think that people should die for crimes that were mistakes or not out of malice like a crime of passion for example or an accidental murder or anything of that degree, but I think that truly heinous criminals should be sentenced to death and was surprised that not many share this viewpoint.  I was reading a thread about the death penalty after watching a sad story on true crime about Junko Furata, and many replies said that every human deserves a second chance and prison should be about rehabilitation. I simply can’t put why I disagree with this, but in cases like the Junko Furata case I simply believe that all 100 involved and even the parents of the main perpetrators of such a heinous crime should have been executed.  First reason why, is that all 3 of the four main perpetrators went on to re-offend or brag about the crime, and another reason is out of sympathy for the victim. If I was tortured for 44 days then burnt alive I sure as hell wouldn’t want the perpetrators to see freedom and would want them hung or electric chaired.   I know this is only one case but I believe that other cases were such vulgarity and evil was committed without a shadow of a doubt, then they should die.   I am open to having my view changed.

35lld6wh	Forgiving all student loans without any regard to the economic situation of borrowers will worsen income inequality and hurt non college graduates (who are generally poorer).    I’m not saying that we shouldn’t cancel any debt, but we should at least focus on cancelling debt for people who actually need it.   &#x200B;  According to BLS college graduates earn an average of $25,000 more per year than a high school graduate. Unemployment and poverty rates for those without a degree are far higher.   &#x200B;  Obviously not everyone is automatically successful because of college. But even those with college experience and no degree earn more than those without college experience.  Plus, the people with the most debt actually end up making the most amount of money(doctors or lawyers). Also the lowest paying majors almost always pay more than the average person without a degree.   &#x200B;  Sure some people with a degree don’t have a great economic situation but it would be far more productive to just cancel debt based on expected income rather than just blanket forgiveness.  &#x200B;  I don’t know why one would support a form of welfare that mostly goes to upper or middle class Americans rather than helping people on a need basis.  Edit: to clarify this US specific and I don’t think cost should prevent people from going to college, this is specifically about recent calls to cancel student loan debt.	1642705634.0	s8qeuu	/r/changemyview/comments/s8qeuu/cmv_forgiving_all_student_debt_is_a_bad_idea_and/	CMV: Forgiving all student debt is a bad idea and will worsen economic inequality.
6hz1khcy	I'd like to focus on American Christianity for this one, but other religious dogmas are welcome to join in.         Housing rights? Sexual sins are irrelevant to that. Respectful behavior? We are commanded to love everybody. Job/cake/public space discrimination? We don't care if you're divorced, had premarital sex, or committed any other legal sin, we let you in.         If I'm understanding Christian doctrines right, it's pretty well established that only God can judge, and it's only by faith that anybody gets on His good side. So, strong arming by other people serves no purpose, right? Following commandments is just seen as a natural consequence of faith, but not as a qualifier for being a good person.        I imagine that a lot of reddit might agree with me on this one, but I really do want some pushback, so I encourage you to play devil's advocate.

iw5v8hw	Prefacing this by saying that I'm from Ontario, Canada and there may be parts of the rest of the country or the world that this is already in practice. Sorry if my thoughts seem scattered below, but the title is as distilled and accurate as I could make it.  I believe that by giving the general public the option to ignore Covid policies in place to help stop the spread and not have any way to verify that this information is true it has been a detriment to recovery. I've been working in retail during the entire pandemic so far, and to my knowledge the law is that we can't ask customers about their medical exemptions.  I believe that the anti-vaxx movement has used this unregulated policy to get away with bypassing restrictions without any repercussions. These people would gladly use this to their advantage because there's no verification whatsoever.   Based on my firsthand experience dealing with customers with claims of exemption, I don't believe that there's any health condition that is severe enough to restrict them from wearing a mask for the short time they're in a store. Each time I've dealt with one of these customers, I've told them that I would be happy to accommodate their needs outside of the store, but that none of the rest of the customers consented to being in their unmasked presence. Each time they've stormed off instead which leads me to believe their claims of exemption are false. If a condition is truly so severe that they can't wear a mask, I don't believe they should be out shopping at the mall since the risk of contracting Covid is likely more deadly for anyone with existing health problems.  I suppose my view is actually twofold:   1. **Government wise:** Given that the vaccinated have to show proof to enter certain businesses, I believe that they should have created a pass to go alonside this so that exempt individuals have a their claims legitimized by the government. Instead, the government went hands off on the matter and these people can use existing polices to skirt restrictions with no repercussions  2. **Individual wise:** Customers should be forthcoming with their reason for exemption and any by trying to bypass restrictions they've done harm to the rest of the population	1642708995.0	s8rney	/r/changemyview/comments/s8rney/cmv_medical_exemption_from_covid_policies_should/	CMV: Medical exemption from Covid policies should not be private info, and lack of regulation of this has done harm
5e20b	I am an asexual, so I actually do not have any experience with sex. Though I am heterosexually orientated and come from a religious background. Now the reason why I'm coming here is to see if I can break any possible prejudices when it comes to this topic.  **The Hypothetical Scenario:**  Let us say that you're in heaven. You have 100% equal attraction to both the male and female gender. You can also switch from being a male to female and vice versa. You also have unlimited amount of partners, all to your liking. When having sex, you cannot use any sex toys either and it must be one on one.  I feel that, over time, the person would start preferring heterosexual sex even if he starts off with either M/M or F/F. Why is that?  With M/M sex, where there's the top and the bottom, I feel that the bottom would not be pleasured because his genitalia is not being simulated. It's not equally mutual pleasure. Even if they were to do frotting, it would not be as pleasurable as penetrative sex.  With F/F, scissoring only leads to clitoral stimulation, and there's a lack of penetrative sex. I feel as if the vagina isn't being used in the way it's supposed to, and in this way, it's being neglected the vagina's designed purpose.  Though with M/F, both partners are equally stimulated, the penis is being used as designed, and the vagina too.  In this way, I feel heterosexual sex is inherently more pleasurable. Though please do not misunderstand the argument I'm making. I'm talking about a purely hypothetical scenario and I'm sure there are LGBT peeps that find homosexual sex more pleasurable than heterosexual sex. Though I feel that people have preferences, which puts bias on what's pleasurable for them, for both homosexual and heterosexual. Though this hypothetical scenario puts away any barriers.  I'd love to hear perspectives on this, and I do want to open my mind on this. I feel that humans are biological designed for heterosexual sex, so by nature it would be more pleasurable if people didn't have any sort of preference or bias.     **EDIT:** My view has sincerely changed. But that's why I've come here. I am pretty ignorant on these things, but that's why I've come here to change my misconceived notions with an open mind. I want to sincerely want to thank everyone for commenting!	1642720334.0	s8vlm9	/r/changemyview/comments/s8vlm9/cmv_heterosexual_sex_is_more_physically/	CMV: Heterosexual sex is more physically pleasurable than Homosexual Sex [Either M/M or F/F]
imtgxtq8	Please do not say any spoilers beyond episode 8 of season 2.  First of, no disrespect to the homie rengoku. He was such a badass and kind character who really cared about others.  However I have seen people from the fandom say that rengoku won the conflict between akaza along with Tanjiro.  However I disagree. Rengoku may have successfully defended the civilians and the other demon slayers however he did not win by any ways, and not just the battle.  What exactly did he accomplish by saving a bunch of nobodies (aside from tanjiro, insouke, and zenitsu) who will not contribute to the war against demons?  Many people have been killed by demons and because rengoku failed to defeat akaza, (who by the way is very fucking sexy. Seriously that demon has such a gorgeous body along with daki and that hot femboy demon enmu) he will continue to kill and eat people. In fact Akaza will probably kill more people than rengoku has saved. I am not saying that he could and should've killed Akaza because rengoku seemed outmatched by him.  His death kind of seemed in vain to me and he didn't seem to really "win" at anything.	1642720530.0	s8vo6r	/r/changemyview/comments/s8vo6r/cmv_demon_slayer_tanjiro_was_wrong_rengoku_did/	CMV: (demon slayer) Tanjiro was wrong.

gtwut	There was a time when I believed in the "transporters kill you" argument. I actually came up with it on my own before I heard it from anyone else. The idea is that if the machine works by destroying you and recreating you somewhere else, "you" experience death and the other version of you is a copy.  But as I thought more about this, I realized that my belief that staying in the same body keeps my consciousness alive is entirely unfounded and arbitrary. For all I know, I could have "died" ten times today and I'd never know the difference. There's no point in worrying about something I have zero knowledge of how to affect.  If consciousness is purely a material phenomenon, then it has no greater meaning and isn't worth the futile effort of trying to keep it alive.  If consciousness has a spiritual component, like a soul, then what happens to it when my body is destroyed is in the hands of whatever higher being exists.  Both of these mean the same thing: I don't know how consciousness works, so why should I worry about it?  By the way, here's [a comic about someone who came to a similar understanding](https://www.existentialcomics.com/comic/1). However, my conclusion is different than that of the comic character. I believe that my values, ideas, and goals have value and they are what I should endeavor to preserve.  I believe that in a world where some sort of mind-copying existed, people who think the way I do would be at a strong advantage. I know my mind-clone would die to save me, a copy of its values, ideas, and goals. My mind-clone would know I would die to save it. They would experience no angst over being a "copy". Both of us would have empathy toward the other and conflict would be minimized, at least until we've had time to diverge.	1642727329.0	s8y1y3	/r/changemyview/comments/s8y1y3/cmv_i_am_not_afraid_to_go_through_a_star_trek/	CMV: I am not afraid to go through a Star Trek teleporter, digitally upload my mind, or copy myself and destroy the original.

h30mpe0x	So the way I see it is:     * Just throwing away our trash into a volcano isn't a viable solution simply because of the tons on tons of fuel needed for the job of transportation of all garbage to the volcano sites and deploying them, the immense amount of harmful greenhouses gases that would be released into our atmosphere as a result of doing so, and the sheer impracticality of transporting everyone's garbage into a singular going-off volcano. * I believe that bringing the world's *recycled glass* to a volcano is far more practical and will have fewer negative externalities * Due to us only transporting *glass* recycling, recycling far less heavy than metals and the step of dividing it into small pieces isn't as likely to harm the environment as doing so for plastics due to the subform of "micro-glass" not existing * Glass doesn't burn, so as it melts it won't burn and send of greenhouse/carbon gases as burning plastics does because glass isn't made of carbon as it was never alive.  * Having a far less bumpy and streamlined travel needed for, again, only excising glass recyclables would make it much cheaper and more practical from a bandwidth perspective. * The infrastructure needed wouldn't be much more than a railroad system.  * Job creation * Throwing glass in a volcano completes the rock 'life cycle', as the solid form melts back into the earth to become put under immense heat and pressure to melt and form rock. * The effects of merging glass recyclables back into the deep earth would have tremendous, interesting, and possibly financially beneficial geological layers in the future. Who knows what crazy minerals something like having a vein of this stuff a million miles long would create? * The world working together to transport recyclable glass would create better international relations as solving problems of waste management and sanitation. A good chunk of that garbage would have a place to go at long last.  Thus, transporting all recyclable glass into or near the edge of inactive volcanos and ready to deploy if a volcano becomes active to return the material to the deep earth to become melted and naturally processed by mother earth would be a good idea to implement to solve or at least somewhat fix environmental and social problems.

9gphfw6b	I am morally Pro-Life. I think that abortion is only morally permissible in rare circumstances such as rape, the health of the mother, etc. I believe that life starts at conception, as it's the only non-arbitrary point in a pregnancy. Abortion is wrong because it robs a future from someone. Even ifyou believe a fetus is not a person yet, it is a distinct organism that has the potential for a future, and abortion ends that potential. An embryo is a distinct organism in a way that a sperm or egg aren't.  At the same time though, I support abortion rights because I don't believe in imposing my views on others. Also, banning abortion would lead to back-alley abortions, which is not better. Banning abortions wouldn't actually stop people from having abortions, and it's not my place to force others to live in accordance with my view of abortion. The negative consequences of banning abortion do not justify banning it.  I also believe that efforts should focus more on sex education, access to contraception, and supporting expecting mothers. Abortion shouldn't be the norm, and we should take steps as a society to reduce the need for abortions in the first place. But in the meantime, we shouldn't ban abortion.  I can be Pro-Life and still support abortion access with a clear conscience. Please change my mind.  Edit 1- two things I want to clarify.  1- I'd consider an abortion any intentional active act to end a pregnancy. And pregnancy meaning that the sperm has fertilized the egg so that there is now an embryo/fetus. 2- the goal if this CMV is not to discuss the morality of abortion. Rather that given that I believe abortion is wrong, I can still support abortion rights from a legal point of view. Morality and legality are not the same. I can be morally pro-life while still support pro-choice legislation and not be breaking my conscience.  Edit 2- I got into a discussion about my view on contraceptives that do not allow for implementation being morally permissible. I intended this to be more about abortion pills and clinical abortions, not contraceptives. I wasn't thinking of birth control when I wrote this CMV.	1642754271.0	s968az	/r/changemyview/comments/s968az/cmv_morally_prolife_yet_support_abortion_rights/	CMV: Morally Pro-Life; Yet Support Abortion Rights; Clear Conscience
4t6ewgkh	For my whole life, like most people, I've had an interest in space. I even contemplated becoming an astronaut when I was little, and recently I've been buying telescopes and trying to get into amateur astronomy.  However, time and time again an idea occurs to me: space is only of interest to geologists. Really, the main reason most people are into space is in the hopes that we'll get to live in the world Star Trek or something in the future. Clearly, that's not going to happen. All attempts to find evidence of alien life have proved fruitless, and its gotten to the point that even serious scientists are considering that aliens may be intentionally hiding from us in some form (theories range from them just maintaining radio silence to avoid drawing the attention of would-be interstellar conquerors, to our world actually being some sort of zoo for highly advanced aliens). Besides, even if did finally get a radio signal, what would it matter? We obviously wouldn't be able to visit them, and two-way communication would be impossible due to the distances involved. In fact, many scientists believe that we'll simply never leave the solar system. Some have even suggested this as an answer to the fermi paradox: interstellar travel is simply impossible, so all aliens are forever trapped in their native solar systems.  Like I said, a lot of the drive for the exploration of space seems to be to just find aliens. When I was young, I was somehow convinced that there was in fact animal life on Mars and that Nasa was just living in denial of it (I have no clue how I got this idea, though I was also into cryptozoology, ufos, ghosts, and I even believed in Atlantis at the time). I now know though that there is clearly nothing there. At best, we may find some germs essentially buried under the ice caps. Even fossils are unlikely, given the short time span during which Mars could've supported macroscopic life (keep in mind, Earth life is believed to have not become multi-cellular until literal billions of years into Earth's history).  Obviously, we're never going to get to meet an alien intelligence, we're never going to have some alien alien as a pet. Our solar system at least is nothing but dead, barren rocks. Who would be interested in that other than geologists? I do acknowledge that geologic activity can be interesting, I'm just saying there really isn't anything else.  And yes, I know Nasa is becoming increasingly convinced that alien fish are hiding inside the icy moons of the outer solar system. Honestly though, to me that always just looked like wishful thinking. They think it 'could be', and thus it must be. That logic has never exactly panned out though. Scientists used to think there could be life on Venus, but we now know that's virtually impossible. There's clearly nothing running through the deserts on Mars, even if the 'Martian germ' thing is still an open question. Even when people finally landed on the moon, Nasa was afraid that the astronauts may bring back alien germs (literally). They kept them in an isolated chamber just in case they caught something contagious, and even made petri dishes of the dust they brought back looking for microbes (along with injecting the dust into chickens to see if they would get sick). I even heard once that one of the apollo astronauts claimed that when he was on the moon, he couldn't shake the feeling that he would turn around at some point to find an alien peaking at him from behind a rock. Seriously. Point is, people time and time again keep overestimating the capabilities of life. Mars has no life, because its atmosphere is too thin, its dry, and the surface is being bombarded by radiation due to its lack of a magnetic field. Even the hardiest of extremophile bacteria can't survive Mars' surface conditions for long. Venus is essentially a planet-sized blast furnace, and pretty much every other body in the solar system has no atmosphere to speak of. Nasa invested quite a lot of money and time trying to intercept alien TV signals and radio shows, again to no avail. Nasa is apparently starting to concede now that we won't find intelligent alien life any time soon, though that still doesn't stop them from trying to work out how to colonize the moon and Mars! Netflix for at a time was even airing a series that was fundamentally a hard-scifi space opera. Regarding the icy moons again, contrary to popular belief, the animals at the hydrothermic vents at the bottom of the ocean are NOT fully independent of resources coming from the surface. Namely, they still need to breath oxygen, which they have no way to synthesize themselves, instead they survive off of oxygen made by photosynthetic plankton at the ocean's surface. Clearly the icy moons don't have that. More than likely, their oceans (if they are even there) are poor in oxygen, essentially creating a situation like Mars but underwater. Besides, some have even suggested that the subsurface oceans may also be highly salty, making it only hospitable to certain extremophile bacteria at best.  Elusiveness aside, let's assume the best case scenario and that there really are alien fishes swimming around in the outer solar system, how could we even study them? Nasa can't seem to get its project started to send a submarine probe to Europa, and even if they could it certainly wouldn't be a regular occurrence. Even if they do finally do it and find alien fish swimming around, that's all the footage we would have for at least another decade (that's about how long it takes just for a probe to get to the Jovian system, forget things like actually planning the mission which can easily drag on for a decade or two on its own).  Besides, let's be honest, if aliens really do exist somewhere and we could study them, they probably wouldn't be that interesting. Everyone seems to be unable to help imagining even alien animals as being fantasy creatures. Yeah, they would probably look weird (or maybe not, some have suggest that alien animals may not be all THAT exotic, citing that there's a multitude of very good reasons why animals on our world are designed the way they are), but I think it safe to say that studying them in reality wouldn't be any more interesting than studying animals on Earth. I mean, even channels that specialize in animal programming can't help but broadcast cryptozoological stuff, for the simple fact that such SELLS BETTER THAN REAL ANIMAL SHOWS. People don't want a new species of deer or wild dog or whatever, they essentially want dragons and unicorns and whatnot. I mean, probably the most popular aliens to imagine are ones that would exist on low-gravity worlds with thick atmospheres, which they obviously do just so they can have a rational explanation for having giant things that fly.  And regarding colonization, honestly even that may be impossible. One thing that nobody seems to be considering is our reliant we are on fossil fuels. Even if you have some green way to generate energy, at the very least you need petroleum to make things like lubricant and tires. Our world could never be 100% green. Tragic as that is, it would pose an even worse problem for people on Mars or the moon. What, is Nasa going to be sending them shipments of lubricant regularly? Any one trying to live outside of Earth is going to be forced to rely mostly on pre-industrial technology essentially. Besides, we don't know yet if humans can even survive low-gravity conditions. We know for a fact that humans can't live perpetually in zero-g, but we honestly have no clue how much gravity humans need. Even nasa concedes that it may turn out that we could never live on the moon or Mars. I mean, many people have been advocating we terraform Venus instead, part of that being it has close to Earth's gravity (about 90%), so it would probably be fine unlike the low gravity worlds of our moon and Mars. Obviously, we're not going to be able to stand on Venus any time soon, for all we know even that world's gravity may turn out to be too little.  TLDR:  Simply put, there's little of interest in space outside of geology. Alien life has proven highly elusive and we keep overestimating where it could survive. Even if we did find it, it certainly wouldn't be all that interested (at best it would be as interesting as Earth life, which nobody really seems to care much about), all attempts to find talking aliens have proven fruitless and even if we did find them we'd have no way to hold a conversation. Besides, let's be real, its pretty unlikely they would be interested in showering us with their technology. Do you see anyone on Earth trying to uplift the various tribes scattered across our planet who are still essentially living in the stone age? And even regarding coloniztion, we simply don't know enough yet if its even doable or not, all we know is that if it is, it would be immensely difficult. At the very least, we would have to divorce ourselves completely from fossil resources before we even consider trying to put permanent habitation on other worlds.  Honestly, at times I agree with Fry's sentiment near the end of that episode of Futurama where he accepts everyone else's opinion that the moon is uninteresting. He remarks on what it meant to people in our time, but then admits that the moon really is 'just a big dumb rock'. In reality, pretty much every moon and planet besides Earth is just another rock. There are no Martians, or Venusians, or Vulcans. The solar system, and the whole universe so far, is just a vast desert that we could possibly start mining in some day (though Nasa seems to consider mining asteroids to be more feasible, though honestly I suspect that may just be because we obviously have no sentimental attachment at all to asteroids unlike we do for the moon and Mars).  Purely and simply, space sucks. I guess its neat if you're into geology, but beyond that, there's nothing to see. I mean, I've even heard of a new answer to the fermi paradox in that aliens may just resort to living out their space opera fantasies in VR games because building such a program would be far easier than finding aliens in the real world, and it would also be far more interesting for obvious reasons. Colonization and curiosity are the only two things I can imagine that would justify space exploration, and the former we're clearly not making much progress on. Besides, I'm sick of being forever teased by the question as to if there's anyone out there. Its an eternal burning question that has defied all attempts to answer it, and really I think its about time we just accept that we're not going to find aliens, at least any time soon.  I do concede though that I haven't thought like this most of my life, I guess I'm sorta still sitting on the fence, which is really the sole reason I'm even posting this. So don't take my post as me just explaining why I've grown tired of space, I am willing to consider that I could be wrong. Besides, its pretty freaking obvious that 99% of the human race would disagree with me either way.	1642762422.0	s985tv	/r/changemyview/comments/s985tv/cmv_space_is_only_of_interest_to_a_geologist/	CMV: Space is only of interest to a geologist.

eie5iyq	The point of nuclear deterrents was to support the doctrine of mutually assured destruction and thus prevent war between major world powers. That doctrine is a relic of the cold war, and the threat it is designed to prevent is no longer likely, nor the most pressing concern of foreign policy.  Disarmament would reduce the number of nuclear weapons which would reduce the likelihood of their use (e.g. through falling into non-state actor hands), and would save a given country considerable amounts of money which could be diverted to any number of net positive causes.  Of course multilateral/universal disarmament would be even better, but I don't see any reason for a given state to wait for that before disarming themselves.	1642783581.0	s9f134	/r/changemyview/comments/s9f134/cmv_unilateral_nuclear_disarmament_by_any_nuclear/	CMV: Unilateral nuclear disarmament by any nuclear armed nation would be of benefit to society
9w27p	In S7E1 of Mr D (a Canadian sitcom about, in essence, a phys-ed teacher), Mr D decides to grade his students on their ability at the sports/activities that the class does. This, of course, causes a hilarious uproar among other teachers. Reflecting on this, I think that it is a reasonable approach.  Take, for an example, a mathematics class. On tests and exams, you are predominately assessed on how well you understand the material, and not how much effort you put into learning; a talented but lazy math student could indeed get a much higher grade than a student who puts in a lot of effort but struggles mathematically (for a potential various host of reasons, but that's neither here nor there for this argument).  Why not apply the same logic to the gym portions of phys ed? For starters, it would give students who are academically talented a chance to learn how to struggle and succeed at something that isn't always in their academic wheelhouse. This would build resiliency and develop a strong work ethic among students that may not develop it through a standardized school curriculum.   Secondly, it gives students that are talented at something besides academics a taste of talent and interest being rewarded. Even if "gym" isn't a skill always required in the adult world, giving students a taste of success outside of raw academics would be beneficial for students self esteem.  I am in no way married to this view and I can indeed be convinced otherwise with a strong argument that the "effort" based grading is fair and beneficial overall.	1642786961.0	s9gbrr	/r/changemyview/comments/s9gbrr/cmv_students_grades_in_the_gym_parts_of_physical/	CMV: Students' grades in the "gym" parts of Physical Education should be based on how good they are at the activities, and not the effort that they show.
5fwnzg1	Two things to get out of the way, first: I'm not saying that all adult's political views are good, and I'm not saying that everything children(i.e. sub-18yr-olds) do in general is not worth serious consideration.  At the core of it, children's political views tend to suffer from two major problems: lack of perspective and lack of acknowledgement of complexity.  The first is fairly obvious: children have not lived very long, by definition, and thus haven't seen as much of the world as an adult. Therefore, they lack necessary context on a lot of important things, to the point where entire points are invalidated. The number of kids I've seen who are, for example, communist, is very large- and if they've never actually worked a day in their lives, then all that talk of exploitation of workers and unfair hierarchies and the need for revolution falls a little bit flat, to say the least- and that's hardly the only thing. Military spending, political partisanship, whether Joe Manchin should be lynched, whatever- overwhelmingly, kids I see have kinda crazy views on it, and it's mostly based on a quick skim of a few news articles at best.  The second point is related to the first- children often don't understand or appreciate the complexity of the world, and so propose overly simplistic, absolutist solutions that wouldn't actually help much.  Fundamentally, the world is *really* complicated, especially politically. Every action has a thousand consequences and a thousand factors, some good and some bad, and they should all be taken into account before seriously talking about them, because otherwise you just get wildly off base. "just tax the rich out of existence" or "just make discrimination illegal" are both things that I've heard repeatedly from kids, and both are rather problematic for many reasons, but it's almost impossible to get kids to admit that because they just don't understand how complex those things are, and so they get frustrated when people tell them that that's not how the world works.	1642786022.0	s9fyym	/r/changemyview/comments/s9fyym/cmv_childrens_political_views_are_poorly_informed/	CMV: Children's political views are poorly informed or overly simplistic the majority of the time, and are thus generally not worth serious consideration.
4rzppk5	A couple disclaimers before I get into the meat and potatoes of my view. This will mainly be directed towards streaming services in the United States, as those are the ones I am familiar with, as well as the fact that not all countries have had the push for streaming licensing like we have in North America. Secondly, some examples I'll bring up will relate to using piracy as an alternative to streaming, but whether or not piracy is justified isn't really my view. There are tons of CMVs on this sub about the morality of piracy, so if you like pirating, go for it.  I often hear this widely held belief that there are too many streaming services nowadays. So much so, that if you wanted to pay for all of them, you'd be spending hundreds of dollars a month for access to everything. People state that cordcutting is no longer the cheap alternative to cable that it once was, and they lament the old days where Netflix was the only streaming service that had "everything." I see memes like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/oyvncb/before_vs_now/) implying that streaming was the reason they stopped pirating, but now that there are dozens of services, they've returned to piracy (which again, the morality of piracy is not really my view).  As much as I hear about this *problem* of an over-saturated streaming market, I've never really understood people's complaints, so I'll break them down one by one.  **1: I have to pay a bunch of money every month to get everything, as opposed to only paying $9 when it was just Netflix.**  This is the point I understand the least. People act as though 2010 era Netflix was this massive content library when it never really was. Netflix had a comparatively *tiny* fraction of all available movies and TV, considering the vast majority of it was exclusive to TV networks as well as physical media like DVD and Blu Ray (Don't worry, I'll address streaming exclusivity in another point). So acting like you could get almost everything on Netflix back then is simply untrue.  Certainly, Netflix had more content back then compared to now, but for good reason. During the early days of streaming, studios and networks were far more willing to give out cheap streaming licenses to entities like Netflix, because they didn't really see streaming as a competitor to their cash cow of network TV. So if Netflix made them a little more money on the side, they indulged them. When it became apparent that streaming was becoming the future of entertainment, those licenses got more expensive. Services like Hulu, Amazon, etc. saw the opportunity to join the market, and now networks didn't have to choose between Netflix or no one at all, or they just made their own services like we see now with Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, Peacock, etc. And while people have a right to be upset about the smaller library, I don't think it was ever realistic to expect them to have a monopoly on streaming forever.  Tl;dr: Netflix never had anywhere close to everything, and believing that they would was a bit of a pipe dream.  **2: Buying every streaming service is just as expensive as cable now, so there's no point to cordcutting.**  I'll start by reiterating that Netflix and Hulu didn't have everything in the early days of streaming when cordcutting started gaining traction. Therefore, the notion that one or two cheap streaming services got you anywhere close to the total amount of content that was available on cable isn't true.  The bigger problem I have with this position, is that people always seem to be comparing cable to buying *every* streaming service, which isn't a fair comparison. I don't know the buying habits of most people, but I'm fairly certain most who switched to streaming weren’t buying every channel package, every premium network, and every on-demand package available to them through their cable provider. While it certainly depends on your provider and region, buying every channel and on-demand package available would easily run you above $500 a month. Heck, sometimes you would need more than one provider to truly get everything. So while buying every service is certainly expensive, it's pretty comparable to cable.  So if you were cordcutting back in the early days of Netflix/Hulu, you either weren't actually paying for "everything" from your cable provider if you saw streaming as an alternative, or you were willing to forgo some content for a more convenient service/pricing model. Which I wouldn't blame anyone for doing. You don't have to pay installation or rental fees, no mandatory price increases after 1 to 2 years, and you don't have to deal with the middlemen of cable companies. I've often signed up and cancelled a service within 20 minutes because I know I only want to watch one show and only needed it for the month.  Most importantly, you aren't really at the whim of TV Network's programming schedules. You don't have to record shows or worry about DVR space, you don't have to wait around until the network with the license arbitrarily decides to air that show or movie, you (for the most part) don't have to watch commercials or wait for all episodes to release, particularly if it's an older show. All that is to say there are a multitude of benefits to cordcutting besides cost-saving.  **3. Exclusivity is ruining streaming now that content is spread thin, rather than consolidated into one good service.**  This one is a bit tricky and probably deserving of its own CMV entirely. Addressing this point is probably most likely to change my view (provided you can get through it).   To start off, I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but while Netflix had more licenses back then than it does now, it's not as though Netflix had everything pre 2010, and now it’s all spread amongst 10+ services. That's not to say that content hasn't left Netflix only to be put on its own proprietary service, like Peacock, Disney Plus etc., but as I alluded to earlier, that is more to do with the shift from TV to streaming and studios not just giving their licenses away for peanuts when they realize people aren't watching TV anymore. I'd think most people would prefer having the majority of content available streaming than have most content exclusive to TV networks.  That being said, there are other arguments kind of baked into this. One of which is that since services can get exclusive licenses, they compete only on what content they have, rather than who has the better service. While I think it's true that some services are more reliant on their content than the quality of their website (looking at you Disney Plus launch), people aren't really flush with examples when asked how they'd make the sites better. Likewise, I don't really see people championing the services with the most features, only complaining that they don't have every show they want on the service they already have (usually Netlifx). So I'm inclined to believe people are more upset that they have to pay for another service as opposed to services not innovating.  And again, back when cable was the norm, if you didn’t like the service your shows were on you often didn’t have an alternative. At least now you can subscribe to a service for a month or two rather than a year, or just rent or buy the content you want from Amazon Video, iTunes, or YouTube (Whose service should theoretically be the most acceptable alternative considering how many hours you watch YouTube with no complaints).  And, of course, you can always just pirate if you really hate all the other services that much or you just don’t want to pay. Though I should mention that, unlike the meme I linked earlier, it doesn’t seem to make logical sense to have stopped pirating in the early days of streaming only to go back now for the variety of reasons I’ve already touched on.  **Other thoughts**  This is a bit more subjective, but even though Netflix had more back in the early 2010 era, I seem to remember a lot low-quality content, like B-Movies, reality TV, documentaries etc., compared to the bigger licenses we see today, and of course, the plethora of original content they produce. Speaking of original content, while we might joke about how bad "Netflix Originals" tend to be, the fact that there is competition for the same licenses encourages entities like Netflix to create more content that they don't have to worry about renewing.   I don't think we can downplay how culturally significant some of that original content is. We also get content from smaller creators and studios that don't have to self-publish, foreign films and shows that wouldn't have made it overseas (Fun fact: I actually started drafting this before Squid Game came out), and even revive cancelled properties like Arrested Development.  So that’s really it. I don’t get why streaming services, or the fact that they're so prevalent, always seem to be the internet’s punching bag. It just seems to be such a common viewpoint that I feel like I’ve missed something, but I can’t think of what.

18kcykri	I mean the title really says it all. If an app is marked as ‘free’ that should mean it’s truly free, not a free trial before you have to pay a subscription. I know people will probably say to check the description for the subscription terms but sometimes the description of the app doesn’t even list that and you only find out until you download the app.   I don’t see why the App Store shouldn’t force these companies to list the subscription price for the app instead of putting ‘free’ when we both know that’s a lie. Some people insist that the phrase ‘in app purchases’ covers this but I disagree. In app purchases imply extra things you can pay for to make the app or game easier, not to simply use the app at all. Think of candy crush; there’s a major difference between buying stuff in candy crush to help you advance levels vs paying a subscription to even USE the app in the first place.   Also other products that have free trials aren’t advertised as free. Think of various software; yeah they have a free trial but the price of their software is plain on their website, they don’t hide behind the word Free* with an asterisk.	1642790803.0	s9hsb0	/r/changemyview/comments/s9hsb0/cmv_apps_that_require_a_subscription_should_not/	CMV: Apps that require a subscription should not be listed as free in the App Store
55m1vke4	(Sports post, feel free to skip if not interested!)   I’ve been following this sub for a while and thought I’d try making my own post. Since most posts here cover complex social issues I figured I’d choose a topic that’s relatively light hearted.   Since i am most familiar with the widespread PED abuse in MMA i will limit it to that sport alone rather than just sports in general since I don’t know the situation with other sports.  My view is as stated in the title but I’ll reiterate.   MMA fighters who test positive for performance enhancing substances (PED’s) should face stiffer repercussions as a result.   Why?   As is, most fighters that fail drug tests receive a slap on the wrist for failing a drug test, at most offenders are banned from competition permanently, more often than not athletes will receive a measly 12-18 month suspension and a fine of $10000.   Normally i would say that is fairly harsh even for repeated offenders but clearly it’s not enough. Cheaters continue to evade testing and if they do get caught they serve their time and as soon as they come back they resort to their same old methods like nothing happened, athletes like Jon Jones, TJ Dillishaw, Cris Santos serve as prime examples of this, despite their history of failing drug tests they’re allowed to compete and not only hurt their opponents physically but also financially.   If USADA were to adopts a zero tolerance policy and permabban athletes from competition upon their first failed test, perhaps it would serve as a strong enough deterrent and curtail the wide spread PED abuse, even if it wouldn’t it would still be more effective than the current system in place.   Looking forward to hearing dissenting views on this.	1642791983.0	s9i897	/r/changemyview/comments/s9i897/cmv_mma_fighters_that_test_positive_for/	CMV: MMA fighters that test positive for performance enhancing substances should face stiffer repercussions.
ctol84e9	Someone recently told me that college is where all the smart people are. I’d have to disagree with that statement for a few reasons. Many people do not go to college for whatever reason and I wouldn’t say all of those people are unintelligent. Many relatively smart people cannot afford college in the US specifically.  I also think it’s safe to say that not everyone in college is very smart. Especially in the beginning I think many students are naive. Students who go directly from high school to college can easily be influenced and aren’t likely to objectively consider what they learn in their classes.  Essentially they could form all of their beliefs on various issues based on the teaching of a handful of professors. I see this as bad. Depending on the types of classes they take this could radicalize them. Lastly, what makes a person smart can be a tricky question. In large part it has to do with how much they know, but I think there are other factors that go into it as well and they aren’t so black and white.

7aji4	To be clear, I'm not against making accommodations for mobility handicapped people generally. I'm guessing that I'm wrong for believing this-- that's why it's here. Don't hate me :)   * I understand that they're a minority who are severely marginalized and face a lot of obstacles making use of services, finding desirable work, etc. I do care about this. * I understand that building codes help them achieve equal opportunities and more fulfilling lives. * I also absolutely believe that new construction should be required to install elevators and provide every accommodation for those who need mobility assistance * I am NOT an expert on ADA policy, nor construction, so I'm totally open to being schooled on this.  Why I think our current policies go to far  * I know of a few buildings right now where the cost of building elevator in an older building (often 2-3k$ iiuc, requires shaft and pit) is prohibitively expensive, so upper floors just go empty.     * The additional rent from leasing those floors just could never justify the cost of making them ADA accessible     * If a developer is considering rehabbing a 500k$ building and the elevator alone costs 200k, they'll just never buy it. A perfectly good building will go neglected for that reason.    * 100's of non-handicapped people could be using upper floors of a building every day, but because a tiny minority can't, no-one gets to use it. Who does this help?  * There are a lot of uses for these spaces which a handicapped person could never make use of anyways     * i.e. a light industrial use which would clearly necessitate workers to be physically mobile    * Spin classes-- is anyone who can't use stairs really suffering from being excluded from any kind of leg-specific exercise? * Obviously handicapped people need access to housing, but do they need access to housing in every unit of every building? If they can't use certain floors in a particular building, should we say that NO-one can use it? A lot of cities are facing serious housing shortages right now and it just seems wasteful.  &#x200B;  Alternatives:  * Pose some additional taxes (in proportion to actual rent received/building value) which go directly towards handicapped services or new, accessible construction * Subsidize the construction of elevators if they are a requirement. * Allow exceptions to ADA when the investment is prohibitively expensive to the point where upper floors of a building (or basements) will just go unoccupied. * If someone lives in an old building without an elevator and becomes handicapped/has an injury or illness which requires mobility assistance, the landlord/the government should pay for them to move somewhere * Ramps or short lifts are often pretty cheap to put in, so I think it's reasonable to enforce first floor accessibility at all times. For commercial apartments in old buildings, you could, say, require 1/3 of the units to be ADA accessible.	1642804705.0	s9n1ko	/r/changemyview/comments/s9n1ko/cmv_requiring_old_buildings_to_accommodate/	CMV: Requiring old buildings to accommodate handicapped people does more harm than good
kcqbp	Mars recently announced they were redesigning the M&Ms characters, saying the overall aim for the revamp is “an updated tone of voice that is more inclusive, welcoming, and unifying.”  According to a statement, the changes include the red M&M “ton[ing] down the bossiness,” while the green M&M has traded in her much-debated white go-go boots for a set of sneakers and a newfound focus on confidence.  Meanwhile, the orange M&M will "embrace his true self, worries and all" in solidarity with the more "anxious" Gen Z generation.  To me, this feels more like a publicity stunt, as I have trouble seeing how people can relate to inanimate candies that are designed to be eaten.  But I’m open to other perspectives-what changing the candies could accomplish, how representation (despite them being candies) could be positive, etc.  Additionally, I don’t see how investing in a redesign will help as opposed to fighting violence that people face, donating to groups that provide resources for people with anxiety, etc.  Do people really care if there are genders to the M&M mascots, or what to see themselves represented in something they eat?  Things that will change my view: Evidence that the old M&Ms design is problematic, uninclusive, or promotes violence Evidence that the redesign will be positive and allow people to feel more included/relate more Evidence that Mars has dedicated other resources to fostering inclusion, putting their money where their mouth is.	1642809171.0	s9ool2	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ool2/cmv_there_is_nothing_uninclusive_or_problematic/	CMV: There is nothing uninclusive or problematic about the previous M&M designs

Most importantly, it should be done in an ethical manner, with a suitable habitat and professionally balanced diet for all the animals involved. That's essential, and if it's not done in such a manner, I don't support it. But, if I became a billionaire, foundations are gonna get put up, land bought, and scientists hired.      Imagine primates selected for intelligence, with generous research funding going towards linguistic and cognitive research on them. Sign language taught to every one. Corvids, too!      Or bears! Bears with big, floppy ears and big eyes like dogs! Just turn the 'domestication syndrome' dial all the way to the right on those.      Raccoons are social animals, like wolves. That's presumably why dogs were able to adapt so well to coexisting with humans, right? Except, they also have little hands like ours. They could arguably be cuter.       The value that dogs and cats bring to our human experience is immeasurable, and if I could somehow impart the knowledge of their value to some parallel dimension where they weren't domesticated, I imagine that they'd get started right away. So what are we missing out on with the giant fluffy dog that bears could become, or the intelligent companions that domesticated crows could be??

e0ugcre	This seems to be an unpopular opinion around Reddit and the Internet, but I genuinely do not think that Dune was a good movie, in the sense that I believe that it failed to tell the story of Dune. I'll admit that the cinematography was mostly great, but it fell far short when it came to plot points and story details. Here are my gripes with Dune:  1) The movie missed out on many important aspects of the story. There are entire scenes, crucial to characterization, that were completely skipped over in the movie. The dinner party scene in the book, for instance, was completely skipped out on. A lot of context for parts of the lore was also missed out on - things like what Mentats are, what Thufir's role in the Atreides household was, things like that.  2) For what scenes remained, editing was bad and led to an incoherent flow of the plot at times. I remember being confused at the Sardaukar scene, and how it suddenly led to the whole betrayal/war action sequence.  3) As with point 1, a lot of scenes lacked context to show why certain things happened in a certain way. For example, Yueh's betrayal of the Atreides family seems to be completely out of nowhere - if I had not read the book, I don't think I would understand why this happens, or even who this random person is. Another one that comes to mind is Stilgar's spitting on the table, which is meant to be a gift since water is so precious on Arrakis, but we are given no explanation about this at all and it just seems really strange.  My thoughts are still a little incoherent so bear with me, but I'd appreciate some thoughtful responses! Point 1 and 3 are my main issues with the movie.	1642849910.0	sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/	CMV: Dune (2021) was NOT a good movie for telling its story.
ggw5fsyd	I'd like to take up this topic with 5 different points that I've seen in other debates regarding the discussion and one major inference from the society whose structure is used in this switch and bait.   first, the Inference. i am from India and I've seen in many debates how trans advocates point to my culture and society as a proof to embolden their point. the truth is, they can't be further from the truth. they often point to how Indian society marks more than two genders and that's a weird assumption to make.   this is so because the social categorisation and biological categorisation has no difference in India, even in our language. the world for male/man is narr( i don't know how to type in devnagari script, sorry) and for a female/woman is nari.  the hijras are never fully categorised as either narr or nari.  The only story that is often cited to support the trans claim is that of Vishnu/Mohini but if you do even a basic reading of that story, it'll be clear that two different entities are talked about. so i don't even understand why my culture is appropriated to make a false claim. sure we have more than two genders but the hijras aren't social men/social women because the category on male/man and female/woman are defined in a way that biology and society mirror each other.  Now for the major points :  1. The label transphobia - the label is used as a definition of hatred, fear or aversion of trans people and it's a train wreck imo.  here's a simple example, if someone whom I can visually figure out to be a man, then I'll call him a man. if he insists on using she/her pronouns, I'll do it out of courtesy but that's about it. I won't suddenly start believe that the person is a woman just because a certain set of pronouns were asked.   Where exactly is the hatred, aversion or fear of trans people in this scenario? now, if you ask me to believe that TWAW because somehow in your head you've decoupled  sex/gender, then that's nothing but ideological imposition. i don't believe in that decoupling.   the bigger problem with this label is the way it's used to shut down conversation but i understand that it's a method used throughout history. Accuse someone of having an isms/ists so that inquiry can be avoided.   2. The Switch bait of Gender/Sex - This one is rather interesting. ok, i can't use man/woman to accurately say male and female in your ideology, but can i then use male/female? according to Trans activists, i can't because they then go into this nonsense of noun vs adjective.  as far as biology is concerned, it's classify males and females (with few abnormal conditions that result in intersex). It's also hilarious when trans activists point to intersex and i don't know how i can tell them that no matter how much they twist the definitions, Futnaris don't really manifest. there are no true hermaphrodites in Humans.    3. But but but....the WHO supports us - just because medical associations have accepted the change in language so that the suicidal rate of trans people can come down, it doesn't mean the general society has to take that up too.  a community of taxonomists don't classify litchi as a fruit  but when common people go out and buy litchi, they use the term fruit.    4. The soul argument - i don't even understand what to say to that. this is the classic, woman/man born in the wrong body of man/woman.  i mean what exactly is born in the body? are you suggesting that there's some sort of soul that transfers into a body like water being transferred in two pots and sometimes, it's transferred in a wrong pot?  if you're making that argument, how exactly do you measure and define this soul?   5. The brain scans - ah, the classic myth of Gendered brains and how it's a debunked idea.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x   in conclusion, the only reasonable argument that's presented by Trans advocates is that of courtesy, but I've  already stated i have no issues with using a certain set of pronouns if requested. Going beyond that is just buying into an ideology based on bait and switch.   Also, if you're going to claim that there's no Gender Ideology and i am talking about lives of people, then don't bother with that argument. just like Islam is an ideology but it also impacts lives of Muslims, in a similar way Gender Ideology is and ideology.	1642844392.0	s9yy7t	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/	CMV: The whole trans debate debate is frustrating because it's a big bait and switch on both biology and language.

However, I believe the central question of when a foetus becomes a sapient human being far outshines any possible social problems. If it was discovered tomorrow that sentience somehow started very shortly after contraception there would be no consideration of women's rights as it would be human life on the line.  We have an issue where people debate about when humanity starts and what counts as murder and a ton of comparatively minuscule social ills are treated like they are on the same playing field.  I get that there is an insane amount of history tieing these two issues together and certain organisations such as the church have vested interests in both but couldn't we ignore all that for such a fundamental, almost philosophical, issue?	1642855759.0	sa1tlj	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/	CMV: Abortion shouldn't be seen as a woman's rights issue

ocj6nss	I believe that there are as many genders as society says there are, because it is a social construct. It is something that society made up. Why exactly we thought it made sense or was a good idea to create these arbitrary roles and rules for ourselves I don't know, I'm not a history major, but honestly if it were up to me there wouldn't be any such thing as gender. I think the whole concept is just divisive and in general gender polarization is harmful to society. I don't think the concept serves any purpose anymore, and the whole idea has gotten way too complicated (not because we're saying that there's more than two now, but because of the way you're supposed to base such a large part of your identity and personality off of what sex organs you were born with, which society also decided should be covered up most of the time.)  I don't think there are two genders because I can clearly observe that most of what gender is is only strongly correlated with biological sex (again, only because society says so) rather than being an actual extension of our biology. There's nothing biological about expecting females to wear what us humans call "dresses" and expecting males NOT to, often finding it strange/odd/funny when they do. There's nothing biological about believing that the color blue is masculine while pink is feminine (infact, less than 100 years ago blue was FEMININE. The main two genders we're most familiar with are always changing too. This helps prove that it's just something society made up. Another example is that not long before blue was considered feminine, it was normal for young males to wear dresses.) Basically, my point is that, somewhere in an alternate universe, males are the ones who wear dresses and carry purses, while females don't, and get judged if they do. Nothing else is different in that alternate universe, and nothing in that alternate universe doesn't make any less sense than it does in this universe.  So if this is the case, why couldn't there be more than two genders? What if I was the type of person to wear dresses and carry purses but also really liked the color blue, and was very muscular? Sure, you can try to tell me that that's just a man in a dress or just a woman with muscles depending on what my biology may be, but since when can't I call that a third gender? It clearly doesn't fit perfectly into either of the usual two. Going with the alternate universe thought experiment again, what if instead of gender, it was that every male in this world is taught that they must grow up to be a doctor, and every female a lawyer. Where males get harshly judged by many if they would rather be lawyers. Where, when a male decides to be an engineer rather than a doctor, they get told "there's only 2 professions you can't just make up a new one called 'engineer' you're just a doctor that likes to tinker around" That world is a pretty stupid world, and I think that logic translates to this world.  So far the only things I've heard in opposition to this are "God created two genders" which doesn't really carry much weight, and "XY chromosomes = boy, XX chromosomes = girl, it's that simple" which anyone with an education in biology can tell you, is actually not that simple. I'm hoping to hear something that makes more sense than this.  EDIT 1: It appears that I could've done far better with my explanation, and that I probably didn't pick the most relevant title. I also got many more comments than I was expecting, and I thank all of you who commented! There are plenty of fresh points to think about here. I will do my best to reply to as many comments as I can and will be trying to clear up any confusion in future edits here.	1642864238.0	sa4hu1	/r/changemyview/comments/sa4hu1/cmv_there_are_not_only_two_genders/	CMV: There are NOT only two genders
11g6h8	While I think the concept is interesting, like many others, I don't appreciate what NFTs have become and the hype around them, and how NFT owners are acting like they are amazing - while they aren't.  But I don't understand why people are acting like it's a horrible non-sensible pyramid scheme, and not simply dumb just like abstract art.  In my mind it's a perfect analogy, but opinions online seem to make it out to be much worse.  - Both are only worth something because someone paid for it. - Both can be made by anyone and don't (always) require much talent. - Both are used for money laundering/status symbols and not actually for art. - Both are easily reproducible.  Edit: as pointed out, a lot of abstract art requires talent. I miss worded and didn't mean to offend anyone. I still find some abstract pieces to be meaningless, like that banana that sold for 250K, but I'm sorry for generalizing.	1642876922.0	sa914a	/r/changemyview/comments/sa914a/cmv_while_nfts_are_dumb_they_arent_any_different/	CMV: While NFTs are dumb, they aren't any different than abstract art
62kyxam2	Every time this "We're in a simulation" argument comes up with scientists *who count out a deity btw* they act like humans or any other species advanced enough to make computers strong enough and big enough to simulate the universe and induce consciousness is going to be focusing their time on that.  Why would these galactic level species (powerful enough to control or use the galaxy as easily as humans use earth) give a rodents rump about simulations. We already know how to code genes, we are going to be creating whole worlds in the distant future if we are to survive the death of the sun.  Not to mention the fact that they would likely be more concerned with surviving the death of the universe and how to stop gravity from pulling everything to pieces.  Anyway literally nothing makes sense. Maybe if a species became so god like powerful that it was able to stop the death of the universe it might try to play god. But then it would just play god IRL not on a computer.	1642886053.0	sacb46	/r/changemyview/comments/sacb46/cmv_any_being_advanced_enough_to_create_planet/	CMV: Any being advanced enough to create planet sized computers to simulate a universe won't waste their time trying to simulate a universe.
gb3xu7s4	Faith and hope are two of the heavenly virtues (although the specific list of heavenly virtues isn't that relevant to my view). Even you're not into the religious aspects of it, I think most would agree they are things that most people look upon favorably. However, I think both are generally bad qualities to emphasize. The specific form of these "virtues" both get tangled up with the concept of trust. I'm focused on the primary definition which is not just a synonym for trust. There are lots of different variations to the definitions so I'll specify what I mean here.  Hope: a feeling of expectation and desire that something will happen  Faith: belief in something despite the absence of (or contrary to) available evidence  Both of these are basically irrationally clinging to a feeling. The main problem I have is that their value is basically in that it gives you extra willpower or determination. But then, why not make determination or willpower the virtue we should strive for? In themselves, it's just a way for us to fight against the looming reality that shit will go bad. If you have determination and willpower but not faith/hope then great. You get the benefits without the drawbacks of getting tangled in dogma (faith) or irrationally clinging to unrealistic outcomes (hope).  To be clear, this is not specific to religion. A couple examples - Hope: Mom loses her son someplace, and keeps hoping he's out there for years. Sure it might provide a little solace, but it's a form of self deception. Better to come to terms and overcome, than to cling to a false hope. If it turns out that the one-in-a-million result occurs and the son is found later, it's not the mom will say "fuck that kid, i've moved on!". Faith: Religion, 'nuf said... Nah I'm jk. Let's say I have a feeling deep in my bones that if I bet on 00 on the roulette wheel I'm going to win. I have absolute faith it'll happen. There is no evidence that can sway me. Is it a good bet? Obviously not. The emotion that drives that faith is leading me down a path that is worse off.  Hope and faith should not be considered major virtues, if anything we should replace them with determination and willpower.

d20dcu60	***If you are TLTR:*** ***being that a speech is a type of presentation, I believe it should focus on being impactful, memorable, and "to the point." And since most orators do not have the ability to sustain a long speech and keep it concise and interesting, in my opinion, speeches should not exceed five minutes in length.***   First, please note that by "speech" I am referring to an address which only uses spoken words directed at an audience (such as an acceptance speech). I am not talking about presentations more generally, which use images, videos, and other content other than spoken words. In other words, speeches are a type of presentation which only use spoken words.   Given this context, I believe that speeches should never exceed five minutes in length for the following reasons:  1. Speeches shouldn't be overly detailed, they should only focus on your "thesis" and nothing else. If said "thesis" requires more than five minutes to be conveyed properly, you should probably rely on additional resources such as the ones states above to do so, thus making a *presentation*, not a speech. 2. *Most* speeches that go over five minutes become invariably boring fairly quicky (emphasis on the word "most," I didn't say all).   Now, I do want to address the fact that (as many will probably point out) almost all of the most famous speeches in history exceed five minutes in length. In my opinion, most of these speeches only became significant due to their historical context, not necessarily because of the content or quality of diction associated with them. Of course, there are some obvious outliers (such as the *I Have a Dream* speech, which was delivered brilliantly), but most of these speeches simply are not that great in and of themselves.   Conversely, there are many great, shorter speeches which are relatively less important and remembered. For example, George W. Bush's address after 9/11, while more or less known, was an excellent address: he went "to the point" and outlines all of his ideas in a concise way. But, for better or worse, it did not obtain a historical significance like other speeches on important dates have.   I do also want to point out that, as previously mentioned with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech, some orators have a knack for delivering great speeches, and these can sometimes exceed even fifteen minutes and still be concise and not boring.   Overall, being that a speech is a type of presentation, I believe it should focus on being impactful, memorable, and "to the point." And since most orators do not have the ability to sustain a long speech and keep it concise and interesting, in my opinion, speeches should not exceed five minutes in length.	1642904914.0	saivf8	/r/changemyview/comments/saivf8/cmv_speeches_should_never_exceed_five_minutes_in/	CMV: Speeches should never exceed five minutes in length

gk12urbh	This is pretty simple view. The Patriot Act was ostensibly supposed to be about stopping terrorism, but in reality has done basically nothing to stop terror and has instead greatly reduced our civil liberties and the 4th amendment, the very things that America was built on. To my knowledge the Patriot Act has also never stopped even *1* actual terrorist attack either. I believe that it should be abolished, it gives the NSA/CIA/FBI wayyy too much power while not even achieving it's goal of fighting terror. I was born after 9/11 so maybe I'm missing something but honestly people need to get over it in my opinion. Yes it was plenty bad but Bin laden is dead, Al Queda is decimated and we've spent billions fighting terror, it was clearly a black swan even that isn't going to repeat anyway. There is absolutely no reason to keep around a terrible law passed in reaction to it that was poorly conceived to begin with just because some idiots knocked over a skyscraper over 20 years ago.	1642909429.0	saka0m	/r/changemyview/comments/saka0m/cmv_the_patriot_act_and_all_its_reauthorizations/	CMV: The Patriot Act and all it's reauthorizations should be repealed
ixcmnhwr	I have a lot of problems with NFTS, and I don't produce them or buy them because of it.   However, the only problem i have with *other* people doing NFTs, is the environmental cost of the blockchain, which is the only part of NFTs that I can see that affects me.   Ethereum has stated that they will switch to proof of stake later this year, which as i'm aware, would dramatically reduce the environmental impact of NFT transactions to a level comparable to other online services such as twitter and reddit.     The NFT marketplace is full of scammers, but as far as I'm concerned, the information to educate yourself on the dangers of the NFT marketplace is out there. If you get scammed by NFTs, I would probably place the blame largely on you.   If you're acting safely and knowledgeably on the blockchain, I think that there some positives that NFTS could provide, such as new ways of monetizing artwork, for example.     You could argue that art theft is a big issue with NFT spaces, but I don't fully believe this is as big of an issue as people say it is. If someone could provide proof that enough NFTs of stolen art have been **sold** (not minted) to warrant it being an actual issue, I would also change my mind on NFTs, however I have not seen evidence that backs this up, even with the large ammount of anti-nft posts that have stormed the internet over the past year or so. I have also visited the pages of multiple NFT sellers that listed stolen work, and none of their pieces had any offers. Even then, I would just say that blockchain websites would need to do better to stop this issue, which I believe is possible.	1642909187.0	sak79h	/r/changemyview/comments/sak79h/cmv_once_nfts_go_green_im_fine_with_them/	cmv: once NFTs "go green", I'm fine with them
2l6wi504	As someone with pretty libertarian views, storming the capitol is... literally the best way to show distaste. Rioting in public areas is severely worse, that's where other people are who are innocent, while the capitol is full of politicians-- the people who oppress and make the rules. If the capitol was stormed in a unifying matter, in a general libertarian sense where all sides of the political spectrum just wanted both parties/ all politicians in general to stop oppressing the citizens, it would be patriotic and the right thing to do. Again, these are the people you want to go after, its actually way more respectful than rioting or causing chaos in the streets/public. The only reason the riot from 2021 was sickening and awful was because of the GROUNDS upon which it was stormed-- to falsely reinstate a president like a dictator.	1642911521.0	sakx3k	/r/changemyview/comments/sakx3k/cmv_storming_the_capital_was_only_wrong_because/	CMV: Storming the capital was only wrong because of how far-right nationalists were doing it to interrupt an election and were pushing fascism.

ikq6zcc6	CMV: Because of how cause and effect works, nothing is anyone's fault. (Predestination)  I think we've all heard this argument before but I'll phrase it here:   &#x200B;  Everything in the universe seems to obey cause and effect. This happened, so this other thing happened etc. Given that, any event you talk about, you can immediately trace back to see what 'caused' that event. If you had FULL knowledge of everything in the universe, then for any given event you could see every 'causal' factor that influenced it.  As a result when we deal with 'human' level questions, especially legal questions: "Why did that person kill this other person, was it self defence.. etc".   The question in reality is moot. If we 'trace back' the causal factors, in the end nothing is anyone's fault. Anyone's decisions are a result of their environment and their genetics. Neither of which they can control.   (Yes, they can control their environment directly etc, but the 'decision' to control their environment itself is an outcome of the environment and genetics, and thus in the end they really had no choice).  If we trace back the causal factors, it stops making sense to us as humans.   Why did he stab him? Because he stole something, Why? because he was hungry, why? because he didn't eat. Why did it get to a point where humans need to eat? cos they need energy? Why? Becuase that's how the cell biology evolved? Why? Because life evolved on earth? Why? Because of the right chemical compounds in a meteor that it the planet 3 billion years ago? Why? because it hit another rock which forced it's trajectory...  &#x200B;  And so the "REAL" causal reason he stabbed that other person was because two rocks collided billions of years ago, or some other such reason that doesn't really have any emotional resonance to us, humans.  A word on quantum phenomenon:  I don't think quantum phenomenon invalidates cause and effect, more so that we just don't understand it given the current observations, and it 'seems' to. However nothing else in the universe does, and it'd be extremely strange if such a fundamental rule would arbitrarily break down at that point for some reason.  And even if quantum mechanics invalidates cause and effect. Does that mean our justice system is based on quantum mechanics? And prior to that being known we had no basis of justice other than randomly drawing lines in the causality tree and saying. Yep it stops there. That guys the problem? Not one branch above him and not one branch below!.  And so justice is more defined by where one chooses to draw the line than the actual act being committed?	1642911652.0	sakyo4	/r/changemyview/comments/sakyo4/cmv_because_of_how_cause_and_effect_works_in/	CMV: Because of how cause and effect works, in reality no one is responsible for their actions.
848tcpgz	Change My View: Anarcho-Capitalism is a Fundamentally Unworkable System. For those who do not know, Anarcho-Capitalism (Ancap(s) is how I would refer to them from this point on.) is a political system/ideology that is based of the abolishment of government and it's replacements being private companies. And it's flaws can be broken down into 2 basic categories: Internal & External threats.  1. External threats        External threats are basically, a different nation invading the ancap nation (Ancapistan.) This basically impossible to prevent, even if citizen or companies had the capital to acquire & maintain weapons of modern war, & are willing to defend Ancapistan, which in itself is questionable, they would unable to stand up to a modern military (I would not debate on Nukes in this debate.) for three reasons: 1. Organization, A group of Private Security Companies could never reach the same level of multi front organization as a modern military, thus causing Ancapistan to be defeated. 2. Most companies lack the ability to operate the logistics required to operate a large scale military force, thus causing a defeat through logistics. And 3. Private Security Companies (Mercenaries) have been historically incredibly unreliable in fighting for the same side, often switching sides if the other side paid more, and so would most likely be true about Ancapistan. All of these reasons would cause Ancapistan to be defeated in any war with a modern military, unless Ancapistan is located in a location that is of no value, which would cause a limited economy to occur, going against capitalism.  2. Internal Threats        Internal threats can be easily summed up in one phrase <<Companies forming their own governments to extract more profit, defeating the entire point of Anarcho-Capitalism.>> To expand on the idea, lets say we have a Private Security Company called "Blackpond" and Blackpond want's to expand their company, so they drive out their completion with a combination of buyouts, anti-completive & violence so they are now the only PSC in the area, leaving it able to force it's people to pay for "protection" and if they decide to not pay, they would be beaten up by some people from Blackpond, thus essentially creating a corpocracy. Now some counter this by saying "But the people would defend themselves." now I would counter this with 2 arguments, 1. People can take a surprising amount of oppressions before revolting, & 2. even if they revolt, Blackpond could simply partner with those who own heavy military equipment, by exempting them from the protection fee (Tax) so that if anyone revolted, they could only fight with relatively basic hardware, meaning the company, with stuff like Armored Vehicles could simply roll over them  Edit: Fixed formatting error & meant "Workable as Intended"	1642913626.0	salk6y	/r/changemyview/comments/salk6y/cmv_anarchocapitalism_is_a_fundamentally/	CMV: Anarcho-Capitalism is a Fundamentally Unworkable System

cwfmwffh	I feel like people struggle with procrastination not because there is a problem with them, but just because they don’t like what they do. If you truly enjoy what you do, you wouldn’t procrastinate. To give an example with myself - I have a degree in Finance and that’s what I work to make a living, but in my free time I’ve been doing music for a few years now.   When it comes to music, I NEVER procrastinate. In fact, I can’t wait to sit down and work on music. Even the boring and tedious parts of the process, I still never procrastinate because I love it overall and I believe in the purpose of what I do. I never procrastinated with anything related to music, whether it’s working on a project, or learning some music theory, or reading a book about music, or learning how a piece of gear works. I just have the internal drive to do these things and I can’t even imagine myself procrastinating on any of it.   On the other hand, when it comes to Finance stuff, I ALWAYS procrastinate, because I just hate it and I personally find it very boring uninspiring. It’s just not who I am. I am a creative and an artist at heart, and looking at excel spreadsheets all day is not something that interests me AT ALL. I am sure there are people who are the exact opposite of me!  So people who procrastinate - I think they shouldn’t try to fight it. I think they should just realise that the reason for procrastinating is likely that they don’t enjoy what they do, and maybe it’s time for a change.   Of course, we all need to do stuff we don’t like sometimes, like washing dishes, cleaning, cooking or whatever it is. But these are things that everyone does and everyone needs to do, no way around it. But no one NEEDS to be a lawyer, banker, engineer, or to study a degree they don’t enjoy.  If I could go back in time and change my degree, I would do so in a heartbeat.

fv0k2	Let me start by saying that I am for passing both free public education and student debt forgiveness together. My issue is there are a lot of people who only advocate for one and I think it is damaging to the movement.  As someone who is about to pay off his student debt after 15 years, I can say I'm not really mad about the concept of cancelling student debt even though I sacrificed and saved for all of college and ever since on. It's definitely unfair to people in my situation but the focus should be on future generations not having to go through the same thing.  That's why student debt cancelation is useless without first making public college free. It helps a very small amount of people compared to sustained programs that could last centuries. Its leaving younger generations out to dry. It's very low impact compared to government paid tuition.  The rationale needs to be, education is a human right and thus college should be free and it is only right to forgive student debt.   This is the major problem with the left replicating itself in a new way.  People are only looking out for themselves which makes it impossible to create a winning coalition. Everyone in the left has their own issue and then Biden or Hillary wins the primary because the issues become secondary.	1642954112.0	sawxc2	/r/changemyview/comments/sawxc2/cmv_until_college_is_made_free_in_the_usa/	CMV: until college is made free in the USA, canceling student debt is useless and selfish
13mao47a	*First, I am not on the boat that says "everything can be learnt on the internet or on the job, away with universities." I think that university offers many benefits that aren't easy to get anywhere else including the opportunity for networking, mentorship, extra-curricular activities, various forms of support, being taught people who actively research their field, and access to special equipment, facilities and resources that only a university can afford to provide,*  *This perspective stems partly from my own experience with an engineering degree. After having completed it I realised that if I had the option and I could go back I would forego getting a degree entirely and do less than half of those courses; many of them were a waste of time and money or things I could have taught myself just as well. Even with less than half the subjects, I would still have diverse skills and be employable and I would have enough of a foundation to teach myself more ad hoc.  I would then concentrate on networking, developing a project portfolio and getting guidance from experienced individuals. All this wouldn't work because we've learnt to cling to the concept of degrees.*  *Btw, I'm mainly focusing on undergraduate degrees and maybe also postgraduate degrees that don't belong to law school or medical school - as these are practices and I can only assume that everything taught here is relevant to the job. However, where I'm from, you can get into law school or medical school through an exam. The exams have an undergrad degree requirement (ANY degree), and I think my perspective can be applied there.*  **It should become established practice to study at university and receive government loans on a course by course basis without the requirement of completing a degree with a particular university** **- as if taking individual courses is absolutely worthless if you don't do them in a particular set of 24/32 that constitutes a particular 3/4 year degree.**  **This will have a series of positive educational and economic effects:**  1. Students will be there because they WANT to be there. Not because the course is compulsory for the degree they are enrolled in regardless of, student preparedness, interest, course quality and employability of skills gained etc. They will take greater responsibility for their learning, hence achieving higher grades and learning more. 2. Teachers will have a classroom full of enthusiastic students. We like to blame teachers for a bad educational experience, but imagine having to face and teach a classroom full of students with little interest in the subject that the lecturer is actually passionate about, treats the subject like a chore and asks zero questions. *This was a pretty common experience of mine.* 3. Students further benefit from the individualism that comes with greater freedom. They elect their courses, so they explore their interests, diversify their skills and knowledge, carve a path towards a career for themselves that they are more likely to stick to (guided by experienced mentors that they will all but have to seek out or they'll feel very lost very quickly - *I personally think mentorship is enormously important for success and should be a pillar of tertiary education*). 4. Bad courses will be eliminated as the students begin to consider reviews of a course by other students before choosing to enrol. Courses that don't get enough enrolments will naturally die. Good courses will be rewarded with higher enrolments and revenue. 5. The price of a course will be determined by supply and demand as students can take a course on a subject they are interested in from ANY university they wish as they are not bound to complete a degree with a particular university. This will likely lead to a drop in the price of courses on average. Good courses will have a higher price of course, but you'll get what you pay for (see point 4). 6. Eliminating the fixed price of courses and the degree-loan system will eliminate economic inefficiencies:  * Some degrees have huge dropout rates of up to [40%](https://educationdata.org/college-dropout-rates) in the US. With the degree system, a dropout's entire tertiary education goes unrecognised even if they've completed a significant portion of a degree and could probably be qualified for an entry-level job in their field with what they've learnt. This represents a loss of skilled labour. * A high percentage of graduates don't enter into a field related to their degree in. In the US, this figure was [73%.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) Without the degree-loan system, this would figure would significantly drop and people would be better poised to contribute to the industry they enter (see points 1 and 3). Another hit to skilled labour. * Lower loans and debts. The government essentially gambles with taxpayer dollars when they provide loans on degrees, they expect each student to benefit enough from the degree to get an economically productive, stable and well-paying job that will allow them to repay the debt. However, in the US, [10%](https://educationdata.org/student-loan-default-rate) of graduates default on their student loans. Without the degree-loan system, the price of each course will be lower (see point 5) and the number of subjects they complete will likely decrease but will be up to the individual's future plans (see point 3) and the better education (points 1 and 4) will lead to higher-skilled workers that can contribute more to the industry and are generally better paid. Hence, lowering student loans, loan default rates, and an increase in "GDP- improvement-to-student-loan-ratio".  I'm not hating on universities for operating like businesses - I mean that's pretty much how any large organisation can hope to operate in the world. My issue with them is short-sightedness. I think the reason they stick to the degree-loan scheme is the shortsighted need to guarantee a fixed and significant amount of revenue from each student that enrols with them.	1642959100.0	sayug9	/r/changemyview/comments/sayug9/cmv_the_concept_of_university_degrees_especially/	CMV: The concept of university degrees (especially undergrad) should be abolished. You should be able to enrol in any selection of courses, which will constitute your tertiary education. You should be able to get a loan on a course-by-course basis (not on a degree basis).
cointc9g	There was a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOnOpB3yN1k) going around in political circles of conservative commentator Matt Walsh making an appearance on a talk show having a discussion with two trans advocates. I think his most impactful argument is when he simply asks the trans advocates, **"What is a woman?"**  To my surprise, neither of them can answer this question. In response to the question "Can you tell me what a woman is?", one says "No I can't, it's not for me to say", and the other says they "cannot define what a woman is" because they are not a woman (which is a logical fallacy).  This struck me. If you can't clearly (or even somewhat) describe what an identity means, why should anyone respect your identity? You could replace "woman" with any other label in that situation. Without any criteria or definition, it doesn't actually matter what you identify as in that situation.  I think we would all agree that defining your terms is of fundamental importance in any kind of debate. So it seems to me that these trans advocates failed in their argument right out of the gate since they failed to define their terms.  I think the reason that these advocates refused to define what a woman means is because if they gave a definition, it would be something so vague and nebulous that most reasonable people would think that their definition doesn't meet their own criteria for what a man or woman is, making the term mostly meaningless.  So I walked away from this clip with a much different perspective on the trans identity. Can anyone offer a more compelling argument as to why I should respect the trans identity?	1642965778.0	sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/	CMV: Without a clear definition of what your identity means, you can't identify as that thing.

9hmvwt6z	Today, most developed countries derive a majority of their revenue from the income tax (and payroll tax) which is a tax on labor. There's also sales tax and VAT which tax consumption, capital gains tax which taxes interest (gains from capital), and the wealth and estate taxes which tax idle wealth.     I tend to be a centrist on the issue of taxation. According to republicans, taxes are evil. According to democrats, taxes are necessary. Both are correct. Just about every tax incurs a deadweight loss upon the economy (not including pigovian taxes). This is because of opportunity cost. Money handed over to the government isn't spent on consumption or investment.     But what if it didn't have to be that way?  &#x200B;  There are three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. Labor refers to effort by man to create. Land is anything made by mother nature like natural resources and land itself. Capital is anything manmade, especially to create goods and services. Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).     Of the three factors of production, land appears to be the odd one out. This is because while labor and capital have a potentially unlimited capacity, land is in fixed supply. Although land specifically refers to natural resources, the namesake is fitting because the primary use for nature in most developed countries is real estate. Land has a fixed supply, meaning that any increase in demand will increase land prices. Furthermore, increases in the value of land benefit no one except the landowners, unlike increases in capital and labor. This is because, as mentioned before, land has a fixed supply. If the price is up, that means there's more economic demand for that land. The saying goes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. This isn't necessarily true, there is a way to get a free lunch. Typical investment involves putting money into something in the hopes of getting more out. When you put money into a business, you are feeding it capital. At some point in the future, assuming the business grows, you will eventually get more out than you put in. Speculation is a form of investing which does not contribute to the investment itself. An example would be buying something for $10 and selling it for $2000 as a rare collectible. This isn't to say that all forms of speculation are bad. In a volatile commodity market, speculation can help serve to stabilize the price. But it's in the real estate market that we see the pernicious effects of speculation because land retained by speculators is not contributing to the economy, at least not as much as it could. This is why an economist by the name of Henry George proposed a land value tax (LVT). The LVT differs from a property tax in that it only taxes the land itself rather than anything on it. This means that decay and improvements won't affect the amount taxed. This is important because more efficiently used land tends to be taxed more. What may affect it is everything happening around it.     Another problem that the LVT may solve (at least if it's implemented at the state or federal level) is the inefficient use of land encouraged by governments. I'm mainly referring to byzantine zoning codes and subsidies to roads. Bad zoning is often the result of local nimbys opposed to new development. What the LVT would do is tax homeowners on very valuable land. Of course, land zoned for single-family housing is worth less than land where highrises can get built but if there's a shortage of housing, land values will go up. An LVT would make the same people who push against projects reconsider, lest they pay significant taxes. Furthermore, an LVT would tax roads subsidized by lower levels of government.     One concern is that it will hit rural america like a trainwreck, devastating agriculture. My response to this is that this tax would actually be a tax on suburbia, let me explain. Landowners in downtown areas will be paying the highest taxes but property there, after enough time, will derive a very high percentage of their value from the improvements rather than just land (Is the land in Manhattan worth more or are the skyscrapers worth more). Rural property will derive a minimal percent of value from improvements but land value will likewise be low. It will be suburbia which gets hit the hardest. This is because suburban land is used the least efficiently. Property taxes encourage suburban sprawl because property encouraging a higher density is typically taxed more. An LVT would encourage efficient use of the urban core, decreasing demand for suburban housing. This would actually be good for farmers because it would slow down suburban sprawl. It would also be good for small farmers because big farms tend to be more land-intensive (small farms have more buildings per unit of land, subjecting them to property taxes).  The LVT would also curb gentrification, or at the very least slow it down. This is because of the way that development would go. Currently, development is incentivized to push toward low income areas because going there means lower property taxes and land is easier to purchase. To illustrate how this would change, take Chicago as an example. You have the north side and south side, the former is home to affluent white communities while the latter is home to poverty stricken black communities with high crime rates. The LVT would incentivize more development in the north side because land values there are higher.	1642968025.0	sb2d87	/r/changemyview/comments/sb2d87/cmv_we_should_have_a_land_value_tax_which_would/	CMV: We should have a land value tax which would replace as much of other forms of taxation as possible
h46ept97	Title. My view is that there is nothing that makes people deserving of things such as love, food, water, shelter, any of these things. There is also no inherent value to people, only the value people ascribe to them for their own benefit. A girl who has a big butt? She's useful for sex. A guy who is experienced at working on cars? He's useful to repair your vehicle. This is the only worth someone has, but no inherent worth.      When I say no one deserves anything, I asked myself "What makes someone deserving of anything", and I could never answer this question for myself. The same thing went to "What inherent worth do people have", and the question went unanswered. Ever since then, I have never found a solution to this question.	1642971745.0	sb3skc	/r/changemyview/comments/sb3skc/cmv_no_one_deserves_anything_and_people_as_a/	CMV: No one deserves anything and people as a whole are inherently worthless
29hxpfed	I have never understood the utility of coffee tables, but maybe somebody can change my mind. For one, it seems like nobody ever uses them for drinks. Nowadays, most people that drink coffee or tea put it in a mug and take it with them to work, buy it on the way to work, or make it at work. It also seems extremely inconvenient to lean forward and bend down to keep picking up and setting down a drink, or doing anything for that matter. Side tables are much more space saving and easier to use for everything I could think of doing. Some people just end up using them as footrests, which is gross and far less comfortable than an ottoman. They also seem to always become dedicated as a collect-all for junk, especially if you have kids. If you don't have kids, you are probably getting too old to keep bending over to use a coffee table.	1642976505.0	sb5oeu	/r/changemyview/comments/sb5oeu/cmv_coffee_tables_are_a_worthless_piece_of/	CMV: Coffee tables are a worthless piece of furniture.
9efj2	Minor spoilers for the film follow: just under an hour into the film, there is a sequence showing two characters falling in love - one professes his desire to a third character who tells him to pursue it, which he does. They spend time together doing various activities, they hold hands, he professes his love to her. Then there is a brief sex scene, with no nudity, where they say “I love you”, then it cuts to a wedding scene.  I would submit that the sex scene adds nothing to the film - the intent of the entire sequence, to show them falling in love, was achieved without it; the scene itself is dimly lit and amounts to little more than him lying on top of her; the dialogue within the scene could have been said in any scenario, not just a sex scene; and the “woah!” effect of the scene being in a Marvel Studios title interrupts the viewers’ suspension of disbelief.  Additionally, I would argue it is the only scene that many parents would take issue with when showing the film to their children. Marvel Cinematic Universe fans often skew younger, and this scene makes Eternals a complicated film to show them.  Happy to have my mind changed, though!	1642977864.0	sb66vb	/r/changemyview/comments/sb66vb/cmv_the_sex_scene_in_marvel_studios_eternals_did/	CMV: The sex scene in Marvel Studio’s Eternals did not add anything to the film, and in fact detracted from it
gn40ghtx	CMV: The only way this pandemic will end is if we have more effective vaccines Effective in terms of transmissability   Simple point of view.   Our current vaccines are not effective enough against transmission, if they were then we would be back to normal now.   We know this because the vaccinated people are still getting infected and then spread it either directly to unvaccinated people, or to other vaccinated people who then eventually through a string of infections to an unvaccinated person.   Yes unvaccinated people make up the bulk of ICU beds, but this is only because vaccines we have now suck at preventing transmission because even in a society where most of us are vaccinated, cases can still rise to the level where our healthcare systems can become overburdened.

12i37h	The title basically says it all.  Timed exclusivity games and permanent exclusivity games are not the same.   &#x200B;  Timed exclusivity games are fundamentally deals between the developer or publisher and a store front. Be it Nintendo, Xbox, Sony, Epic, etc. That in exchange for an upfront cost or potentially a larger cut of the sales from the store front, the game will be released only on that store front for X amount of time. Usually a couple months to a year before they release the game for all systems that the developer or publisher can or wants to support.   &#x200B;  Deathloop by Arkane Studios is an example of this. Sony made a deal with Arkane or ZeniMax (pre buy out) to have the game first release on PlayStation consoles.  After that no doubt the game would be released on Xbox, PC and maybe Switch would get a port a few months down the road if there were no direct hardware limitations.  &#x200B;  Deep Rock Galactic is another example. Though that one is more likely due to resource limitations then any contract due to Ghost Ship Games being a tiny 5 person studio founded in 2016.  DRG was released on Steam Early Access in Feb 2018. Two years later it got an official 1.0 release for Steam and Xbox in May 2020. Before finally being released on PlayStation in Jan 2022.  The game will not be getting a Switch release because the system lacks the memory requirements to handle the procedural generated mine that is created during each mission. According to Ghost Ship Game's developers.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Permanent exclusive games are fundamentally games that will never leave the original system they were created on. Some are because of controller differences. This is mostly RTS games that were created with a mouse and keyboard in mind and trying to fit that on a controller isn't worth the time and effort.  But most of the time it is because the owner of the IP doesn't want it aviable on other systems or stores.  &#x200B;  Ratchet and Clank  and Halo series represent the easiest examples as they are first party titles that Sony and Microsoft hold the respective IP rights two. And each series has become a core aspect of their respective console's first party games.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I am bringing this all up because I have recently had an interesting conversation with someone who insisted that they are both identical.  That because both examples involve exclusivity they are fundamentally the same thing.   Similarities matter but differences even minor ones can matter even more.  And saying that Deathloop or Deep Rock Galactic that took a year or years to release on all systems and Halo or R&C that will never leave their 1st party systems are the same is just objectively wrong.   &#x200B;  Delaying someone being able to play a game is not the same as never allowing someone to play a game.	1642983708.0	sb8bie	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8bie/cmv_timed_exclusivity_games_and_permanent/	CMV: Timed Exclusivity Games and Permanent Exclusive Games are not the same.
b0lj1bpy	edit: to clarify the title a bit, it should've been "... any company should not be trusted and should be taken with a huge grain of salt"  &#x200B;  to expand a bit more, any product related videos, such as reviews, set ups, etc, should not be trusted or taken with a grain of salt, if the reviewer gets (or usually gets) sponsorship from any company, whether it's the company of the specific product or not.  an example: a tech reviewer does "my desk setup for 2022" and shows a bunch of products he used. Then he mentions "this video is kindly sponsored by blah blah VPN". Any contents (besides non tech related videos, such as politics or social justice) by this reviewer should not be taken with full trust.  &#x200B;  Reviewers need to make money (or spend less), just like anyone who is not relying on others to live. This means that they will do whatever it takes, within reasons, to attract potential sponsors. This is most effectively done by saying nice things. Even criticisms are minimized and very mild. They are typically very personal to minimize deterring viewers from purchasing that item. Sponsors do not like and don't want reviewers being brutally honest (which I'll discuss in the later section). They want the reviewer to say nice things, but realistically. So they are fine with some mild criticisms, but mostly filled with nice things.  this is precisely how magazine, both electronic and paper, reviewers write to attract ads for the magazine.  Now, why does it matter if the sponsor's products are not featured in a specific video? Remember that the idea is to attract sponsors. It's about the presentation. The reviewers want their reviewing styles to be known to the potential sponsors. So even if they purchased the items featured in the video, their main goal for the potential sponsors is "hey, see how nicely I say things about your products? please consider sponsoring me". Sure, any reviewer could have this goal. But those who never need sponsors typically don't care about pleasing potential sponsors, because they don't get any benefits. If they can afford to buy stuff or have no reason to save money, what's the point of pleasing sponsors? It's much easier to be brutally honest than faking realism.  &#x200B;  As mentioned previously, companies do not want reviewers to get brutally honest. They've already done design testing in house and perhaps with beta testers. it's not good to get bad reputation on any product, so any testing is preferred to be in house or privately. Why would they want to pay, with money or product, someone to say bad things about their products, when they can just recruit people to do it privately? The only reason for paying someone to make their opinions very much public is purely for marketing.  &#x200B;  Now, who can we trust more (be less suspicious)? Anyone who doesn't get any sponsorship and pay products with their own money. (by the way, anyone who purchases products, do reviews, and return them should not be fucking trusted, because that's a dick move)  How should reviewers make money then? The current Youtube payment is a great model. The way reviewers get paid by YouTube is the number of views, generally speaking. This is an indirect payment by consumers, NOT by sponsors. I'm not saying that the current YouTube model is the best way, because the payment is probably too little, but it's the right idea - the reviewers should get paid indirectly/directly by the consumers, not by the companies.	1642983951.0	sb8ej0	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8ej0/cmv_any_product_contents_from_a_reviewer_eg/	CMV: any product contents from a reviewer (eg. youtubers) who gets sponsorship from any company should not be trusted or taken with a huge grain of salt
10hmrj	My view is quite simple, something must be encased in pastry to be considered a pie. There are other existing terms to describe other possible combinations such as pastry bases and potato tops or the like, so calling something a pie to describe the main part of the dish being encased (or partially encased) in something else is misleading.  Just because something is made with pastry doesn’t make it a pie- tarts, pasties and palmiers etc… are all made with pastry but don’t proclaim themselves to be pies, yet some things, such as cream pies are made with cake and bear no other resemblance to traditional pies, pumpkin pies are actually tarts and pie charts aren’t even edible and don’t have a filling- they are just disgraces to the name ‘pie’  The word pie exists for a reason, let us not dilute its good name by associating it with inferior products.	1642984295.0	sb8j11	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8j11/cmv_to_be_considered_a_pie_it_must_be_fully/	CMV: To be considered a pie, it must be fully encased in pastry.
fkcm0	I am talking about moving other people laundry from the washer or dryer to a clean surface (like a table or the top of a washer or dryer) 5 minutes or more after their cycle has finished IF there are no other free washers/dryers available. I am also talking about a situation where you can't simply text someone first because the facilities are shared between too many people to know whose clothing is responsible for what  You shouldn't inconvenience yourself more than 5 minutes waiting for someone to come get their laundry.  1. you don't know how long they could be, they could have put their clothes in the dryer and left for the day. and if they do that and you leave their clothes there, you are letting them monopolize the washer/dryer for a whole day instead of the time of one cycle (less than an hour) 2. People should be responsible for getting their clothes from the washer or dryer, such as by getting their 5 minutes early. If they can't arrange them, it is likely they failed to plan ahead. If you want to avoid things like other people touching your laundry or accidentally losing some items (like socks), you should get your laundry, instead of leaving them in public and hogging a washer or dryer 3. You shouldn't move people's wet clothing from the washer into the drying machine, because you don't know what they wanted with their clothing (may want to hang dry their clothing for ex), as drying can have negative effect on clothing (depends on fabrics). And not moving wet clothes into the dryer and instead leaving them in a clean place is similar to if you hadn't done your laundry - you obviously don't have an obligation go into the laundry room to ensure other people don't forget to move their laundry from the washer to the dryer.  People in my dorm would email the dorm listserve asking people move their laundry, creating lots of spam, without any guarantee the relevant offenders would even see the email. Some people just wouldn't do their wash in the washers are full!? Why? Moving laundry is non-malicious, and allows you to do your laundry without being obstructed by others while only requiring minimal effort. Since these are shared washers and dryers you can't just let people leave their clothes in them for hours or a full day since other people also need to use them.	1642985384.0	sb8w9v	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8w9v/cmv_in_shared_living_dorms_etc_you_should_move/	CMV: In shared living (dorms etc), you should move other people's finished laundry to do your own

ahgreb5a	In a game where two superstar quarterbacks are battling back and forth, NFL overtime rules state that the first team to score a touchdown wins. That means one team could win without the other team even getting an opportunity on the field.   This gives immense benefit to the team that wins the coin toss. Simple as that. It is more luck of the draw than football skill. In a playoff game, it should not come down to a coin toss.  Rule should be changed to give each team at least one possession, regardless of scoring.  I would like to know why the NFL has this rule and why it's superior to what I've suggested.  **Edit. What will NOT change my view is something along the lines of "If you can't stop them on defense you don't deserve to win."   **Edit 2. Once again, I WILL NOT accept the idea that a team only playing Defense, but no opportunity for Offense, is a good argument. The NFL has more protections and rules to provide for offensive production. Give both teams an equal opportunity. Not playing good defense is NOT a reason to not give the offense a equal opportunity. Yet that is almost all the arguments in this thread.  ***Edit 3. Performance of a specific team in previous games, decision-making earlier in the game, etc., will not sway my opinion. My CMV is broad and not the result of one game. I am not a Bills fan. I am not a Chiefs fan.  **** EDIT 4. IF PLAYING DEFENSE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED, IF THE DEFENSE PREVENTED A TD THEY SHOULD WIN, RIGHT? SO WHY DON'T THEY? Why does one team need to play defense AND then play offense whereas one team only needs to play offense? How is that fair? I repeat: for everyone saying YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM... so you think if a team does stop them they should win without having to score?  That statement should go both ways so each defense needs to prove itself. And besides, if people really meant that, why do teams that allowing scoring during the regular game get the ball? What's the difference? That's like saying, in baseball, if the pitcher gives uo a HR in the too of the 10th inning the other team shouldn't get a chance to bat.	1642993253.0	sbbjoo	/r/changemyview/comments/sbbjoo/cmv_current_nfl_overtime_rules_are_awful/	CMV: Current NFL overtime rules are awful.

604m6tes	The left lane should be used for passing slower traffic to the right but often times people who are oblivious, ignorant, or both start cruising in the left lane at the same speed or slower as cars to the right of them.   This causes cars who want to pass slower traffic to pile up behind them and they are unable to get around.  This causes a great deal of frustration for drivers behind them and often times causes these drivers to drive wrecklessly by tail gating or weaving through several lanes of traffic to get around. This increases the probability of an accident occurring and makes the road more dangerous for all lanes of traffic.   While people shouldn’t drive wrecklessly at all, it is almost certainly bound to occur with at least one or more drivers stuck behind the slow driver as the frustration gets the better of them.  This issue can easily be solved if the slow left lane driver would just simply move over. That way everyone is happy - the cars behind them can speed up and the slow driver can continue cruising how they want.  I think the issue is that people are too oblivious to realize what they are doing is wrong. We all know that speeding is bad and we immediately slow down when we see cops up on the road. I think the same reality check reaction should occur if you’re driving in the left lane and the best way to do this would be increasing the penalty for holding up traffic in the left lane when you can reasonably move over.  This would hopefully cause drivers to think twice before getting comfortable and slow in the left lane.	1643004299.0	sbf18l	/r/changemyview/comments/sbf18l/cmv_people_who_drive_slow_in_the_left_lane_should/	CMV: People who drive slow in the left lane should be given tickets just as bad as speeding tickets

It should be the opposite. You should have to designate through your end of life wishes, like you would with any advanced directive or discussion with your designated power of attorney, that you do NOT want to donate your organs. Anyone who does not do this should be assumed that they will donate their organs.  This also should apply to kids, babies, people who are considered incompetent to make medical decisions, undocumented people, travelers, and people who are unidentified.  There is no reason someone’s organs should not be donated when they died simply because they just never signed up for the registry.

49m3cdti	Why need a guy to be rich? Why not become as rich yourself as you want your husband to be? I get that it's an individual preference but I think one should marry a person they deserve and love, because this thought process is patriarchal.   I have heard some arguments saying "It's because a rich guy would create better chances of sustenance of the offspring, which is why it's inherent in women to look for such guys". How is it not different from saying that I want to marry a girl who does all the household chores, takes care of my children alone and doesn't have an identity of her own because if she works outside my offspring won't be taken care of properly. It's inherent in me because during stone age, men used to hunt outside and women used to takecare of the offspring and had little to no say in anything.  Why do I see this whole "rich guy" thing so common even today? In 21st century how is this idea not leading to the idea of inequality? Am I missing something? Please help me understand.  Edit 1: My point is not against aspiring to become rich. We live in a practical world and we should try to become rich but why do a girl needs a guy to be rich? Shouldn't they be having aspirations to earn more and more themselves rather than aspiring for a rich husband?  Edit 2: I agree that people who are rich probably have many other things which made them so but I am here talking about  people who did nothing but have their father's money.  Edit 3: Most of the counter views can be summarized as it being "realistic". If we look at everything with realism then we can throw away many discussions about equality, generosity, morality, feminism etc because many of them don't stand from a realistic perspective.	1643031778.0	sbmiae	/r/changemyview/comments/sbmiae/cmv_girls_who_marry_a_guy_just_for_his_money/	cmv: Girls who marry a guy just for his money actually perpetuate patriarchy
clqcyvm3	Many Christians engage in spontaneous prayer. I define spontaneous prayer as "prayer that is done, on the spot, with no set words or preparation, often n a very informal manner". For example, say if a Christian is sad, and they randomly pray in that moment, with no planning of what to say or preparation.   I believe that this type of prayer makes no sense. I am not a Christian, but I can try to look at it from their perspective. Christians view God as a King and Father, who should be treated with respect. If you were going to talk to a human King, then surely you would prepare your speech (in the case of prayer, use a set prayer) and use formal language? The Creator of the Universe surely deserves this type of prayer, over informal spontaneous prayers.   Spontaneous prayer is very common among Christians, particularly in my experience Evangelicals, some of whom will treat Jesus/God like a best friend. To me, and with my understanding of Christian theology, this is very weird.  Why pray to God at any time, anywhere? The time and place may not be appropriate.   Yes, I am a Hindu, and I pray a lot, but this isn't the type of prayer I pray. It just doesn't make sense. I pray formally, using mantras and candles and incense and offering bowls, and devotional songs - how you would actually approach a Queen, as Goddess is described in our scriptures.   Please change my view, because I want to understand Christians better.	1643034223.0	sbncab	/r/changemyview/comments/sbncab/cmv_spontaneous_prayer_makes_no_sense/	CMV: Spontaneous Prayer Makes No Sense

litpy	Markets crashing. The perceived net worth of these billionaires is just evaporating because their holdings are dropping in value. I've seen calls for these holdings to be taxed, but this market crash scenario is why I think that's dumb. Corporate profits should be taxed and those loopholes closed.  This will in turn reduce the value of stocks because the companies are less profitable.   This is preferable to me because end of year profits are concrete, and set.  Just tax a huge chunk of that and the USA will have fewer billionaires anyway, because their portfolio won't get so big in the first place and use it for things like public health care, roads, and retirement.

13i4cf	For those that don't know the concept of a smart gun  is that it can't fire without biometrics or link to your phone.  This sounds good in general, it would keep unauthorized users from getting their hands on it and misusing it, right? That would be perfectly fine for hobby/recreational shooting. But it very much becomes a problem if you need to use it for self defence.  Several self defense experts indicate that when the emergency happens you function at about 70% of your worst day performance. This means that you won't be grabbing at the right angle needed to unlock the firearm. Or what if you have gloves on? Biometrics don't read through clothing.  The response to the biometric gloves problem might be the well have it unlock when in proximity to your phone argument. Unfortunately this also doesn't work for self defence. Often people's phones go dead.   And how far should the range be? If your phone is taken from you by one of a team and gets it over 20 feet away do you lose the ability to use your defensive tool?  That's about how far I can get from my phone before the headphones disconnect.  Basically when I think about how "smart" features function they simply make the firearm less reliable as a self defence tool and therefore should not be used for self defense applications. And as self defense is the primary purpose of semi automatic designs it really doesn't belong in that platform.  Hunting? Okay. Self defense? Absolutely not. And people are far more likely to have self defense guns than hunting ones thus making the application of that technology virtually useless.  Edit: okay a bunch of you are assuming home defense. I want to be explicit: I'm not taking about home defense but carry out in every day life.  Edit2: forgot to put this forward, this is primarily in reference to the possibility of requiring it. Devoid of that it's simply an type of safety and that's it's own debate.

3qbhrr9s	It is only fair that you have Uncle Sam pay off your debt you don't get to keep the degree. Otherwise it's a free ride and is unfair to the people that did pay their loans off. Those that opt for student loan forgiveness shouldn't use their college degree on their resume.   P.s. I understand that unaffordable college education is a big problem in the USA. The colleges are corrupt and inflate the education costs because they can, because the government gives out education loans fairly easily. I believe the government instead of forgiving the student loans should first try to tackle the "unaffordable college" situation so we never land in a place like this again.

snvyh	**Edit - we're done here:** It's been demonstrated convincingly that statistical literacy is generally unrelated to the underlying problem, and that it would be much more effective to teach "some very basic philosophy, rhetorical critique, and the underlying psychology of believe".  **Edit - major change:** A better approach would be "specific tasks that encourage further analysis, such as debates, research and other such projects. If you teach that desire for further inquiry and a healthy sense of skepticism, then people don't need specific prior education in stats at all."  I think basic statistical literacy is important to basic functioning in a world that has tons of data flying around on various important topics.  When a lot of important arguments hinge on statistics, it's difficult to critically evaluate the points made without understanding the math.  One example is that people are prone to comparing the risk or benefit of [action] to nothing, not considering the risk or benefit of [inaction].  This problem runs deeper than being acquainted with the math, but I think having some training in thinking that way would encourage thinking it through properly.  For a more immediate association, it's also pretty common for people to compare proportions of [thing] by population without considering the size of the respective populations.  Both of these have prominent current examples, but I want to avoid the distraction of bringing up specific political controversies here.  Not a particularly in-depth argument, but I think it's fairly obvious that a lot of people aren't equipped to reason about important statistics, and I don't see a major downside to trying to change that.  That said, I haven't given it a ton of thought, so I'm open to the possibility that I overlooked something obvious (e.g. evidence that it wouldn't work).  To address "what class would this replace?", I think it would work fine in place of an existing math class.	1643056040.0	sbvm3h	/r/changemyview/comments/sbvm3h/cmv_probability_and_statistics_should_be_part_of/	CMV: probability and statistics should be part of the high school core curriculum.
337mmtum	I believe that hunting is generally immoral. It does not matter if you are planning to eat the animal or not. The only situation in which I believe hunting is ethical, is if you need to kill an animal to eat in order to survive. I grew up around hunters and have even been hunting once and killed an animal. I am not vegan nor a vegetarian.   Despite the fact that many members of my family choose to hunt and eat the meat, I still find the practice immoral. None of these people NEED to kill a deer to eat, they all have normal jobs and make enough money to buy meat from the grocery store. This is what my opinion centers on... given a situation where you do not need to kill an innocent animal, but chose to anyway, I would consider the hunter to be in the wrong.  I don't pretend that meat I enjoy doesn't come from dead animals. However they were likely killed, processed, and prepared in a factory-type setting which is designed to produce food for humans. This is probably a more traumatic experience for the animal compared to getting killed by a bullet, I realize that. However I don't understand the hunter's "need" or "desire" to want to go out and kill an innocent animal when you can just buy meat from the store.   TL/DR: The individual decision to say "yeah I'm going to kill/hunt an innocent animal today even though I could easily go to the store and get the food I need" is what I consider immoral. I'm not interested in comparing hunting to a slaughterhouse or farm, I'm just saying that killing when you don't need to kill is bad.  EDIT: A lot of people missing the point, and that's probably because I didn't do a great job explaining my perspective. It's not that I think factory farming is better, or that having someone else kill for you is better. You guys are all treating the scenario as "factory farming" vs "hunting". These are not mutually exclusive. Factory farming happens regardless of whether you hunt or not. Factory farming produces more meat than we can consume. Therefore I believe hunting for food is unnecessary, animals are already killed and processed for you to eat, and there is no shortage of it. The individual hunter does not NEED to wake up, load a gun, and kill a deer. They could choose instead to consume an animal that's already dead. It boils down to killing is bad, killing more than you have to kill in order to survive is worse.	1643058599.0	sbwknv	/r/changemyview/comments/sbwknv/cmv_hunting_animals_is_generally_immoral/	CMV: Hunting animals is generally immoral
4de7s	When I go into a new restaurant/bar/cafe these days, the majority of the time I go in fully expecting to be disappointed because they will likely have these cheap medieval torture devices masquerading as chairs.  I don't get how any adult with a rear end bigger than an 10-year-old girl's could possibly find them comfortable.  I have never met a single person that enjoyed sitting in one for longer than 15 seconds.  In fact, if you google the phrase "shitty metal chair in every restaurant these days", you get images of "The Chair" and links to articles about how terrible they are.   Businesses that use them apparently only care about the trendiness and/or cost/maintenance associated with them because they cannot be considering customers' comfort when choosing them.   What's worse than businesses having them is that with the whole trendy "modern farmhouse" aesthetic that is going around these days (Thanks Chip and Joanna Gaines), half my friends have replaced their dining room seating with these unholy terrors, making it very difficult to work up the desire to visit them.  Now, I'm a bigger guy so I realize my hate for them might be more than someone else's, and I am genuinely open to understanding how these things might be somehow beneficial to those using them to sit on and not solely to those providing them to sit on.	1643061502.0	sbxql7	/r/changemyview/comments/sbxql7/cmv_those_crappy_metal_tolix_chairs_that_every/	CMV: Those crappy metal Tolix chairs that every other restaurant has these days are terrible, and places that only have them for seating do not care about their customers.

I don't  like them because:  (1) I find them visually unappealing.  (2) they look clumsily built, heavy and very awkward to hold.  (3) the string to finger ratio is so ridiculous that I just don't  see the practicality or playability of a guitar that has more strings than humans have fingers.  (4) I've never seen a decent youtube video of this instrument being played in any way that can make a decent song. Its usually just a short improvosation piece.  (5) the bass strings are usually so heavy that they sound dissonant.  (6) its so wide that you can't wrap your fretting hand around it, nor can you strum across 14 strings.

hkcykjj2	I will say that I don’t think that people should die for crimes that were mistakes or not out of malice like a crime of passion for example or an accidental murder or anything of that degree, but I think that truly heinous criminals should be sentenced to death and was surprised that not many share this viewpoint.  I was reading a thread about the death penalty after watching a sad story on true crime about Junko Furata, and many replies said that every human deserves a second chance and prison should be about rehabilitation. I simply can’t put why I disagree with this, but in cases like the Junko Furata case I simply believe that all 100 involved and even the parents of the main perpetrators of such a heinous crime should have been executed.  First reason why, is that all 3 of the four main perpetrators went on to re-offend or brag about the crime, and another reason is out of sympathy for the victim. If I was tortured for 44 days then burnt alive I sure as hell wouldn’t want the perpetrators to see freedom and would want them hung or electric chaired.   I know this is only one case but I believe that other cases were such vulgarity and evil was committed without a shadow of a doubt, then they should die.   I am open to having my view changed.

35lld6wh	Forgiving all student loans without any regard to the economic situation of borrowers will worsen income inequality and hurt non college graduates (who are generally poorer).    I’m not saying that we shouldn’t cancel any debt, but we should at least focus on cancelling debt for people who actually need it.   &#x200B;  According to BLS college graduates earn an average of $25,000 more per year than a high school graduate. Unemployment and poverty rates for those without a degree are far higher.   &#x200B;  Obviously not everyone is automatically successful because of college. But even those with college experience and no degree earn more than those without college experience.  Plus, the people with the most debt actually end up making the most amount of money(doctors or lawyers). Also the lowest paying majors almost always pay more than the average person without a degree.   &#x200B;  Sure some people with a degree don’t have a great economic situation but it would be far more productive to just cancel debt based on expected income rather than just blanket forgiveness.  &#x200B;  I don’t know why one would support a form of welfare that mostly goes to upper or middle class Americans rather than helping people on a need basis.

6hz1khcy	I'd like to focus on American Christianity for this one, but other religious dogmas are welcome to join in.         Housing rights? Sexual sins are irrelevant to that. Respectful behavior? We are commanded to love everybody. Job/cake/public space discrimination? We don't care if you're divorced, had premarital sex, or committed any other legal sin, we let you in.         If I'm understanding Christian doctrines right, it's pretty well established that only God can judge, and it's only by faith that anybody gets on His good side. So, strong arming by other people serves no purpose, right? Following commandments is just seen as a natural consequence of faith, but not as a qualifier for being a good person.

iw5v8hw	Prefacing this by saying that I'm from Ontario, Canada and there may be parts of the rest of the country or the world that this is already in practice. Sorry if my thoughts seem scattered below, but the title is as distilled and accurate as I could make it.  I believe that by giving the general public the option to ignore Covid policies in place to help stop the spread and not have any way to verify that this information is true it has been a detriment to recovery. I've been working in retail during the entire pandemic so far, and to my knowledge the law is that we can't ask customers about their medical exemptions.  I believe that the anti-vaxx movement has used this unregulated policy to get away with bypassing restrictions without any repercussions. These people would gladly use this to their advantage because there's no verification whatsoever.   Based on my firsthand experience dealing with customers with claims of exemption, I don't believe that there's any health condition that is severe enough to restrict them from wearing a mask for the short time they're in a store. Each time I've dealt with one of these customers, I've told them that I would be happy to accommodate their needs outside of the store, but that none of the rest of the customers consented to being in their unmasked presence. Each time they've stormed off instead which leads me to believe their claims of exemption are false. If a condition is truly so severe that they can't wear a mask, I don't believe they should be out shopping at the mall since the risk of contracting Covid is likely more deadly for anyone with existing health problems.  I suppose my view is actually twofold:   1. **Government wise:** Given that the vaccinated have to show proof to enter certain businesses, I believe that they should have created a pass to go alonside this so that exempt individuals have a their claims legitimized by the government. Instead, the government went hands off on the matter and these people can use existing polices to skirt restrictions with no repercussions  2. **Individual wise:** Customers should be forthcoming with their reason for exemption and any by trying to bypass restrictions they've done harm to the rest of the population	1642708995.0	s8rney	/r/changemyview/comments/s8rney/cmv_medical_exemption_from_covid_policies_should/	CMV: Medical exemption from Covid policies should not be private info, and lack of regulation of this has done harm
5e20b	I am an asexual, so I actually do not have any experience with sex. Though I am heterosexually orientated and come from a religious background. Now the reason why I'm coming here is to see if I can break any possible prejudices when it comes to this topic.  **The Hypothetical Scenario:**  Let us say that you're in heaven. You have 100% equal attraction to both the male and female gender. You can also switch from being a male to female and vice versa. You also have unlimited amount of partners, all to your liking. When having sex, you cannot use any sex toys either and it must be one on one.  I feel that, over time, the person would start preferring heterosexual sex even if he starts off with either M/M or F/F. Why is that?  With M/M sex, where there's the top and the bottom, I feel that the bottom would not be pleasured because his genitalia is not being simulated. It's not equally mutual pleasure. Even if they were to do frotting, it would not be as pleasurable as penetrative sex.  With F/F, scissoring only leads to clitoral stimulation, and there's a lack of penetrative sex. I feel as if the vagina isn't being used in the way it's supposed to, and in this way, it's being neglected the vagina's designed purpose.  Though with M/F, both partners are equally stimulated, the penis is being used as designed, and the vagina too.  In this way, I feel heterosexual sex is inherently more pleasurable. Though please do not misunderstand the argument I'm making. I'm talking about a purely hypothetical scenario and I'm sure there are LGBT peeps that find homosexual sex more pleasurable than heterosexual sex. Though I feel that people have preferences, which puts bias on what's pleasurable for them, for both homosexual and heterosexual. Though this hypothetical scenario puts away any barriers.  I'd love to hear perspectives on this, and I do want to open my mind on this. I feel that humans are biological designed for heterosexual sex, so by nature it would be more pleasurable if people didn't have any sort of preference or bias.     **EDIT:** My view has sincerely changed. But that's why I've come here. I am pretty ignorant on these things, but that's why I've come here to change my misconceived notions with an open mind.

However I have seen people from the fandom say that rengoku won the conflict between akaza along with Tanjiro.  However I disagree. Rengoku may have successfully defended the civilians and the other demon slayers however he did not win by any ways, and not just the battle.  What exactly did he accomplish by saving a bunch of nobodies (aside from tanjiro, insouke, and zenitsu) who will not contribute to the war against demons?  Many people have been killed by demons and because rengoku failed to defeat akaza, (who by the way is very fucking sexy. Seriously that demon has such a gorgeous body along with daki and that hot femboy demon enmu) he will continue to kill and eat people. In fact Akaza will probably kill more people than rengoku has saved. I am not saying that he could and should've killed Akaza because rengoku seemed outmatched by him.

gtwut	There was a time when I believed in the "transporters kill you" argument. I actually came up with it on my own before I heard it from anyone else. The idea is that if the machine works by destroying you and recreating you somewhere else, "you" experience death and the other version of you is a copy.  But as I thought more about this, I realized that my belief that staying in the same body keeps my consciousness alive is entirely unfounded and arbitrary. For all I know, I could have "died" ten times today and I'd never know the difference. There's no point in worrying about something I have zero knowledge of how to affect.  If consciousness is purely a material phenomenon, then it has no greater meaning and isn't worth the futile effort of trying to keep it alive.  If consciousness has a spiritual component, like a soul, then what happens to it when my body is destroyed is in the hands of whatever higher being exists.  Both of these mean the same thing: I don't know how consciousness works, so why should I worry about it?  By the way, here's [a comic about someone who came to a similar understanding](https://www.existentialcomics.com/comic/1). However, my conclusion is different than that of the comic character. I believe that my values, ideas, and goals have value and they are what I should endeavor to preserve.  I believe that in a world where some sort of mind-copying existed, people who think the way I do would be at a strong advantage. I know my mind-clone would die to save me, a copy of its values, ideas, and goals. My mind-clone would know I would die to save it. They would experience no angst over being a "copy". Both of us would have empathy toward the other and conflict would be minimized, at least until we've had time to diverge.	1642727329.0	s8y1y3	/r/changemyview/comments/s8y1y3/cmv_i_am_not_afraid_to_go_through_a_star_trek/	CMV: I am not afraid to go through a Star Trek teleporter, digitally upload my mind, or copy myself and destroy the original.

h30mpe0x	So the way I see it is:     * Just throwing away our trash into a volcano isn't a viable solution simply because of the tons on tons of fuel needed for the job of transportation of all garbage to the volcano sites and deploying them, the immense amount of harmful greenhouses gases that would be released into our atmosphere as a result of doing so, and the sheer impracticality of transporting everyone's garbage into a singular going-off volcano. * I believe that bringing the world's *recycled glass* to a volcano is far more practical and will have fewer negative externalities * Due to us only transporting *glass* recycling, recycling far less heavy than metals and the step of dividing it into small pieces isn't as likely to harm the environment as doing so for plastics due to the subform of "micro-glass" not existing * Glass doesn't burn, so as it melts it won't burn and send of greenhouse/carbon gases as burning plastics does because glass isn't made of carbon as it was never alive.  * Having a far less bumpy and streamlined travel needed for, again, only excising glass recyclables would make it much cheaper and more practical from a bandwidth perspective. * The infrastructure needed wouldn't be much more than a railroad system.  * Job creation * Throwing glass in a volcano completes the rock 'life cycle', as the solid form melts back into the earth to become put under immense heat and pressure to melt and form rock. * The effects of merging glass recyclables back into the deep earth would have tremendous, interesting, and possibly financially beneficial geological layers in the future. Who knows what crazy minerals something like having a vein of this stuff a million miles long would create? * The world working together to transport recyclable glass would create better international relations as solving problems of waste management and sanitation. A good chunk of that garbage would have a place to go at long last.  Thus, transporting all recyclable glass into or near the edge of inactive volcanos and ready to deploy if a volcano becomes active to return the material to the deep earth to become melted and naturally processed by mother earth would be a good idea to implement to solve or at least somewhat fix environmental and social problems.

9gphfw6b	I am morally Pro-Life. I think that abortion is only morally permissible in rare circumstances such as rape, the health of the mother, etc. I believe that life starts at conception, as it's the only non-arbitrary point in a pregnancy. Abortion is wrong because it robs a future from someone. Even ifyou believe a fetus is not a person yet, it is a distinct organism that has the potential for a future, and abortion ends that potential. An embryo is a distinct organism in a way that a sperm or egg aren't.  At the same time though, I support abortion rights because I don't believe in imposing my views on others. Also, banning abortion would lead to back-alley abortions, which is not better. Banning abortions wouldn't actually stop people from having abortions, and it's not my place to force others to live in accordance with my view of abortion. The negative consequences of banning abortion do not justify banning it.  I also believe that efforts should focus more on sex education, access to contraception, and supporting expecting mothers. Abortion shouldn't be the norm, and we should take steps as a society to reduce the need for abortions in the first place. But in the meantime, we shouldn't ban abortion.  I can be Pro-Life and still support abortion access with a clear conscience. Please change my mind.  Edit 1- two things I want to clarify.  1- I'd consider an abortion any intentional active act to end a pregnancy. And pregnancy meaning that the sperm has fertilized the egg so that there is now an embryo/fetus. 2- the goal if this CMV is not to discuss the morality of abortion. Rather that given that I believe abortion is wrong, I can still support abortion rights from a legal point of view. Morality and legality are not the same. I can be morally pro-life while still support pro-choice legislation and not be breaking my conscience.  Edit 2- I got into a discussion about my view on contraceptives that do not allow for implementation being morally permissible. I intended this to be more about abortion pills and clinical abortions, not contraceptives. I wasn't thinking of birth control when I wrote this CMV.	1642754271.0	s968az	/r/changemyview/comments/s968az/cmv_morally_prolife_yet_support_abortion_rights/	CMV: Morally Pro-Life; Yet Support Abortion Rights; Clear Conscience
4t6ewgkh	For my whole life, like most people, I've had an interest in space. I even contemplated becoming an astronaut when I was little, and recently I've been buying telescopes and trying to get into amateur astronomy.  However, time and time again an idea occurs to me: space is only of interest to geologists. Really, the main reason most people are into space is in the hopes that we'll get to live in the world Star Trek or something in the future. Clearly, that's not going to happen. All attempts to find evidence of alien life have proved fruitless, and its gotten to the point that even serious scientists are considering that aliens may be intentionally hiding from us in some form (theories range from them just maintaining radio silence to avoid drawing the attention of would-be interstellar conquerors, to our world actually being some sort of zoo for highly advanced aliens). Besides, even if did finally get a radio signal, what would it matter? We obviously wouldn't be able to visit them, and two-way communication would be impossible due to the distances involved. In fact, many scientists believe that we'll simply never leave the solar system. Some have even suggested this as an answer to the fermi paradox: interstellar travel is simply impossible, so all aliens are forever trapped in their native solar systems.  Like I said, a lot of the drive for the exploration of space seems to be to just find aliens. When I was young, I was somehow convinced that there was in fact animal life on Mars and that Nasa was just living in denial of it (I have no clue how I got this idea, though I was also into cryptozoology, ufos, ghosts, and I even believed in Atlantis at the time). I now know though that there is clearly nothing there. At best, we may find some germs essentially buried under the ice caps. Even fossils are unlikely, given the short time span during which Mars could've supported macroscopic life (keep in mind, Earth life is believed to have not become multi-cellular until literal billions of years into Earth's history).  Obviously, we're never going to get to meet an alien intelligence, we're never going to have some alien alien as a pet. Our solar system at least is nothing but dead, barren rocks. Who would be interested in that other than geologists? I do acknowledge that geologic activity can be interesting, I'm just saying there really isn't anything else.  And yes, I know Nasa is becoming increasingly convinced that alien fish are hiding inside the icy moons of the outer solar system. Honestly though, to me that always just looked like wishful thinking. They think it 'could be', and thus it must be. That logic has never exactly panned out though. Scientists used to think there could be life on Venus, but we now know that's virtually impossible. There's clearly nothing running through the deserts on Mars, even if the 'Martian germ' thing is still an open question. Even when people finally landed on the moon, Nasa was afraid that the astronauts may bring back alien germs (literally). They kept them in an isolated chamber just in case they caught something contagious, and even made petri dishes of the dust they brought back looking for microbes (along with injecting the dust into chickens to see if they would get sick). I even heard once that one of the apollo astronauts claimed that when he was on the moon, he couldn't shake the feeling that he would turn around at some point to find an alien peaking at him from behind a rock. Seriously. Point is, people time and time again keep overestimating the capabilities of life. Mars has no life, because its atmosphere is too thin, its dry, and the surface is being bombarded by radiation due to its lack of a magnetic field. Even the hardiest of extremophile bacteria can't survive Mars' surface conditions for long. Venus is essentially a planet-sized blast furnace, and pretty much every other body in the solar system has no atmosphere to speak of. Nasa invested quite a lot of money and time trying to intercept alien TV signals and radio shows, again to no avail. Nasa is apparently starting to concede now that we won't find intelligent alien life any time soon, though that still doesn't stop them from trying to work out how to colonize the moon and Mars! Netflix for at a time was even airing a series that was fundamentally a hard-scifi space opera. Regarding the icy moons again, contrary to popular belief, the animals at the hydrothermic vents at the bottom of the ocean are NOT fully independent of resources coming from the surface. Namely, they still need to breath oxygen, which they have no way to synthesize themselves, instead they survive off of oxygen made by photosynthetic plankton at the ocean's surface. Clearly the icy moons don't have that. More than likely, their oceans (if they are even there) are poor in oxygen, essentially creating a situation like Mars but underwater. Besides, some have even suggested that the subsurface oceans may also be highly salty, making it only hospitable to certain extremophile bacteria at best.  Elusiveness aside, let's assume the best case scenario and that there really are alien fishes swimming around in the outer solar system, how could we even study them? Nasa can't seem to get its project started to send a submarine probe to Europa, and even if they could it certainly wouldn't be a regular occurrence. Even if they do finally do it and find alien fish swimming around, that's all the footage we would have for at least another decade (that's about how long it takes just for a probe to get to the Jovian system, forget things like actually planning the mission which can easily drag on for a decade or two on its own).  Besides, let's be honest, if aliens really do exist somewhere and we could study them, they probably wouldn't be that interesting. Everyone seems to be unable to help imagining even alien animals as being fantasy creatures. Yeah, they would probably look weird (or maybe not, some have suggest that alien animals may not be all THAT exotic, citing that there's a multitude of very good reasons why animals on our world are designed the way they are), but I think it safe to say that studying them in reality wouldn't be any more interesting than studying animals on Earth. I mean, even channels that specialize in animal programming can't help but broadcast cryptozoological stuff, for the simple fact that such SELLS BETTER THAN REAL ANIMAL SHOWS. People don't want a new species of deer or wild dog or whatever, they essentially want dragons and unicorns and whatnot. I mean, probably the most popular aliens to imagine are ones that would exist on low-gravity worlds with thick atmospheres, which they obviously do just so they can have a rational explanation for having giant things that fly.  And regarding colonization, honestly even that may be impossible. One thing that nobody seems to be considering is our reliant we are on fossil fuels. Even if you have some green way to generate energy, at the very least you need petroleum to make things like lubricant and tires. Our world could never be 100% green. Tragic as that is, it would pose an even worse problem for people on Mars or the moon. What, is Nasa going to be sending them shipments of lubricant regularly? Any one trying to live outside of Earth is going to be forced to rely mostly on pre-industrial technology essentially. Besides, we don't know yet if humans can even survive low-gravity conditions. We know for a fact that humans can't live perpetually in zero-g, but we honestly have no clue how much gravity humans need. Even nasa concedes that it may turn out that we could never live on the moon or Mars. I mean, many people have been advocating we terraform Venus instead, part of that being it has close to Earth's gravity (about 90%), so it would probably be fine unlike the low gravity worlds of our moon and Mars. Obviously, we're not going to be able to stand on Venus any time soon, for all we know even that world's gravity may turn out to be too little.  TLDR:  Simply put, there's little of interest in space outside of geology. Alien life has proven highly elusive and we keep overestimating where it could survive. Even if we did find it, it certainly wouldn't be all that interested (at best it would be as interesting as Earth life, which nobody really seems to care much about), all attempts to find talking aliens have proven fruitless and even if we did find them we'd have no way to hold a conversation. Besides, let's be real, its pretty unlikely they would be interested in showering us with their technology. Do you see anyone on Earth trying to uplift the various tribes scattered across our planet who are still essentially living in the stone age? And even regarding coloniztion, we simply don't know enough yet if its even doable or not, all we know is that if it is, it would be immensely difficult. At the very least, we would have to divorce ourselves completely from fossil resources before we even consider trying to put permanent habitation on other worlds.  Honestly, at times I agree with Fry's sentiment near the end of that episode of Futurama where he accepts everyone else's opinion that the moon is uninteresting. He remarks on what it meant to people in our time, but then admits that the moon really is 'just a big dumb rock'. In reality, pretty much every moon and planet besides Earth is just another rock. There are no Martians, or Venusians, or Vulcans. The solar system, and the whole universe so far, is just a vast desert that we could possibly start mining in some day (though Nasa seems to consider mining asteroids to be more feasible, though honestly I suspect that may just be because we obviously have no sentimental attachment at all to asteroids unlike we do for the moon and Mars).  Purely and simply, space sucks. I guess its neat if you're into geology, but beyond that, there's nothing to see. I mean, I've even heard of a new answer to the fermi paradox in that aliens may just resort to living out their space opera fantasies in VR games because building such a program would be far easier than finding aliens in the real world, and it would also be far more interesting for obvious reasons. Colonization and curiosity are the only two things I can imagine that would justify space exploration, and the former we're clearly not making much progress on. Besides, I'm sick of being forever teased by the question as to if there's anyone out there. Its an eternal burning question that has defied all attempts to answer it, and really I think its about time we just accept that we're not going to find aliens, at least any time soon.  I do concede though that I haven't thought like this most of my life, I guess I'm sorta still sitting on the fence, which is really the sole reason I'm even posting this. So don't take my post as me just explaining why I've grown tired of space, I am willing to consider that I could be wrong. Besides, its pretty freaking obvious that 99% of the human race would disagree with me either way.	1642762422.0	s985tv	/r/changemyview/comments/s985tv/cmv_space_is_only_of_interest_to_a_geologist/	CMV: Space is only of interest to a geologist.
ij5pitnb	Not sure of the best way to word it, but I don't mean just running straight thru a red light. More like treating it like a stop sign. Look around, see if it is safe, then go. In my town with a bunch of lights that make no sense, it can save me quite a bit of time. I got in a debate on reddit a while ago about this topic, someone basically calling me a very unsafe maniac. They argued it was never really safe to go until the light was green. I mean traffic lights are literally for controlling traffic, not for safety.

eie5iyq	The point of nuclear deterrents was to support the doctrine of mutually assured destruction and thus prevent war between major world powers. That doctrine is a relic of the cold war, and the threat it is designed to prevent is no longer likely, nor the most pressing concern of foreign policy.  Disarmament would reduce the number of nuclear weapons which would reduce the likelihood of their use (e.g. through falling into non-state actor hands), and would save a given country considerable amounts of money which could be diverted to any number of net positive causes.  Of course multilateral/universal disarmament would be even better, but I don't see any reason for a given state to wait for that before disarming themselves.	1642783581.0	s9f134	/r/changemyview/comments/s9f134/cmv_unilateral_nuclear_disarmament_by_any_nuclear/	CMV: Unilateral nuclear disarmament by any nuclear armed nation would be of benefit to society
9w27p	In S7E1 of Mr D (a Canadian sitcom about, in essence, a phys-ed teacher), Mr D decides to grade his students on their ability at the sports/activities that the class does. This, of course, causes a hilarious uproar among other teachers. Reflecting on this, I think that it is a reasonable approach.  Take, for an example, a mathematics class. On tests and exams, you are predominately assessed on how well you understand the material, and not how much effort you put into learning; a talented but lazy math student could indeed get a much higher grade than a student who puts in a lot of effort but struggles mathematically (for a potential various host of reasons, but that's neither here nor there for this argument).  Why not apply the same logic to the gym portions of phys ed? For starters, it would give students who are academically talented a chance to learn how to struggle and succeed at something that isn't always in their academic wheelhouse. This would build resiliency and develop a strong work ethic among students that may not develop it through a standardized school curriculum.   Secondly, it gives students that are talented at something besides academics a taste of talent and interest being rewarded. Even if "gym" isn't a skill always required in the adult world, giving students a taste of success outside of raw academics would be beneficial for students self esteem.  I am in no way married to this view and I can indeed be convinced otherwise with a strong argument that the "effort" based grading is fair and beneficial overall.	1642786961.0	s9gbrr	/r/changemyview/comments/s9gbrr/cmv_students_grades_in_the_gym_parts_of_physical/	CMV: Students' grades in the "gym" parts of Physical Education should be based on how good they are at the activities, and not the effort that they show.
5fwnzg1	Two things to get out of the way, first: I'm not saying that all adult's political views are good, and I'm not saying that everything children(i.e. sub-18yr-olds) do in general is not worth serious consideration.  At the core of it, children's political views tend to suffer from two major problems: lack of perspective and lack of acknowledgement of complexity.  The first is fairly obvious: children have not lived very long, by definition, and thus haven't seen as much of the world as an adult. Therefore, they lack necessary context on a lot of important things, to the point where entire points are invalidated. The number of kids I've seen who are, for example, communist, is very large- and if they've never actually worked a day in their lives, then all that talk of exploitation of workers and unfair hierarchies and the need for revolution falls a little bit flat, to say the least- and that's hardly the only thing. Military spending, political partisanship, whether Joe Manchin should be lynched, whatever- overwhelmingly, kids I see have kinda crazy views on it, and it's mostly based on a quick skim of a few news articles at best.  The second point is related to the first- children often don't understand or appreciate the complexity of the world, and so propose overly simplistic, absolutist solutions that wouldn't actually help much.  Fundamentally, the world is *really* complicated, especially politically. Every action has a thousand consequences and a thousand factors, some good and some bad, and they should all be taken into account before seriously talking about them, because otherwise you just get wildly off base. "just tax the rich out of existence" or "just make discrimination illegal" are both things that I've heard repeatedly from kids, and both are rather problematic for many reasons, but it's almost impossible to get kids to admit that because they just don't understand how complex those things are, and so they get frustrated when people tell them that that's not how the world works.	1642786022.0	s9fyym	/r/changemyview/comments/s9fyym/cmv_childrens_political_views_are_poorly_informed/	CMV: Children's political views are poorly informed or overly simplistic the majority of the time, and are thus generally not worth serious consideration.
4rzppk5	A couple disclaimers before I get into the meat and potatoes of my view. This will mainly be directed towards streaming services in the United States, as those are the ones I am familiar with, as well as the fact that not all countries have had the push for streaming licensing like we have in North America. Secondly, some examples I'll bring up will relate to using piracy as an alternative to streaming, but whether or not piracy is justified isn't really my view. There are tons of CMVs on this sub about the morality of piracy, so if you like pirating, go for it.  I often hear this widely held belief that there are too many streaming services nowadays. So much so, that if you wanted to pay for all of them, you'd be spending hundreds of dollars a month for access to everything. People state that cordcutting is no longer the cheap alternative to cable that it once was, and they lament the old days where Netflix was the only streaming service that had "everything." I see memes like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/oyvncb/before_vs_now/) implying that streaming was the reason they stopped pirating, but now that there are dozens of services, they've returned to piracy (which again, the morality of piracy is not really my view).  As much as I hear about this *problem* of an over-saturated streaming market, I've never really understood people's complaints, so I'll break them down one by one.  **1: I have to pay a bunch of money every month to get everything, as opposed to only paying $9 when it was just Netflix.**  This is the point I understand the least. People act as though 2010 era Netflix was this massive content library when it never really was. Netflix had a comparatively *tiny* fraction of all available movies and TV, considering the vast majority of it was exclusive to TV networks as well as physical media like DVD and Blu Ray (Don't worry, I'll address streaming exclusivity in another point). So acting like you could get almost everything on Netflix back then is simply untrue.  Certainly, Netflix had more content back then compared to now, but for good reason. During the early days of streaming, studios and networks were far more willing to give out cheap streaming licenses to entities like Netflix, because they didn't really see streaming as a competitor to their cash cow of network TV. So if Netflix made them a little more money on the side, they indulged them. When it became apparent that streaming was becoming the future of entertainment, those licenses got more expensive. Services like Hulu, Amazon, etc. saw the opportunity to join the market, and now networks didn't have to choose between Netflix or no one at all, or they just made their own services like we see now with Paramount Plus, Disney Plus, Peacock, etc. And while people have a right to be upset about the smaller library, I don't think it was ever realistic to expect them to have a monopoly on streaming forever.  Tl;dr: Netflix never had anywhere close to everything, and believing that they would was a bit of a pipe dream.  **2: Buying every streaming service is just as expensive as cable now, so there's no point to cordcutting.**  I'll start by reiterating that Netflix and Hulu didn't have everything in the early days of streaming when cordcutting started gaining traction. Therefore, the notion that one or two cheap streaming services got you anywhere close to the total amount of content that was available on cable isn't true.  The bigger problem I have with this position, is that people always seem to be comparing cable to buying *every* streaming service, which isn't a fair comparison. I don't know the buying habits of most people, but I'm fairly certain most who switched to streaming weren’t buying every channel package, every premium network, and every on-demand package available to them through their cable provider. While it certainly depends on your provider and region, buying every channel and on-demand package available would easily run you above $500 a month. Heck, sometimes you would need more than one provider to truly get everything. So while buying every service is certainly expensive, it's pretty comparable to cable.  So if you were cordcutting back in the early days of Netflix/Hulu, you either weren't actually paying for "everything" from your cable provider if you saw streaming as an alternative, or you were willing to forgo some content for a more convenient service/pricing model. Which I wouldn't blame anyone for doing. You don't have to pay installation or rental fees, no mandatory price increases after 1 to 2 years, and you don't have to deal with the middlemen of cable companies. I've often signed up and cancelled a service within 20 minutes because I know I only want to watch one show and only needed it for the month.  Most importantly, you aren't really at the whim of TV Network's programming schedules. You don't have to record shows or worry about DVR space, you don't have to wait around until the network with the license arbitrarily decides to air that show or movie, you (for the most part) don't have to watch commercials or wait for all episodes to release, particularly if it's an older show. All that is to say there are a multitude of benefits to cordcutting besides cost-saving.  **3. Exclusivity is ruining streaming now that content is spread thin, rather than consolidated into one good service.**  This one is a bit tricky and probably deserving of its own CMV entirely. Addressing this point is probably most likely to change my view (provided you can get through it).   To start off, I don't mean to sound like a broken record, but while Netflix had more licenses back then than it does now, it's not as though Netflix had everything pre 2010, and now it’s all spread amongst 10+ services. That's not to say that content hasn't left Netflix only to be put on its own proprietary service, like Peacock, Disney Plus etc., but as I alluded to earlier, that is more to do with the shift from TV to streaming and studios not just giving their licenses away for peanuts when they realize people aren't watching TV anymore. I'd think most people would prefer having the majority of content available streaming than have most content exclusive to TV networks.  That being said, there are other arguments kind of baked into this. One of which is that since services can get exclusive licenses, they compete only on what content they have, rather than who has the better service. While I think it's true that some services are more reliant on their content than the quality of their website (looking at you Disney Plus launch), people aren't really flush with examples when asked how they'd make the sites better. Likewise, I don't really see people championing the services with the most features, only complaining that they don't have every show they want on the service they already have (usually Netlifx). So I'm inclined to believe people are more upset that they have to pay for another service as opposed to services not innovating.  And again, back when cable was the norm, if you didn’t like the service your shows were on you often didn’t have an alternative. At least now you can subscribe to a service for a month or two rather than a year, or just rent or buy the content you want from Amazon Video, iTunes, or YouTube (Whose service should theoretically be the most acceptable alternative considering how many hours you watch YouTube with no complaints).  And, of course, you can always just pirate if you really hate all the other services that much or you just don’t want to pay. Though I should mention that, unlike the meme I linked earlier, it doesn’t seem to make logical sense to have stopped pirating in the early days of streaming only to go back now for the variety of reasons I’ve already touched on.  **Other thoughts**  This is a bit more subjective, but even though Netflix had more back in the early 2010 era, I seem to remember a lot low-quality content, like B-Movies, reality TV, documentaries etc., compared to the bigger licenses we see today, and of course, the plethora of original content they produce. Speaking of original content, while we might joke about how bad "Netflix Originals" tend to be, the fact that there is competition for the same licenses encourages entities like Netflix to create more content that they don't have to worry about renewing.   I don't think we can downplay how culturally significant some of that original content is. We also get content from smaller creators and studios that don't have to self-publish, foreign films and shows that wouldn't have made it overseas (Fun fact: I actually started drafting this before Squid Game came out), and even revive cancelled properties like Arrested Development.  So that’s really it. I don’t get why streaming services, or the fact that they're so prevalent, always seem to be the internet’s punching bag. It just seems to be such a common viewpoint that I feel like I’ve missed something, but I can’t think of what.

18kcykri	I mean the title really says it all. If an app is marked as ‘free’ that should mean it’s truly free, not a free trial before you have to pay a subscription. I know people will probably say to check the description for the subscription terms but sometimes the description of the app doesn’t even list that and you only find out until you download the app.   I don’t see why the App Store shouldn’t force these companies to list the subscription price for the app instead of putting ‘free’ when we both know that’s a lie. Some people insist that the phrase ‘in app purchases’ covers this but I disagree. In app purchases imply extra things you can pay for to make the app or game easier, not to simply use the app at all. Think of candy crush; there’s a major difference between buying stuff in candy crush to help you advance levels vs paying a subscription to even USE the app in the first place.   Also other products that have free trials aren’t advertised as free. Think of various software; yeah they have a free trial but the price of their software is plain on their website, they don’t hide behind the word Free* with an asterisk.	1642790803.0	s9hsb0	/r/changemyview/comments/s9hsb0/cmv_apps_that_require_a_subscription_should_not/	CMV: Apps that require a subscription should not be listed as free in the App Store
55m1vke4	(Sports post, feel free to skip if not interested!)   I’ve been following this sub for a while and thought I’d try making my own post. Since most posts here cover complex social issues I figured I’d choose a topic that’s relatively light hearted.   Since i am most familiar with the widespread PED abuse in MMA i will limit it to that sport alone rather than just sports in general since I don’t know the situation with other sports.  My view is as stated in the title but I’ll reiterate.   MMA fighters who test positive for performance enhancing substances (PED’s) should face stiffer repercussions as a result.   Why?   As is, most fighters that fail drug tests receive a slap on the wrist for failing a drug test, at most offenders are banned from competition permanently, more often than not athletes will receive a measly 12-18 month suspension and a fine of $10000.   Normally i would say that is fairly harsh even for repeated offenders but clearly it’s not enough. Cheaters continue to evade testing and if they do get caught they serve their time and as soon as they come back they resort to their same old methods like nothing happened, athletes like Jon Jones, TJ Dillishaw, Cris Santos serve as prime examples of this, despite their history of failing drug tests they’re allowed to compete and not only hurt their opponents physically but also financially.   If USADA were to adopts a zero tolerance policy and permabban athletes from competition upon their first failed test, perhaps it would serve as a strong enough deterrent and curtail the wide spread PED abuse, even if it wouldn’t it would still be more effective than the current system in place.   Looking forward to hearing dissenting views on this.	1642791983.0	s9i897	/r/changemyview/comments/s9i897/cmv_mma_fighters_that_test_positive_for/	CMV: MMA fighters that test positive for performance enhancing substances should face stiffer repercussions.
ctol84e9	Someone recently told me that college is where all the smart people are. I’d have to disagree with that statement for a few reasons. Many people do not go to college for whatever reason and I wouldn’t say all of those people are unintelligent. Many relatively smart people cannot afford college in the US specifically.  I also think it’s safe to say that not everyone in college is very smart. Especially in the beginning I think many students are naive. Students who go directly from high school to college can easily be influenced and aren’t likely to objectively consider what they learn in their classes.  Essentially they could form all of their beliefs on various issues based on the teaching of a handful of professors. I see this as bad. Depending on the types of classes they take this could radicalize them. Lastly, what makes a person smart can be a tricky question. In large part it has to do with how much they know, but I think there are other factors that go into it as well and they aren’t so black and white.

7aji4	To be clear, I'm not against making accommodations for mobility handicapped people generally. I'm guessing that I'm wrong for believing this-- that's why it's here. Don't hate me :)   * I understand that they're a minority who are severely marginalized and face a lot of obstacles making use of services, finding desirable work, etc. I do care about this. * I understand that building codes help them achieve equal opportunities and more fulfilling lives. * I also absolutely believe that new construction should be required to install elevators and provide every accommodation for those who need mobility assistance * I am NOT an expert on ADA policy, nor construction, so I'm totally open to being schooled on this.  Why I think our current policies go to far  * I know of a few buildings right now where the cost of building elevator in an older building (often 2-3k$ iiuc, requires shaft and pit) is prohibitively expensive, so upper floors just go empty.     * The additional rent from leasing those floors just could never justify the cost of making them ADA accessible     * If a developer is considering rehabbing a 500k$ building and the elevator alone costs 200k, they'll just never buy it. A perfectly good building will go neglected for that reason.    * 100's of non-handicapped people could be using upper floors of a building every day, but because a tiny minority can't, no-one gets to use it. Who does this help?  * There are a lot of uses for these spaces which a handicapped person could never make use of anyways     * i.e. a light industrial use which would clearly necessitate workers to be physically mobile    * Spin classes-- is anyone who can't use stairs really suffering from being excluded from any kind of leg-specific exercise? * Obviously handicapped people need access to housing, but do they need access to housing in every unit of every building? If they can't use certain floors in a particular building, should we say that NO-one can use it? A lot of cities are facing serious housing shortages right now and it just seems wasteful.  &#x200B;  Alternatives:  * Pose some additional taxes (in proportion to actual rent received/building value) which go directly towards handicapped services or new, accessible construction * Subsidize the construction of elevators if they are a requirement. * Allow exceptions to ADA when the investment is prohibitively expensive to the point where upper floors of a building (or basements) will just go unoccupied. * If someone lives in an old building without an elevator and becomes handicapped/has an injury or illness which requires mobility assistance, the landlord/the government should pay for them to move somewhere * Ramps or short lifts are often pretty cheap to put in, so I think it's reasonable to enforce first floor accessibility at all times. For commercial apartments in old buildings, you could, say, require 1/3 of the units to be ADA accessible.	1642804705.0	s9n1ko	/r/changemyview/comments/s9n1ko/cmv_requiring_old_buildings_to_accommodate/	CMV: Requiring old buildings to accommodate handicapped people does more harm than good
kcqbp	Mars recently announced they were redesigning the M&Ms characters, saying the overall aim for the revamp is “an updated tone of voice that is more inclusive, welcoming, and unifying.”  According to a statement, the changes include the red M&M “ton[ing] down the bossiness,” while the green M&M has traded in her much-debated white go-go boots for a set of sneakers and a newfound focus on confidence.  Meanwhile, the orange M&M will "embrace his true self, worries and all" in solidarity with the more "anxious" Gen Z generation.  To me, this feels more like a publicity stunt, as I have trouble seeing how people can relate to inanimate candies that are designed to be eaten.  But I’m open to other perspectives-what changing the candies could accomplish, how representation (despite them being candies) could be positive, etc.  Additionally, I don’t see how investing in a redesign will help as opposed to fighting violence that people face, donating to groups that provide resources for people with anxiety, etc.  Do people really care if there are genders to the M&M mascots, or what to see themselves represented in something they eat?  Things that will change my view: Evidence that the old M&Ms design is problematic, uninclusive, or promotes violence Evidence that the redesign will be positive and allow people to feel more included/relate more Evidence that Mars has dedicated other resources to fostering inclusion, putting their money where their mouth is.	1642809171.0	s9ool2	/r/changemyview/comments/s9ool2/cmv_there_is_nothing_uninclusive_or_problematic/	CMV: There is nothing uninclusive or problematic about the previous M&M designs
6hz1khcy	Of course it should be well funded, well-researched, and done thoroughly. Most importantly, it should be done in an ethical manner, with a suitable habitat and professionally balanced diet for all the animals involved. That's essential, and if it's not done in such a manner, I don't support it. But, if I became a billionaire, foundations are gonna get put up, land bought, and scientists hired.      Imagine primates selected for intelligence, with generous research funding going towards linguistic and cognitive research on them. Sign language taught to every one. Corvids, too!      Or bears! Bears with big, floppy ears and big eyes like dogs! Just turn the 'domestication syndrome' dial all the way to the right on those.      Raccoons are social animals, like wolves. That's presumably why dogs were able to adapt so well to coexisting with humans, right? Except, they also have little hands like ours. They could arguably be cuter.       The value that dogs and cats bring to our human experience is immeasurable, and if I could somehow impart the knowledge of their value to some parallel dimension where they weren't domesticated, I imagine that they'd get started right away. So what are we missing out on with the giant fluffy dog that bears could become, or the intelligent companions that domesticated crows could be?? It may take centuries, and I wouldn't live to see the best of it, but such a project must be worth my hypothetical eccentric billions of dollars.	1642812477.0	s9puoy	/r/changemyview/comments/s9puoy/cmv_we_should_totally_domesticate_more_animals/	CMV: We should totally domesticate more animals.

I think it underlies much of how we view and interact with fields of study like archeology, historical studies, and even sociology.   This view encompasses everything from raw knowledge, to personal and communal hygiene, to social order and structure, to economics, to literature, and to the sciences.   Please change my view that ancient people were more developed or advanced in any one of these categories (or all of them) if you can. Perhaps there is another category I haven't mentioned here, but you deem relevant, please include it in your response and generate a fsir defence for it.

ggw5fsyd	I'd like to take up this topic with 5 different points that I've seen in other debates regarding the discussion and one major inference from the society whose structure is used in this switch and bait.   first, the Inference. i am from India and I've seen in many debates how trans advocates point to my culture and society as a proof to embolden their point. the truth is, they can't be further from the truth. they often point to how Indian society marks more than two genders and that's a weird assumption to make.   this is so because the social categorisation and biological categorisation has no difference in India, even in our language. the world for male/man is narr( i don't know how to type in devnagari script, sorry) and for a female/woman is nari.  the hijras are never fully categorised as either narr or nari.  The only story that is often cited to support the trans claim is that of Vishnu/Mohini but if you do even a basic reading of that story, it'll be clear that two different entities are talked about. so i don't even understand why my culture is appropriated to make a false claim. sure we have more than two genders but the hijras aren't social men/social women because the category on male/man and female/woman are defined in a way that biology and society mirror each other.  Now for the major points :  1. The label transphobia - the label is used as a definition of hatred, fear or aversion of trans people and it's a train wreck imo.  here's a simple example, if someone whom I can visually figure out to be a man, then I'll call him a man. if he insists on using she/her pronouns, I'll do it out of courtesy but that's about it. I won't suddenly start believe that the person is a woman just because a certain set of pronouns were asked.   Where exactly is the hatred, aversion or fear of trans people in this scenario? now, if you ask me to believe that TWAW because somehow in your head you've decoupled  sex/gender, then that's nothing but ideological imposition. i don't believe in that decoupling.   the bigger problem with this label is the way it's used to shut down conversation but i understand that it's a method used throughout history. Accuse someone of having an isms/ists so that inquiry can be avoided.   2. The Switch bait of Gender/Sex - This one is rather interesting. ok, i can't use man/woman to accurately say male and female in your ideology, but can i then use male/female? according to Trans activists, i can't because they then go into this nonsense of noun vs adjective.  as far as biology is concerned, it's classify males and females (with few abnormal conditions that result in intersex). It's also hilarious when trans activists point to intersex and i don't know how i can tell them that no matter how much they twist the definitions, Futnaris don't really manifest. there are no true hermaphrodites in Humans.    3. But but but....the WHO supports us - just because medical associations have accepted the change in language so that the suicidal rate of trans people can come down, it doesn't mean the general society has to take that up too.  a community of taxonomists don't classify litchi as a fruit  but when common people go out and buy litchi, they use the term fruit.    4. The soul argument - i don't even understand what to say to that. this is the classic, woman/man born in the wrong body of man/woman.  i mean what exactly is born in the body? are you suggesting that there's some sort of soul that transfers into a body like water being transferred in two pots and sometimes, it's transferred in a wrong pot?  if you're making that argument, how exactly do you measure and define this soul?   5. The brain scans - ah, the classic myth of Gendered brains and how it's a debunked idea.  https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00677-x   in conclusion, the only reasonable argument that's presented by Trans advocates is that of courtesy, but I've  already stated i have no issues with using a certain set of pronouns if requested. Going beyond that is just buying into an ideology based on bait and switch.   Also, if you're going to claim that there's no Gender Ideology and i am talking about lives of people, then don't bother with that argument. just like Islam is an ideology but it also impacts lives of Muslims, in a similar way Gender Ideology is and ideology.	1642844392.0	s9yy7t	/r/changemyview/comments/s9yy7t/cmv_the_whole_trans_debate_debate_is_frustrating/	CMV: The whole trans debate debate is frustrating because it's a big bait and switch on both biology and language.
e0ugcre	This seems to be an unpopular opinion around Reddit and the Internet, but I genuinely do not think that Dune was a good movie, in the sense that I believe that it failed to tell the story of Dune. I'll admit that the cinematography was mostly great, but it fell far short when it came to plot points and story details. Here are my gripes with Dune:  1) The movie missed out on many important aspects of the story. There are entire scenes, crucial to characterization, that were completely skipped over in the movie. The dinner party scene in the book, for instance, was completely skipped out on. A lot of context for parts of the lore was also missed out on - things like what Mentats are, what Thufir's role in the Atreides household was, things like that.  2) For what scenes remained, editing was bad and led to an incoherent flow of the plot at times. I remember being confused at the Sardaukar scene, and how it suddenly led to the whole betrayal/war action sequence.  3) As with point 1, a lot of scenes lacked context to show why certain things happened in a certain way. For example, Yueh's betrayal of the Atreides family seems to be completely out of nowhere - if I had not read the book, I don't think I would understand why this happens, or even who this random person is. Another one that comes to mind is Stilgar's spitting on the table, which is meant to be a gift since water is so precious on Arrakis, but we are given no explanation about this at all and it just seems really strange.  My thoughts are still a little incoherent so bear with me, but I'd appreciate some thoughtful responses! Point 1 and 3 are my main issues with the movie.	1642849910.0	sa0bgn	/r/changemyview/comments/sa0bgn/cmv_dune_2021_was_not_a_good_movie_for_telling/	CMV: Dune (2021) was NOT a good movie for telling its story.
12hwzhih	Don't get me wrong, it massively impacts women and their bodily autonomy.  However, I believe the central question of when a foetus becomes a sapient human being far outshines any possible social problems. If it was discovered tomorrow that sentience somehow started very shortly after contraception there would be no consideration of women's rights as it would be human life on the line.  We have an issue where people debate about when humanity starts and what counts as murder and a ton of comparatively minuscule social ills are treated like they are on the same playing field.  I get that there is an insane amount of history tieing these two issues together and certain organisations such as the church have vested interests in both but couldn't we ignore all that for such a fundamental, almost philosophical, issue?	1642855759.0	sa1tlj	/r/changemyview/comments/sa1tlj/cmv_abortion_shouldnt_be_seen_as_a_womans_rights/	CMV: Abortion shouldn't be seen as a woman's rights issue

ocj6nss	I believe that there are as many genders as society says there are, because it is a social construct. It is something that society made up. Why exactly we thought it made sense or was a good idea to create these arbitrary roles and rules for ourselves I don't know, I'm not a history major, but honestly if it were up to me there wouldn't be any such thing as gender. I think the whole concept is just divisive and in general gender polarization is harmful to society. I don't think the concept serves any purpose anymore, and the whole idea has gotten way too complicated (not because we're saying that there's more than two now, but because of the way you're supposed to base such a large part of your identity and personality off of what sex organs you were born with, which society also decided should be covered up most of the time.)  I don't think there are two genders because I can clearly observe that most of what gender is is only strongly correlated with biological sex (again, only because society says so) rather than being an actual extension of our biology. There's nothing biological about expecting females to wear what us humans call "dresses" and expecting males NOT to, often finding it strange/odd/funny when they do. There's nothing biological about believing that the color blue is masculine while pink is feminine (infact, less than 100 years ago blue was FEMININE. The main two genders we're most familiar with are always changing too. This helps prove that it's just something society made up. Another example is that not long before blue was considered feminine, it was normal for young males to wear dresses.) Basically, my point is that, somewhere in an alternate universe, males are the ones who wear dresses and carry purses, while females don't, and get judged if they do. Nothing else is different in that alternate universe, and nothing in that alternate universe doesn't make any less sense than it does in this universe.  So if this is the case, why couldn't there be more than two genders? What if I was the type of person to wear dresses and carry purses but also really liked the color blue, and was very muscular? Sure, you can try to tell me that that's just a man in a dress or just a woman with muscles depending on what my biology may be, but since when can't I call that a third gender? It clearly doesn't fit perfectly into either of the usual two. Going with the alternate universe thought experiment again, what if instead of gender, it was that every male in this world is taught that they must grow up to be a doctor, and every female a lawyer. Where males get harshly judged by many if they would rather be lawyers. Where, when a male decides to be an engineer rather than a doctor, they get told "there's only 2 professions you can't just make up a new one called 'engineer' you're just a doctor that likes to tinker around" That world is a pretty stupid world, and I think that logic translates to this world.  So far the only things I've heard in opposition to this are "God created two genders" which doesn't really carry much weight, and "XY chromosomes = boy, XX chromosomes = girl, it's that simple" which anyone with an education in biology can tell you, is actually not that simple. I'm hoping to hear something that makes more sense than this.  EDIT 1: It appears that I could've done far better with my explanation, and that I probably didn't pick the most relevant title. I also got many more comments than I was expecting, and I thank all of you who commented! There are plenty of fresh points to think about here. I will do my best to reply to as many comments as I can and will be trying to clear up any confusion in future edits here.	1642864238.0	sa4hu1	/r/changemyview/comments/sa4hu1/cmv_there_are_not_only_two_genders/	CMV: There are NOT only two genders

62kyxam2	Every time this "We're in a simulation" argument comes up with scientists *who count out a deity btw* they act like humans or any other species advanced enough to make computers strong enough and big enough to simulate the universe and induce consciousness is going to be focusing their time on that.  Why would these galactic level species (powerful enough to control or use the galaxy as easily as humans use earth) give a rodents rump about simulations. We already know how to code genes, we are going to be creating whole worlds in the distant future if we are to survive the death of the sun.  Not to mention the fact that they would likely be more concerned with surviving the death of the universe and how to stop gravity from pulling everything to pieces.  Anyway literally nothing makes sense. Maybe if a species became so god like powerful that it was able to stop the death of the universe it might try to play god.

gb3xu7s4	Faith and hope are two of the heavenly virtues (although the specific list of heavenly virtues isn't that relevant to my view). Even you're not into the religious aspects of it, I think most would agree they are things that most people look upon favorably. However, I think both are generally bad qualities to emphasize. The specific form of these "virtues" both get tangled up with the concept of trust. I'm focused on the primary definition which is not just a synonym for trust. There are lots of different variations to the definitions so I'll specify what I mean here.  Hope: a feeling of expectation and desire that something will happen  Faith: belief in something despite the absence of (or contrary to) available evidence  Both of these are basically irrationally clinging to a feeling. The main problem I have is that their value is basically in that it gives you extra willpower or determination. But then, why not make determination or willpower the virtue we should strive for? In themselves, it's just a way for us to fight against the looming reality that shit will go bad. If you have determination and willpower but not faith/hope then great. You get the benefits without the drawbacks of getting tangled in dogma (faith) or irrationally clinging to unrealistic outcomes (hope).  To be clear, this is not specific to religion. A couple examples - Hope: Mom loses her son someplace, and keeps hoping he's out there for years. Sure it might provide a little solace, but it's a form of self deception. Better to come to terms and overcome, than to cling to a false hope. If it turns out that the one-in-a-million result occurs and the son is found later, it's not the mom will say "fuck that kid, i've moved on!". Faith: Religion, 'nuf said... Nah I'm jk. Let's say I have a feeling deep in my bones that if I bet on 00 on the roulette wheel I'm going to win. I have absolute faith it'll happen. There is no evidence that can sway me. Is it a good bet? Obviously not. The emotion that drives that faith is leading me down a path that is worse off.  Hope and faith should not be considered major virtues, if anything we should replace them with determination and willpower.

d20dcu60	***If you are TLTR:*** ***being that a speech is a type of presentation, I believe it should focus on being impactful, memorable, and "to the point." And since most orators do not have the ability to sustain a long speech and keep it concise and interesting, in my opinion, speeches should not exceed five minutes in length.***   First, please note that by "speech" I am referring to an address which only uses spoken words directed at an audience (such as an acceptance speech). I am not talking about presentations more generally, which use images, videos, and other content other than spoken words. In other words, speeches are a type of presentation which only use spoken words.   Given this context, I believe that speeches should never exceed five minutes in length for the following reasons:  1. Speeches shouldn't be overly detailed, they should only focus on your "thesis" and nothing else. If said "thesis" requires more than five minutes to be conveyed properly, you should probably rely on additional resources such as the ones states above to do so, thus making a *presentation*, not a speech. 2. *Most* speeches that go over five minutes become invariably boring fairly quicky (emphasis on the word "most," I didn't say all).   Now, I do want to address the fact that (as many will probably point out) almost all of the most famous speeches in history exceed five minutes in length. In my opinion, most of these speeches only became significant due to their historical context, not necessarily because of the content or quality of diction associated with them. Of course, there are some obvious outliers (such as the *I Have a Dream* speech, which was delivered brilliantly), but most of these speeches simply are not that great in and of themselves.   Conversely, there are many great, shorter speeches which are relatively less important and remembered. For example, George W. Bush's address after 9/11, while more or less known, was an excellent address: he went "to the point" and outlines all of his ideas in a concise way. But, for better or worse, it did not obtain a historical significance like other speeches on important dates have.   I do also want to point out that, as previously mentioned with Martin Luther King, Jr.'s speech, some orators have a knack for delivering great speeches, and these can sometimes exceed even fifteen minutes and still be concise and not boring.   Overall, being that a speech is a type of presentation, I believe it should focus on being impactful, memorable, and "to the point." And since most orators do not have the ability to sustain a long speech and keep it concise and interesting, in my opinion, speeches should not exceed five minutes in length.	1642904914.0	saivf8	/r/changemyview/comments/saivf8/cmv_speeches_should_never_exceed_five_minutes_in/	CMV: Speeches should never exceed five minutes in length

ixcmnhwr	I have a lot of problems with NFTS, and I don't produce them or buy them because of it.   However, the only problem i have with *other* people doing NFTs, is the environmental cost of the blockchain, which is the only part of NFTs that I can see that affects me.   Ethereum has stated that they will switch to proof of stake later this year, which as i'm aware, would dramatically reduce the environmental impact of NFT transactions to a level comparable to other online services such as twitter and reddit.     The NFT marketplace is full of scammers, but as far as I'm concerned, the information to educate yourself on the dangers of the NFT marketplace is out there. If you get scammed by NFTs, I would probably place the blame largely on you.   If you're acting safely and knowledgeably on the blockchain, I think that there some positives that NFTS could provide, such as new ways of monetizing artwork, for example.     You could argue that art theft is a big issue with NFT spaces, but I don't fully believe this is as big of an issue as people say it is. If someone could provide proof that enough NFTs of stolen art have been **sold** (not minted) to warrant it being an actual issue, I would also change my mind on NFTs, however I have not seen evidence that backs this up, even with the large ammount of anti-nft posts that have stormed the internet over the past year or so. I have also visited the pages of multiple NFT sellers that listed stolen work, and none of their pieces had any offers. Even then, I would just say that blockchain websites would need to do better to stop this issue, which I believe is possible.	1642909187.0	sak79h	/r/changemyview/comments/sak79h/cmv_once_nfts_go_green_im_fine_with_them/	cmv: once NFTs "go green", I'm fine with them
gk12urbh	This is pretty simple view. The Patriot Act was ostensibly supposed to be about stopping terrorism, but in reality has done basically nothing to stop terror and has instead greatly reduced our civil liberties and the 4th amendment, the very things that America was built on. To my knowledge the Patriot Act has also never stopped even *1* actual terrorist attack either. I believe that it should be abolished, it gives the NSA/CIA/FBI wayyy too much power while not even achieving it's goal of fighting terror. I was born after 9/11 so maybe I'm missing something but honestly people need to get over it in my opinion. Yes it was plenty bad but Bin laden is dead, Al Queda is decimated and we've spent billions fighting terror, it was clearly a black swan even that isn't going to repeat anyway. There is absolutely no reason to keep around a terrible law passed in reaction to it that was poorly conceived to begin with just because some idiots knocked over a skyscraper over 20 years ago.	1642909429.0	saka0m	/r/changemyview/comments/saka0m/cmv_the_patriot_act_and_all_its_reauthorizations/	CMV: The Patriot Act and all it's reauthorizations should be repealed
2l6wi504	As someone with pretty libertarian views, storming the capitol is... literally the best way to show distaste. Rioting in public areas is severely worse, that's where other people are who are innocent, while the capitol is full of politicians-- the people who oppress and make the rules. If the capitol was stormed in a unifying matter, in a general libertarian sense where all sides of the political spectrum just wanted both parties/ all politicians in general to stop oppressing the citizens, it would be patriotic and the right thing to do. Again, these are the people you want to go after, its actually way more respectful than rioting or causing chaos in the streets/public. The only reason the riot from 2021 was sickening and awful was because of the GROUNDS upon which it was stormed-- to falsely reinstate a president like a dictator.	1642911521.0	sakx3k	/r/changemyview/comments/sakx3k/cmv_storming_the_capital_was_only_wrong_because/	CMV: Storming the capital was only wrong because of how far-right nationalists were doing it to interrupt an election and were pushing fascism.

ikq6zcc6	CMV: Because of how cause and effect works, nothing is anyone's fault. (Predestination)  I think we've all heard this argument before but I'll phrase it here:   &#x200B;  Everything in the universe seems to obey cause and effect. This happened, so this other thing happened etc. Given that, any event you talk about, you can immediately trace back to see what 'caused' that event. If you had FULL knowledge of everything in the universe, then for any given event you could see every 'causal' factor that influenced it.  As a result when we deal with 'human' level questions, especially legal questions: "Why did that person kill this other person, was it self defence.. etc".   The question in reality is moot. If we 'trace back' the causal factors, in the end nothing is anyone's fault. Anyone's decisions are a result of their environment and their genetics. Neither of which they can control.   (Yes, they can control their environment directly etc, but the 'decision' to control their environment itself is an outcome of the environment and genetics, and thus in the end they really had no choice).  If we trace back the causal factors, it stops making sense to us as humans.   Why did he stab him? Because he stole something, Why? because he was hungry, why? because he didn't eat. Why did it get to a point where humans need to eat? cos they need energy? Why? Becuase that's how the cell biology evolved? Why? Because life evolved on earth? Why? Because of the right chemical compounds in a meteor that it the planet 3 billion years ago? Why? because it hit another rock which forced it's trajectory...  &#x200B;  And so the "REAL" causal reason he stabbed that other person was because two rocks collided billions of years ago, or some other such reason that doesn't really have any emotional resonance to us, humans.  A word on quantum phenomenon:  I don't think quantum phenomenon invalidates cause and effect, more so that we just don't understand it given the current observations, and it 'seems' to. However nothing else in the universe does, and it'd be extremely strange if such a fundamental rule would arbitrarily break down at that point for some reason.  And even if quantum mechanics invalidates cause and effect. Does that mean our justice system is based on quantum mechanics? And prior to that being known we had no basis of justice other than randomly drawing lines in the causality tree and saying. Yep it stops there. That guys the problem? Not one branch above him and not one branch below!.  And so justice is more defined by where one chooses to draw the line than the actual act being committed?	1642911652.0	sakyo4	/r/changemyview/comments/sakyo4/cmv_because_of_how_cause_and_effect_works_in/	CMV: Because of how cause and effect works, in reality no one is responsible for their actions.
848tcpgz	Change My View: Anarcho-Capitalism is a Fundamentally Unworkable System. For those who do not know, Anarcho-Capitalism (Ancap(s) is how I would refer to them from this point on.) is a political system/ideology that is based of the abolishment of government and it's replacements being private companies. And it's flaws can be broken down into 2 basic categories: Internal & External threats.  1. External threats        External threats are basically, a different nation invading the ancap nation (Ancapistan.) This basically impossible to prevent, even if citizen or companies had the capital to acquire & maintain weapons of modern war, & are willing to defend Ancapistan, which in itself is questionable, they would unable to stand up to a modern military (I would not debate on Nukes in this debate.) for three reasons: 1. Organization, A group of Private Security Companies could never reach the same level of multi front organization as a modern military, thus causing Ancapistan to be defeated. 2. Most companies lack the ability to operate the logistics required to operate a large scale military force, thus causing a defeat through logistics. And 3. Private Security Companies (Mercenaries) have been historically incredibly unreliable in fighting for the same side, often switching sides if the other side paid more, and so would most likely be true about Ancapistan. All of these reasons would cause Ancapistan to be defeated in any war with a modern military, unless Ancapistan is located in a location that is of no value, which would cause a limited economy to occur, going against capitalism.  2. Internal Threats        Internal threats can be easily summed up in one phrase <<Companies forming their own governments to extract more profit, defeating the entire point of Anarcho-Capitalism.>> To expand on the idea, lets say we have a Private Security Company called "Blackpond" and Blackpond want's to expand their company, so they drive out their completion with a combination of buyouts, anti-completive & violence so they are now the only PSC in the area, leaving it able to force it's people to pay for "protection" and if they decide to not pay, they would be beaten up by some people from Blackpond, thus essentially creating a corpocracy. Now some counter this by saying "But the people would defend themselves." now I would counter this with 2 arguments, 1. People can take a surprising amount of oppressions before revolting, & 2. even if they revolt, Blackpond could simply partner with those who own heavy military equipment, by exempting them from the protection fee (Tax) so that if anyone revolted, they could only fight with relatively basic hardware, meaning the company, with stuff like Armored Vehicles could simply roll over them  Edit: Fixed formatting error & meant "Workable as Intended"	1642913626.0	salk6y	/r/changemyview/comments/salk6y/cmv_anarchocapitalism_is_a_fundamentally/	CMV: Anarcho-Capitalism is a Fundamentally Unworkable System

cwfmwffh	I feel like people struggle with procrastination not because there is a problem with them, but just because they don’t like what they do. If you truly enjoy what you do, you wouldn’t procrastinate. To give an example with myself - I have a degree in Finance and that’s what I work to make a living, but in my free time I’ve been doing music for a few years now.   When it comes to music, I NEVER procrastinate. In fact, I can’t wait to sit down and work on music. Even the boring and tedious parts of the process, I still never procrastinate because I love it overall and I believe in the purpose of what I do. I never procrastinated with anything related to music, whether it’s working on a project, or learning some music theory, or reading a book about music, or learning how a piece of gear works. I just have the internal drive to do these things and I can’t even imagine myself procrastinating on any of it.   On the other hand, when it comes to Finance stuff, I ALWAYS procrastinate, because I just hate it and I personally find it very boring uninspiring. It’s just not who I am. I am a creative and an artist at heart, and looking at excel spreadsheets all day is not something that interests me AT ALL. I am sure there are people who are the exact opposite of me!  So people who procrastinate - I think they shouldn’t try to fight it. I think they should just realise that the reason for procrastinating is likely that they don’t enjoy what they do, and maybe it’s time for a change.   Of course, we all need to do stuff we don’t like sometimes, like washing dishes, cleaning, cooking or whatever it is. But these are things that everyone does and everyone needs to do, no way around it. But no one NEEDS to be a lawyer, banker, engineer, or to study a degree they don’t enjoy.  If I could go back in time and change my degree, I would do so in a heartbeat. I would love to change my career now and do something more creative and enjoyable, but I haven’t found a feasible option for me yet.	1642945882.0	sau39j	/r/changemyview/comments/sau39j/cmv_we_shouldnt_try_to_fight_procrastination_most/	CMV: We shouldn’t try to fight procrastination (most of the time)
fv0k2	Let me start by saying that I am for passing both free public education and student debt forgiveness together. My issue is there are a lot of people who only advocate for one and I think it is damaging to the movement.  As someone who is about to pay off his student debt after 15 years, I can say I'm not really mad about the concept of cancelling student debt even though I sacrificed and saved for all of college and ever since on. It's definitely unfair to people in my situation but the focus should be on future generations not having to go through the same thing.  That's why student debt cancelation is useless without first making public college free. It helps a very small amount of people compared to sustained programs that could last centuries. Its leaving younger generations out to dry. It's very low impact compared to government paid tuition.  The rationale needs to be, education is a human right and thus college should be free and it is only right to forgive student debt.   This is the major problem with the left replicating itself in a new way.  People are only looking out for themselves which makes it impossible to create a winning coalition. Everyone in the left has their own issue and then Biden or Hillary wins the primary because the issues become secondary.	1642954112.0	sawxc2	/r/changemyview/comments/sawxc2/cmv_until_college_is_made_free_in_the_usa/	CMV: until college is made free in the USA, canceling student debt is useless and selfish
13mao47a	*First, I am not on the boat that says "everything can be learnt on the internet or on the job, away with universities." I think that university offers many benefits that aren't easy to get anywhere else including the opportunity for networking, mentorship, extra-curricular activities, various forms of support, being taught people who actively research their field, and access to special equipment, facilities and resources that only a university can afford to provide,*  *This perspective stems partly from my own experience with an engineering degree. After having completed it I realised that if I had the option and I could go back I would forego getting a degree entirely and do less than half of those courses; many of them were a waste of time and money or things I could have taught myself just as well. Even with less than half the subjects, I would still have diverse skills and be employable and I would have enough of a foundation to teach myself more ad hoc.  I would then concentrate on networking, developing a project portfolio and getting guidance from experienced individuals. All this wouldn't work because we've learnt to cling to the concept of degrees.*  *Btw, I'm mainly focusing on undergraduate degrees and maybe also postgraduate degrees that don't belong to law school or medical school - as these are practices and I can only assume that everything taught here is relevant to the job. However, where I'm from, you can get into law school or medical school through an exam. The exams have an undergrad degree requirement (ANY degree), and I think my perspective can be applied there.*  **It should become established practice to study at university and receive government loans on a course by course basis without the requirement of completing a degree with a particular university** **- as if taking individual courses is absolutely worthless if you don't do them in a particular set of 24/32 that constitutes a particular 3/4 year degree.**  **This will have a series of positive educational and economic effects:**  1. Students will be there because they WANT to be there. Not because the course is compulsory for the degree they are enrolled in regardless of, student preparedness, interest, course quality and employability of skills gained etc. They will take greater responsibility for their learning, hence achieving higher grades and learning more. 2. Teachers will have a classroom full of enthusiastic students. We like to blame teachers for a bad educational experience, but imagine having to face and teach a classroom full of students with little interest in the subject that the lecturer is actually passionate about, treats the subject like a chore and asks zero questions. *This was a pretty common experience of mine.* 3. Students further benefit from the individualism that comes with greater freedom. They elect their courses, so they explore their interests, diversify their skills and knowledge, carve a path towards a career for themselves that they are more likely to stick to (guided by experienced mentors that they will all but have to seek out or they'll feel very lost very quickly - *I personally think mentorship is enormously important for success and should be a pillar of tertiary education*). 4. Bad courses will be eliminated as the students begin to consider reviews of a course by other students before choosing to enrol. Courses that don't get enough enrolments will naturally die. Good courses will be rewarded with higher enrolments and revenue. 5. The price of a course will be determined by supply and demand as students can take a course on a subject they are interested in from ANY university they wish as they are not bound to complete a degree with a particular university. This will likely lead to a drop in the price of courses on average. Good courses will have a higher price of course, but you'll get what you pay for (see point 4). 6. Eliminating the fixed price of courses and the degree-loan system will eliminate economic inefficiencies:  * Some degrees have huge dropout rates of up to [40%](https://educationdata.org/college-dropout-rates) in the US. With the degree system, a dropout's entire tertiary education goes unrecognised even if they've completed a significant portion of a degree and could probably be qualified for an entry-level job in their field with what they've learnt. This represents a loss of skilled labour. * A high percentage of graduates don't enter into a field related to their degree in. In the US, this figure was [73%.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/20/only-27-percent-of-college-grads-have-a-job-related-to-their-major/) Without the degree-loan system, this would figure would significantly drop and people would be better poised to contribute to the industry they enter (see points 1 and 3). Another hit to skilled labour. * Lower loans and debts. The government essentially gambles with taxpayer dollars when they provide loans on degrees, they expect each student to benefit enough from the degree to get an economically productive, stable and well-paying job that will allow them to repay the debt. However, in the US, [10%](https://educationdata.org/student-loan-default-rate) of graduates default on their student loans. Without the degree-loan system, the price of each course will be lower (see point 5) and the number of subjects they complete will likely decrease but will be up to the individual's future plans (see point 3) and the better education (points 1 and 4) will lead to higher-skilled workers that can contribute more to the industry and are generally better paid. Hence, lowering student loans, loan default rates, and an increase in "GDP- improvement-to-student-loan-ratio".  I'm not hating on universities for operating like businesses - I mean that's pretty much how any large organisation can hope to operate in the world. My issue with them is short-sightedness. I think the reason they stick to the degree-loan scheme is the shortsighted need to guarantee a fixed and significant amount of revenue from each student that enrols with them.	1642959100.0	sayug9	/r/changemyview/comments/sayug9/cmv_the_concept_of_university_degrees_especially/	CMV: The concept of university degrees (especially undergrad) should be abolished. You should be able to enrol in any selection of courses, which will constitute your tertiary education. You should be able to get a loan on a course-by-course basis (not on a degree basis).
cointc9g	There was a [clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOnOpB3yN1k) going around in political circles of conservative commentator Matt Walsh making an appearance on a talk show having a discussion with two trans advocates. I think his most impactful argument is when he simply asks the trans advocates, **"What is a woman?"**  To my surprise, neither of them can answer this question. In response to the question "Can you tell me what a woman is?", one says "No I can't, it's not for me to say", and the other says they "cannot define what a woman is" because they are not a woman (which is a logical fallacy).  This struck me. If you can't clearly (or even somewhat) describe what an identity means, why should anyone respect your identity? You could replace "woman" with any other label in that situation. Without any criteria or definition, it doesn't actually matter what you identify as in that situation.  I think we would all agree that defining your terms is of fundamental importance in any kind of debate. So it seems to me that these trans advocates failed in their argument right out of the gate since they failed to define their terms.  I think the reason that these advocates refused to define what a woman means is because if they gave a definition, it would be something so vague and nebulous that most reasonable people would think that their definition doesn't meet their own criteria for what a man or woman is, making the term mostly meaningless.  So I walked away from this clip with a much different perspective on the trans identity. Can anyone offer a more compelling argument as to why I should respect the trans identity?	1642965778.0	sb1i9b	/r/changemyview/comments/sb1i9b/cmv_without_a_clear_definition_of_what_your/	CMV: Without a clear definition of what your identity means, you can't identify as that thing.

9hmvwt6z	Today, most developed countries derive a majority of their revenue from the income tax (and payroll tax) which is a tax on labor. There's also sales tax and VAT which tax consumption, capital gains tax which taxes interest (gains from capital), and the wealth and estate taxes which tax idle wealth.     I tend to be a centrist on the issue of taxation. According to republicans, taxes are evil. According to democrats, taxes are necessary. Both are correct. Just about every tax incurs a deadweight loss upon the economy (not including pigovian taxes). This is because of opportunity cost. Money handed over to the government isn't spent on consumption or investment.     But what if it didn't have to be that way?  &#x200B;  There are three factors of production: land, labor, and capital. Labor refers to effort by man to create. Land is anything made by mother nature like natural resources and land itself. Capital is anything manmade, especially to create goods and services. Profit is also split into three categories: wages (labor), interest (capital), and rent (land).     Of the three factors of production, land appears to be the odd one out. This is because while labor and capital have a potentially unlimited capacity, land is in fixed supply. Although land specifically refers to natural resources, the namesake is fitting because the primary use for nature in most developed countries is real estate. Land has a fixed supply, meaning that any increase in demand will increase land prices. Furthermore, increases in the value of land benefit no one except the landowners, unlike increases in capital and labor. This is because, as mentioned before, land has a fixed supply. If the price is up, that means there's more economic demand for that land. The saying goes that there is no such thing as a free lunch. This isn't necessarily true, there is a way to get a free lunch. Typical investment involves putting money into something in the hopes of getting more out. When you put money into a business, you are feeding it capital. At some point in the future, assuming the business grows, you will eventually get more out than you put in. Speculation is a form of investing which does not contribute to the investment itself. An example would be buying something for $10 and selling it for $2000 as a rare collectible. This isn't to say that all forms of speculation are bad. In a volatile commodity market, speculation can help serve to stabilize the price. But it's in the real estate market that we see the pernicious effects of speculation because land retained by speculators is not contributing to the economy, at least not as much as it could. This is why an economist by the name of Henry George proposed a land value tax (LVT). The LVT differs from a property tax in that it only taxes the land itself rather than anything on it. This means that decay and improvements won't affect the amount taxed. This is important because more efficiently used land tends to be taxed more. What may affect it is everything happening around it.     Another problem that the LVT may solve (at least if it's implemented at the state or federal level) is the inefficient use of land encouraged by governments. I'm mainly referring to byzantine zoning codes and subsidies to roads. Bad zoning is often the result of local nimbys opposed to new development. What the LVT would do is tax homeowners on very valuable land. Of course, land zoned for single-family housing is worth less than land where highrises can get built but if there's a shortage of housing, land values will go up. An LVT would make the same people who push against projects reconsider, lest they pay significant taxes. Furthermore, an LVT would tax roads subsidized by lower levels of government.     One concern is that it will hit rural america like a trainwreck, devastating agriculture. My response to this is that this tax would actually be a tax on suburbia, let me explain. Landowners in downtown areas will be paying the highest taxes but property there, after enough time, will derive a very high percentage of their value from the improvements rather than just land (Is the land in Manhattan worth more or are the skyscrapers worth more). Rural property will derive a minimal percent of value from improvements but land value will likewise be low. It will be suburbia which gets hit the hardest. This is because suburban land is used the least efficiently. Property taxes encourage suburban sprawl because property encouraging a higher density is typically taxed more. An LVT would encourage efficient use of the urban core, decreasing demand for suburban housing. This would actually be good for farmers because it would slow down suburban sprawl. It would also be good for small farmers because big farms tend to be more land-intensive (small farms have more buildings per unit of land, subjecting them to property taxes).  The LVT would also curb gentrification, or at the very least slow it down. This is because of the way that development would go. Currently, development is incentivized to push toward low income areas because going there means lower property taxes and land is easier to purchase. To illustrate how this would change, take Chicago as an example. You have the north side and south side, the former is home to affluent white communities while the latter is home to poverty stricken black communities with high crime rates. The LVT would incentivize more development in the north side because land values there are higher.	1642968025.0	sb2d87	/r/changemyview/comments/sb2d87/cmv_we_should_have_a_land_value_tax_which_would/	CMV: We should have a land value tax which would replace as much of other forms of taxation as possible
h46ept97	Title. My view is that there is nothing that makes people deserving of things such as love, food, water, shelter, any of these things. There is also no inherent value to people, only the value people ascribe to them for their own benefit. A girl who has a big butt? She's useful for sex. A guy who is experienced at working on cars? He's useful to repair your vehicle. This is the only worth someone has, but no inherent worth.      When I say no one deserves anything, I asked myself "What makes someone deserving of anything", and I could never answer this question for myself.

29hxpfed	I have never understood the utility of coffee tables, but maybe somebody can change my mind. For one, it seems like nobody ever uses them for drinks. Nowadays, most people that drink coffee or tea put it in a mug and take it with them to work, buy it on the way to work, or make it at work. It also seems extremely inconvenient to lean forward and bend down to keep picking up and setting down a drink, or doing anything for that matter. Side tables are much more space saving and easier to use for everything I could think of doing. Some people just end up using them as footrests, which is gross and far less comfortable than an ottoman. They also seem to always become dedicated as a collect-all for junk, especially if you have kids. If you don't have kids, you are probably getting too old to keep bending over to use a coffee table.	1642976505.0	sb5oeu	/r/changemyview/comments/sb5oeu/cmv_coffee_tables_are_a_worthless_piece_of/	CMV: Coffee tables are a worthless piece of furniture.
9efj2	Minor spoilers for the film follow: just under an hour into the film, there is a sequence showing two characters falling in love - one professes his desire to a third character who tells him to pursue it, which he does. They spend time together doing various activities, they hold hands, he professes his love to her. Then there is a brief sex scene, with no nudity, where they say “I love you”, then it cuts to a wedding scene.  I would submit that the sex scene adds nothing to the film - the intent of the entire sequence, to show them falling in love, was achieved without it; the scene itself is dimly lit and amounts to little more than him lying on top of her; the dialogue within the scene could have been said in any scenario, not just a sex scene; and the “woah!” effect of the scene being in a Marvel Studios title interrupts the viewers’ suspension of disbelief.  Additionally, I would argue it is the only scene that many parents would take issue with when showing the film to their children. Marvel Cinematic Universe fans often skew younger, and this scene makes Eternals a complicated film to show them.

Yes unvaccinated people make up the bulk of ICU beds, but this is only because vaccines we have now suck at preventing transmission because even in a society where most of us are vaccinated, cases can still rise to the level where our healthcare systems can become overburdened.   We need a vaccine against COVID that's as effective as the vaccine against measles or Hib or polio, that's the only way we are getting out of this	1642981666.0	sb7l0v	/r/changemyview/comments/sb7l0v/cmv_the_only_way_this_pandemic_will_end_is_if_we/	CMV: The only way this pandemic will end is if we have more effective vaccines
12i37h	The title basically says it all.  Timed exclusivity games and permanent exclusivity games are not the same.   &#x200B;  Timed exclusivity games are fundamentally deals between the developer or publisher and a store front. Be it Nintendo, Xbox, Sony, Epic, etc. That in exchange for an upfront cost or potentially a larger cut of the sales from the store front, the game will be released only on that store front for X amount of time. Usually a couple months to a year before they release the game for all systems that the developer or publisher can or wants to support.   &#x200B;  Deathloop by Arkane Studios is an example of this. Sony made a deal with Arkane or ZeniMax (pre buy out) to have the game first release on PlayStation consoles.  After that no doubt the game would be released on Xbox, PC and maybe Switch would get a port a few months down the road if there were no direct hardware limitations.  &#x200B;  Deep Rock Galactic is another example. Though that one is more likely due to resource limitations then any contract due to Ghost Ship Games being a tiny 5 person studio founded in 2016.  DRG was released on Steam Early Access in Feb 2018. Two years later it got an official 1.0 release for Steam and Xbox in May 2020. Before finally being released on PlayStation in Jan 2022.  The game will not be getting a Switch release because the system lacks the memory requirements to handle the procedural generated mine that is created during each mission. According to Ghost Ship Game's developers.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  Permanent exclusive games are fundamentally games that will never leave the original system they were created on. Some are because of controller differences. This is mostly RTS games that were created with a mouse and keyboard in mind and trying to fit that on a controller isn't worth the time and effort.  But most of the time it is because the owner of the IP doesn't want it aviable on other systems or stores.  &#x200B;  Ratchet and Clank  and Halo series represent the easiest examples as they are first party titles that Sony and Microsoft hold the respective IP rights two. And each series has become a core aspect of their respective console's first party games.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  I am bringing this all up because I have recently had an interesting conversation with someone who insisted that they are both identical.  That because both examples involve exclusivity they are fundamentally the same thing.   Similarities matter but differences even minor ones can matter even more.  And saying that Deathloop or Deep Rock Galactic that took a year or years to release on all systems and Halo or R&C that will never leave their 1st party systems are the same is just objectively wrong.   &#x200B;  Delaying someone being able to play a game is not the same as never allowing someone to play a game.	1642983708.0	sb8bie	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8bie/cmv_timed_exclusivity_games_and_permanent/	CMV: Timed Exclusivity Games and Permanent Exclusive Games are not the same.
b0lj1bpy	edit: to clarify the title a bit, it should've been "... any company should not be trusted and should be taken with a huge grain of salt"  &#x200B;  to expand a bit more, any product related videos, such as reviews, set ups, etc, should not be trusted or taken with a grain of salt, if the reviewer gets (or usually gets) sponsorship from any company, whether it's the company of the specific product or not.  an example: a tech reviewer does "my desk setup for 2022" and shows a bunch of products he used. Then he mentions "this video is kindly sponsored by blah blah VPN". Any contents (besides non tech related videos, such as politics or social justice) by this reviewer should not be taken with full trust.  &#x200B;  Reviewers need to make money (or spend less), just like anyone who is not relying on others to live. This means that they will do whatever it takes, within reasons, to attract potential sponsors. This is most effectively done by saying nice things. Even criticisms are minimized and very mild. They are typically very personal to minimize deterring viewers from purchasing that item. Sponsors do not like and don't want reviewers being brutally honest (which I'll discuss in the later section). They want the reviewer to say nice things, but realistically. So they are fine with some mild criticisms, but mostly filled with nice things.  this is precisely how magazine, both electronic and paper, reviewers write to attract ads for the magazine.  Now, why does it matter if the sponsor's products are not featured in a specific video? Remember that the idea is to attract sponsors. It's about the presentation. The reviewers want their reviewing styles to be known to the potential sponsors. So even if they purchased the items featured in the video, their main goal for the potential sponsors is "hey, see how nicely I say things about your products? please consider sponsoring me". Sure, any reviewer could have this goal. But those who never need sponsors typically don't care about pleasing potential sponsors, because they don't get any benefits. If they can afford to buy stuff or have no reason to save money, what's the point of pleasing sponsors? It's much easier to be brutally honest than faking realism.  &#x200B;  As mentioned previously, companies do not want reviewers to get brutally honest. They've already done design testing in house and perhaps with beta testers. it's not good to get bad reputation on any product, so any testing is preferred to be in house or privately. Why would they want to pay, with money or product, someone to say bad things about their products, when they can just recruit people to do it privately? The only reason for paying someone to make their opinions very much public is purely for marketing.  &#x200B;  Now, who can we trust more (be less suspicious)? Anyone who doesn't get any sponsorship and pay products with their own money. (by the way, anyone who purchases products, do reviews, and return them should not be fucking trusted, because that's a dick move)  How should reviewers make money then? The current Youtube payment is a great model. The way reviewers get paid by YouTube is the number of views, generally speaking. This is an indirect payment by consumers, NOT by sponsors. I'm not saying that the current YouTube model is the best way, because the payment is probably too little, but it's the right idea - the reviewers should get paid indirectly/directly by the consumers, not by the companies.	1642983951.0	sb8ej0	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8ej0/cmv_any_product_contents_from_a_reviewer_eg/	CMV: any product contents from a reviewer (eg. youtubers) who gets sponsorship from any company should not be trusted or taken with a huge grain of salt
10hmrj	My view is quite simple, something must be encased in pastry to be considered a pie. There are other existing terms to describe other possible combinations such as pastry bases and potato tops or the like, so calling something a pie to describe the main part of the dish being encased (or partially encased) in something else is misleading.  Just because something is made with pastry doesn’t make it a pie- tarts, pasties and palmiers etc… are all made with pastry but don’t proclaim themselves to be pies, yet some things, such as cream pies are made with cake and bear no other resemblance to traditional pies, pumpkin pies are actually tarts and pie charts aren’t even edible and don’t have a filling- they are just disgraces to the name ‘pie’  The word pie exists for a reason, let us not dilute its good name by associating it with inferior products.	1642984295.0	sb8j11	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8j11/cmv_to_be_considered_a_pie_it_must_be_fully/	CMV: To be considered a pie, it must be fully encased in pastry.
fkcm0	I am talking about moving other people laundry from the washer or dryer to a clean surface (like a table or the top of a washer or dryer) 5 minutes or more after their cycle has finished IF there are no other free washers/dryers available. I am also talking about a situation where you can't simply text someone first because the facilities are shared between too many people to know whose clothing is responsible for what  You shouldn't inconvenience yourself more than 5 minutes waiting for someone to come get their laundry.  1. you don't know how long they could be, they could have put their clothes in the dryer and left for the day. and if they do that and you leave their clothes there, you are letting them monopolize the washer/dryer for a whole day instead of the time of one cycle (less than an hour) 2. People should be responsible for getting their clothes from the washer or dryer, such as by getting their 5 minutes early. If they can't arrange them, it is likely they failed to plan ahead. If you want to avoid things like other people touching your laundry or accidentally losing some items (like socks), you should get your laundry, instead of leaving them in public and hogging a washer or dryer 3. You shouldn't move people's wet clothing from the washer into the drying machine, because you don't know what they wanted with their clothing (may want to hang dry their clothing for ex), as drying can have negative effect on clothing (depends on fabrics). And not moving wet clothes into the dryer and instead leaving them in a clean place is similar to if you hadn't done your laundry - you obviously don't have an obligation go into the laundry room to ensure other people don't forget to move their laundry from the washer to the dryer.  People in my dorm would email the dorm listserve asking people move their laundry, creating lots of spam, without any guarantee the relevant offenders would even see the email. Some people just wouldn't do their wash in the washers are full!? Why? Moving laundry is non-malicious, and allows you to do your laundry without being obstructed by others while only requiring minimal effort. Since these are shared washers and dryers you can't just let people leave their clothes in them for hours or a full day since other people also need to use them.	1642985384.0	sb8w9v	/r/changemyview/comments/sb8w9v/cmv_in_shared_living_dorms_etc_you_should_move/	CMV: In shared living (dorms etc), you should move other people's finished laundry to do your own

It is deceptive to show staged content and act as if it wasn't staged. It leads to false perceptions and is no different from fake advertisement.

ahgreb5a	In a game where two superstar quarterbacks are battling back and forth, NFL overtime rules state that the first team to score a touchdown wins. That means one team could win without the other team even getting an opportunity on the field.   This gives immense benefit to the team that wins the coin toss. Simple as that. It is more luck of the draw than football skill. In a playoff game, it should not come down to a coin toss.  Rule should be changed to give each team at least one possession, regardless of scoring.  I would like to know why the NFL has this rule and why it's superior to what I've suggested.  **Edit. What will NOT change my view is something along the lines of "If you can't stop them on defense you don't deserve to win."   **Edit 2. Once again, I WILL NOT accept the idea that a team only playing Defense, but no opportunity for Offense, is a good argument. The NFL has more protections and rules to provide for offensive production. Give both teams an equal opportunity. Not playing good defense is NOT a reason to not give the offense a equal opportunity. Yet that is almost all the arguments in this thread.  ***Edit 3. Performance of a specific team in previous games, decision-making earlier in the game, etc., will not sway my opinion. My CMV is broad and not the result of one game. I am not a Bills fan. I am not a Chiefs fan.  **** EDIT 4. IF PLAYING DEFENSE IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERED, IF THE DEFENSE PREVENTED A TD THEY SHOULD WIN, RIGHT? SO WHY DON'T THEY? Why does one team need to play defense AND then play offense whereas one team only needs to play offense? How is that fair? I repeat: for everyone saying YOU HAVE TO STOP THEM... so you think if a team does stop them they should win without having to score?  That statement should go both ways so each defense needs to prove itself. And besides, if people really meant that, why do teams that allowing scoring during the regular game get the ball? What's the difference? That's like saying, in baseball, if the pitcher gives uo a HR in the too of the 10th inning the other team shouldn't get a chance to bat.	1642993253.0	sbbjoo	/r/changemyview/comments/sbbjoo/cmv_current_nfl_overtime_rules_are_awful/	CMV: Current NFL overtime rules are awful.
49ibpg2e	I know 'incel' has a weird connotation, but what I mean is, I saw yet again so many posts about men saying 'dating is hard'. I don't get a lot of matches etc. I will preface by saying I'm autistic woman and not very pretty, so I understand being sad about being single. However, even if I acknowledge being a woman I'll get a bunch of men thirsting after me and men don't get a lot of women thirsting after them. So what?   I'm not getting it. Men have nothing to offer me. They aren't interesting. Am I supposed to... what? Say hi to every guy? Ego boost them? Tell them they are dateable?

604m6tes	The left lane should be used for passing slower traffic to the right but often times people who are oblivious, ignorant, or both start cruising in the left lane at the same speed or slower as cars to the right of them.   This causes cars who want to pass slower traffic to pile up behind them and they are unable to get around.  This causes a great deal of frustration for drivers behind them and often times causes these drivers to drive wrecklessly by tail gating or weaving through several lanes of traffic to get around. This increases the probability of an accident occurring and makes the road more dangerous for all lanes of traffic.   While people shouldn’t drive wrecklessly at all, it is almost certainly bound to occur with at least one or more drivers stuck behind the slow driver as the frustration gets the better of them.  This issue can easily be solved if the slow left lane driver would just simply move over. That way everyone is happy - the cars behind them can speed up and the slow driver can continue cruising how they want.  I think the issue is that people are too oblivious to realize what they are doing is wrong. We all know that speeding is bad and we immediately slow down when we see cops up on the road. I think the same reality check reaction should occur if you’re driving in the left lane and the best way to do this would be increasing the penalty for holding up traffic in the left lane when you can reasonably move over.  This would hopefully cause drivers to think twice before getting comfortable and slow in the left lane.	1643004299.0	sbf18l	/r/changemyview/comments/sbf18l/cmv_people_who_drive_slow_in_the_left_lane_should/	CMV: People who drive slow in the left lane should be given tickets just as bad as speeding tickets
b1ke942p	Example. For the US, the "right" to bear arms is an essential "human right", so much so it is the second amendment right after free speech. Does this mean that every other country on earth except maybe Russia and Somalia is committing human rights abuses by not having a second amendment equivalent?   The definition of a social construct is: **an idea that has been created and accepted by the people in a society**   Rights only exist because they've been created and accepted by a certain people. A human right is not something that you can point to like you can your left arm and say, “Look, there it is.” Human rights are a social construct. We cannot prove their existence as a matter of scientific fact. A person alone on a desert island would have no need of rights. The concept would be meaningless.

49m3cdti	Why need a guy to be rich? Why not become as rich yourself as you want your husband to be? I get that it's an individual preference but I think one should marry a person they deserve and love, because this thought process is patriarchal.   I have heard some arguments saying "It's because a rich guy would create better chances of sustenance of the offspring, which is why it's inherent in women to look for such guys". How is it not different from saying that I want to marry a girl who does all the household chores, takes care of my children alone and doesn't have an identity of her own because if she works outside my offspring won't be taken care of properly. It's inherent in me because during stone age, men used to hunt outside and women used to takecare of the offspring and had little to no say in anything.  Why do I see this whole "rich guy" thing so common even today? In 21st century how is this idea not leading to the idea of inequality? Am I missing something? Please help me understand.  Edit 1: My point is not against aspiring to become rich. We live in a practical world and we should try to become rich but why do a girl needs a guy to be rich? Shouldn't they be having aspirations to earn more and more themselves rather than aspiring for a rich husband?  Edit 2: I agree that people who are rich probably have many other things which made them so but I am here talking about  people who did nothing but have their father's money.  Edit 3: Most of the counter views can be summarized as it being "realistic".

clqcyvm3	Many Christians engage in spontaneous prayer. I define spontaneous prayer as "prayer that is done, on the spot, with no set words or preparation, often n a very informal manner". For example, say if a Christian is sad, and they randomly pray in that moment, with no planning of what to say or preparation.   I believe that this type of prayer makes no sense. I am not a Christian, but I can try to look at it from their perspective. Christians view God as a King and Father, who should be treated with respect. If you were going to talk to a human King, then surely you would prepare your speech (in the case of prayer, use a set prayer) and use formal language? The Creator of the Universe surely deserves this type of prayer, over informal spontaneous prayers.   Spontaneous prayer is very common among Christians, particularly in my experience Evangelicals, some of whom will treat Jesus/God like a best friend. To me, and with my understanding of Christian theology, this is very weird.  Why pray to God at any time, anywhere? The time and place may not be appropriate.   Yes, I am a Hindu, and I pray a lot, but this isn't the type of prayer I pray. It just doesn't make sense. I pray formally, using mantras and candles and incense and offering bowls, and devotional songs - how you would actually approach a Queen, as Goddess is described in our scriptures.   Please change my view, because I want to understand Christians better.	1643034223.0	sbncab	/r/changemyview/comments/sbncab/cmv_spontaneous_prayer_makes_no_sense/	CMV: Spontaneous Prayer Makes No Sense

13i4cf	For those that don't know the concept of a smart gun  is that it can't fire without biometrics or link to your phone.  This sounds good in general, it would keep unauthorized users from getting their hands on it and misusing it, right? That would be perfectly fine for hobby/recreational shooting. But it very much becomes a problem if you need to use it for self defence.  Several self defense experts indicate that when the emergency happens you function at about 70% of your worst day performance. This means that you won't be grabbing at the right angle needed to unlock the firearm. Or what if you have gloves on? Biometrics don't read through clothing.  The response to the biometric gloves problem might be the well have it unlock when in proximity to your phone argument. Unfortunately this also doesn't work for self defence. Often people's phones go dead.   And how far should the range be? If your phone is taken from you by one of a team and gets it over 20 feet away do you lose the ability to use your defensive tool?  That's about how far I can get from my phone before the headphones disconnect.  Basically when I think about how "smart" features function they simply make the firearm less reliable as a self defence tool and therefore should not be used for self defense applications. And as self defense is the primary purpose of semi automatic designs it really doesn't belong in that platform.  Hunting? Okay. Self defense? Absolutely not. And people are far more likely to have self defense guns than hunting ones thus making the application of that technology virtually useless.  Edit: okay a bunch of you are assuming home defense. I want to be explicit: I'm not taking about home defense but carry out in every day life.  Edit2: forgot to put this forward, this is primarily in reference to the possibility of requiring it.

snvyh	**Edit - we're done here:** It's been demonstrated convincingly that statistical literacy is generally unrelated to the underlying problem, and that it would be much more effective to teach "some very basic philosophy, rhetorical critique, and the underlying psychology of believe".  **Edit - major change:** A better approach would be "specific tasks that encourage further analysis, such as debates, research and other such projects. If you teach that desire for further inquiry and a healthy sense of skepticism, then people don't need specific prior education in stats at all."  I think basic statistical literacy is important to basic functioning in a world that has tons of data flying around on various important topics.  When a lot of important arguments hinge on statistics, it's difficult to critically evaluate the points made without understanding the math.  One example is that people are prone to comparing the risk or benefit of [action] to nothing, not considering the risk or benefit of [inaction].  This problem runs deeper than being acquainted with the math, but I think having some training in thinking that way would encourage thinking it through properly.  For a more immediate association, it's also pretty common for people to compare proportions of [thing] by population without considering the size of the respective populations.  Both of these have prominent current examples, but I want to avoid the distraction of bringing up specific political controversies here.  Not a particularly in-depth argument, but I think it's fairly obvious that a lot of people aren't equipped to reason about important statistics, and I don't see a major downside to trying to change that.  That said, I haven't given it a ton of thought, so I'm open to the possibility that I overlooked something obvious (e.g. evidence that it wouldn't work).  To address "what class would this replace?", I think it would work fine in place of an existing math class.	1643056040.0	sbvm3h	/r/changemyview/comments/sbvm3h/cmv_probability_and_statistics_should_be_part_of/	CMV: probability and statistics should be part of the high school core curriculum.
337mmtum	I believe that hunting is generally immoral. It does not matter if you are planning to eat the animal or not. The only situation in which I believe hunting is ethical, is if you need to kill an animal to eat in order to survive. I grew up around hunters and have even been hunting once and killed an animal. I am not vegan nor a vegetarian.   Despite the fact that many members of my family choose to hunt and eat the meat, I still find the practice immoral. None of these people NEED to kill a deer to eat, they all have normal jobs and make enough money to buy meat from the grocery store. This is what my opinion centers on... given a situation where you do not need to kill an innocent animal, but chose to anyway, I would consider the hunter to be in the wrong.  I don't pretend that meat I enjoy doesn't come from dead animals. However they were likely killed, processed, and prepared in a factory-type setting which is designed to produce food for humans. This is probably a more traumatic experience for the animal compared to getting killed by a bullet, I realize that. However I don't understand the hunter's "need" or "desire" to want to go out and kill an innocent animal when you can just buy meat from the store.   TL/DR: The individual decision to say "yeah I'm going to kill/hunt an innocent animal today even though I could easily go to the store and get the food I need" is what I consider immoral. I'm not interested in comparing hunting to a slaughterhouse or farm, I'm just saying that killing when you don't need to kill is bad.  EDIT: A lot of people missing the point, and that's probably because I didn't do a great job explaining my perspective. It's not that I think factory farming is better, or that having someone else kill for you is better. You guys are all treating the scenario as "factory farming" vs "hunting". These are not mutually exclusive. Factory farming happens regardless of whether you hunt or not. Factory farming produces more meat than we can consume. Therefore I believe hunting for food is unnecessary, animals are already killed and processed for you to eat, and there is no shortage of it. The individual hunter does not NEED to wake up, load a gun, and kill a deer. They could choose instead to consume an animal that's already dead. It boils down to killing is bad, killing more than you have to kill in order to survive is worse.	1643058599.0	sbwknv	/r/changemyview/comments/sbwknv/cmv_hunting_animals_is_generally_immoral/	CMV: Hunting animals is generally immoral
4de7s	When I go into a new restaurant/bar/cafe these days, the majority of the time I go in fully expecting to be disappointed because they will likely have these cheap medieval torture devices masquerading as chairs.  I don't get how any adult with a rear end bigger than an 10-year-old girl's could possibly find them comfortable.  I have never met a single person that enjoyed sitting in one for longer than 15 seconds.  In fact, if you google the phrase "shitty metal chair in every restaurant these days", you get images of "The Chair" and links to articles about how terrible they are.   Businesses that use them apparently only care about the trendiness and/or cost/maintenance associated with them because they cannot be considering customers' comfort when choosing them.   What's worse than businesses having them is that with the whole trendy "modern farmhouse" aesthetic that is going around these days (Thanks Chip and Joanna Gaines), half my friends have replaced their dining room seating with these unholy terrors, making it very difficult to work up the desire to visit them.  Now, I'm a bigger guy so I realize my hate for them might be more than someone else's, and I am genuinely open to understanding how these things might be somehow beneficial to those using them to sit on and not solely to those providing them to sit on.	1643061502.0	sbxql7	/r/changemyview/comments/sbxql7/cmv_those_crappy_metal_tolix_chairs_that_every/	CMV: Those crappy metal Tolix chairs that every other restaurant has these days are terrible, and places that only have them for seating do not care about their customers.

6v6b3	This is an opinion I’ve seen too often on Reddit that sounds empowering, but really makes no sense. “You shouldn’t be thanking anyone for doing the bare minimum.”  Let’s get right to the heart of it: this is aimed at men. No man really tells another man, “don’t you dare thank your wife for doing what she already should be doing.” Then again, it’s no secret that in most homes, women still do more of the housework and childcare, even if working traditional jobs as well. This isn’t right and my goal isn’t to argue against it.   What I do want to point out is that the idea of not thanking your partner (whatever the gender) is not helpful and will do more harm than good.   It seems as though the idea of thanking your partner for doing work they’re expected to do fills people with resentment, both personal and political.  It’s personal, because everyone who comments likes this has had someone in their life that didn’t do his fair share. And it’s political, because the debate is fundamentally about the balance of power, especially between men and women as groups.  But thanking someone is not the same as apologizing—it doesn’t place you in a subservient position. Expressing gratitude simply acknowledges behavior that you find beneficial and does not perpetuate inequality. In fact, it can help make relationships more equal.  My wife thanks me when I pick up my socks. She’s not telling me that I’m a hero or that I’m necessarily worthy of that praise. She’s acknowledging that I’m listening to her when she complains about my socks. That reinforces in my mind that she usually is the one picking up my socks and it shouldn’t be that way. And since people who receive gifts typically feel obligated to reciprocate, this insight has led to me, arguably an under-performing partner, to offer “gifts” of my own by contributing more to household tasks.  Contrast this with what usually happens—when one person criticizes or insults how little their partner does or criticizes how they do it, which leads to resentment on both ends. More than likely, the SO who has been scolded will end up denigrating the other partners contributions and avoid future participation.    I should also point out that—according to most studies—men typically have a harder time expressing gratefulness for household tasks being done. That’s why I qualified that both genders should be thanking their significant others for their contributions, despite how “expected” those contributions are. Gratitude must go both ways to be effective. It’s the role of the spouse to serve as witness to their partner’s life and gratitude tells the spouse that they are being seen, that their sacrifices and struggles are visible and honored.	1643066968.0	sbzsp3	/r/changemyview/comments/sbzsp3/cmv_there_is_nothing_wrong_with_thanking_for/	CMV: There is nothing wrong with thanking for spouse (man or woman) for doing housework.
2u99s3j6	So obvious trigger warning.  I basically don't see any reason why we shouldn't think this, and prepare for the fact that the human race is about to be wiped out.  Russia is about to invade Ukraine, and according to British intelligence they're going to be attacking major Ukrainian cities/capitals, so this is not just going to be annexing an eastern part of it like they did with the Crimea.  So even if this itself does not ignite WWIII, it's going to put Russia much closer to other countries that are members of NATO. Meaning NATO boarders, and hence NATO nukes, are going to be right on Russia's doorstep, and hence we have another missile crisis on our hands.  It was a fluke the Cuban crisis didn't make the Cold War go hot, the odds of us coming out of this one is low.

748q0hhx	Recently after a year and a half of identifying as non-binary, I finally found someone irl who actually wants to be called strictly as they/them or ze/hir and would get visibly upset or annoyed when people misgendered them.  It makes perfect sense that someone who was a born a female and want to identify as male would be called a he. There's just no inconvenience for the person who's referring to them to use one instead of the other, and if there is this could be worked out in a respectful manner. Specially if the person looks blatantly male like many trans people do, then there's not even the need for the preferred pronoun to be requested in the first place.  However it doesn't make much sense to me why someone would rather be called neither one of the existing biological sexes? I believe we can have progressive politics regarding gender and sexuality while still being tethered to reality. A biological female and someone who identifies as a female are not always the same exact thing, but that fact is not a problem at all in a world where they're socially treated the same way.  I don't see what self-identity mood boost would get by not identifying with the male or female gender. It's like you don't want to be seen as human or an animal at all. Yes, I'll use it if you ask me to, but I can't pretend using they/them while talking about someone who's right in front of me doesn't sound weird as hell and ze/hir weren't even real words for me two years ago. I may have no problem learning to use those pronouns if it makes someone's life better, but I fear people like my parents might disregard the whole transgender movement as nonsense cause they don't feel like calling someone that makes any sense, and honestly, I cannot blame them at all for thinking it's too much.	1643073687.0	sc19al	/r/changemyview/comments/sc19al/cmv_i_cant_see_why_anybody_would_want_to_be/	CMV: I can't see why anybody would want to be called a pronoun that doesn't refer to any of the two sexes, and it's counterproductive to endorse it.
15vmfv	I have seen lots of complaints, mainly about the ending of the first season.   I don’t understand how people think that the main characters choice (to not fly on his plane home to his daughter) was a selfish choice. He obviously cares about the thousands of people who will be killed in those games and the injustice of the situation. I felt like it was a true call to action for his character.   Another complaint I see is that he took too long to help Sae-byeok’s brother after he got out of the games. And he shouldn’t have sulked away for as long as he did… I feel as if no one would act or feel normal after surviving in those games. Especially since he is not allowed to tell anyone anything. PTSD and depression would be all over his mind.   My last complaint I don’t understand is the VIP dialogue. I felt like it represented the mega rich in a realistic way. Have you seen what Jeff Bezos is like or his Instagram? Or even Zoidberg? Those guys are cringy and are more likely to be even more cringy behind closed doors. I haven’t even gotten to Elon too.   The one nitpick I agree with is the villain arc with the twist at the end. Felt unnecessary for the story and the old man should’ve remained a normal contestant.	1643089311.0	sc6e1x	/r/changemyview/comments/sc6e1x/cmv_the_complaints_about_squid_game_are_missing/	cmv: The complaints about Squid Game are missing the point.
5nt1jc0o	Hey guys,  So one of the main reasons I believe this is due to some of my experiences with women in life so far. Growing up I was heavily tormented and bullied by my cousin for being a weird kid/quirky. I was also one of the people who go into arguments with her and didn't kiss the ground she walked on. She spread rumors about me, told her friends not to talk to me, used to prank call me from parties, and overall took a shot at my self-esteem whenever she got the chance to. She was a big social butterfly and was part of the mean girl's crowd at school so she was pretty socially savvy and even denied we were family to others at some point. Now as a grown-up she feigns amnesia regarding all this and pretends it didn't happen, or that I'm blowing things out of proportion. Some other girls at school used to insult me based on my looks or personality too, so you could say this had a heavy influence on me on not to trust a lot of women at first glance.  Now years later I'm in college and have had my fair share of female friends, acquaintances, and partners. One thing that always stands out to me is how much influence they seem to have in the social sphere of life. They have no problem getting invited to parties, getting help from friends in daily tasks or with important things, and seem to have a plethora of guys ready to help them out or stand up for them. As someone who mostly grew up relying on themself, it does touch a nerve. I know men and women have their own strengths and weakness but women's strengths seem to play a lot more to their advantage in the modern world. Men have more physical strength on average which is useful when it comes to manual things but women seem to have more 'social power' and this seems to be an unbridgeable gap. One of the stories a girl told me once involved her telling me about how she slapped a guy at a bar because he interrupted her and talked to her friend. Then she sought out the help of a male friend and had the guy thrown out of the bar. Later the same girl slapped me in the college dining hall because she misheard what I said. After I clarified she apologized but the fact that the very first thought to come to her head is to slap me when she feels she's insulted spoke volumes about her lack of fear of retaliation. If I slap a guy I best be prepared for him to retaliate but I'm sure a guy who physically retaliates against a girl is getting jumped by her guy friends regardless of whether she's in the wrong.  Just as easily if you have an argument with your so or friend and it turns ugly she can easily isolate you from your common friends. I Have personally seen that people are more likely to take a women's side in public without knowing the full story and implicitly believe the guy to be a jerk or in the wrong. What's most frightening is their influence over other men. They can easily have their guy friends mess you up if they feel slighted and the only thing holding them back is their own morality. similarly, they have almost the lion's share of power in the dating world.  They have a plethora of guys willing to date them and they can pick and choose who to date and who to reject. This extends even to average women.  Now I know what you're going to say, that I'm being paranoid and misogynistic. I don't expect most women to resort to this, of course, the majority of women are sweet and don't like to hurt people like any normal person. I have just had the misfortune of encountering a few sociopaths and the fact that they have people dancing like puppets on the palms of their hands is scary. Many men seem to be willing to look past these traits as long as the women are attractive and that seems beyond frightening to me. You get individuals who're entitled and have fragile egos who will resort in savage ways and ruin your life without a second thought if they feel ever so slight. A guy can do this too but conflicts between guys tend to be more physical and chances are they leave you alone if you best them on that front or stand up to them. Women especially attractive women with a lot of social power can turn people against you and isolate you. They can accuse you rape if they're crazy enough and ruin your reputation. The scary thing is there are no laws or anything to protect you. That same girl who bullied you in school is probably going to live the rest of her life free of consequence while modeling and having thousands of followers, at the same time preaching about social justice. The only power you have is to forgive yourself and move on and that stings. Anyway, this is just my opinion. I know similar to unpopular guys, there are unattractive girls who are picked on too who lack this power. I feel for them too. My case is only for those girls who hold a lot of soft power.	1643092350.0	sc7887	/r/changemyview/comments/sc7887/cmv_i_believe_women_especially_attractive_women/	CMV: I believe women especially attractive women have too much power in the social sphere of life: dating, social circles, and life and overall in influencing people.
5x1e1hke	It doesn't make sense if the regulation or certain laws prohibit guns for a certain places while in the same time do not implement security check.  The purpose of these regulations or laws is to reduce the possibility of mass shootings. However, if a perpetrator does intend to commit such crime, they will just ignore the rules and carry out the shooting.  Numerous examples like schools or churches support such argument. However, there is few examples of mass shootings **inside the security area** of an airport. This does make sense since security check is implemented in every airport.

3q2f8mqb	People born in the western world for the most part seem to be losing interest in religion from what I can tell.  Now it seems that religious sense of identity is fading and people are replacing that sense of identity and culture with politics.  I almost feel like older generations used to have a lot more radicalized Christians in the western world.  Now I feel like current generations are starting to get radicalized political partisans.  It got to absurd levels with a cult of personality tied to Donald Trump.    Anyhow it's both a good and depressing trend if it's true and not just what I see from my own bubble.  Good in that the superstition of religion is fading and theoretically that people are more civically engaged.

gw92lk27	To be clear, I'm not saying I want this to happen. Actually, the idea of a one-party nation scares me. But looking at the political landscape it seems like Democrats, if they really wanted to, could force Republicans from power.   First, Democrats can pack the Supreme Court to tilt it in their favor. Once that's done, Biden can use executive orders to make voting as widespread as possible, favoring Democrats. He can also pass executive orders that would give aid to people. These assistance programs would help Democrats in 2024 as well.   If Democrats can dominate all three branches of government come 2024, they can pass legislation to make their executive orders permanent. Once that's done, they can abolish the electoral college, dealing a fatal blow to Republicans.  Maybe it's not 100%, but it seems like Democrats can take steps to tilt the midterm elections in their favor, pass executive orders which will help them win in 2024 in all areas of government, and then use those victories to permanently enshrine the changes made by executive orders. But I'm curious to hear other people's thoughts on this, and I am by no means certain that my view is correct.  Edit: New information: Democrats could admit Puerto Rico and D.C. as states, giving themselves a greater majority in the senate and they could expand the house of representatives as well.	1643101251.0	sc9eot	/r/changemyview/comments/sc9eot/cmv_if_democrats_wanted_to_they_could_make/	CMV: If Democrats wanted to, they could make America a one-party nation and keep Republicans from controlling any branch of government ever again.
155tbo	I believe that everything that would traditionally be done by email, would be better done with other tools (mainly messaging services like discord) and the only good reason that email isn't a totally dead technology is its wide adoption and intercompatibility.   Email clients fundamentally still rely on decades-old interpretations of how to group information in the interface. Every usability feature that I have ever seen in emails just makes them appear closer to something like discord. One early example is message chains / threads / discussions or whatever having multiple messages under one title is called. Outlook 365 is filled with tiny UI features that just basically try to get over the shortcomings of email.

62kyxam2	**Reasons the United African Currency would be a benefit**  1. The UAC would stabilize the national economies, the whims of corrupt officials could no longer devalue the currency and all accounts would be trackable by the African Union.  2. The UAC would go much further than any of the current currencies. The less money one needs to carry around the better. You'd see items selling for less than a whole UAC and it would just make everything easier to keep track and have a real understanding of wealth.  3. You could go to any African nation and use the money without fees for conversion.  4. Trade would be made much easier with the EU as their currencies would be a 1 to 1 match hopefully bringing more wealth to the continent.  5. No more debt dependency, all loans would be kept with in Africa vs for example China. The Union bank loans money, and is able to set a tangible pay back loan system.  Having a currency that is universal but practically worthless when converted to the Euro or Dollar would not be very helpful.	1643119886.0	scemwj	/r/changemyview/comments/scemwj/cmv_the_african_union_should_create_a_universal/	CMV: The African Union should create a universal currency for Africa and peg it to the Euro, then convert all money to that currency.
5c5jxlcp	Over the long term I think it’s very likely that China will remain one   of the world’s dominant powers due to both its size and cultural clout   (assuming it can get its birth rate back above replacement rate within   the next couple of generations); but over the short and medium term   China’s current government looks very unstable to me because the   government lacks legitimacy and is set up for a “Tocqueville Paradox”   revolution.  I currently believe China has a 60% chance of a very bloody overthrow   of its current regime sometime in the next 20 years or less and a 40%   chance of such an event occurring in the next 10 years or less.  I am   open to my view being changed on this; both that the chances are   somewhat higher, or much lower. Note that I’m picking percentages in   order to make my view as measurable as possible.  To elaborate, the “Tocqueville Paradox” is a theory of revolutions   positing that a country is most likely to experience a violent   revolution not when things are bad for a long time, but when   conditions have been steadily getting better and suddenly get much   worse again (dashed expectations create more anger than long-term   oppression).  China has enjoyed an explosion of material wealth over   the last generation.  Given the current level of instability in the   world I believe a significant economic shock to the world economy is   extremely likely and that shock is also likely to have a large impact   on the Chinese economy.  In addition, I strongly suspect China’s   policies are making such a shock likely to be more severe because it’s   planning choices and economic interventions cannot foresee the future   nearly as well as Xi seems to think they can (the property bubble is a   potentially “small” example).  Part of this is based on my view that   while a strongly interventionist economic policy can have benefits, it   is also more prone to shocks because of the distortions it can create.   In short, China is likely to experience a very significant economic   shock following its recent history of growth.  Further, I believe China is usually vulnerable to political disruption   that could result from such a shock.  The Maoist interlude destroyed a   lot of China’s cultural fabric which makes building legitimacy much   harder for a government.  It seems clear Xi recognizes this with his   attempt to reintroduce Confucianism into the culture, however   rebuilding cultural fabric takes centuries and it will not be enough   to help in the short term.  The current “Communist” government instead   rests its legitimacy on its claim to be a good steward of the economy   and record of success delivering a tremendous period of material   growth.  This seems to be working fine while growth is good, but if   the economy experiences a significant depression it will destroy the   source of the regime’s legitimacy.  I think Xi recognizes this as   well which is why the government has gone to such great pains to   cultivate nationalism.  Nationalism, however, is riding a tiger.  If   you are suddenly seen as incompetent, the “nationalist” thing to do is   stage a bloody revolution and to throw the weak bums out.  Further, it   raises the stakes for Xi in Taiwan tremendously.  If he were to stage   an invasion and fail that alone could spark a revolution.  In   addition, at least from the outside China appears to have a   significant corruption/princeling problem that further undermines   legitimacy.  Next, China has a long history of rebellions and an intellectual   tradition justifying them when they succeed.  I don’t think this   factor is dispositive, but it’s a data point raising the chances of   another such event.  Finally, China’s demographics are uniquely suited to a revolution.   The large imbalance of men to women creates a huge pool of potential   malcontents with very little to lose.  A rapidly aging society is also   going to create unknown stressors that can’t be positive for   stability.  All that said, I am very much an outside observer here and am curious   to hear where my views may be based on bad information or my analysis   is flawed.  I’m especially interested to hear from people with more on   the ground knowledge or who have studied the history of revolution in   other countries.	1643123884.0	scg14g	/r/changemyview/comments/scg14g/cmv_china_has_a_60_chance_of_a_violent_revolution/	CMV: China Has a 60% Chance of a Violent Revolution in the Next 20 Years

The brain doesn't even stop maturing until age 25.  Colleges at least have legal adults on their teams, who are more able to make their own decisions. Minors, on the other hand, either don't know the risks or aren't mature enough to consent (again, age 25).

6km2a	To be clear: this is a problem with Reddit as a platform, not just this subreddit.  Therefore I believe it should be in accordance with the rules.    When it comes to these topics on Reddit, the majority of the people flocking to these posts are not doing so in good faith. They're outright zealots who gravitate to these discussions like moths to a flame. You could no more change their minds than you could change a cat into a dog.  Now, you may say, what's the harm in engaging in pointless debate? Normally I would say none, but the far right people attracted to these topics, and possibly those from the opposite side of the spectrum as well, have a particularly insidious tactic that they use. Specifically, they will reply to a post with a lot of misinformation and citations. It looks like they have strong evidence, until you examine it.  But there's a trick. After they make this post, they block you. Under reddit's rules, you are no longer allowed to reply to that post. So from the outside, it looks like they posted a well researched response and you simply walked away without addressing it. It looks from the outside like they debunked your post, when the reality is they simply blocked you from debunking their debunking. These types of posts are rife with this bad faith behavior. And, until and unless some sort of rule change prevents it, there's simply no point in taking this bait. You will play into the hands of misinformation peddlers.  I've obviously fallen into this trap multiple times leading to this new conclusion on my part.

11i2s2q2	As a person with Italian heritage, I find it difficult to understand how the history of the United States has led to “white privilege” when that should only apply to certain groups of European descendants. For example, Italians have faced violence and discrimination ever since they migrated to the US up until recently.  [In 1891, one of the largest mass lynchings in American history was of 11 Italians in New Orleans because they were arrested for a crime where 9 of 19 had already been found innocent or there was a mistrial.

Obviously there are many factors that go into invasions, and in this day and age the use of robotic weaponry like drones takes away the need for actual troops. But if you want to invade and hold something, you can't do it remotely. Someone has to be there to maintain order. Which is why I am comparing land area vs troop size. You need to have people patrolling the country, looking in buildings and under bridges for partisans. Can't patrol there with drones and aircraft.      Based on the estimates provided by various news media, it is believed that there are 175,000 Russian troops amassed at the Ukrainian border. This amount to 19% of Russian forces. As far as I can tell, only Nazi Germany committed more of their troop pool to invasions than Russia would in the hypothetical invasion of Ukraine, but that was the Nazi Germany double-edged sword that worked out in the beginning but ended up leading to their downfall.     Based on this information, I believe the Ukrainian invasion from Russia is not imminent. That does not mean it can't happen in the future, but with the present troops at the border it doesn't seem likely. Unless Russia moves more troops or a nearby country assists with the Invasion, Ukraine will remain (further) unmolested.

7vqd4	The United States is a representative democratic republic, wherein people elect leads who create policy on their behalf. Although our government was designed to protect the population from the tyranny of the majority, it was also designed to prevent minority rule. The modern era has ensured that the latter objective has failed. Information spreads fast enough that only the most polarizing, national policies get attention, while local and state government elections are ignored. My view is that congress should be made up of politicians chosen by state legislatures. This would allow the population to give their deserved attention to national issues through the election of state and local representatives who can both execute state governments in a way that supports those policies, as well as nominate federal representatives who can accomplish their same goals. Such a system would both create a more representational democracy, but also return attention to the politicians who more closely affect each voters' life	1643133769.0	scjruy	/r/changemyview/comments/scjruy/cmv_the_united_states_should_revert_to_a_system/	CMV: The United States should revert to a system where local and state representatives nominate their federal representatives
7ls2h9fq	I know there is a certain comfort that comes from being in a group like that and being able to identify as such. There is no word for a person who supports LGBTQ+ rights or who supports BLM, at least not a word that is in common use. Since a lot of people want to tear down any progressive movement, the meaning of the words 'Socialist' and 'feminist' get distorted by people looking for a reason to not agree with them. Both movements would achieve a lot more of their goals (which would be a good thing, but that's not what I want to discuss here) if they were to change the language they used. Feminism had a brief surge of progress with the expression 'me too' because it was inclusive language. They should challenge people on whether or not they are a Misogynist, not a feminist. Socialists should ask people if they are capitalists, not socialists. This simple change would make the group of people on side with progress much larger. The gay rights movement have long taken the attitude that; almost anyone who is unhappy to be labelled a homophobe, is probably on the right side.	1643137052.0	scl156	/r/changemyview/comments/scl156/cmv_feminists_and_socialists_should_stop_using/	CMV: 'Feminists' and 'Socialists' should stop using those words, they are exclusionary and hinder the progress of their respective causes.
1gl8ozs3	My definition of Left here means anybody not of a Liberal or Social Democratic way of ideology, but Communist, Maoist, Anarchist, Democratic Socialist, etc.  Im a person who doesn't necessarily subscribe to an ideology, but oh boy have folks tried to justify Russia as the victim in this situation.  If we look at contemporary history, we can obviously see the trends that go on here. Russia has invaded Georgia, and has troops in places like Abkhazia and Ossetia (if thats the correct spelling), to prevent Georgia getting closer to the West. Russia has sent in *"little green men"* into Crimea and has it as a disputed oblast within the new occupying country; including sending "Volunteers" to seperatists in Donbass and Donetsk. Yeltsin, the first President of Modern Russia has even said that NATO expansion doesn't matter to him (albeit he was cautious of it).  NATO is a military alliance that doesn't ask, but receives the request to join the ranks of its Militaries. Sweden and Finland have signalled it may join, but no commitment has been made, but Russia has already threatened Sweden with fly-by's and Naval Ships near its waters to ward off Swedens new interest in joining. NATO does not invade and tell that nation "ok youre with us now". All it does in all reality, is create a mutual defense pact for those involved, and creates a gurantee of protection/independence if an attack happens.   Ukraine is not a NATO member, but wants to be a part of the EU minimally as far as I remember. Russia sees this as a threat, because the nation isn't Russophilic like it was pre-2014.   With all this out of the way, this is the kinds of arguments of folks who consider themselves of the "Left":  -Ukraine is not a sovereign Country (yes, it has been said)  -NATO is provoking war by expanding  -Russia is not provoking anything but to secure its future and Ukraine is the Aggressor by not wanting to play ball  -War wouldn't be inevitable if the Defense Contractors and Mil-Com Industry wasn't negging for another war.  How can anyone, who is on the left, say that a Fascistic Autocrats ambitions are more just than literally anyone elses? Aren't the left supposed to be super duper Anti-Fascist? Is the point of the Left to say "Both sides are fucking stupid", rather than simping for the guy who made Pride Parades illegal, and let a genocide against the LGBT happen in Chechenya?  Russia is the Aggressor, NATO is not expanding like a hive mind threatening Russia, and the Left needs to do a better job of analyzing the actual situation.  (I know for those of you who are gonna say "its geopolitics" or something like that, but these are the facts as it stands and it clearly determines Russia is wanting war.

e3gwz1di	When you make the choice to become a parent, you are choosing to take on responsibility for another human being in perpetuity. That child did not choose to be born, you chose to have them and as such you owe them your care to the best of your ability. You have to feed them, house them, clothe them, not just until they’re 18 but until you have done what you can to adequately prepare them to take care of themselves and you cannot and should not make them feel guilty for that. Kicking your child out at 18 because “they’re an adult” is wrong. Turning 18 doesn’t magically make you responsible enough to care for yourself. I also think you have an obligation to educate them to the best of your ability. If you can afford to send your child to college, you should be paying for it. College helps prepare kids to be self sufficient and independent and as a parent it’s your duty to help your kids become those things. Obviously people have different financial situations and not all parents can provide the exact same support to their kids as others might be able to, but to the best of your ability you owe your kids support, financial, emotional, physical, etc. Also quite frankly, it’s normally parents who do have the financial means to support their kids that are the most stingy. They’ll say they want to teach their kids to work hard, but are making life for them unnecessarily difficult. This is especially true of rich parents who deny financial support for things like college, but because of their financial means are disqualifying their kids for aid they’d qualify for if they were on their own.   Now if you have done everything within your power to prepare your child to support themselves and they are still expecting a hand out that is one thing, but otherwise, you chose to have a child, you need to take care of them.	1643145881.0	scocmy	/r/changemyview/comments/scocmy/cmv_as_a_parent_it_is_your_responsibility_to_care/	CMV: as a parent it is your responsibility to care for your child to the best of your ability even after they turn 18
v6lnk4d	Market consolidation is a major problem facing American capitalism. The rise of global markets and corporate centralization, as well as lax government regulation, has created a state in which a few gigantic corporations can control the overwhelming majority of all but a few categories. Whether you're a free market libertarian or a big government liberal, or a revolutionary socialist, the current state of affairs is clearly not how markets are supposed to work. There can be no creative destruction in a world full of companies too big to fail!  The problem with fixing this corruption is that doing so involves direct interference in the market. Someone has to pick who gets broken up or who can't have a merger. There are standards, but even the order in which they are enforced could have monumental economic consequences. The other is obvious, political capital. Everytime a company is broken up the sitting administration has to deal with 1-2 days of coverage debating the decision. It's not impossible, it's just difficult and reliant on some level of government consensus.   So given all that, I suggest that we instead enforce market competition by imposing a tax. The tax would be based on the percentage of the share in a market a corporation has in each industry to which it is party. The tax would start at some bottom level, the maximum acceptable share in a competitive market, say 20%. For each percentage of market share over that, the company pays a 1.25% tax on all profits produced in the given industry. The tax would be scaled so that at 100% market share all profits are taxed, in the case of a 20% floor it would be 1.25%.   This has multiple advantages when compared with the current model. For one, it allows the government to put a dollar value on market competitiveness. In the climate debate they refer to this as factoring in externalities, I believe the idea is that some corporate actions apply an indescribable price on all of society and so by putting a price on that social cost you encourage companies to consider the social good in business affairs. In this case companies who become hegemonic in a sector benefit from increased prices, low labor competition, and large government protections while facing no financial consequences for errors and limiting public choice. Why shouldn't there be a financial punishment for willfully disregarding the fundamental concept of a free market to the detriment of all but a few?  Another advantage is that it reduces the political overhead of securing a free market. Instead of deciding for each individual company who is and isn't violating market competition, you have a disincentive built into the system itself. If there are some markets where competition is not beneficial or in which only a few competitors exist (an emerging market, for instance) they could lobby for a temporary exemption, but this puts the burden of proof on corporations to show they are abiding by market principles.   Finally, it's also easier to pass in our political climate. This, as far as I can tell, is a proposal that every major economic discipline in the American political debate could endorse. It targets the 1% while encouraging economic growth without spending. It would also significantly alleviate the American debt burden as the government would receive large short-term tax increases on those who have been flagrantly ignoring these rules for decades.   Look, this is mostly improvisational for me. I'm not an economics person, so I fully expect there's already a concept out there like this and 2000 pages of debates for and against. Tbh, I wouldn't even know how to find that convo myself if I tried. I just thought this seemed like an ideal solution and can't really understand why it hasn't already happened. So CMV, or enlighten me please!	1643146922.0	scoqbr	/r/changemyview/comments/scoqbr/cmv_we_should_use_taxes_to_enforce_market/	CMV: We should use taxes to enforce market competition
3zbj5lrr	"In this house we believe science is real, no human is illegal, black lives matter, love is love, women's rights are human rights..." etc. etc. etc or some version of this and many other signs with other similar slogans.   If you live in a bigger US city, *particularly in areas of the city that are less dense and more white*, you have definitely seen plenty of these signs.   To some degree, I don't want to question the motives of people who post lawn signs. I am myself a liberal, I live in such a place as I described, and I am white. I also generally believe in the phrases on these signs.  But one thing I absolutely cannot stand is virtue signaling. Virtue signaling is not a productive form of politics, and too many people do it nowadays among people of all political leanings. The worst part of these signs, though, in particular, is that they're mostly posted on the lawns of people who would never vote to rezone their neighborhoods, build more affordable housing, would call the police on people who seem "out of place" in the neighborhood (or homeless), and would never actually give their time or money to stand up to injustice. Many are also white people who have moved into (gentrified) neighborhoods that are mostly non-white for cheaper rent.  Summer of 2020, after George Floyd was murdered, our country, particularly out big cities, went through a period of intense activism. Most demonstrations were peaceful and isolated in downtown areas, but some became violent and ventured into areas that are predominantly residential. I don't want to debate this because it's not my main point. It's an objective fact that some protests turned violent. I don't think it makes the justice movements any less valid, but sadly it happened.  Noticing that there was a higher potential for 1960s-style riots to come into neighborhoods, people started posting lawn signs on their properties. Whether they know it or not, the signs are meant to signal to rioters "please do not loot my home, I am on your side". It's almost like the blood on the Israelites' doors during the slaying of the first born. People are scared of protests gone wrong, and are looking for a way to proactively protect themselves.  Otherwise, I genuinely cannot think of another motivation for posting such stupid lawn signs on your property. It's not an election year, and these people live in places that vote like 90% the same way. Do you really think that posting a BLM sign on your lawn in D.C. or San Francisco is really changing anyone's mind? This is largely what leads me to believe the signs are intended as riot protection.   I guess I could understand someone in a really conservative area or very purple area posting lawn signs as a means of protesting against the community's lean or signaling where you stand in the mix. But in places where basically everyone is a liberal, the signs don't serve a purpose other than to try to convince someone violent who might attack you for being a gentrifier or something that you "support" them, and therefore you shouldn't be attacked.  I imagine my view can most easily be changed by some showing that people are either just plain virtue signaling or following the crowd, but I don't expect anyone to have to jump through any logical hoops to make a good argument here.

dltbpru7	To clarify, I’m a believer in man made climate change and I know the world especially my country, The US, needs to do a lot more to solve probably the most dangerous problem there is right now.        But it makes me mad when I see other climate activists call climate deniers idiots or insult them in various other ways. I don’t think people should insult other people in debate anyway but for climate change related debates especially. Insulting their intelligence isn’t going to help convince them that climate change is real and it’s going to make it even worse. You’re just going to make them more stubborn and once everyone starts throwing insults then nothing productive is going to happen.       It should be your priority to convince them of the truth not fuel your own ego. Convincing more people to care about the environment is of course going to help the environment.	1643154372.0	scrg0n	/r/changemyview/comments/scrg0n/cmv_you_shouldnt_insult_climate_deniers/	cmv: you shouldn’t insult climate deniers
3yt8hmx3	Using data from 2020, women earned roughly 84% of what men earned in the US, and nearly all published analysis across the spectrum estimates these differences in earnings ranging somewhere between 22% 15% in 2020, with men earning more.   While there is objectively a difference in average earnings among men and women, the media narrative suggests that nearly all of this pay gap stems from the patriarchy, and that women are set up for failure due to a discriminatory system that won't allow them to reach their full potential. This is incorrect.   Although you'd likely assume that the person's occupation, rank within their organization, tenure, education level, and average hours worked per week would be factored in this equation, none of these elements are included. Instead, it's strictly calculated by looking at the difference between the average earnings of all men and comparing them with the average earnings of all women.  The vast majority of the pay gap between men and women stems from their respective decisions they typically don't wish to change, along with biological differences. Men are significantly more likely to pursue higher paying degrees and choose careers that require frequent travel, or are dangerous. Women are less likely to pursue the path of being a top 1% income earner as it typically requires sacrifices like not having children. Men are also significantly more likely to negotiate their salary. When these are considered, the gender pay gap shrinks to between 3%-5%.  I'm not saying that we shouldn't make an effort to address that 3%-5%, but there is a critical lack of basic, 101 level multivariate analysis to support this narrative and it deserves to at least be acknowledged if we want women to feel empowered enough to control their futures in the workforce.	1643155310.0	scrshd	/r/changemyview/comments/scrshd/cmv_the_gender_pay_gap_media_narrative_in_the_us/	CMV: The 'Gender Pay Gap' media narrative in the US is misleading and should be corrected
3i5pny18	This question is inspired by this news article: [St Kilda’s Captain Cook statue doused in red paint in Australia Day protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/scp39h/st_kildas_captain_cook_statue_doused_in_red_paint/). I understand that Australia Day offends a lot of people, and that we most definitely do not have a good track record of treatment of our Indigenous people. But it does not help the cause of Indigenous rights to be seen as vandals. Our side needs to improve our argument.  I believe in following the examples set by Martin Luther King and Alan Turing.   * I know that MLK [had a disapproval rate of 75% when he was killed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/04/04/martin-luther-king-jr-50-years-assassination-donald-trump-disapproval-column/482242002/). But his strategy was genius - don't be vandals or violent, instead make your victimhood obvious. In doing so, he embarrassed his country into passing civil rights legislation even when they really didn't want to and they didn't really like him. His actions made the incredibly strong argument of "we are innocent victims".  * Alan Turing made groundbreaking innovations in computing that may have been essential in saving his nation in World War II. But his nation still persecuted him for being gay. He let the government have its way, and it led to his depression and suicide. Nowadays, his martyrdom has become an excellent argument and trump card when debating in support of gay rights.  I also want to draw your attention to the [United Australia Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Australia_Party_(2013)). I am most emphatically **not** a supporter of them. But they have become Australia's biggest political party by grassroots membership - [with over 70,000 members by October 2021](https://archive.is/sI3FA) according to the *Sydney Morning Herald*, a centrist newspaper. Their ads are incessant, but they have some excellent scare tactic arguments (so no wonder they are more successful now than during Clive Palmer's previous attempts to win power), such as:  * "[*Zero emissions, Zero Jobs, and Zero Future. Thanks for Zero, Scomo, Barnaby & Albo.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U7iSUkvt1Q)" (which is doubly bad because Australia has very poor climate action, and the UAP is claiming that even this is going too far) * "[*Stick to Your Promises Scott Morrison*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WdCNWqIwdw)" (which rubs in how Scott Morrison was previously against mandatory vaccinations but changed his mind)  To conclude, "Don't raise your voice, improve your argument":  * Allowed civil rights legislation to pass in the USA even when most people opposed it and opposed MLK. * Gives the pro-LGBT camp gets an excellent argument from the victimhood of Alan Turing. * Allows United Australia Party can suck in so many members through well-worded scare campaigns. * In contrast, we will make no progress on Indigenous rights if the pro-Indigenous camp doesn't follow this advice.	1643161211.0	sctw6c	/r/changemyview/comments/sctw6c/cmv_we_should_take_desmond_tutus_advice_of_dont/	CMV: We should take Desmond Tutu's advice of "Don't raise your voice, improve your argument".
kpw5jxx	Feeling that anger, that vindictiveness is actually rather cathartic. I had a bully way back in junior high. I remember hating him for years after we'd finally parted ways. I hated talking about, hearing about, and just thinking about him. And it made me feel power and control. I could hate him without having to fear what he'd do in turn or what others would say.   One day I realized that I didn't want to feel that hate anymore. I didn't want to feel anger every time my bully was brought up or I just recalled him for whatever reason because it brings down my overall mood. I realized that I didn't want that to happen for my whole life. I didn't want 20 years later and my bully for some reason gets brought up and my mood to lessen because of it. I didn't want the people around me to have to tip-toe around that issue even though I know they would fully understand. So, I worked at it. I worked on just letting go of my anger bit by bit. Letting it fade in baby steps. I will admit my anger hasn't reached zero yet, but it is extremely close. I can talk and think about the guy and my mood doesn't lessen.   I don't regret holding a grudge as long as I did but I'm glad that I let go of it when I did as well.  I think grudge-holding in the short-term is empowering, but in the long-term it actually gives power to the one who hurt us.  Of course, how long the short-term lasts will differ for people widely based on the severity of the transgressions against them. I sure don't expect victims of sexual abuse or a loved one being murdered to let go of their grudge any time soon. But I don't think any victim should *try* to hold a grudge forever. After a certain point it becomes an unnecessary burden more than anything.  Oh, indeed, we are not obligated to forgive anyone who has wronged us. But, we are also not obligated to hold grudges either.  We can hold grudges and still live happy and fulfilling. But even so, if we had less to be angry about, wouldn't we have more chances of being even happier than we already are?	1643169553.0	scwpup	/r/changemyview/comments/scwpup/cmv_holding_a_grudge_is_very_cathartic_in_the/	CMV: Holding a grudge is very cathartic... in the short-term.

To **convincingly** show that there was BUILDING UP, we need to show that there were less before, and there are more now. Interestingly, the best site that I found to show this buzzfeednews lol. It shows a before / after picture, a more convincing argument that there is a building up.   However, even this is not well **contextualized**. It shows 2 pictures 3 months apart but just 2 locations. There are many issues with this:  1. Maybe there is a built up ONLY at the 2 locations. To make it convincing, we need to show the before after for all locations close to the border.  1. Maybe there is a built up EVERYWHERE, not at Ukraine in particular, to make it convincing, we need to show the locations of all Russian military.  2. The pictures are 3 months apart. Maybe this is a normal part of a 6 month cycle? For example, 2 pictures one at low tide and another at high tide is not a well contexed pictured to argue for sea level rising.  Maybe the articles are assuming that the readers are already keeping track of the location of Russian military unit in the past decades, so the reader themselves are already well contextualized. Which is perfectly fine I suppose. I'm not saying that the articles are bad, or misleading, or wrong. I'm simply saying that they are not providing the context convincingly show that there is an evidence of built up WITHIN the article itself.  To CMV, just give me one a good news article / video.

hztqj	Perhaps I am simply weak, but I am not a fan of seeing horror films that revel in the torture of their characters. I am shocked and appalled by the plots of Human Centipede I, II, III and 120 Days of Sodom - reading them deeply troubled me since it seems to imply that people enjoy watching the torture of others. The Saw films, while not as extreme, also trouble me on some level, though I do see how people find them entertaining.  &#x200B;  I am of course not making the argument that films should simply have positive, feel-good plots, I think it is important to express the full human condition, of which it is mostly struggle, in our media. I also don't think that torture has no place in movies - sometimes it is in service of the plot. I'm also not necessarily opposed to films that concern stories of torture, such as victims trapped by rapists in their basement or a POW camp.      However, films such as Human Centipede seem to me to be nothing but pornography of violence and torture, and I cannot understand how they are enjoyed by others. I find it morally wrong to watch and produce such content.     Focusing on the producer, I cannot imagine what would compel a director and a cast to undergo the production of these sorts of films, and I would find it troubling if those involved were not disturbed and shocked by the experience of making such films. If they did find it a good or bearable experience, I would question their morals.     For viewers, I can understand the morbid fascination with excessive violence and torture, but it seems to me that a certain subset finds these films enjoyable and seek them out. To enjoy these films seems to me to imply a certain disconnect and lack of empathy for fellow people.      Perhaps a fan of these films could share their mindset  - I cannot understand it.

37gqzyrr	The concept of full-time jobs being normalized in society is insanity to me.  I believe that the foundation of living a good and meaningful life hinges on taking care of 3 things: 1. Mind 2. Body 3. Soul  Once that foundation has been established, only then can we have the opportunity to truly flourish as a human being. I believe that all of us should have this right.  But how is that even possible if you have a full-time job taking up majority of your waking hours (time and energy).  To achieve the above, you will need to have enough sleep (8 hours), do your chores (cook, clean, grocery shopping etc.), socialise with friends, spend time with your family, meditate, exercise and workout and spend time on your hobbies (watching tv shows, reading books, drawing etc.).  And I haven't included the time needed to commute to and from work/places and setting time aside for a healthy morning and nightly routine.  AND the above does not include the scenario where you have children of your own that you need to care for.  We can absolutely acheive this - if we didnt have a full-time job. I'm sure some of you would have experienced that too during a holiday period where you had more time to yourself and felt like you were on the path to flourishing as a human being - where life felt like it was at lesst worth living.  Life is meant to be experienced - our existence is not meant to be us being cooped up in a small cubicle for the majority of our waking hours until we die.  Why are we accepting this. There has to be another way. Full-time jobs are trash. Change my view.	1643177775.0	scz6fx	/r/changemyview/comments/scz6fx/cmv_you_are_unable_to_flourish_as_a_human_being/	CMV: You are unable to flourish as a human being if you hold a full-time job.

That is the case for countries as well.  &#x200B;  America justifies its global military presence with the assumption that the US government and military is a force for good, liberating oppressed peoples and spreading freedom and democracy. But is that actually true?  &#x200B;  What was the last military conflict you felt it was worth it for the US to fight, your answer may vary but I think the most common one would be the Second World War.

dyc6g6xz	There seems to be a near unanimous perception online that Nickelodeon show-runner Dan Schneider is some shade of sexual creep who abused and/or exploited young female cast members on his shows. There are countless YouTube videos and Reddit posts posturing as to why he's supposedly this entertainment industry boogeyman along the lines of Harvey Weinstein.  All of the evidence for these claims revolve around clips with questionable jokes across many of his shows. A lot of these jokes involve either discussing feet or displaying feet in some manner, leading many to draw the conclusion that Schneider is a prolific foot fetishist. I will certainly say that it's possible this could be the case, but it also seems highly possible that he was just some guy trying to write wacky comedy for children and thought that feet were funny. It may have not even crossed his mind at the time that these jokes would later be interpreted in a much more negative light.  In situations like this, I think it's best to be charitable and assume good intentions unless other people spoken up and stated that there were issues. As far as I have seen, the majority of former child cast members on his shows have had nothing but positive words about Schneider, and continue to interact with him on social media. Of the few that have publicly aired problems (like Alexa Nicholas), the stories only suggest that he was an asshole, *not* any sort of sexual creep.  Why are people so willing to jump the gun with such flimsy evidence? I honestly believe Schneider's appearance has a lot to do with it. Tell me. would this same narrative have formed around a chiseled, nice looking dude? No, people saw pictures of some greasy fat guy posing with female teenage celebrities and jumped the gun.  **To be clear, the second that a single person were to come out with any sort of accusations against Schneider this post would be invalidated. That has yet to happen as far as I'm aware.**	1643182564.0	sd0fdz	/r/changemyview/comments/sd0fdz/cmv_the_internets_characterization_of_dan/	CMV: The internet's characterization of Dan Schneider as a creep/predator is completely unfounded and likely stereotyped from appearance
c3jg8	There's no basis for excluding us or what we create (buildings, cars, roads planes) from the definition of natural. We don't do the same for dams or anthills built by beavers and ants - we recognise these structures as being natural, and while they are massively different in scale and impact to what humans create, scale and impact alone seem like a dubious criterion for whether or not something is "natural" (just look at natural disasters).   If human beings are somehow 'outside' of nature then there would need to be some point in evolutionary history where this jump from being part of nature to being separate from it occurred, and that seems nonsensical on its face.	1643184168.0	sd0uac	/r/changemyview/comments/sd0uac/cmv_natural_vs_manmade_is_a_false_distinction/	Cmv: natural vs man-made is a false distinction, given that human beings, being animals, are part of nature
64ixkw73	My husband and I have always been courteous neighbors. We are not loud people in general—our average tv volume is under 10.   Our downstairs neighbors, however, are loud, particularly from midnight to three in the morning. They are either yelling or watching movies so loud I know exactly what movie it is because I am getting a play by play. I have contacted management multiple times about this and they say they have reached out, but no change has happened. I lose hours of sleep a night due to this.   So fuck it. If no one cares about our needs then I’m not going to be quiet anymore. Maybe if I play my movies and music at full volume at 11AM (when they are apparently sleeping after playing movies til 3 in the morning) and at random times during the day, I have the right to do it. Ima be hecka loud. Ima vacuum every day, twice a day and turn on the blow dryer.  According to a previous post I made about wanting to know how to deal with loud neighbors, redditors claim that it doesn’t matter if I can’t sleep—my neighbors can do whatever they want. So fine then.

No to mention that the articles are extremely expensive and if you don't have the backing of a library or institution it's hard to do. Secondly, the money they make is semnificative.    "Elsevier is the first name that comes to mind when many people think of the large, highly-profitable middle-men of the science communication industry. I'm not sure that Elsevier clearly stands out from its competitors, e.g. Taylor & Francis, or Springer, or Wiley, or various professional-society publishers, with regard to ethical issues. All of these companies face ethics complaints, which generally fall into the following categories:  Pay-walling of publicly-funded research: An ethical argument is made that the results of research funded by public taxes should be publicly accessible, and that these companies' business model of charging people to download papers or receive the print publications are contrary to that principle. Implicit in this line of argument is an observation that the costs of access--typically $20-60 for online papers--far exceed the normal or customary costs of, say, printing a document or having it delivered.  Extortionate pricing and rent-seeking motive: Some clients of these industries don't object to the for-profit business model per se, but interpret their high profitability, all-or-nothing pricing models, and sometimes wildly-disparate pricing within the industry, as evidence of classical rent-seeking and other fundamentally-parasitic motives. Elsevier is regularly in the news because of university, library system, and editorial boycotts over the perception of exploitative pricing.  Weak commitment to peer review: Sometimes the rent-seeking accusations are coupled with an observation that the chief value added by the publisher under this model should be a robust peer-review process, and that the companies are regularly caught publishing troll submissions and low-grade content. There is a feeling that, for the prices charged, the companies should make a better investment in editorial prestige, competence, and the review process generally." - details here: https://www.quora.com/Is-it-immoral-to-publish-scientific-papers-with-Elsevier    Links: https://www.thebookseller.com/news/elsevier-records-2-lifts-revenue-and-profits-960016  https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science "With total global revenues of more than £19bn, it weighs in somewhere between the recording and the film industries in size, but it is far more profitable.

13i8id	Those who identify as 'woke' versus those who identify as 'anti-woke' are taking a shot at each other and social media platforms have algorithms that intensify the debate as that would imply more time spent on their platforms.  Fields of social sciences such as postcolonial studies are increasingly aware that many parts of history have been written with nationalism in mind thus started examining them critically. The issue is that even if nationalism is an old idea, it does empower people and makes them proud in their pursuits. Thus, while most such researchers are simply doing their job with intellectual honesty, they unintentionally disempower a group of white people who feel their power is being taken away from them. Since white people as a demographic is around 57% in the US right now and projected to further decline, this trend is likely to continue. The fact that men are doing worse and worse in college every year (https://www.wsj.com/articles/college-university-fall-higher-education-men-women-enrollment-admissions-back-to-school-11630948233) will not help with their bitterness. The woke movement is an easy target and the energy ends up being wasted debating that the new snow white movie has chosen an actress with too much melanin (if you don't believe me check out any video discussing this trivial piece of news).  Consequently, this trend is likely to continue or even snowball into the future.  Having said that, I hope I am wrong, and am open to being disproven.	1643195156.0	sd3i0s	/r/changemyview/comments/sd3i0s/cmv_the_cultural_wars_are_not_going_to_stop/	CMV: The cultural wars are not going to stop anytime soon.

1l3vw81m	I believe that “toxic masculinity” has both cultural and a biological/physical components, and should be treated as a complex issue.  I’ve seen several hundred debates, articles, and monologues where a man is condemned for their behavior, and this is 100% valid!  I am NOT advocating that they should get a pass.  However, I have not seen very many (if any) conversation around the effects of testosterone or other physical medical characteristics.  We discuss behavioral psychology, cultural indoctrination, etc., but where is the research or therapeutics that address chemical intoxication by sex hormones?  What harm would happen if someone was allowed to take hormones or blockers as a way to have more agency over themselves?  We take medicines to lower blood pressure, or to combat depression/mania, why not this?   Disclaimers:  I am not a doctor, nor even a medical student who knows where to look for this kind of thing.  This is entirely anecdotal, as a non-binary person I have had estrogen, testosterone, both, and neither coursing through my veins several times…the difference is real and significant.  When I say “masculinity” and “man”, these are meant to focus on one intersection of culture and biology, not define any identifying terms.  I fully acknowledge that there are folk who very authentically and correctly identify with the terms “man” and/or “masculine” and may have very low or no testosterone.  I’ve said this already, but in the hopes of avoiding the unnecessary discussion, I do NOT seek to excuse toxic behavior, only to express an interest in additional treatments.	1643199696.0	sd4qjz	/r/changemyview/comments/sd4qjz/cmv_toxic_masculinity_has_a_biological_component/	cmv: “Toxic Masculinity” has a biological component and should also have a medical treatment option.
gb3xu7s4	Necromancy and the undead are almost always considered straight up evil. Good people and holy men consider them abominations, and necromancers are to be hunted down. But why? If the night king from Game of Thrones used his army to build bridges, then zombies would've been fine. Paladins and clerics usually have a "kill on sight" approach. It's not **inherently** evil, it's just that writers like to make necromancers/undead the villains trying to do harm. What if I was a necromancer who created undead to clean trash from beaches? You might say, "I don't want you digging up grandma's body! It'll hurt my feelings". Ok fine, then I'll use bodies of people that nobody alive ever knew. "it's wrong to dig up the dead!" Ok what about cave men and pharaohs? I'll just use really old bodies. "We shouldn't dig up pharaohs and cave men either!" Ok what if I used animal bodies. "I want fido to rest in peace!" Ok what if I use road kill or slaughtered livestock or even wild animals that died of natural causes? The problem is how the undead are used, not an inherently evil aspect of their creation.
