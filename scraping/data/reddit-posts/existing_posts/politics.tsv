d5h4t	Welcome to the 'What happened in your state last week' thread, where you can post any local political news stories that you find important in the comments. This is a weekly thread posted every Monday, in order to facilitate more discussion on local issues on /r/politics. Since this is intended to be a thread about local politics, top-level comments that are exclusively about national issues will not be allowed. When commenting, please include the state you're living in, and don't forget to link sources. **Also, please actually describe what happened. Things like "I live in X, you know what happened", "Nothing happened" or "[Politician] continues to be an idiot" isn't helpful to users and will be removed.**  If someone from your state made a news round-up that you think is insufficient, feel free to comment to that round-up with further news stories. Enjoy discussion, and review [our civility guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/wiki/rulesandregs#wiki_please_be_civil) before engaging with others.  ---  Hi there, /r/politics. Because this thread is about local politics, I'd like to reiterate that **news about President Biden or any other national political figure is off topic in this thread and will be removed**.
