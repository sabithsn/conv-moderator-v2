5lpp7d52	So I recently moved jobs and started working at a start up, it has been 7 months now, I am the events manager and organize events for all the departments in the organization, amd work with different teams for their events. I have made a lot of friends and have made a place for myself in the org for being friendly and approachable.  So, 1 very senior person from the organization started texting me and we casually started chatting on and off regarding work, fitness, workouts, funny drunk stories etc etc and 2 months later ( in december) he asked me out to dinner and drinks and I thought why not and went out with him, there we got talking and had way too many drinks and were dancing and suddenly we were kissing and before we realized wat we were doing we booked the hotel room across the street and  we  hookedup, well we didnt go all the way but we went till 3rd base since i was on my period.  We talked and showered and again did stuff in the morning and then in the morning he tells me he is not emotionally available as he is stuck up on a gal he is seeing who moved to another city. He is not committed to her and neither is he willing to stop seeing her. Bcoz he has feelings for her but she is apparently leaving the country soon so it is pretty much a dead end. Then he told me it was nice wat we shared and he seemed a bit lost and he left after 1o mins i also left. Then we didnt talk much, we would see each other at work.  He pinged me and checked-in on me wen i was unwell 2 weeks ago and kept checking in with me about my health till i recovered and also kept asking me about my fitness and workout routines etc etc. We texted a bit. Then i asked him why he was closed off. He said he had a lotta shit to deal with and was really unsure wat to do in life.  I asked if he wanted to talk. He said some other time..so i said okay.  2 days ago, it was his work milestone and i organized a whole surprise virtual event for him and he loved all the things that were arranged and thanked me. And during the event i realized he has flown to another city to see the girl he is stuck up on, and i felt really bad. Tho i did not say anything. I just feel bad. I dnt know why.  I know i shouldnt have slept with the guy on the first date. But we were frnds for like 5-6 mnths it wasnt a 1st date officially It was a drunken escapede wat we did and i did not harbor feelings for him wen we hookedup. But now i feel bad / envious bcoz he does not want to date me.  Maybe some of y'all will say i am a dumb bitch, but guys i just had a mindless fling and did not know i would catch feelings. He is a genuinely nice guy, sweet, helpful, and caring. And now I dnt want to spoil our work relationship or you know be hurt that he does not have feelings for me. It is his choice and i respect his choice and emotions. It is okay if he does not reciprocate wat i feel  What should i do to get over him, i just dnt want to feel hurt knowing he is dating other people  Please share some suggestions, pls dnt share mean abuses	1642427062.0	s64cvg	/r/MensRights/comments/s64cvg/wat_do_i_do/	Wat do i do?

Here's the first chapter of the conclusion of the article where Kivivuori lists the problems of Feminist research on violence. Rest of the article can be found [here](https://journal.fi/tt/article/view/6878/5530?fbclid=IwAR0uED_Eh0kecA5gnfMZcJg05Vzb9S7oeiR8Agspp-BJ7X7IWPnTeDo7m4o) in Finnish.    > Ronkainen (2009, 454–455) has considered that there is no unified trend in Feminist research on violence. The view is incorrect. Feminist research on violence is unexceptionally cohesive ideological pressure group that, as a scientific trend, suffers from serious problems. These include internal inconsistencies, the replacement of truth criteria by appropriateness criteria, inability or unwillingness to perceive the difference between explaining and explaining away, deliberate contempt and disregard for international empirical research, active attacks on empirical sciences, the narrowness of the knowledge base, and the invisibility of existing large-scale research data.   Personally, I think it's nice that not all academics are afraid of the establishment and have the guts to say how things are even when it comes to taboo issues like this unbearably ugly side of Feminism.	1642445838.0	s6bpe2	/r/MensRights/comments/s6bpe2/an_article_by_a_leading_finnish_criminologist/	An article by a leading Finnish criminologist debunking Feminist lies about violence.

fbf6urqz	Dont get me wrong. I believe for a healthy functioning relationship, a man should always be given room to be in his masculine frame and for a woman to be in her feminine frame.  However that being said, there is a disturbing I noticed on the Internet and you can say this is related to Mens rights in a way with respect to the fact that men of today are literally shamed for being sexual in their relationship and especially marriage.  Lets just put 2 facts right out here :- 1) Women initiate divorces far more then men; Men have far more to lose in a divorce and 2) The amount of sex in a relationship drastically reduce post marriage.  Now im going to put a fact which has been summed up by multiple studies :- A mans biological imperative is to impregnate many women while a womans biological imperative is to make babies with the highest possible value man.  And now my last fact :- Society has deemed it normal that men are disposable and women, children and dogs can only be loved unconditionally and be given preference in every phase of life. if im quite honest, we got to put the blame on a lot of men who have been solely responsible for giving rights to women but with no accountability whatsoever for their actions.  When you combine all the facts above, its pretty clear that in a marriage, a man is expected to love his spouse unconditionally and cater to her demands but when you consider a woman, she is expected to do whats right for herself. This all has led to a trickle down effect of many women getting into marriages and then using men for their money and resources or cheating on them and leaving for someone else and leaving the man heartbroken and finances lost post divorce. Due to this, I believe its become the norm for a lot of women to shame their husbands whenever they ask them for sex. Women need to be held accountable to the fact that just like they are marrying a man for traditional benefits like status, money and resources, a woman should held her end of the bargain and provide traditional benefits like loyalty and regular sex.  &#x200B;  Even on a comment I made earlier on a sub reddit (feel free to check my profile for that)... i was shamed for advising the man to divorce his wife since he is not getting the end of the bargain in terms of love and sex from her.  &#x200B;  Sorry guys but this is a rant from my end, I really love and respect the mens rights in every shape and form but I do hope someday, society do hold women accountable as well to the benefits they are to provide to men when it comes to relationships and marriages. I believe society needs to eventually come up to the idea of respecting men in terms of their sexuality and worth in society or else civilizations will crumble.	1642446588.0	s6c0fj	/r/MensRights/comments/s6c0fj/why_is_male_sexuality_shamed_but_on_the_other/	Why is Male Sexuality shamed but on the other hand Female Sexuality is cheered by society ?

2wwr8	A man from the United Kingdom wrote in a private group that his ex wife has made false allegations against him and has obtained legal aid. She had no evidence and the police declined to arrest him, yet when he presented evidence of her abuse she was not charged and no action was taken.  Here is my reply to him in the hopes that it may help any person in a similar situation who may wish to seek justice:  I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.  You appear to allege that you and your children are victims of sexist discrimination.  If this is correct then it seems to me that false allegations which harm the parent child relationship are acts of domestic violence. I think that you are a victim. I think that your perpetrator is being given victim's services which are illegally being denied to you.  > The new definition of domestic violence and abuse now states: > Any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour,  violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality.

eqgdo	One of the big problems in society regarding gender equality is that research into gender is dominated by women and the feminist narrative. Of course they believe nonsense like patriarchy and toxic masculinity when they don't even look at the male perspective.  I'm a professional men's rights writer, and I often advocate for more men to get into these fields... but maybe I should put my money where my mouth is.  Here's the thing, though. I couldn't stand years of a PhD program listening to feminist propaganda, and I wouldn't even be able to get into one anyway if I said I wanted to study men's issues. I'd have to have a faculty advisor at least partly sympathetic to men's rights interested in supporting my research.  So does anyone know of any?

It is any group demanding privileges. Named after one of Napoleon's officers,  who after returning from conquests in Egypt formed a group that demanded  privileges in the law for military personnel. For 80-90 years the word  Chauvinism detonated **any** group demanding privileges in the law, until  the 1970s, when feminists attached the word "male" to the word "chauvinist" for the first time, and argued that there are  male-chauvinists, that is, men who demand privileges in the law for men. Feminism became so powerful since then that the "male"  was dropped and people started believing that chauvinism is somehow  tied to "men" by nature - but this is only feminist propaganda, reaching another tremendous victory in shaping minds, in demonizing men, and  in rewriting terms and history. **Any group** that demands privileges in laws and norms is chauvinistic and needs to be called chauvinist, this has nothing to do with the male sex in  particular. And currently, **feminism has become chauvinism** \- female  chauvinism, female, anti-male chauvinism - demanding privileges in norms and in the law. And therefore criticizing feminism including being anti-feminist when  feminism is chauvinism (female anti-male chauvinism), is not only not  "hating women", but **necessary** if one supports equality in human value and in rights.	1642537563.0	s76y9o	/r/MensRights/comments/s76y9o/when_a_woman_beats_a_man_it_should_be_classified/	"When a woman beats a man, it should be classified as men's violence against women," The Gender Equality Authority writes this in a handbook on "violence, gender and prevention". #FEMINISM_IS_CHAUVINISM, female, anti-male, chauvinism.

4abfhjfk	It takes five seconds to google the homicide rates for both genders, and to see that men are more likely to be killed in all countries in the world, but apparently, people are trying to do a psyop to make everyone think that women are killed more than men.   Everytime I see a feminist online and they are asked why they believed women are uniquely oppressed compared to men, they always say "women get killed more" or "men get killed less"  This is a **COMPLETE LIE.**   In the vast majority of countries in the world, men get killed at much higher rates than women. " According to the data given by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, worldwide, **78.7% of homicide victims are men**, and in **193 of the 202 listed countries or regions**, **men were more likely to be killed than women."**  So no matter where you live, chances are, more men are being murdered than women. That is an undisputable fact!   So if you say women are oppressed because we get murdered more than men, you are actually proving that men are oppressed.    **Link to my discord:** [**https://discord.gg/nntPBy8S2b**](https://discord.gg/nntPBy8S2b) join if you want to join a growing MRA server!	1642541994.0	s78o8f	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/	No, for the last time, men do not get killed less than women

d2kj1iug	This is institutionalised sexual assault and it is still rampant in America. It turns my stomach when people mention it so nonchalantly, “he slept through it”, “he got his snip”, “he’s grumpy after his circ”, etc, etc. This is all over sites such as TikTok and even here in Reddit.   Why the hell is this still acceptable? I don’t need to respect the “choices” of parents that took integrity away from someone else. I can’t fathom why this is still considered normal.	1642529305.0	s73qcx	/r/MensRights/comments/s73qcx/the_fact_that_male_circumcision_is_still/	The fact that male circumcision is still normalised is absolutely insane
bhp5hiqe	 So this is my first Reddit post, I’m not sure how this all works… not even sure if this belongs here. Posted this in r/sad a couple days ago as well. it’s gonna be a little long.                   I (31m) have a 4yo daughter (let’s call her Dee) and she is so awesome! It’s really cool being a dad and now that she’s here I wouldn’t trade her for the world. She is the best thing about my life now and makes me smile every day! That being said having a child w the wrong woman(drug addict)/before I was ready  basically ruined my life.                 I have always been a free spirit and love to travel the homeless hippie way. The world was mine for the taking and I loved the freedom and adventure! I’ve never believed that life was about money or the 9-5 slavery. I was my happiest without a penny in my pocket and the whole world to explore.         During a stint while I was back home in wv I had a fun night with a woman (we’ll call her J) I met in a bar that turned into a not-so-serious relationship. I made it very clear that I didn’t want kids for a long time and exactly why. J’s response was always that I would make such a great dad.         I always used protection but I caught her poking holes in the condoms!!!!! She became pregnant and again I reiterated that in no way was I ready to have a child. I was told it wasn’t my choice and that this was her chance to be a good mother.(she had previously had a child taken from her by the state for reasons I would later find out the truth behind.) it came out that she wasn’t sure that I was the father because she had been cheating on me with an old man for pills behind my back.          Despite it all I stayed with J and ‘manned up’-got a good job and all the baby things that you would need and a place to live and those such things. Due to her sneaking opiates behind my back while she was pregnant Dee was born addicted and premature and had to spend her first month in the nicu. She almost died on several occasions.            I was furious at J but stuck in there and was totally supportive of her path to recovery. She got worse and worse and became emotionally and physically abusive constantly. I don’t believe in harming women and also I’m kinda a little fella so things weren’t good at all.           I left her after she snatched me up by the neck and lifted me off my feet when I refused to give her any more money for pills. (For perspective I  don’t do anything but smoke a little greenery on occasion) Dee was about 1yo at this point. I took my daughter with me when I left and let J stay in the house while I moved back in w my dad.          Soon after J didn’t pay the bills and had to go live in her car. At this point she sued me for custody and WON with no home no job and a drug addiction. I was put on child support and had to send my sweet baby away to live in a car in the middle of winter. Her drug use moved to heroine instead of pills and she was shooting it and dealing with the worst kind of people.            She would date these total scumbags, dealers and robbers and call me to tell me my daughter had a new daddy every time. I honestly cried myself to sleep every night thinking about what she was putting Dee through. I ended up moving to Florida for a job and to distance myself from the pain a bit.         Soon after this my daughter pricked herself on a dirty needle in J’s car that they lived in. Mind you this whole time I was fighting the courts hard for custody and losing every time because ‘she’s the mother’. (The system truly is horrible to fathers) When I found out through hospital records what happened I finally managed to get custody. Dee was around 2yo by this time. SOMEHOW I STILL HAD TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT!!! (This was eventually sorted out but there’s thousands of dollars I’ll never get back) This money was going strait to a habit… but finally my sweet girl was safe and could be happy in a good place with people that truly care about her.          She’s almost five now. J has been in and out of jail constantly (theft, drugs, etc.) and only keeps in contact when she needs something from me. It’s been an amazing journey with my babygirl and once again I’d never give her up now that she’s here but….        Obviously being a single father I’ll never live the life I wanted. I’ll be working 9-5 for the rest of my young life trapped in one place living the life I never wanted to fall into. A sheep enslaved to the dollar bill barely making ends meet. To be clear I don’t resent my daughter for this at all. Do I resent her mother? Yes- 100 percent yes. She tricked me into having a kid, destroyed my confidence and sense of self, used me for her ‘second chance’ and pissed it all away for f**king dope.          I’ll never be able to live the live the life I wanted all because she wanted a child for her selfish emotional needs. Am I being selfish for thinking these things? I’m aware some of this may come off pretty entitled and I’m sorry for that. I love my daughter with all my heart and she is the most wonderful, awesome, smart, beautiful, and empathetic kid! But the point of this story is that you should never sleep with someone you aren’t willing to have a child with. WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY READY!!! Wait until you’re satisfied that you have done what you wanted in life and had the experiences that you’ll never have once you have a child because that child is always going to be the most important thing in your life after that point!          It kills me when I think about the life I could’ve had if I would’ve just kept it in my pants or been more selective. Am I wrong for feeling this way? It makes me feel so guilty when I think about my feelings on it all- but it’s whats inside my heart and no matter how hard I try I can’t get rid of that resentment. I don’t want to feel this way, I just wish I could be truly happy again without feeling trapped and controlled in a system that could give an f less about me. I feel like I’ll never be free again…. :edit:- formatting	1642520246.0	s70a7k	/r/MensRights/comments/s70a7k/my_experience_with_the_family_court_system_and/	My experience with the family court system and being bamboozled.

77lzul	**Cast**  **Me:** A feminist and a men's rights advocate who can only represent herself.    **An MRA**: A fictional men's right's advocate who represents no one, but who I hope will be more than a strawman.      \_\_\_  &#x200B;  **An MRA:** Do you think it’s OK to judge a demographic based on what a tiny minority do?   **Me:** Absolutely not.   **An MRA:**  So why are you demanding that all men have to change because of what a tiny minority of men do?   **Me:** I don't think I am demanding that. But I get the feeling you're trying to address something specific. What do you mean by that question?  **An MRA:** In reality, a vast majority of power and wealth is held by less than 1% of men. Over 99% of men dont have that power or wealth. But all feminists claim that all men should answer for the abuses of the first group of men, a minority.   **Me:** Okay. I think I understand now. If you'll indulge me, I'd like to separate out what you've said into two parts, because I want to find common ground and address the issues that you care about while also gently challenge the way in which you are also generalising a whole group of people.   First of all, what you are saying gives me the impression that you believe it is unjust for the majority of men to be characterised as problems when so many of the issues that we face as a society are rooted in class, and rich and powerful men are a minority. I couldn't agree more. To ignore how socio-economic class divides us and is harmful to our society, and by focusing solely on the gender of the rich and powerful is reductive and unhelpful. Feminists who are saying that are missing the bigger picture and perhaps we should educate more people about how class and gender, among other things, intersect in complex ways that shouldn't be reduced down to a dichotomy.   Second of all, you claim that feminists subscribe to this reductive and unhelpful view. I can't speak for any other feminist but myself, but I don't feel like this is true or fair. My partner is also a feminist and a mens rights advocate and I don't think he'd agree with this either. In fact, most of the feminists I listen to and learn from agree that class and gender interact in complex ways that shouldn't just be reduced down to "all men bad". In fact, most of the things I am saying here are coming from a school of thought known as intersectional feminism. I'm not denying that some feminists have said or do believe these things. I'm sure you could come up with many examples. But to say that *all feminists* believe this thing is reductive in a different way.   **An MRA:** ... This convesation isn't going how I expected.   **Me:** It rarely does when you're talking to real people. But that's okay. You don't have to agree with me. I care a lot about men's rights and men's issues and I consider myself a men's rights advocate. AND I care about women's issues and rights, and I consider myself a feminist. I know that most readers and posters on this subreddit consider feminism and men's rights advocacy to be like oil and water, never to reconcile. And that makes me sad because I believe that they have so many interests in common and should walk hand in hand. Call me niave, but I want to live in a world where men and women help each other, and that our liberation and advancement are mutual. Again, you don't have to agree with me. I know many don't.   Now I feel like I've done a lot of talking. And I can tell that this is a really important issue for you. Would you like to talk more about class and gender? It is a really worthy subject and there is always room for me to hear people's thoughts when they are presented in good faith.   **An MRA:** I know a great coffee place down the road...   **Me:** Excellent.

5lpp7d52	So I recently moved jobs and started working at a start up, it has been 7 months now, I am the events manager and organize events for all the departments in the organization, amd work with different teams for their events. I have made a lot of friends and have made a place for myself in the org for being friendly and approachable.  So, 1 very senior person from the organization started texting me and we casually started chatting on and off regarding work, fitness, workouts, funny drunk stories etc etc and 2 months later ( in december) he asked me out to dinner and drinks and I thought why not and went out with him, there we got talking and had way too many drinks and were dancing and suddenly we were kissing and before we realized wat we were doing we booked the hotel room across the street and  we  hookedup, well we didnt go all the way but we went till 3rd base since i was on my period.  We talked and showered and again did stuff in the morning and then in the morning he tells me he is not emotionally available as he is stuck up on a gal he is seeing who moved to another city. He is not committed to her and neither is he willing to stop seeing her. Bcoz he has feelings for her but she is apparently leaving the country soon so it is pretty much a dead end. Then he told me it was nice wat we shared and he seemed a bit lost and he left after 1o mins i also left. Then we didnt talk much, we would see each other at work.  He pinged me and checked-in on me wen i was unwell 2 weeks ago and kept checking in with me about my health till i recovered and also kept asking me about my fitness and workout routines etc etc. We texted a bit. Then i asked him why he was closed off. He said he had a lotta shit to deal with and was really unsure wat to do in life.  I asked if he wanted to talk. He said some other time..so i said okay.  2 days ago, it was his work milestone and i organized a whole surprise virtual event for him and he loved all the things that were arranged and thanked me. And during the event i realized he has flown to another city to see the girl he is stuck up on, and i felt really bad. Tho i did not say anything. I just feel bad. I dnt know why.  I know i shouldnt have slept with the guy on the first date. But we were frnds for like 5-6 mnths it wasnt a 1st date officially It was a drunken escapede wat we did and i did not harbor feelings for him wen we hookedup. But now i feel bad / envious bcoz he does not want to date me.  Maybe some of y'all will say i am a dumb bitch, but guys i just had a mindless fling and did not know i would catch feelings. He is a genuinely nice guy, sweet, helpful, and caring. And now I dnt want to spoil our work relationship or you know be hurt that he does not have feelings for me. It is his choice and i respect his choice and emotions. It is okay if he does not reciprocate wat i feel  What should i do to get over him, i just dnt want to feel hurt knowing he is dating other people  Please share some suggestions, pls dnt share mean abuses	1642427062.0	s64cvg	/r/MensRights/comments/s64cvg/wat_do_i_do/	Wat do i do?

The view is incorrect. Feminist research on violence is unexceptionally cohesive ideological pressure group that, as a scientific trend, suffers from serious problems. These include internal inconsistencies, the replacement of truth criteria by appropriateness criteria, inability or unwillingness to perceive the difference between explaining and explaining away, deliberate contempt and disregard for international empirical research, active attacks on empirical sciences, the narrowness of the knowledge base, and the invisibility of existing large-scale research data.   Personally, I think it's nice that not all academics are afraid of the establishment and have the guts to say how things are even when it comes to taboo issues like this unbearably ugly side of Feminism.	1642445838.0	s6bpe2	/r/MensRights/comments/s6bpe2/an_article_by_a_leading_finnish_criminologist/	An article by a leading Finnish criminologist debunking Feminist lies about violence.

fbf6urqz	Dont get me wrong. I believe for a healthy functioning relationship, a man should always be given room to be in his masculine frame and for a woman to be in her feminine frame.  However that being said, there is a disturbing I noticed on the Internet and you can say this is related to Mens rights in a way with respect to the fact that men of today are literally shamed for being sexual in their relationship and especially marriage.  Lets just put 2 facts right out here :- 1) Women initiate divorces far more then men; Men have far more to lose in a divorce and 2) The amount of sex in a relationship drastically reduce post marriage.  Now im going to put a fact which has been summed up by multiple studies :- A mans biological imperative is to impregnate many women while a womans biological imperative is to make babies with the highest possible value man.  And now my last fact :- Society has deemed it normal that men are disposable and women, children and dogs can only be loved unconditionally and be given preference in every phase of life. if im quite honest, we got to put the blame on a lot of men who have been solely responsible for giving rights to women but with no accountability whatsoever for their actions.  When you combine all the facts above, its pretty clear that in a marriage, a man is expected to love his spouse unconditionally and cater to her demands but when you consider a woman, she is expected to do whats right for herself. This all has led to a trickle down effect of many women getting into marriages and then using men for their money and resources or cheating on them and leaving for someone else and leaving the man heartbroken and finances lost post divorce. Due to this, I believe its become the norm for a lot of women to shame their husbands whenever they ask them for sex. Women need to be held accountable to the fact that just like they are marrying a man for traditional benefits like status, money and resources, a woman should held her end of the bargain and provide traditional benefits like loyalty and regular sex.  &#x200B;  Even on a comment I made earlier on a sub reddit (feel free to check my profile for that)... i was shamed for advising the man to divorce his wife since he is not getting the end of the bargain in terms of love and sex from her.  &#x200B;  Sorry guys but this is a rant from my end, I really love and respect the mens rights in every shape and form but I do hope someday, society do hold women accountable as well to the benefits they are to provide to men when it comes to relationships and marriages. I believe society needs to eventually come up to the idea of respecting men in terms of their sexuality and worth in society or else civilizations will crumble.	1642446588.0	s6c0fj	/r/MensRights/comments/s6c0fj/why_is_male_sexuality_shamed_but_on_the_other/	Why is Male Sexuality shamed but on the other hand Female Sexuality is cheered by society ?

2wwr8	A man from the United Kingdom wrote in a private group that his ex wife has made false allegations against him and has obtained legal aid. She had no evidence and the police declined to arrest him, yet when he presented evidence of her abuse she was not charged and no action was taken.  Here is my reply to him in the hopes that it may help any person in a similar situation who may wish to seek justice:  I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.  You appear to allege that you and your children are victims of sexist discrimination.  If this is correct then it seems to me that false allegations which harm the parent child relationship are acts of domestic violence. I think that you are a victim. I think that your perpetrator is being given victim's services which are illegally being denied to you.  > The new definition of domestic violence and abuse now states: > Any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour,  violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality.

eqgdo	One of the big problems in society regarding gender equality is that research into gender is dominated by women and the feminist narrative. Of course they believe nonsense like patriarchy and toxic masculinity when they don't even look at the male perspective.  I'm a professional men's rights writer, and I often advocate for more men to get into these fields... but maybe I should put my money where my mouth is.  Here's the thing, though. I couldn't stand years of a PhD program listening to feminist propaganda, and I wouldn't even be able to get into one anyway if I said I wanted to study men's issues. I'd have to have a faculty advisor at least partly sympathetic to men's rights interested in supporting my research.  So does anyone know of any?

But if you are a man who commits a crime against a woman, because you hate women, it'll be a hate crime. Worrying developments.

What has feminism actually done for men because seems to me feminism puts mens issues to the back seat while focusing on women but yet say they want equality.  Feminism doesn’t do anything to address the homeless situation with men.   Feminism doesn’t do anything about the suicide rate of men.  Feminism doesn’t do anything about domestic abuse shelters or victims of men.  Feminism doesn’t do anything with the false sexual assault allegations with men.

It is any group demanding privileges. Named after one of Napoleon's officers,  who after returning from conquests in Egypt formed a group that demanded  privileges in the law for military personnel. For 80-90 years the word  Chauvinism detonated **any** group demanding privileges in the law, until  the 1970s, when feminists attached the word "male" to the word "chauvinist" for the first time, and argued that there are  male-chauvinists, that is, men who demand privileges in the law for men. Feminism became so powerful since then that the "male"  was dropped and people started believing that chauvinism is somehow  tied to "men" by nature - but this is only feminist propaganda, reaching another tremendous victory in shaping minds, in demonizing men, and  in rewriting terms and history. **Any group** that demands privileges in laws and norms is chauvinistic and needs to be called chauvinist, this has nothing to do with the male sex in  particular. And currently, **feminism has become chauvinism** \- female  chauvinism, female, anti-male chauvinism - demanding privileges in norms and in the law. And therefore criticizing feminism including being anti-feminist when  feminism is chauvinism (female anti-male chauvinism), is not only not  "hating women", but **necessary** if one supports equality in human value and in rights.	1642537563.0	s76y9o	/r/MensRights/comments/s76y9o/when_a_woman_beats_a_man_it_should_be_classified/	"When a woman beats a man, it should be classified as men's violence against women," The Gender Equality Authority writes this in a handbook on "violence, gender and prevention". #FEMINISM_IS_CHAUVINISM, female, anti-male, chauvinism.

4abfhjfk	It takes five seconds to google the homicide rates for both genders, and to see that men are more likely to be killed in all countries in the world, but apparently, people are trying to do a psyop to make everyone think that women are killed more than men.   Everytime I see a feminist online and they are asked why they believed women are uniquely oppressed compared to men, they always say "women get killed more" or "men get killed less"  This is a **COMPLETE LIE.**   In the vast majority of countries in the world, men get killed at much higher rates than women. " According to the data given by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, worldwide, **78.7% of homicide victims are men**, and in **193 of the 202 listed countries or regions**, **men were more likely to be killed than women."**  So no matter where you live, chances are, more men are being murdered than women. That is an undisputable fact!   So if you say women are oppressed because we get murdered more than men, you are actually proving that men are oppressed.    **Link to my discord:** [**https://discord.gg/nntPBy8S2b**](https://discord.gg/nntPBy8S2b) join if you want to join a growing MRA server!	1642541994.0	s78o8f	/r/MensRights/comments/s78o8f/no_for_the_last_time_men_do_not_get_killed_less/	No, for the last time, men do not get killed less than women

bhp5hiqe	 So this is my first Reddit post, I’m not sure how this all works… not even sure if this belongs here. Posted this in r/sad a couple days ago as well. it’s gonna be a little long.                   I (31m) have a 4yo daughter (let’s call her Dee) and she is so awesome! It’s really cool being a dad and now that she’s here I wouldn’t trade her for the world. She is the best thing about my life now and makes me smile every day! That being said having a child w the wrong woman(drug addict)/before I was ready  basically ruined my life.                 I have always been a free spirit and love to travel the homeless hippie way. The world was mine for the taking and I loved the freedom and adventure! I’ve never believed that life was about money or the 9-5 slavery. I was my happiest without a penny in my pocket and the whole world to explore.         During a stint while I was back home in wv I had a fun night with a woman (we’ll call her J) I met in a bar that turned into a not-so-serious relationship. I made it very clear that I didn’t want kids for a long time and exactly why. J’s response was always that I would make such a great dad.         I always used protection but I caught her poking holes in the condoms!!!!! She became pregnant and again I reiterated that in no way was I ready to have a child. I was told it wasn’t my choice and that this was her chance to be a good mother.(she had previously had a child taken from her by the state for reasons I would later find out the truth behind.) it came out that she wasn’t sure that I was the father because she had been cheating on me with an old man for pills behind my back.          Despite it all I stayed with J and ‘manned up’-got a good job and all the baby things that you would need and a place to live and those such things. Due to her sneaking opiates behind my back while she was pregnant Dee was born addicted and premature and had to spend her first month in the nicu. She almost died on several occasions.            I was furious at J but stuck in there and was totally supportive of her path to recovery. She got worse and worse and became emotionally and physically abusive constantly. I don’t believe in harming women and also I’m kinda a little fella so things weren’t good at all.           I left her after she snatched me up by the neck and lifted me off my feet when I refused to give her any more money for pills. (For perspective I  don’t do anything but smoke a little greenery on occasion) Dee was about 1yo at this point. I took my daughter with me when I left and let J stay in the house while I moved back in w my dad.          Soon after J didn’t pay the bills and had to go live in her car. At this point she sued me for custody and WON with no home no job and a drug addiction. I was put on child support and had to send my sweet baby away to live in a car in the middle of winter. Her drug use moved to heroine instead of pills and she was shooting it and dealing with the worst kind of people.            She would date these total scumbags, dealers and robbers and call me to tell me my daughter had a new daddy every time. I honestly cried myself to sleep every night thinking about what she was putting Dee through. I ended up moving to Florida for a job and to distance myself from the pain a bit.         Soon after this my daughter pricked herself on a dirty needle in J’s car that they lived in. Mind you this whole time I was fighting the courts hard for custody and losing every time because ‘she’s the mother’. (The system truly is horrible to fathers) When I found out through hospital records what happened I finally managed to get custody. Dee was around 2yo by this time. SOMEHOW I STILL HAD TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT!!! (This was eventually sorted out but there’s thousands of dollars I’ll never get back) This money was going strait to a habit… but finally my sweet girl was safe and could be happy in a good place with people that truly care about her.          She’s almost five now. J has been in and out of jail constantly (theft, drugs, etc.) and only keeps in contact when she needs something from me. It’s been an amazing journey with my babygirl and once again I’d never give her up now that she’s here but….        Obviously being a single father I’ll never live the life I wanted. I’ll be working 9-5 for the rest of my young life trapped in one place living the life I never wanted to fall into. A sheep enslaved to the dollar bill barely making ends meet. To be clear I don’t resent my daughter for this at all. Do I resent her mother? Yes- 100 percent yes. She tricked me into having a kid, destroyed my confidence and sense of self, used me for her ‘second chance’ and pissed it all away for f**king dope.          I’ll never be able to live the live the life I wanted all because she wanted a child for her selfish emotional needs. Am I being selfish for thinking these things? I’m aware some of this may come off pretty entitled and I’m sorry for that. I love my daughter with all my heart and she is the most wonderful, awesome, smart, beautiful, and empathetic kid! But the point of this story is that you should never sleep with someone you aren’t willing to have a child with. WAIT UNTIL YOU ARE FINANCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY READY!!! Wait until you’re satisfied that you have done what you wanted in life and had the experiences that you’ll never have once you have a child because that child is always going to be the most important thing in your life after that point!          It kills me when I think about the life I could’ve had if I would’ve just kept it in my pants or been more selective. Am I wrong for feeling this way? It makes me feel so guilty when I think about my feelings on it all- but it’s whats inside my heart and no matter how hard I try I can’t get rid of that resentment. I don’t want to feel this way, I just wish I could be truly happy again without feeling trapped and controlled in a system that could give an f less about me. I feel like I’ll never be free again…. :edit:- formatting	1642520246.0	s70a7k	/r/MensRights/comments/s70a7k/my_experience_with_the_family_court_system_and/	My experience with the family court system and being bamboozled.

77lzul	**Cast**  **Me:** A feminist and a men's rights advocate who can only represent herself.    **An MRA**: A fictional men's right's advocate who represents no one, but who I hope will be more than a strawman.      \_\_\_  &#x200B;  **An MRA:** Do you think it’s OK to judge a demographic based on what a tiny minority do?   **Me:** Absolutely not.   **An MRA:**  So why are you demanding that all men have to change because of what a tiny minority of men do?   **Me:** I don't think I am demanding that. But I get the feeling you're trying to address something specific. What do you mean by that question?  **An MRA:** In reality, a vast majority of power and wealth is held by less than 1% of men. Over 99% of men dont have that power or wealth. But all feminists claim that all men should answer for the abuses of the first group of men, a minority.   **Me:** Okay. I think I understand now. If you'll indulge me, I'd like to separate out what you've said into two parts, because I want to find common ground and address the issues that you care about while also gently challenge the way in which you are also generalising a whole group of people.   First of all, what you are saying gives me the impression that you believe it is unjust for the majority of men to be characterised as problems when so many of the issues that we face as a society are rooted in class, and rich and powerful men are a minority. I couldn't agree more. To ignore how socio-economic class divides us and is harmful to our society, and by focusing solely on the gender of the rich and powerful is reductive and unhelpful. Feminists who are saying that are missing the bigger picture and perhaps we should educate more people about how class and gender, among other things, intersect in complex ways that shouldn't be reduced down to a dichotomy.   Second of all, you claim that feminists subscribe to this reductive and unhelpful view. I can't speak for any other feminist but myself, but I don't feel like this is true or fair. My partner is also a feminist and a mens rights advocate and I don't think he'd agree with this either. In fact, most of the feminists I listen to and learn from agree that class and gender interact in complex ways that shouldn't just be reduced down to "all men bad". In fact, most of the things I am saying here are coming from a school of thought known as intersectional feminism. I'm not denying that some feminists have said or do believe these things. I'm sure you could come up with many examples. But to say that *all feminists* believe this thing is reductive in a different way.   **An MRA:** ... This convesation isn't going how I expected.   **Me:** It rarely does when you're talking to real people. But that's okay. You don't have to agree with me. I care a lot about men's rights and men's issues and I consider myself a men's rights advocate. AND I care about women's issues and rights, and I consider myself a feminist. I know that most readers and posters on this subreddit consider feminism and men's rights advocacy to be like oil and water, never to reconcile. And that makes me sad because I believe that they have so many interests in common and should walk hand in hand. Call me niave, but I want to live in a world where men and women help each other, and that our liberation and advancement are mutual. Again, you don't have to agree with me. I know many don't.

86f1jsgs	 I'm not looking to generalise and say this is true of all male subs, neither am I looking to kinkshame. I don't know how common these behaviours are but having looked at the BDSM community on and off for a number of years (not as a participant, just an observer), it seems to me that extreme behaviours seem to be engaged in more than what would be expected.  My morbid curiosity took me to investigate this community, and on the surface there are light acts of playful sadomasochistic behaviour, underneath that the acts go very far into the realm of "should this be allowed?"  For instance, I have seen men have needles pushed through their testicles, and I have seen a man be kicked in the nuts until he was coughing blood.  The most recent example of this extreme BDSM that I have seen is this: (Warning - Disturbing - Graphic) [https://np.reddit.com/r/GrossCutters/comments/s7oekb/extreme\_bdsm\_circumsexual\_pornographers\_continued/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrossCutters/comments/s7oekb/extreme_bdsm_circumsexual_pornographers_continued/)  Here a man is being "circumcised" by his girlfriend. She has no medical training and appears from her comments to have learnt what to do from the internet. As the comments in the post read, she has done an extreme operation and it is likely that the man is going to suffer erectile dysfunction because of it. The purpose of this "circumcision" was to make his penis as numb as possible, an un-moveable dildo.  If you were to search the internet long enough, I'm sure you would be able to find videos of men being castrated for their sexual gratification.  We often hear about how women in these communities are pushed to do extreme acts and exploited, but my question is, who is looking after the men? Who is ensuring the men's wellbeing? Who is making sure that their mental health is sound before they engage in these extreme behaviours? How can we be sure that the men are, as it is assumed by most, not being exploited? (Especially when money is a factor in this business.)  It also appears to me that the acts of sadism towards men in these communities is commonly more extreme than that towards the women, but I have never heard anyone raise concern about them in mainstream culture. Should there be limits placed on these acts? Should limits be placed on the type of acts that are allowed to be exhibited on the internet of this nature? It seems to me that the community is somewhat lawness as it pertains to men.  What do you think?	1642619452.0	s7xt5c	/r/MensRights/comments/s7xt5c/i_have_observed_the_bdsm_community_break_its_own/	I have observed the BDSM community break it's own rules when it comes to being "safe, sane, and consensual" in relation to male subs, just wondering what you guys think.

aiqzz5wx	The use of the phrase "Toxic Masculinity" is in and of itself toxic; in all circumstances, no matter how well intentioned the user is. The behavior of people can be toxic, not genders, not races, not social or economic classes. A person's identity should NEVER be labelled toxic.  "Toxic masculinity" is the sex-based equivalent of anti-Semites claiming that "Jewish Greed" led to the holocaust. It is like a racist saying "I'm not racist, they're just 'one of the bad ones'", after calling a black person the N-word.  It is a hateful and manipulative term that is designed to always blame and shame men. Don't claim you want to help men and then say "we need to tackle your toxic masculinity!", "men's toxic masculinity is the problem", "men would be happier if they stopped perpetrating toxic masculinity".  No, no and NO. **You are essentially victim blaming, or gas-lighting men** into believing they are the problem. When you say men's toxic masculinity is a problem, you are telling a group of human beings that their natural identity is an issue.   **Blaming men for their "toxic masculinity" is a sexist slur.**  Masculinity is a good thing, it's not something to be ashamed of. It's not something that needs to be removed. Masculinity ought to be celebrated and embraced.  Stop using this hate filled phrase. Encourage others to stop using it. Speak up about the harm this phrase causes.	1642648285.0	s88krq	/r/MensRights/comments/s88krq/the_use_of_the_phrase_toxic_masculinity_is_in_and/	The use of the phrase 'Toxic Masculinity' is in and of itself toxic

ch81q55l	When society discusses the 'patriarchy', they focus on traditional female roles. They discuss how women were expected to stay home all day taking care of the children, doing housework etc.  No one discusses how men were expected to find the highest paying job they could get, no matter how grueling. Majority of jobs throughout history have been dangerous labor jobs, where men were expected to work outdoors in harsh and dangerous conditions all day, being verbally (and sometimes even physically) abused by their bosses.  Thankfully, due to changing times, the idea of the traditional female role is changing fast. Yet unfortunately, men are still expected to be the breadwinners no matter what. Men make up 93% of workplace deaths, and continue to work the harshest and most grueling jobs. While women are being freed from traditional roles and expectations, men are still bound to their traditional roles, which is why the men's movement needs to be much bigger than it currently is.	1642653294.0	s8a84q	/r/MensRights/comments/s8a84q/the_struggles_of_traditional_male_roles_are/	The struggles of traditional male roles are ignored

Clearly trying to sell men on coming in and cleaning up their messes.    I have nothing but respect for step dads/parents, so don't get what i'm about to say twisted..  But how about we start promoting picking a good parent for your child to begin with? Somebody you have actual compatability with.  How about picking the man you friendzoned for 3 years over the Chad that you just met in the club and got knocked up by later?  How about we promote not just leaving a marriage or relationship just cause you're bored of the person or want something new? How about longevity and perseverance?  How about we promote not cheating on people and try to appreciate and promote monogamy cause its good for our children.  How about we stop using people to get your "dream life" and leaving them later when you realize you never even liked them, you just wanted "that life"?  How about we stop letting outside people advise us on our relationships when they aren't in it and don't understand it how we do? And then allowing those opinions *ruin our damn relationships*.    How about we stop criticizing our partners over dumb things that don't matter and overthinking everything (90% of reddit advice pages)?  *how about we talk about fixing root causes and not talking about what kind of bandaids we can put on our lives when we screw it up.

ffbvjlt3	In german media ranging from entertainment to news, there is a rising tendency to paint women as primary victims of violence. Especially sexual violence and intimite partner violence is highlighted while explictly stating that women are most affected.  I took a look at the 2020 (the latest available) criminal statistics seperated by age and gender made by the Bundeskriminalamt (BKA, the official german agency dealing with crime). Available [HERE](https://www.bka.de/DE/AktuelleInformationen/StatistikenLagebilder/PolizeilicheKriminalstatistik/PKS2020/PKSTabellen/BundOpfertabellen/bundopfertabellen.html?nn=145488) in german.  First, the total number of crime victims of all categories:  |*Category*|*Total*|*Men*|*Women*|*Men/Women (%)*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Total Crime Victims|1.011.462|594.531|416.931|59%|  Secondly, the BKA defines a category called "Violent Crime" (key 892000). This category includes the following crime definitions:  &#x200B;  |*Category*|*Total*|*Men*|*Women*|*Men/Women (%)*| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Hostage Taking 234000|38|22|16|58%| |Extortionate Kidnapping 233000|93|68|25|73%| |Dangerous Bodily Injury 222000|159.196|115.864|43.332|73%| |Bodily Injury w. Deadly Consequency 221000|102|69|33|67%| |Robbery and Blackmailing 210000|38.804|28.343|10.461|73%| |Rape, Sexual Coercion, Heavy Sexual Assault 111000|9872|546|9,326|5.5%| |Homicide 20010|1.975|1.413|562|71%| |Murder 10000|1.117|651|466|58%| |Violent Crime in Total (Including all of the above)|211.216|146.982|64.234|70%|  Based on this numbers, the vast majority of violent sexual crime is commited against women while all other violent crime is significantly affecting men more. In my perspective, this is media cherry picking this particular statistic to paint women as primary victims (whih they are in this particular category), yet men are clearly mostly affected overall. Not to take away from victims of rape, thats a terrible to experience, but i think a more adjusted view on this in the media would be appropiate, given that these statistics are freely available.  EDIT 1: Also notably, the ratio of *Rape, Sexual Coercion, Heavy Sexual Assault 111000 to* total violent crime is 4.4%.	1642696781.0	s8n2m1	/r/MensRights/comments/s8n2m1/victims_of_violent_crime_german_statistics_2020/	Victims of violent crime: German statistics 2020

I was raped by a grown adult women at the age of 5. It was my 18 year old step sister. (she was MORE then old enough to know what she was doing.) It is one of those things that I think about every once in a while. I didn't know what happened until I was in my teens and realized that I was molested. I was way to young to know what I was doing and what was even happening. And still remember details vividly.  She has young kids now and a big family. And we babysit my nieces and nephews. I want to say something to my loved ones and my parents but I haven't had the heart to... If I do, I feel like it would rip my family apart. I also honestly believe that people in my family would not believe me if I did say anything. I guess I just don't know how to go about it with telling people... should I keep it to my self?

2v9ngucp	[The defeat of feminist buffet in South Korea / Political correctness war between men and women | H&S](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlfSx1-B2sY)  The translation subtitle is pretty terrible, for example when the word patriarchy appears, it actually meant Men's right. The video is made by Taiwanese ((I think their purpose is to encourage Taiwanese men by showing example of their neighbor Korea, since Taiwan had became a feminist shithole)), if you could understand the language it's a good watch.  Basically, the South Korean men are very united, almost the entire country goes MGTOW mode after Korean women in general became the most radical Feminist in the world ((how radical? Basically they officially promote killing male babies to reduce male population in order to gain voting leverage)), and use every Feminist argument against themselves but even stricter. And soon Women in general realize under this strict rule they can't take the pressure themselves.  For example if a photo consist more Men than Women, the Feminist immediately scream misogyny, so the Men's right than propose they'll remove the photo, but if they ever see a photo that had more women than men, that is misandry and is totally unacceptable.  Another example if a TV comedy show makes joke about women, Feminist scream misogyny, than the men's right came in basically saying if the same show ever dares to make a single joke about men, then they will boycott the show entirely. Soon the show producer cannot sustain itself to the pressure and collapsed.  The same goes for relationship and marriage, when Feminist demand equality, if a woman would expect a man to pay for dinner, that man breakup with her. There is a soft rule in Korea if you propose more than three time, that's sexual harassment, so the men immediate stop propose and stay single. Soon women find they are the one that actually needed marriage. The only reason traditional men wish to marry are most due to pressure from traditional family value, the feminist basically destroyed the only chain that imprison men, soon men find themselves actually favor marriage free.  In this total egalitarian status women begin to realize it's themselves at disadvantage, then the feminist group begin infighting because of different interests among different class of women, watch the video if you are interested in the topic.  \-----------------------------  Trivia, the word "Feminist buffet" in the video's title is a catchy word that's becoming increasingly popular recent year in Taiwan. Basically it describe how Feminists operate on a basis that they only pick what they like and leftover what they don't like, when it came to picking "Privileges" and "Responsibility", its like eating a buffet.  The beauty about men's rights movement is that no matter which culture you are from, or which political spectrum you are from, we could all come to understanding. Korean men had done a astonishing job, respect to them.	1642732491.0	s8zt0i	/r/MensRights/comments/s8zt0i/a_very_interesting_video_about_mens_right/	A very interesting video about Men's right actually beating Feminist in South Korea

3lflo5z1	I was reading http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/ (NSFW content on the site) it's a website about how sex with an intact penis is better for both the man and the woman. However I kinda felt like it focuses so much on women and comparatively very little on men, even though men were tho ones with their genitals altered. I haven't read much of the book but on the third page the author who is a woman writes (slightly paraphrased) "foreskin has a dramatic effect on male sexual pleasure but a doubly dramatic effect in female sexual pleasure". Don't know how she can quantify it like that, she's female and has no idea how it feels as a man.

There are a few easy examples:  Body positivity for women who are clinically obese, but shame men for being less than 6’0” tall or for their penis size (confirmed or speculated).  Women are 100% independent, but it’s acceptable to only seek men who are wealthier than them.  Women should be treated equally, so they need to be advantaged by policy.	1642754118.0	s9674j	/r/MensRights/comments/s9674j/feminism_and_no_true_scotsman_logical_fallacy/	Feminism and “No True Scotsman” Logical Fallacy
itgxeyq1	A couple of days ago, I was having a conversation over dinner with my wife. The conversation turned to an acquaintance she would go to concerts with every now and again, and she explained to me how she actually stopped contacting her because of her behavior.  You see, her friend would often, unprovoked, feign fear and disgust with men standing near her on public transportation or walking by her. She would use terms like "creep" and "perv" freely, despite them not even looking at her.  I think it brings up a really important observation: just like not all cases of sexual assault are brought to the police, not all false accusations are made to the police. The number of false allegations shared between women unbeknownst to the accused is tremendous. The social media posts, messages scribbled on bathroom walls, and vocalized accusations are even *more* likely to be false than those taken to the authorities, as at least when an accusation is taken to the police, there is an (astronomically small) chance that the woman making it will be charged with a false police report.  These are examples of words I've had directed at me that were well into false accusation territory:  * A feminist once said that if I were an MRA, I must actually be a closet rapist. This happened in person in front of other people.   * When I asked a woman on a date twice, she spread a rumor that I was "pushing boundaries" and being "creepy." I was nothing but courteous and polite with her, but she flat-out lied about my behavior (such as saying I called her 11 times overnight; I never called her) to raise her own social status.   * When I was in high school, a female classmate accused me of masturbating in class. She just blurted it out. She said I was doing it in my pocket. Why? Again, there's absolutely no accountability. Girls are seldom punished for their bad behavior.  Many men, despite being completely innocent, are falsely accused in the manners above. I was accused of being a rapist, a stalker, and of public masturbation. Feminists enable such women by saying that they *must have had their reasons*.	1642751006.0	s95g6q	/r/MensRights/comments/s95g6q/the_underaddressed_and_overlooked_kind_of_false/	The under-addressed and overlooked kind of false accusation

2qffj9lv	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34997197/  Abstract:  > Non-therapeutic circumcision refers to the surgical removal of part or all of the foreskin, in healthy males, where there is no medical condition requiring surgery. The arguments for and against this practice in children have been debated for many years, with conflicting and conflicted evidence presented on both sides. Here, we explore the evidence behind the claimed benefits and risks from a medical and health-related perspective. We examine the number of circumcisions which would be required to achieve each purported benefit, and set that against the reported rates of short- and long-term complications. We conclude that non-therapeutic circumcision performed on otherwise healthy infants or children has little or no high-quality medical evidence to support its overall benefit. Moreover, it is associated with rare but avoidable harm and even occasional deaths. From the perspective of the individual boy, there is no medical justification for performing a circumcision prior to an age that he can assess the known risks and potential benefits, and choose to give or withhold informed consent himself. We feel that the evidence presented in this review is essential information for all parents and practitioners considering non-therapeutic circumcisions on otherwise healthy infants and children.  #r/Intactivism	1642770687.0	s9afgu	/r/MensRights/comments/s9afgu/what_is_the_medical_evidence_on_nontherapeutic/	What is the medical evidence on non-therapeutic child circumcision?

4rx3hoya	As reported in *'Spiked',* 16th Jan 2022, Scotland's top prosecutor, Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain QC, wants juries removed from rape trials. In this decision, she has been guided by feminist research carried out at Glasgow University by Fiona Leverick, who believes that the public do not have the correct attitude towards such cases, urging that they be decided by 'trauma-informed' judges alone *\[see Daily Record 27th December 2021\].* Her arguments can be found in detail *\[Leverick : The Institutional Journal of Evidence Vol 24, issue 3, 2020\].* They make dismal reading for men. Ms Leverick is part of The Scottish Feminist Judgements Project (SFJP). This organisation *"re-imagines the processes and outcomes of judgements in key cases, in a manner that is more attentive to issues of gender inequality and power dynamics."*  As reported by William Collins in *'The Empathy Gap',* pages 708-729, numerous suggestions have been made by women's advocacy groups to increase the number of rape convictions. First, there was the suggestion to 'train' juries in rape trials, prior to commencement of proceedings. Unsurprisingly, the 'training' was to be carried out by the lobbyists. Now, it seems, we cut to the chase, and remove the jurors, leaving only the judges to be 'educated' towards increasing the conviction rates. South of the border, MP Ann Coffey has been calling for abolition of juries in rape trials for years, due to rising rate of acquittals..... ignoring the fact that these were *caused by rising levels of false allegations!*   Coffey states: *"The most common cause of unsuccessful prosecutions in rape cases is jury acquittal. Jurors are reluctant to convict young men."* Here, she is using the Prosecution definition of 'success' - ie conviction. She has no way of knowing how 'successful' juries are. Success is more properly judged as a correlation between their verdict and the truth. There seems a presumption that all men are guilty, an imposition which will be easier to achieve following jury removal, and feminist indoctrination of judges. Had she taken the time and trouble to inspect the reduced conviction rates, she would have found this due to the *increased volume of weak cases going to trial, due to pressure by women's groups -* figures which were deliberately fudged by the CPS, in a blatant dissimulation. In fact, it was the uncovering of these figures, and the modus operandi of the CPS which stimulated William Collins to write his book.  Make no mistake - this is coming, a second-class 'justice' for men. It will be posited as a progressive measure to help rape victims. It will be enthusiastically implemented as a means of dealing with court backlogs caused by Covid-19, and cutting costs. Together with this week's amendment on the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill, where the Lords voted 242 - 185 in favour of categorising misogyny as a Hate Crime, there seems little to protect the basic rights of men in today's criminal justice system.	1642782883.0	s9ere8	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ere8/no_juries_for_rape_trials_in_scotland/	No Juries for Rape Trials in Scotland

1oqnlj5x	Update:   A week ago, I posted a [story](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s3ne57/marital_rape_also_include_men/)  about my friend, and now I'm updating with some latest developments and the whole story. I urge all to read and spread the word. Every man should read the story before deciding to get married. I apologize for my English; it is not my native language.   My friend works in an IT company and earns good money. He also works on some freelance projects as well. His life took a rough turn in his early adulthood, completely changing his personality. His father was paralyzed, and he was the sole breadwinner of his family, but he managed very well and became successful.    He used to go to the same coffee shop every morning before going to the office. There was a girl (waitress) in the coffee shop. She imitated the casual conversation and exchanged her number, and soon they became friends. They started dating, and he came to know that the girl was barely making a living. He proposed to her, and the friendship turned into a relationship. She was eager to marry him. My friend bought an expensive diamond ring and gifted Audi at the wedding. He also bought a new home in an affluent area. He also planned for the honeymoon, but they cancelled the plan because of COVID restrictions. In short, the girl who used to buy clothes from the thrift stores was now wearing Armani suits, Christian Dior sandals, and Gucci bags. When the initial euphoria faded, the problems started arriving.    That bitch acted like she owned his wealth from the first day and had to earn more to prove himself as a good husband. Even though she was a cult feminist and taught about women's rights. After a year, she started complaining about not having a baby. They both went to a gynecologist and fertility specialist, and the reports were satisfactory. Doctors recommended that they should wait. After the marriage, she stopped working and never looked for a job because he was earning good money, and they even hired a maid for house chores. He took her to Bali, Koh Samui, and many more places where the covid restriction were easy, hoping that she would somehow admire him. Eventually, she skipped making dinners (the one job she did for a while). So, my friend spends his whole day in the office, coming home and preparing dinner or taking her out for dinner to have some good night romance. She wasn't doing a damn thing in the house. Just enjoying her fantasies and dreams on his credit card. He was one of the most incredible guys (pussy) and never complained. She started refusing to have sex with his husband. He took her to a marriage therapist and paid godamn $500 per session. But turned out that she was taking advice from her feminist company and refused to go to the therapist. One day, she yelled that she would consider this a marital rape and go to the police if he ever touched her again. He completely broke at that time; I know he was even crying. So I offered him my shoulder and advised him to separate his bed. So, he took some extra freelance projects, and after dinner, he started working and slept in a separate room. One day she was furious at him and accused he was looking at porn. So, he took the laptop and slept on the same bed. She asked him to stop using the laptop and started using the phone. He used to play games.   When she noticed that he had stopped the craving entirely for sex, she started wearing yoga pants, revealing clothes to provoke him, but I strongly advised him not to fall into the trap again. One day she started kissing without his consent, so he did the same and refused and said that this is marital rape as well. She could not bear the same treatment and slapped him right on the face; for the first time, he slapped back. That night she called her friend, and they went to the police to charge him for domestic violence. The police refused to charge him because she started the fight; her friend gave the most stupid argument that he slapped her harder. She threw her husband and ATM out of his house. He shifted to his friend's house and even apologized to his wife. When I came to know the whole situation, I was furious at my friend. I knew she was a predator, but why he was acting like a pussy.    I took a leave from my work and explained the whole god damn thing. I asked him to show his bank statements and joint-credit card bills; I was utterly shocked. That bitch was draining his money. I explained to him that 90% of his money was going to his wife since he married her. He was working the whole day, paying her bills and preparing meals just to have sex, which he rarely gets the chance. He promised me that he wouldn't go to his house for a week and brainstorm about his future. I also gave him Xbox, and we arranged a room in his friend's motel because my house was far from his workplace, and the motel was the best option. He also blocked his credit card and changed his phone number.    After two days, I was surprised that bitch sent her friend to my home to persuade my friend to come back home. I asked her to get the fuck out here and never come back. The next day his wife came to his workplace and yelled like a mad dog. She even blamed that my friend his impotent and couldn't have a baby. I have seen his penis and sperm count results. This was my friend's boiling point, and he lost all respect for her. His boss arranged a divorce lawyer for him because he went through the same in his life. He took a leave from office and went straight to a divorce lawyer.   Here comes the shocking part. The lawyer said no matter how long he stretches the court case (six months or a year). My friend will surely lose half of his savings and assets. The lawyer was a good friend of my friend's boss, that's why he told everything in advance. Even if his wife hires an attorney, he would have to pay the fee for the attorney, which is almost 500$-700$/hr. And he even bought the house in the name of his wife, which obviously will make him homeless. The only good thing is that he won't be entitled to child support because they don't have any children. The lawyer said to him to take some time and then conclude. So, I took him to the motel and bought a can of beer and said, that's it. You have a decision to make. No matter what you choose, I'll be here for you. After an hour, I received the call, and he said that he was going for the divorce and ready to give half of his wealth to that bitch. I've heard many stories about men who lose everything in the family courts, but hearing straight from a lawyer was pretty shocking for me.  Lessons to learn   * How a lovely romantic marriage can end up losing half of your assets in just two years. You will have to offer everything just for a pussy. * Your wife is not entitled to return the car, gifts, and money you gave to her.  * You enter a wedding trap a ring and end up losing what you earned in your whole life.  * The marriage is a complete surrender for men. She stays, she goes, or you stay or go, no matter what you do. You have to pay. You will surely lose.  * Marriage is just a business for women.  * Before falling into the romantic relationship and marriage trap, keep in mind you have to pay. You will lose everything in the end.

3ngbcdr3	I don't know any man who cannot do things like change a flat tire. Many of us pay for roadside assistance. This covers anything from jump-starting a flat battery, to changing a tire, to being towed away if your car stops in the middle of nowhere.  I have never called such a company (even though I am paying for the service) to change a flat. Maybe I will do it one day if I am dressed up in a good suit and have to get to a meeting looking spotless.  Recently I was with a friend and we got a flat and he called his company to come and change it. I was surprised when I heard the conversation at the other end (it was on speaker phone). The guy at the other end told my friend ''we're very busy tonight, you're a man, can't you change it yourself?''  I started to cringe and I think my friend was made to feel as if he should cringe too because he was convinced to change tyres himself (well, we did it together).  Meanwhile, several women have told me that they found their cars with a flat while they were in their garages - and the roadside assistance companies actually visited them at home in their own garages to change a flat. I must admit that I did not look at the contracts very carefully - but a roadside assistance company is meant to help you when you get in trouble on the road, not when you are at home in your own garage.	1642789008.0	s9h4di	/r/MensRights/comments/s9h4di/the_sexism_against_men_when_roadside_assistance/	The sexism against men when roadside assistance is required.

3ngbcdr3	I found a news item about an inmate for a crime related to drugs. It is known that a good percentage of inmates use their time to work on their careers once they leave prison.  This man had been working as a talent spotter for local football clubs and he continued his work from inside the prison. He had a TV in his room and he also kept a note book. A female police inspector who specialises in child abuse suspected that he was a paedophile - because he kept the names of young teens in this notebook!   These teens were all boys involved in football. He wrote down information about each boy and he also had some photos (I suppose they were photos of them playing football).  Since the police inspector cannot accuse this man of having done anything illegal, she managed to find a loophole. He had used a database from his previous place of work to get their parents' details so that he could contact the parents. But he had broken a data protection law in the process.

2v9ngucp	This post could be pretty messy, I apology first  The word "enemy" here is a metaphoric term, I am not in anyway promoting aggressive behavior, we are a peaceful community but we will defend our belief if we have to.  I've been having some deep thoughts lately as to why are misandry so persistent and prevalent (outside of this community of course), if you actually take time to read subs like *TwoXChromosomes* , the pattern is pretty clear, its basically lies supporting lies, with enough numbers of people and louder voice, lies became the perceived "truth". No matter how logical and truthful you are, if you are in a group that had less numbers and are mostly silenced, you basically stands little chance of combating discrimination.  First let me get one thing straight to avoid misunderstanding. There is nothing WRONG with using the word "Feminist", since the feminism ideology is **one of** the main contributor to Misandry, which ultimately leads to the everyday discrimination we are facing.  But by only discussing the root of the problem might not addressing the currently situation, Its like we are in a middle of a Chess game, and we can't just magically start the game over, we will have to figure out the next step within the current composition, feminism won't just magically disappear, if you get what I mean.  There are downsides by ONLY using the word "feminist"  1. Misandry could happen before feminism is even a thing, misandry could have been as long as human existed, in a nutshell although feminist **having a better chance** of becoming a misandrist but not all misandrists are feminists 2. Most average misandrist don't even identify themselves with any ideology let alone feminism, just look at *TwoXChromosomes*, just how many of these people have any knowledge of what feminism even is? And there are rare instance where people that do identify as feminist actually supports men (I know its sound crazy, but there ARE even though rare feminists that actually do believe in equality), one example I came to mind is Cassie Jaye the producer of Red Pill Movie. Heck, even Warren Farrell used to be feminist. 3. But we can't just use the word "Women" either because this is overly generalizing and keeping potential ally out of our doors, we really need any support we could get, including Women who supports us, its a numbers game after all. By saying stuff like "Woman hate us" we significantly increase the chance of aiming at the wrong people.  **But there is one thing we could be undoubtedly sure of, our true enemies are universally the Misandrists.** They don't have to identify as any ideology, they don't have to be in any political spectrum, they just simply hate men due to their own bias, heck they don't even have to be women. And *FemaleDatingStrategy* is the testament of what I've just said, trust me, even some feminists will not want to associate themselves with this level of garbage.  As trivial as it might sound, we would have to take one step at a time, and the first thing is that we need more supporters, by changing the way we address our enemy, it might not be much in the short term, but it could give us significantly more ally in the long term. Because what we are doing now is basically **Aiming more accurately towards our true enemy while avoiding possible friendly fire or collateral damage as much as possible.**  I remember last year, when I introduce men's right to one of my best female friend who consider herself a feminist that believed in true equality, when I explained to her our concept she 100% agreed and supportive, but after she start browsing some of the online MRA communities, she start feeling disconnect "I really wanted to help you guys, but I just don't know where I fit into" she told me.  I mean clearly she is a feminist, but she is not a misandrist.  \--------------------------------  What those toxic misandrist community often lies about us is by depicting us as a community that exist solely for bashing feminists, so maybe if we actually use the word misandrist, then we are not bashing feminists, because that is what we actually meant in the first place: **We are combating discrimination against men as gender by putting counter argument towards the Misandrists that disguise themselves as other ideology in reality are just wolf wearing sheep's cloth.**  And by claim that, I assume even feminists couldn't disagree with that argument.	1642816617.0	s9r7ge	/r/MensRights/comments/s9r7ge/we_should_start_using_the_word_misandrist_more/	We should start using the word "Misandrist" more when we are addressing our enemy
4zyym	There is a huge moral outrage with people seemingly competing to condemn Prince Andrew. His offences would seem to be on the low end of the scale i.e. having sex with a 17 year old girl (only an offence in a few states, not in Britain). He may not even have known about the trafficking the responsibility for which should be placed at Epstein's door.  Everyone seems to be ignoring that his accuser, who has already accepted $500 000 and agreed not to take further action, actively trafficked underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein and was probably more than happy to get flown around the world and consort with royalty and the very rich. IMO she is guilty of more than he (Andrew) is. But very few people are talking about that.  Now, I have watched several youtube body language "experts" presenting their "analyses" of his interview with Emily Maitless. To no one's surprise, the conclusion is usually to the effect that the secret signs prove he is a warlock and should be burnt, and most of the comments follow with same sort of judgement.   However, none of "experts", at least none of the ones I have seen, have done the obvious scientific thing and compared his body language in that interview to his body language on other occasions. They are in effect making interpretations in the dark, like doing a drug test without using a control group.  If they had watched other interviews, they would have seen all the same gestures. You can see Andrew being interviewed about his engagement to Sarah in 1986 [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2NnvxNkPOU )  (jump to 6:11). He displays all the gestures which "experts" are interpreting as showing he was lying in the Maitliss interview, although here he is only talking about his engagement to her.  It seems to me that his problem is simply that he is mis-matched. This is when your body language is not consistent with your actual emotions. Malcolm Gladwell talks about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LaG25gdJog)   My feeling is that some of the people jumping on the burn Prince Andrew bandwagon are the same as those people, like Andrew O'Keefe, who go on about abuse of women before being outed as abusers themselves. It's projection.  I also wonder whether the problem of being mis-matched may result from being trained to project a particular public image from the time you can first walk.	1642818633.0	s9ruy6	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ruy6/the_new_moral_outrage_prince_andrew_body_language/	The New Moral Outrage, Prince Andrew, Body Language Experts

7np0uhh7	Hello everyone,  To begin with we would first need some background. First of all I just wanted to highlight few laws which discriminate men in India and are widely misused to extort money from them. Yes, extortion industry in India is very huge.  First law is IPC 498A : Which protect wives from cruelty, sexual abuse from husbnad & his family. The law which is biased and made on assumption that only wives faces cruelty and husbands don't. No evidence is needed just statement from wife is required to arrest anyone from the family from husband.  Trial can go upto many years. 90% of cases register under this act turned out to be false because it encourages wives to extort money from husband & his family, here's how : once 498A is registered women is entitled to maintenance and can't live with husband. She can skip the hearings which make cases to last more longer and husband to pay more to the wife. Wife after filling this case don't attend hearings and enjoying lifetime free income. Child custody always given to wife because husband is accused of cruelty. India have seen 70% rise in suicide rates by married men. It encourages extrotion industry and main source to earn for lawyers, judges and women.  After observing by courts that this IPC is getting misused, court orders police not to immediately arrest husband and his family. After that wives are filling IPC 377 along with 498A. 377 is also for married wives if husband forces them for unnatural sex. Wives demanding lifetime income to drop the charges because getting bail in India is no easy. Btw, again no evidence from accuser is required and no initial investigation needed.  Now for unmarried men : IPC375 & 376 , law to prevent rape. This law is also for one gender i.e. women. But the only problem of this law is it's definition and evidence act it follows. If a women accuse any men of rape, she don't need to undergo any medical examination and accused has to prove that he is innocent. The burden to prove his innocence is on accused. There is no law in the world like this. Also, in a relationship if a women have consensual intercourse with men then she can also file this case while saying the man has obtained the consent by promising me of marriage. In other world we call it breakup but in India we call it rape. Sex means you have to marry her. Hence, another misuse of law.  Sorry for long write-up, but now feminists in India are demanding IPC 375/376 to be applicable for married women while they already have recourse to file for cruelty in section 498A and 377. This is draconian law because it make any man to go under trial without investigation and evidence. Which means first it is not gender neutral and second, men has to prove his innocence and no evidence is required to accuse someone with 375/376  The men in India only want to fix this law by first fixing evidence act. Second by making it gender neutral. Since court has already denied it now men have no option but to boycott marriage. This is the reason why #MarriageStrike is trending in India.

dmt0p	1) Disregard of facts  This is perhaps the most obvious characteristic of many feminist texts - and yet something most people ignore. There is [a great book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53052177) on the "applied postmodernism", which explains how this side of Feminism, at least in academic circles, is a feature not a bug.  2) Disregard of a balanced view  In the book [The Right to Sex](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56347680) an Oxford professor argues that men have all the power in sexual relationships and force, via patriarchy, women to submit to sex. A balanced view would point out that women are gatekeepers of sex and as such have much more power in sexual relationships. This lack of a balanced view and, thus, fairness is typical to feminist texts.   3) Resentment  [Feminist writers tend to be angry and bitter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34640834-down-girl). We live in patriarchy and thus everything wrong.  And why wouldn't it be when you are fed with the views described above?	1642870564.0	sa6p4k	/r/MensRights/comments/sa6p4k/after_reading_several_books_related_to_feminism/	After reading several books related to feminism, here is a view on what is typical?

142kre	I'm currently in the middle of a divorce in the USA. I'd prefer not to go into too much detail, but suffice to say, my son is with her only because I didn't want her to involve the police and make things ugly for my son, which she absolutely would have, and being that I'm a man, and she's got her other son so twisted around he's completely against me and would lie for her (has already done so), I'm sure they'd side with her. She was pretty emotionally and verbally abusive to me the majority of the time we were married. Lots of wearing down, gaslighting, bait and switch tactics, etc. Eventually I was spending as little time at home as possible to avoid her.  Right now, I only see my son every other weekend, and occasionally in the evenings when I have time to drive an extra hour (she has to be civil around her parents, so at least that's a plus). I call him every night, but she hovers, probably to make sure I don't tell him the truth or anything.  She's presently living in her parents' home, intentionally doesn't have a real job of any sort, she sees child support for her other 2 children falling off completely this year, and so now she's going after me for something like 1000/month. That's almost a third of my income.  Obviously, given the situation (and some details I'd rather not mention at present), I'd much rather have primary custody of my son, but I'm sure that'd look ugly to the court, so I'm going for 50/50 shared custody. If she needs funds to take care of him while he's there, she can get a job; she's fully capable.  She has a lawyer (under 'indigent' aid), but I can neither afford one outright (lowest retainer I could find was 8000), nor qualify for public aid programs. I found a lawyer who is eager to take the case, but he's that one with the lowest retainer (and that's after offering me a discount).  I'm hoping this is the right place to ask; does anyone here have any advice on finding finance options for this? My credit score isn't great, very low 600's according to Experian and a bit under 6000 according to Credit Karma. I can of course afford to pay a loan down, I just don't presently have a way to get that much money together at once.

Camille Paglia has already noticed this. For girls, we create a patriarchal society to explore women and they use this to put in our hands ALL their sadness. They cancel ex-boyfriends when a relantionship broke, and the society is totally inclined to embrace women version (including men). To be a heterosexual man these days is to be politically incorrect. Society is totally fucked to us. Drunk girls can't consent to sex and we must discern for them. If the girl says she was too much drunk, man... you can go to jail and could be a RAPIST!!!

8hmqmcpg	Men catch a lot of flak for being more shallow than women, meaning that they put a lot of emphasis on one thing, physical attractiveness, when seeking a partner.  The subtext of this criticism is that the core of one’s physical attractiveness (skeletal structure, especially facial appearance) cannot be changed, and therefore, it’s wrong to reject people for not possessing something that’s difficult for many to achieve.  Some may claim that it’s because “they have so much more to offer other than looks”,  but if good looks were easier to achieve (not born that way), I seriously doubt this “more to offer” would result in this same level of criticism of shallowness.  Why then, is it considered inherently better for women to hold a plethora of standards for men?   Even though it’s not shallow, it’s actually more difficult to meet those standards…	1642904677.0	saismy	/r/MensRights/comments/saismy/subtext_of_criticizing_men_for_being_shallow_and/	Subtext of Criticizing Men for Being Shallow, and Why not Being Shallow can be Worse
8tg60gqq	So I (20M) met her (20F) like 3 months ago in a club, we kinda turned into a fuckbuddy thing more than a fwb cause we really wouldn’t hang or talk outside the bedroom.  Last night I had a few friends going out to the clubs, I was invited but I knocked it back cause I had plans to grab a few beers with another mate. I’m also extremely exhausted from work cause a lot of my coworkers were in covid isolation over the last two weeks so i’ve been working nearly 90 hours a week for the extra money.  So my plans with my mate falls through last moment, and I message my fwb asking if she’s free tonight. She says she’s out clubbing but she’s a bit sick of the people she’s with and will be home early. Ok sweet. I said to not get too drunk because I wouldn’t feel comfortable if she was that incapacitated.   Anyways she texts me at like 10:30 pm saying she’s on her her way home. I ask her if her house is free or do we want to do it at mine (she lives with her parents, i support myself) and she says there’s no one home. Anyways I call an uber and when i get into the uber and going she sorta apologises and say actuslly her friends are staying over snd I said that’s okay but like I don’t wanna meet them or whatever, like as long as they’re out of the way, etc etc   Anyways i get there and I got to knock on the door and I hear like a bunch of people laughing and having fun etc. Should of gone home here cause I was instantly not comfortable with this but idk i soent too much on the uber anyways so I thought eh maybe they’re just having drinks or whatever and i get to avoid them.  Anyways I come inside and like they know a lot about me… What I do for work, where i’m from, what my dad does for work (??), my name, my dick size (red flag - but at the time i thought nothing of it cause i bring my own size condoms around cause no one expects it lol), what i study, that i’m bisexual (still very closeted about it, got bullied quite badly in highschool for being suspected gay so only a small group of people know). I should of left here but idk i stayed for some reason.  So we kinda get chatting, they had pizza and drinks there so I help myself. It was Triple J hottest 100 in Australia where the public broadcaster does a Radio show of fan voted top 100 songs of the year. People usually get by a pool and drink summer drinks so i’ve been drinking in the sun for like nearly 12 hours at this point. It kinda gets flirty and I kinda get quiet. I’m trying not to reciprocate and send any signs because I am (a) not comfortable in this situation, (b) not comfortable in the situation their insinuating  So i’m visible uncomfortable here. My fwb asks me if i’m alright. I say yeah it’s fine cause i don’t wanna disappoint her, just wasn’t expecting this. Long story short I end up in bed with the three of them. Worst sex of my life.   I don’t know what happened, I wasn’t comfortable with the situation but I didn’t say no. I don’t know why or how, it kinda makes me feel sick talking about it. I felt and do still objectified about it. Idk why I assured my fwb that I was okay with this, I wasn’t. It didn’t feel right.  I feel guilty cause she asked me, but I still said yes. But i can’t shake it out of my head how her friends knew so much about me, how she told me the house was empty. I go to call an uber home afterwards but it’s $80 so I sleep in the bed.   I woke up at 6am and caught the first bus home. I have a shower and try to catch up on some sleep but idk I just feel awful. I sent my girl-friend (two seperate words) a message after it happened but she was sleeping.   She saw my messages when I just got on the bus and told me I need to get out of there. She’s been SA’ed before in a much more traumatic way so I feel bad talking to her about it cause I feel like i’m triggering her. I don’t know if i can talk to my friends about this. I got an older friend (25M) who I feel like I can talk to but he’s on a hike and doesn’t get back till tomorrow.   I just don’t know how to feel. I assured my fwb that I was fine but I can’t help to think she put me in this situation on purpose. She’s told me before she’s been interested in a threesome and I told her I wasn’t, even if i’m bi so i feel like she might of planned it.  My girl-friend told me to cut her off ASAP and I will. But idk I just feel weak willed and ashamed  This got removed off /r/AskMen by the automod so I posted here.

8bd2oyqc	About 8 months ago I got diagnosed with stage 4 non hodgekins lymphoma. It turned my whole life upside down, but one of the strangest things was seeing the treatment I’d get from people around me, or peoples reactions. I constantly get stares, horrible looks. I know that I look very odd, not having eyebrows eyelashes or any hair at all, but people will just straight up point at me from 5 feet away and I’ll hear them saying something stupid about my cane or whatever I have with me, mostly women. Now that I’m cleared to work out and start my recovery I’ve been going to the gym. Gym bros I’ve never met in my life have no problem spotting me, helping me, just hanging out and including me in general. They aren’t offput by all the intense disfigurement and strange look I have now. Women on the other hand give me unbelievably scornful looks at the gym. Some of them just straight up laugh and point when I’m struggling to just lift the bar. Or a particularly frustrating situation have been women telling me that it’s really not that bad, because breast cancer kills women every day. I still have no idea what that means. A lot of support groups, free physical therapy, therapy for cancer patients, all that come to find is only accessible to women. Not all of them obviously, but it’s intensely frustrating to try to find help, and to be turned away because I didn’t go through a “normal” cancer like breast or ovarian cancer. Has anybody else experienced this? Am I just overanalyzing this?	1642945432.0	saty7y	/r/MensRights/comments/saty7y/my_most_direct_experiences_with_misandry_were/	My most direct experiences with misandry were when I had cancer

8hmqmcpg	Creating a stickied thread to compile examples of casual prejudice against men would be more effective in painting a picture of what we face.  A recurring issue I encounter when attempting to explain issues that negatively affect men, is people latch onto specific examples that I point out, instead of only speaking in the abstract.  It’s a catch-22; if I speak in generalities, opponents push back with the typical “not everyone is identical” argument, but if I stick to real life specific examples, they nitpick any little aspect of the story that is less than prejudiced against men, as proof that none of it was prejudiced.  If we could send people a link that’s just a barrage of examples, it would essentially bypass their ability to nitpick, because even if they tried, there would be too many examples to deny the overall picture.	1642956918.0	saxzvo	/r/MensRights/comments/saxzvo/stickies_thread_for_examples_of_casual_prejudice/	Stickies Thread for Examples of Casual Prejudice Against Men?

1w4xzamq	Dear All,  I am posting this message to solicit signatures for a coalition Title IX complaint against Cornell University.  The federal complaint challenges discrimination on the basis of sex in college admissions, residential spaces, scholarships, professional clubs,  medical services, academic departments, et cetera. Men are now a minority in colleges and our diverse coalition hopes to eliminate affirmative action for the female majority. The complaint has been signed by 199 individuals so far -- including think tank presidents, authors,  professors, lawyers,  activists. Signatories include Jordan Peterson, Warren Farrell, Christina Hoff Summers, Peter Wood, Cynthia Garrett, Harvey Silverglate, Paul du Quenoy, Amy Wax, Andrew Miltenberg, Janice Fiamengo, Lawrence  Alexander (among many others). Glenn Reynolds [covered the complaint in this opinion piece.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/02/12/colleges-universities-discriminate-men-title-ix-complaints-toxic-masculinity-column/2831834002/)   You can read the amended and final version of the complaint here: [https://www.scribd.com/document/554289896/Coalition-Complaint-Amended](https://www.scribd.com/document/554289896/Coalition-Complaint-Amended)  Every signature matters. All my work is *pro bono* and I had to engage in a hunger strike lasting for 32 days to pressure the United States Department of Education into investigating Yale University for discrimination against men. To sign the coalition complaint, please email me at [titleixstudentadvocacy@gmail.com](mailto:titleixstudentadvocacy@gmail.com). Please indicate your most recent/advanced college degree and the name of your alma mater. I welcome all comments and questions, even from those who do not wish to sign the complaint. The petition is private and signatures will be shared with the Department of Education, not with the press.

dmt0p	Patriarchy is a social system. Not the way feminists describe it, of course, but world used to be and still is in some parts divided into clans led by "fathers", patriarchs. So, patriarchy is a thing.  It's also true that men have been in control of most of the world for thousands of years.   Why?  Most westerners, living in their air-conditioned houses, sitting at their computer, don't understand what it takes to survive on this planet.   For millions of years surviving has been a battle where the strongest and meanest have survived.  Or so would you think.   Somehow, like in a miracle, humankind has not only survived but we have managed to create - in some parts - a civilization of prosperity and freedom.  How did that happen?  Feminists say that we live under patriarchy. If so, patriarchy has created this miracle.  Me?  I have studies history so much that I don't believe in simplistic explanations, the way feminists believe.  But, yeah, somehow it was indeed men who managed to turn the tables, create these oases of hope where freedom and prosperity prevails.  I don't want to say that this the new great narrative that we should embrace. I don't want to say that women played no part in all this.   But patriarchy? If you just change your perspective little, shouldn't we be amazed?

1qaa0i25	I don’t know what to flair this.   Most of my friends, if not all, are female. I’m 22M.   Why do I feel guilty about talking to my female friends about my mental health? Why do I have fear that they’re going to use it against me in the future, even though they’re supportive of me now?  Well, because it happened. A few times actually. One is on-going (ish) and one happened last week.   I’ve been friends with this girl for a year and she deleted me off of Facebook. The reason? Well, idk. I told her I was psychotic and I wasn’t really talking to many people because I didn’t trust anyone at the time. The response? “Ok then. Bye.”, so I go to her profile and she’s deleted me. So I just blocked her.   The other girl, well, her and I talk on a daily basis, but only when she wants to? If that makes any sense? Like okay, I have her on snap, right, so she’ll send me morning streaks and night streaks but leave me on read otherwise, even if I send her another snap she’ll leave me on read. I’ll give her credit, she will respond if I ask for her help, and I’m not blaming her; in fact, I’m thankful for her. She has a really stern way of helping but it helps nonetheless.   But there was this one time where I mentioned I was trying to better myself. I had a bad panic attack a few days later, messaged her saying I need help, and was immediately told “didn’t you say you wanted to get better?” and I responded “am I not allowed to have bad days?” And she goes “you are. It was just a question.” I feel bad, I mean, I know I shouldn’t have said that but it just hurt.   Even my mom does this shit sometimes. She’ll complain about men all the time. (Okay this one isn’t really about “health” but it’s relevant). She’ll blame me or my dad for mundane things. She’ll literally go “you men and your” whatever. Or “jeez, you men!”   “You men don’t understand the beauty of” whatever   We just got a cat, her name is Gigi, my dad calls her “g-spot” (cause why not, it’s funny) and my mom, on *his* Facebook feed, goes “her name is NOT g-spot, it’s Gigi! Jeez, men!”  Everything is always about her, otherwise it doesn’t matter. Whenever I try to say something, she’ll strike it down with “oh yeah, well what *you’re* doing is wrong”. When I say “I had a rough childhood” she’ll go “pfft, *you* had a rough childhood?” Then proceed to tell me everything about her childhood and make me feel like the asshole for even bringing it up.   I’m not allowed to feel emotions, I’m not allowed to be angry, sad, happy, anything. No matter what I do. She even accused me of being mad at her when I said nothing was wrong. I literally had to call her and tell her to stop the attitude, and that I was fine.   “Oh I can tell somethings wrong, you’ve got resting bitch face” okay. Cool.   “You’ve been so moody recently, why don’t you tell me what’s wrong?”  I tell her nothings wrong   “Yes there is, I can tell” what? I’m literally telling you, face to face, *I’m fine*. What more do you want?   But anyway. Back to my original point. I feel guilty talking to girls about my issues, like I feel like they just don’t care. I don’t have any guy friends, and I haven’t had a “boys” hang out in a year, I haven’t hung out with the boys in forever. But I don’t have any.   Idk, I feel more comfortable talking to girls but not about my issues. My doctor is female, my psych is female, all of my friends are female. They don’t care about my feelings. I’m a man, I’m supposed to man up, right?   On the topic of psychs, you know how awkward it is to tell a doctor or psych of the opposite gender how you’re feeling? Like I know I literally just said I feel more comfortable talking to girls and whatnot, and I’m probably contradicting myself, but I’d rather have a male doctor than a female doctor. I had to tell my former female psych about my erection problems. You know how fuckin awkward that was for me?  Let me answer your question right now (if you’re even reading this far, honestly I don’t blame you if you’re not reading this anymore. It’s a mess): I don’t have easy access to psychs or therapists. I need to be referred because I don’t have insurance, and if I’m referred by a doctor, all appointments are free. The only downside is wait times. I had to wait literally 4 years, if not more, to get a psych. All of high school and grades 7-8, so more than 4 years. I only got what I got because that psych was a friend of my GP. But yeah. I live in Canada. Sure, it was free, but I’d rather pay the $200/session or whatever and get help right away than wait years and years, only to be told “it’s all in your head” thanks I know, you diagnosed me with schizoaffective. Now apparently I don’t have it. And I had to switch psychs because my old psych was moving to a different province and stopping her practice, so I had to wait a long time again to get this psych that I was told I wasn’t supposed to get because I don’t live in the city, I live in the country. The funny thing is, my current psych has a number I can text or call, and an email I can email. But I can only text or call her during business hours Monday-Friday (so no weekends or nights when I need people the most) and she doesn’t check her email until the appointment, and even then she told me not to email her. So idk.   Sorry. I rant when I’m upset. I don’t blame you for not reading this. It kinda just spiraled anyway. Thanks for reading if you do read this. I need support from other men I guess.	1642975494.0	sb59td	/r/MensRights/comments/sb59td/why_is_my_mental_health_not_being_taken_seriously/	Why is my mental health not being taken seriously?
hjmjlozw	We seem to constantly be bombarded by info and complaints about the so-called ‘pink tax’; the idea that women have to pay more to live at the same standard of living.  A lot of this idea is rooted in the additional and supposedly inflated costs for menstrual products, clothing, and other cosmetic upcharges, etc.  However, I’d argue that men are under greater financial duress constantly, ignoring lifestyle factors that cause even greater financial burden (I.e, addiction, hobbies, etc.) and other factors men face (divorce, lower spending [women spend a lot of men’s income]).  Even ignoring all that, men:  - Consume 25% more calories and thus spend much more on food  - Spend more on car insurance (women constitute more crashes per capita but men drive way more for work and such)  - Spend more on life insurance due to earlier death  - Spend more on gas, vehicular maintenance, etc. due to driving habits often driven by employment needs   - Men are much more likely to have hair loss problems at an earlier age, which can lead to expensive treatment regimes  - Sneakers cost much more for men than women  - Men pay more in taxes and get less tax credits (tax credit discrepancy still exists if income is equalized)  - Bars/clubs often cost more for men than women due to special discounts dished out for women  - Disability insurance costs more for men  - Etc.  I’m not advocating for men getting special treatment or anything I just think it’s important to keep in mind that men pay more for a lot of things out of their control- the Blue Tax is a lot more real and uncontrollable than the pink one imho.	1642972256.0	sb3zrj	/r/MensRights/comments/sb3zrj/the_blue_tax/	The ‘Blue Tax’

8390y6bv	I'm only 20 years old, but I already find it so fucking hard being a man and especially when your abuser is your own mother. I've been following this sub for some time, and within that time I've come to the horrifying realization that the narrative will always be pinned against me. As long as I'm male and my abuser is female, courts will always be biased against me. The public will always be biased against me. If it's revelaed that I was the true victim and that my mom has always been the agressor and the abuser, most likely that still won't change the biases people have placed against me. People will always go through the extreme mental gymnastics to have me take accountability for someone's abuse onto myself. It got me thinking back on all the times my mom made police threats, and if those threats went through how I was almost close to facing this battle even when I was too young to know how unjust the system is.  Some background: I live with my mom and grandma, my dad abandoned me before my birth, I've endured a lifetime amount of abuse from my emotionally and physically abusive mother. I had behavioral problems when I was younger and went through a lot of corporal punishments that extended past the typical belt whoopings. As early as 8 years old, my mom - 300 pounds - would sit on me - a scrawny ass kid at the time - to keep me from running away from her while she punched and whooped me. I held my arms up to block her blows and to try to push her away from me so I can get out from under her. She'd grab my wrist and bite the side of it hard enough to have me screaming and crying and forced to keep my arms at my side and away from my face while she needed to do what she had to do. When it still seemed like my behavior needed to be corrected, my mom found a power over me in the form of knives. From age 8 to 13, my mom threatened to either stab me or herself as a disciplining tactic. She'd chase me around the small apartments we lived in with knives varying in size from a stake knife to the kind of knife you see Michael Myers carry. She'd hold the knife close to me to get me to stop crying because 'I'm too emotional to be a boy' and that she can say what she needed to say without me running away.   Cut to me at age 13, I was going through the typical puberty stages most boys went through at that age: becoming taller than their mother, becoming biologically stronger even if I was still skinny, and having longer arms for longer reach. This was before I was aware of how much I was growing and this night in particular made me realize that. My mom was coming at me again with the typical - either belt whoopings, punches, pushing me back, or all three - and I was instinctively defending myself as I did since I was 8. Now, this was the age where it was no longer "acceptable" for me to defend myself. Because I was taller than my mom and my arms were longer and stronger, I was better at keeping my mom away from me by pushing her back. I never pushed my mom again after this night, which you'll come to know why, but when I did it was never violent. I never pushed her hard enough to have her tumbling back or having her back hit against the wall nor the floor. I softly pushed her away as I was backing away to maintain the distance between us, except my mom kept advancing and I had no choice but to keep pushing her away.   Later that night, my mom called me into her room. She was sitting at the edge of her bed with the house phone in her hand. She was contemplating calling the police on ME and telling them I pushed her. She was even crying, playing victim, and saying things like 'What do you think they \[the police\] will do if I told them my son pushed me? Do you really want to grow up abusing your mother like you did tonight? Do you want to treat your wife like this when you're older??' Looking back I realize this is my mom emotionally abusing and gaslighting me, but at the time I genuinely thought I was being abusive and I was crying, praying to never grow up to be the kind of guy to hit their mother and wife, any woman for that matter. I think at that moment my mom found a new hold over me: police threats. For all the times following after when she physically assault me, I never pushed her but I still instinctively raised my arms up to block myself from her. She'd either have a fist or a belt, or both, in one hand and a phone in the other, and threatened to call the police if I didn't put my arms down in the next five seconds. That way, she can still keep hitting me without me blocking any of her attacks. My defense system was taken away and I was at my most angriest when I just had to stand and take the abuse, cause she even threatened to call the police if I ran away or hid from her and even flinched when she raised her fist. She'd even tell me to stand up if I was hit to the ground or if the pain was just that unbearable, or else that would be another police threat. I would just stand there, trying not to cry cause that would be another police threat right there, with my hands at my side balled into a fist. She'd notice this and always said 'What you balling your fists for? Are you going to hit me? Do you want to hit me?' and just make the assumption that I was on the verge of punching her which would incline her with more police threats.  I'm going to leave a link for Pt 2 when I post that soon.	1642981936.0	sb7ol7	/r/MensRights/comments/sb7ol7/my_abusive_mothers_history_of_making_police/	My abusive mother's history of making police threats, Pt 1

h394ibm1	Personally, I never understood it. Like, duh straight guys love to see and check out hot girls. How is that abnormal?  I mean unless they act creepy, predatory or just very wrong around it. I see not even a single problem about guys checking out girls' bodies.  Girls can do it too, you know. But this is just my opinion.  What do you think?  EDIT: Guys please don't be misogynist with the "chad" parts. It's true, it's a bit annoying that women have much higher dating standards compared to guys. However, that doesn't mean they don't get a choice or an opinion towards guys checking out(especially if these guys "gaze" too long) Same with guys towards women and "female gaze"  For me, I really don't care whether they allow a handsome man to check them out while an ugly man not to do that. But I care when feminists are being misandrist and making this weird term "male gaze" even though both genders do it.  EDIT2: Guys please don't use incel terms and ideology, we have to be better than feminists. Also I understand male gaze now, it's still total bullshit but now I get that it's related to art more than it's related to the actual world.	1642987642.0	sb9oli	/r/MensRights/comments/sb9oli/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_male_gaze/	What do you guys think about the "male gaze"?

a1yxamy8	Hi people, the monosphere made me believe that not getting on tinder was due to female selectivity or that they are extremely shallow.  https://preview.redd.it/enthrugzzjd81.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe72b42a1d005d89a7ec5de989e2a02d4d1b0d8  With that idea in my mind I got a little upset, I even thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life because of the high superficiality.  But I started to question that 80/20 rule and I said: And how many male and female users are there in the app on which the app was based? no one in the manosphere asked that question, and bingo:  https://preview.redd.it/nt41ut3i0kd81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=8feef1597afe0f5b9a2c0df73c67a6b636c55d1c  And when I discovered this it opened up a whole world of ideas and reasons or causes for relationship problems.  It is pure basic mathematics, 1000 men for 200 women gives you a 0.2 chance to have a match and if we add to that that many men turn right thousands of times, that complicates the woman to see all those options.  Brutally saturating the market and complicating things for flirting.  It makes all the sense in the world that women are selective, if you have a store and you see that there is a great demand for customers but little product, you raise the price and pay the highest bidder as simple as that.  Also dating apps only account for %17 of marriages regardless of the app company.  This data gave me some sense and explanation to things, not what the red pill tells you.  This discovery was a year and a half ago, and I have improved in my confidence and fear of talking to women and  does it seem to work.  I'm 22 years old and I've quit the apps and I've flirted in University, and I've done much better, I'm not so shy anymore and I'm just being myself and not pretending to be someone else.  I don't pretend to be bad, good, provider, I just show myself as I am.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fkbari2p1kd81.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1a575422f2a4ed41b1a6c2e3461456d5842896  &#x200B;  About ok cupid exactly the same thing happens......  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/iokdponk2kd81.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=70099a667a17247675c4d373cef1ca1ca4c5e3c3	1642995144.0	sbc6tw	/r/MensRights/comments/sbc6tw/about_tinder_dating/	About Tinder dating.....
2w4gvfml	# The Modern Woman’s Guide to Life, and to Defeating The Patriarchy  The below is an incomplete list. Feel free to suggest points I may have missed.  **Home**  · Be cautious of helping around the house. That can be seen as bowing to The Patriarchy. When your spouse asks for help, make sure to consider his request in the context of The Patriarchy. You should be declining his requests for help often. If he becomes despondent, and/or ceases asking for help, that’s a sign that you are succeeding over The Patriarchy.  · You may feel an innate urge towards leaving Corporate America, and staying home to raise you children. Remember, this is an instinct borne of thousands of years of evolution. It must be suppressed. It is much more important to rise in Corporate America, and outsource child raising to caretakers and other lesser individuals.  **Career**  · As society has advanced and shed its old ways, people have come to realize the value of Diversity, particularly in management roles. Contrary to olden times, when hiring was done based on merit, you should plan to have a leg-up on getting hired. Also, expect quick movement up to management ranks.  · When in management, remember that You are the one who is In Charge. Do not solicit advise from more experienced peers, and certainly don’t solicit advise from your direct reports. Doing so would be seen as a sign of weakness. Rather, direct people what needs to be done. Anyone who pushes back is likely a member of The Patriarchy.  **Society**  · Every male-owned small business is looking to cheat you. Do not believe anything from your mechanic, home contractor, or anyone else. You know what is best, regardless of your experience in any of these fields. Once you make your demands known, you may find some of these businesses are hesitant to work with you. Don’t worry, that’s just a sign of their membership in The Patriarchy.  · It’s important to have a constant focus on Environmental issues, particularly Global Warming. Do not question the underlying motives of the existing narrative. Also, don’t worry about your own personal actions, as they can never make a difference. It’s not important for you to make any changes in your daily life, rather simply remember to repeat and support the existing narrative.  · It’s equally important to have a constant focus on Social Justice issues. Again, do not question any underlying motives of the existing narrative. Particularly the possibility of Social Justice Issues being used as a distraction from growing wealth inequality, and the relentless rise of a corporate oligarchy. Remember, the United States is the most racist, cop killing-est, Patriarchal country on the face of the earth. Don’t pay any attention to anyone who says otherwise, particularly those who are using so-called “Data.”	1642999528.0	sbdl55	/r/MensRights/comments/sbdl55/satire_the_modern_womans_guide_to_life_and_to/	[Satire] The Modern Woman’s Guide to Life, and to Defeating The Patriarchy

cc3iqycu	This is a long one, so brace yourself for this essay.  My dad has been a duck hunter most of his life. When I was a kid, I was interested as to why he tried his best to shoot Drakes (males) and not Hens (females). He explained to me that it takes a lot of work for the hens to raise their ducklings and carry their eggs to term. Therefore, males were less of a hinderance to population growth. Also, males can breed with many females.  As I grew older, I noticed this pattern in the world of biology and other forms of hunting as well.   In deer hunting, it is more commonplace to shoot the males to help control the population. In the world of insects, males are sometimes eaten after coitus or are sacrificed for certain purposes.  In our world, we (the human race) have seen the horrors of the world wars and thanks to our social media and news platforms, have seen the horrors that go on in our own country (racism, sexism in the form of misandry and misogyny as well as various injustices). What bothers me is how we are numbed or ignorant of the human cost, especially when many males are being affected.   I’m not implying that women don’t deserve attention for their problems, it’s just kinda sad how males are ignored when talking about human costs that affect males more.   We try to forget/ ignore how young men were sent to the battlefields of the First World War by the thousands, never to return. In addition to the First World War, how the Second World War saw allied soldiers in the invasion of Normandy basically be viewed as assets, not necessarily people. Not to mention the Holocaust (that did kill many women as well, not ignoring that fact) that ended so many lives. I will admit it’s a good thing we do our best to not forget the Holocaust and how atrocious it was, just wanted to include it to show I’m not ignoring the obvious.  Also, the draft (at least in the U.S) being mandatory for all males and how during the World Wars and Vietnam the draft actively sent men to war, weather they wanted to go or not. I have seen many times on this sub where after an attack or tragedy, how it is stated how many women and children died while men aren’t even mentioned.   What’s also terrifying is how female pedophiles are swept under the rug and many people refuse to admit that there are female pedophiles. It seems like every month, at least one female teacher gets caught having sex with a minor (not saying that all female teachers should be treated like pedophiles).  It’s even better how we see sexually active females as being empowered, but very sexually active guys are fuckboys or sex addicts. Even when it comes to sexually inactive individuals, females are being seen as being empowered for not letting their standards down and just sleeping with anyone. Guys are viewed as virgin losers.  The point I’m trying to make with all this rambling is how it seems like our world reflects the simpler and natural world many animals live in, despite all our innovations. We try to save and care for the females while males are seen as somewhat expendable.   I find it funny that people are amazed at the suicide rate and depression statistics for men, when males are treated as expendable, that’s kinda bound to happen, which is really unfortunate.	1643043053.0	sbqjpn	/r/MensRights/comments/sbqjpn/something_i_as_well_as_many_others_i_assume_have/	Something I (as well as many others I assume) have noticed in the world.

3ngbcdr3	I found a news item about an inmate for a crime related to drugs. It is known that a good percentage of inmates use their time to work on their careers once they leave prison.  This man had been working as a talent spotter for local football clubs and he continued his work from inside the prison. He had a TV in his room and he also kept a note book. A female police inspector who specialises in child abuse suspected that he was a paedophile - because he kept the names of young teens in this notebook!   These teens were all boys involved in football. He wrote down information about each boy and he also had some photos (I suppose they were photos of them playing football).  Since the police inspector cannot accuse this man of having done anything illegal, she managed to find a loophole. He had used a database from his previous place of work to get their parents' details so that he could contact the parents. But he had broken a data protection law in the process.

2v9ngucp	This post could be pretty messy, I apology first  The word "enemy" here is a metaphoric term, I am not in anyway promoting aggressive behavior, we are a peaceful community but we will defend our belief if we have to.  I've been having some deep thoughts lately as to why are misandry so persistent and prevalent (outside of this community of course), if you actually take time to read subs like *TwoXChromosomes* , the pattern is pretty clear, its basically lies supporting lies, with enough numbers of people and louder voice, lies became the perceived "truth". No matter how logical and truthful you are, if you are in a group that had less numbers and are mostly silenced, you basically stands little chance of combating discrimination.  First let me get one thing straight to avoid misunderstanding. There is nothing WRONG with using the word "Feminist", since the feminism ideology is **one of** the main contributor to Misandry, which ultimately leads to the everyday discrimination we are facing.  But by only discussing the root of the problem might not addressing the currently situation, Its like we are in a middle of a Chess game, and we can't just magically start the game over, we will have to figure out the next step within the current composition, feminism won't just magically disappear, if you get what I mean.  There are downsides by ONLY using the word "feminist"  1. Misandry could happen before feminism is even a thing, misandry could have been as long as human existed, in a nutshell although feminist **having a better chance** of becoming a misandrist but not all misandrists are feminists 2. Most average misandrist don't even identify themselves with any ideology let alone feminism, just look at *TwoXChromosomes*, just how many of these people have any knowledge of what feminism even is? And there are rare instance where people that do identify as feminist actually supports men (I know its sound crazy, but there ARE even though rare feminists that actually do believe in equality), one example I came to mind is Cassie Jaye the producer of Red Pill Movie. Heck, even Warren Farrell used to be feminist. 3. But we can't just use the word "Women" either because this is overly generalizing and keeping potential ally out of our doors, we really need any support we could get, including Women who supports us, its a numbers game after all. By saying stuff like "Woman hate us" we significantly increase the chance of aiming at the wrong people.  **But there is one thing we could be undoubtedly sure of, our true enemies are universally the Misandrists.** They don't have to identify as any ideology, they don't have to be in any political spectrum, they just simply hate men due to their own bias, heck they don't even have to be women. And *FemaleDatingStrategy* is the testament of what I've just said, trust me, even some feminists will not want to associate themselves with this level of garbage.  As trivial as it might sound, we would have to take one step at a time, and the first thing is that we need more supporters, by changing the way we address our enemy, it might not be much in the short term, but it could give us significantly more ally in the long term. Because what we are doing now is basically **Aiming more accurately towards our true enemy while avoiding possible friendly fire or collateral damage as much as possible.**  I remember last year, when I introduce men's right to one of my best female friend who consider herself a feminist that believed in true equality, when I explained to her our concept she 100% agreed and supportive, but after she start browsing some of the online MRA communities, she start feeling disconnect "I really wanted to help you guys, but I just don't know where I fit into" she told me.  I mean clearly she is a feminist, but she is not a misandrist.  \--------------------------------  What those toxic misandrist community often lies about us is by depicting us as a community that exist solely for bashing feminists, so maybe if we actually use the word misandrist, then we are not bashing feminists, because that is what we actually meant in the first place: **We are combating discrimination against men as gender by putting counter argument towards the Misandrists that disguise themselves as other ideology in reality are just wolf wearing sheep's cloth.**  And by claim that, I assume even feminists couldn't disagree with that argument.	1642816617.0	s9r7ge	/r/MensRights/comments/s9r7ge/we_should_start_using_the_word_misandrist_more/	We should start using the word "Misandrist" more when we are addressing our enemy
4zyym	There is a huge moral outrage with people seemingly competing to condemn Prince Andrew. His offences would seem to be on the low end of the scale i.e. having sex with a 17 year old girl (only an offence in a few states, not in Britain). He may not even have known about the trafficking the responsibility for which should be placed at Epstein's door.  Everyone seems to be ignoring that his accuser, who has already accepted $500 000 and agreed not to take further action, actively trafficked underage girls for Jeffrey Epstein and was probably more than happy to get flown around the world and consort with royalty and the very rich. IMO she is guilty of more than he (Andrew) is. But very few people are talking about that.  Now, I have watched several youtube body language "experts" presenting their "analyses" of his interview with Emily Maitless. To no one's surprise, the conclusion is usually to the effect that the secret signs prove he is a warlock and should be burnt, and most of the comments follow with same sort of judgement.   However, none of "experts", at least none of the ones I have seen, have done the obvious scientific thing and compared his body language in that interview to his body language on other occasions. They are in effect making interpretations in the dark, like doing a drug test without using a control group.  If they had watched other interviews, they would have seen all the same gestures. You can see Andrew being interviewed about his engagement to Sarah in 1986 [here]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2NnvxNkPOU )  (jump to 6:11). He displays all the gestures which "experts" are interpreting as showing he was lying in the Maitliss interview, although here he is only talking about his engagement to her.  It seems to me that his problem is simply that he is mis-matched. This is when your body language is not consistent with your actual emotions. Malcolm Gladwell talks about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LaG25gdJog)   My feeling is that some of the people jumping on the burn Prince Andrew bandwagon are the same as those people, like Andrew O'Keefe, who go on about abuse of women before being outed as abusers themselves. It's projection.  I also wonder whether the problem of being mis-matched may result from being trained to project a particular public image from the time you can first walk.	1642818633.0	s9ruy6	/r/MensRights/comments/s9ruy6/the_new_moral_outrage_prince_andrew_body_language/	The New Moral Outrage, Prince Andrew, Body Language Experts

7np0uhh7	Hello everyone,  To begin with we would first need some background. First of all I just wanted to highlight few laws which discriminate men in India and are widely misused to extort money from them. Yes, extortion industry in India is very huge.  First law is IPC 498A : Which protect wives from cruelty, sexual abuse from husbnad & his family. The law which is biased and made on assumption that only wives faces cruelty and husbands don't. No evidence is needed just statement from wife is required to arrest anyone from the family from husband.  Trial can go upto many years. 90% of cases register under this act turned out to be false because it encourages wives to extort money from husband & his family, here's how : once 498A is registered women is entitled to maintenance and can't live with husband. She can skip the hearings which make cases to last more longer and husband to pay more to the wife. Wife after filling this case don't attend hearings and enjoying lifetime free income. Child custody always given to wife because husband is accused of cruelty. India have seen 70% rise in suicide rates by married men. It encourages extrotion industry and main source to earn for lawyers, judges and women.  After observing by courts that this IPC is getting misused, court orders police not to immediately arrest husband and his family. After that wives are filling IPC 377 along with 498A. 377 is also for married wives if husband forces them for unnatural sex. Wives demanding lifetime income to drop the charges because getting bail in India is no easy. Btw, again no evidence from accuser is required and no initial investigation needed.  Now for unmarried men : IPC375 & 376 , law to prevent rape. This law is also for one gender i.e. women. But the only problem of this law is it's definition and evidence act it follows. If a women accuse any men of rape, she don't need to undergo any medical examination and accused has to prove that he is innocent. The burden to prove his innocence is on accused. There is no law in the world like this. Also, in a relationship if a women have consensual intercourse with men then she can also file this case while saying the man has obtained the consent by promising me of marriage. In other world we call it breakup but in India we call it rape. Sex means you have to marry her. Hence, another misuse of law.  Sorry for long write-up, but now feminists in India are demanding IPC 375/376 to be applicable for married women while they already have recourse to file for cruelty in section 498A and 377. This is draconian law because it make any man to go under trial without investigation and evidence. Which means first it is not gender neutral and second, men has to prove his innocence and no evidence is required to accuse someone with 375/376  The men in India only want to fix this law by first fixing evidence act. Second by making it gender neutral. Since court has already denied it now men have no option but to boycott marriage. This is the reason why #MarriageStrike is trending in India.

dmt0p	1) Disregard of facts  This is perhaps the most obvious characteristic of many feminist texts - and yet something most people ignore. There is [a great book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53052177) on the "applied postmodernism", which explains how this side of Feminism, at least in academic circles, is a feature not a bug.  2) Disregard of a balanced view  In the book [The Right to Sex](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/56347680) an Oxford professor argues that men have all the power in sexual relationships and force, via patriarchy, women to submit to sex. A balanced view would point out that women are gatekeepers of sex and as such have much more power in sexual relationships. This lack of a balanced view and, thus, fairness is typical to feminist texts.   3) Resentment  [Feminist writers tend to be angry and bitter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34640834-down-girl). We live in patriarchy and thus everything wrong.  And why wouldn't it be when you are fed with the views described above?	1642870564.0	sa6p4k	/r/MensRights/comments/sa6p4k/after_reading_several_books_related_to_feminism/	After reading several books related to feminism, here is a view on what is typical?

142kre	I'm currently in the middle of a divorce in the USA. I'd prefer not to go into too much detail, but suffice to say, my son is with her only because I didn't want her to involve the police and make things ugly for my son, which she absolutely would have, and being that I'm a man, and she's got her other son so twisted around he's completely against me and would lie for her (has already done so), I'm sure they'd side with her. She was pretty emotionally and verbally abusive to me the majority of the time we were married. Lots of wearing down, gaslighting, bait and switch tactics, etc. Eventually I was spending as little time at home as possible to avoid her.  Right now, I only see my son every other weekend, and occasionally in the evenings when I have time to drive an extra hour (she has to be civil around her parents, so at least that's a plus). I call him every night, but she hovers, probably to make sure I don't tell him the truth or anything.  She's presently living in her parents' home, intentionally doesn't have a real job of any sort, she sees child support for her other 2 children falling off completely this year, and so now she's going after me for something like 1000/month. That's almost a third of my income.  Obviously, given the situation (and some details I'd rather not mention at present), I'd much rather have primary custody of my son, but I'm sure that'd look ugly to the court, so I'm going for 50/50 shared custody. If she needs funds to take care of him while he's there, she can get a job; she's fully capable.  She has a lawyer (under 'indigent' aid), but I can neither afford one outright (lowest retainer I could find was 8000), nor qualify for public aid programs. I found a lawyer who is eager to take the case, but he's that one with the lowest retainer (and that's after offering me a discount).  I'm hoping this is the right place to ask; does anyone here have any advice on finding finance options for this? My credit score isn't great, very low 600's according to Experian and a bit under 6000 according to Credit Karma. I can of course afford to pay a loan down, I just don't presently have a way to get that much money together at once.

They can agree with me when I talk in a conversation about women, but his engagement ends there. God damn, it's unbelievable.  Men are so overloaded, everything is our guilty. Camille Paglia has already noticed this. For girls, we create a patriarchal society to explore women and they use this to put in our hands ALL their sadness. They cancel ex-boyfriends when a relantionship broke, and the society is totally inclined to embrace women version (including men). To be a heterosexual man these days is to be politically incorrect. Society is totally fucked to us. Drunk girls can't consent to sex and we must discern for them. If the girl says she was too much drunk, man... you can go to jail and could be a RAPIST!!!

8hmqmcpg	Men catch a lot of flak for being more shallow than women, meaning that they put a lot of emphasis on one thing, physical attractiveness, when seeking a partner.  The subtext of this criticism is that the core of one’s physical attractiveness (skeletal structure, especially facial appearance) cannot be changed, and therefore, it’s wrong to reject people for not possessing something that’s difficult for many to achieve.  Some may claim that it’s because “they have so much more to offer other than looks”,  but if good looks were easier to achieve (not born that way), I seriously doubt this “more to offer” would result in this same level of criticism of shallowness.  Why then, is it considered inherently better for women to hold a plethora of standards for men?   Even though it’s not shallow, it’s actually more difficult to meet those standards…	1642904677.0	saismy	/r/MensRights/comments/saismy/subtext_of_criticizing_men_for_being_shallow_and/	Subtext of Criticizing Men for Being Shallow, and Why not Being Shallow can be Worse
8tg60gqq	So I (20M) met her (20F) like 3 months ago in a club, we kinda turned into a fuckbuddy thing more than a fwb cause we really wouldn’t hang or talk outside the bedroom.  Last night I had a few friends going out to the clubs, I was invited but I knocked it back cause I had plans to grab a few beers with another mate. I’m also extremely exhausted from work cause a lot of my coworkers were in covid isolation over the last two weeks so i’ve been working nearly 90 hours a week for the extra money.  So my plans with my mate falls through last moment, and I message my fwb asking if she’s free tonight. She says she’s out clubbing but she’s a bit sick of the people she’s with and will be home early. Ok sweet. I said to not get too drunk because I wouldn’t feel comfortable if she was that incapacitated.   Anyways she texts me at like 10:30 pm saying she’s on her her way home. I ask her if her house is free or do we want to do it at mine (she lives with her parents, i support myself) and she says there’s no one home. Anyways I call an uber and when i get into the uber and going she sorta apologises and say actuslly her friends are staying over snd I said that’s okay but like I don’t wanna meet them or whatever, like as long as they’re out of the way, etc etc   Anyways i get there and I got to knock on the door and I hear like a bunch of people laughing and having fun etc. Should of gone home here cause I was instantly not comfortable with this but idk i soent too much on the uber anyways so I thought eh maybe they’re just having drinks or whatever and i get to avoid them.  Anyways I come inside and like they know a lot about me… What I do for work, where i’m from, what my dad does for work (??), my name, my dick size (red flag - but at the time i thought nothing of it cause i bring my own size condoms around cause no one expects it lol), what i study, that i’m bisexual (still very closeted about it, got bullied quite badly in highschool for being suspected gay so only a small group of people know). I should of left here but idk i stayed for some reason.  So we kinda get chatting, they had pizza and drinks there so I help myself. It was Triple J hottest 100 in Australia where the public broadcaster does a Radio show of fan voted top 100 songs of the year. People usually get by a pool and drink summer drinks so i’ve been drinking in the sun for like nearly 12 hours at this point. It kinda gets flirty and I kinda get quiet. I’m trying not to reciprocate and send any signs because I am (a) not comfortable in this situation, (b) not comfortable in the situation their insinuating  So i’m visible uncomfortable here. My fwb asks me if i’m alright. I say yeah it’s fine cause i don’t wanna disappoint her, just wasn’t expecting this. Long story short I end up in bed with the three of them. Worst sex of my life.   I don’t know what happened, I wasn’t comfortable with the situation but I didn’t say no. I don’t know why or how, it kinda makes me feel sick talking about it. I felt and do still objectified about it. Idk why I assured my fwb that I was okay with this, I wasn’t. It didn’t feel right.  I feel guilty cause she asked me, but I still said yes. But i can’t shake it out of my head how her friends knew so much about me, how she told me the house was empty. I go to call an uber home afterwards but it’s $80 so I sleep in the bed.   I woke up at 6am and caught the first bus home. I have a shower and try to catch up on some sleep but idk I just feel awful. I sent my girl-friend (two seperate words) a message after it happened but she was sleeping.   She saw my messages when I just got on the bus and told me I need to get out of there. She’s been SA’ed before in a much more traumatic way so I feel bad talking to her about it cause I feel like i’m triggering her. I don’t know if i can talk to my friends about this. I got an older friend (25M) who I feel like I can talk to but he’s on a hike and doesn’t get back till tomorrow.   I just don’t know how to feel. I assured my fwb that I was fine but I can’t help to think she put me in this situation on purpose. She’s told me before she’s been interested in a threesome and I told her I wasn’t, even if i’m bi so i feel like she might of planned it.  My girl-friend told me to cut her off ASAP and I will. But idk I just feel weak willed and ashamed  This got removed off /r/AskMen by the automod so I posted here. I just kinda need it off my chest.	1642905218.0	saiz11	/r/MensRights/comments/saiz11/i_think_i_got_sexually_assaulted_i_dont_know_how/	I think I got sexually assaulted. I don’t know how to feel.

8bd2oyqc	About 8 months ago I got diagnosed with stage 4 non hodgekins lymphoma. It turned my whole life upside down, but one of the strangest things was seeing the treatment I’d get from people around me, or peoples reactions. I constantly get stares, horrible looks. I know that I look very odd, not having eyebrows eyelashes or any hair at all, but people will just straight up point at me from 5 feet away and I’ll hear them saying something stupid about my cane or whatever I have with me, mostly women. Now that I’m cleared to work out and start my recovery I’ve been going to the gym. Gym bros I’ve never met in my life have no problem spotting me, helping me, just hanging out and including me in general. They aren’t offput by all the intense disfigurement and strange look I have now. Women on the other hand give me unbelievably scornful looks at the gym. Some of them just straight up laugh and point when I’m struggling to just lift the bar. Or a particularly frustrating situation have been women telling me that it’s really not that bad, because breast cancer kills women every day. I still have no idea what that means. A lot of support groups, free physical therapy, therapy for cancer patients, all that come to find is only accessible to women. Not all of them obviously, but it’s intensely frustrating to try to find help, and to be turned away because I didn’t go through a “normal” cancer like breast or ovarian cancer.

8hmqmcpg	Creating a stickied thread to compile examples of casual prejudice against men would be more effective in painting a picture of what we face.  A recurring issue I encounter when attempting to explain issues that negatively affect men, is people latch onto specific examples that I point out, instead of only speaking in the abstract.  It’s a catch-22; if I speak in generalities, opponents push back with the typical “not everyone is identical” argument, but if I stick to real life specific examples, they nitpick any little aspect of the story that is less than prejudiced against men, as proof that none of it was prejudiced.  If we could send people a link that’s just a barrage of examples, it would essentially bypass their ability to nitpick, because even if they tried, there would be too many examples to deny the overall picture.	1642956918.0	saxzvo	/r/MensRights/comments/saxzvo/stickies_thread_for_examples_of_casual_prejudice/	Stickies Thread for Examples of Casual Prejudice Against Men?

The federal complaint challenges discrimination on the basis of sex in college admissions, residential spaces, scholarships, professional clubs,  medical services, academic departments, et cetera. Men are now a minority in colleges and our diverse coalition hopes to eliminate affirmative action for the female majority. The complaint has been signed by 199 individuals so far -- including think tank presidents, authors,  professors, lawyers,  activists. Signatories include Jordan Peterson, Warren Farrell, Christina Hoff Summers, Peter Wood, Cynthia Garrett, Harvey Silverglate, Paul du Quenoy, Amy Wax, Andrew Miltenberg, Janice Fiamengo, Lawrence  Alexander (among many others). Glenn Reynolds [covered the complaint in this opinion piece.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/02/12/colleges-universities-discriminate-men-title-ix-complaints-toxic-masculinity-column/2831834002/)   You can read the amended and final version of the complaint here: [https://www.scribd.com/document/554289896/Coalition-Complaint-Amended](https://www.scribd.com/document/554289896/Coalition-Complaint-Amended)  Every signature matters.

dmt0p	Patriarchy is a social system. Not the way feminists describe it, of course, but world used to be and still is in some parts divided into clans led by "fathers", patriarchs. So, patriarchy is a thing.  It's also true that men have been in control of most of the world for thousands of years.   Why?  Most westerners, living in their air-conditioned houses, sitting at their computer, don't understand what it takes to survive on this planet.   For millions of years surviving has been a battle where the strongest and meanest have survived.  Or so would you think.   Somehow, like in a miracle, humankind has not only survived but we have managed to create - in some parts - a civilization of prosperity and freedom.  How did that happen?  Feminists say that we live under patriarchy. If so, patriarchy has created this miracle.  Me?  I have studies history so much that I don't believe in simplistic explanations, the way feminists believe.  But, yeah, somehow it was indeed men who managed to turn the tables, create these oases of hope where freedom and prosperity prevails.  I don't want to say that this the new great narrative that we should embrace. I don't want to say that women played no part in all this.   But patriarchy? If you just change your perspective little, shouldn't we be amazed?

1qaa0i25	I don’t know what to flair this.   Most of my friends, if not all, are female. I’m 22M.   Why do I feel guilty about talking to my female friends about my mental health? Why do I have fear that they’re going to use it against me in the future, even though they’re supportive of me now?  Well, because it happened. A few times actually. One is on-going (ish) and one happened last week.   I’ve been friends with this girl for a year and she deleted me off of Facebook. The reason? Well, idk. I told her I was psychotic and I wasn’t really talking to many people because I didn’t trust anyone at the time. The response? “Ok then. Bye.”, so I go to her profile and she’s deleted me. So I just blocked her.   The other girl, well, her and I talk on a daily basis, but only when she wants to? If that makes any sense? Like okay, I have her on snap, right, so she’ll send me morning streaks and night streaks but leave me on read otherwise, even if I send her another snap she’ll leave me on read. I’ll give her credit, she will respond if I ask for her help, and I’m not blaming her; in fact, I’m thankful for her. She has a really stern way of helping but it helps nonetheless.   But there was this one time where I mentioned I was trying to better myself. I had a bad panic attack a few days later, messaged her saying I need help, and was immediately told “didn’t you say you wanted to get better?” and I responded “am I not allowed to have bad days?” And she goes “you are. It was just a question.” I feel bad, I mean, I know I shouldn’t have said that but it just hurt.   Even my mom does this shit sometimes. She’ll complain about men all the time. (Okay this one isn’t really about “health” but it’s relevant). She’ll blame me or my dad for mundane things. She’ll literally go “you men and your” whatever. Or “jeez, you men!”   “You men don’t understand the beauty of” whatever   We just got a cat, her name is Gigi, my dad calls her “g-spot” (cause why not, it’s funny) and my mom, on *his* Facebook feed, goes “her name is NOT g-spot, it’s Gigi! Jeez, men!”  Everything is always about her, otherwise it doesn’t matter. Whenever I try to say something, she’ll strike it down with “oh yeah, well what *you’re* doing is wrong”. When I say “I had a rough childhood” she’ll go “pfft, *you* had a rough childhood?” Then proceed to tell me everything about her childhood and make me feel like the asshole for even bringing it up.   I’m not allowed to feel emotions, I’m not allowed to be angry, sad, happy, anything. No matter what I do. She even accused me of being mad at her when I said nothing was wrong. I literally had to call her and tell her to stop the attitude, and that I was fine.   “Oh I can tell somethings wrong, you’ve got resting bitch face” okay. Cool.   “You’ve been so moody recently, why don’t you tell me what’s wrong?”  I tell her nothings wrong   “Yes there is, I can tell” what? I’m literally telling you, face to face, *I’m fine*. What more do you want?   But anyway. Back to my original point. I feel guilty talking to girls about my issues, like I feel like they just don’t care. I don’t have any guy friends, and I haven’t had a “boys” hang out in a year, I haven’t hung out with the boys in forever. But I don’t have any.   Idk, I feel more comfortable talking to girls but not about my issues. My doctor is female, my psych is female, all of my friends are female. They don’t care about my feelings. I’m a man, I’m supposed to man up, right?   On the topic of psychs, you know how awkward it is to tell a doctor or psych of the opposite gender how you’re feeling? Like I know I literally just said I feel more comfortable talking to girls and whatnot, and I’m probably contradicting myself, but I’d rather have a male doctor than a female doctor. I had to tell my former female psych about my erection problems. You know how fuckin awkward that was for me?  Let me answer your question right now (if you’re even reading this far, honestly I don’t blame you if you’re not reading this anymore. It’s a mess): I don’t have easy access to psychs or therapists. I need to be referred because I don’t have insurance, and if I’m referred by a doctor, all appointments are free. The only downside is wait times. I had to wait literally 4 years, if not more, to get a psych. All of high school and grades 7-8, so more than 4 years. I only got what I got because that psych was a friend of my GP. But yeah. I live in Canada. Sure, it was free, but I’d rather pay the $200/session or whatever and get help right away than wait years and years, only to be told “it’s all in your head” thanks I know, you diagnosed me with schizoaffective. Now apparently I don’t have it. And I had to switch psychs because my old psych was moving to a different province and stopping her practice, so I had to wait a long time again to get this psych that I was told I wasn’t supposed to get because I don’t live in the city, I live in the country. The funny thing is, my current psych has a number I can text or call, and an email I can email. But I can only text or call her during business hours Monday-Friday (so no weekends or nights when I need people the most) and she doesn’t check her email until the appointment, and even then she told me not to email her. So idk.   Sorry. I rant when I’m upset. I don’t blame you for not reading this. It kinda just spiraled anyway. Thanks for reading if you do read this. I need support from other men I guess.	1642975494.0	sb59td	/r/MensRights/comments/sb59td/why_is_my_mental_health_not_being_taken_seriously/	Why is my mental health not being taken seriously?
hjmjlozw	We seem to constantly be bombarded by info and complaints about the so-called ‘pink tax’; the idea that women have to pay more to live at the same standard of living.  A lot of this idea is rooted in the additional and supposedly inflated costs for menstrual products, clothing, and other cosmetic upcharges, etc.  However, I’d argue that men are under greater financial duress constantly, ignoring lifestyle factors that cause even greater financial burden (I.e, addiction, hobbies, etc.) and other factors men face (divorce, lower spending [women spend a lot of men’s income]).  Even ignoring all that, men:  - Consume 25% more calories and thus spend much more on food  - Spend more on car insurance (women constitute more crashes per capita but men drive way more for work and such)  - Spend more on life insurance due to earlier death  - Spend more on gas, vehicular maintenance, etc. due to driving habits often driven by employment needs   - Men are much more likely to have hair loss problems at an earlier age, which can lead to expensive treatment regimes  - Sneakers cost much more for men than women  - Men pay more in taxes and get less tax credits (tax credit discrepancy still exists if income is equalized)  - Bars/clubs often cost more for men than women due to special discounts dished out for women  - Disability insurance costs more for men  - Etc.  I’m not advocating for men getting special treatment or anything I just think it’s important to keep in mind that men pay more for a lot of things out of their control- the Blue Tax is a lot more real and uncontrollable than the pink one imho.	1642972256.0	sb3zrj	/r/MensRights/comments/sb3zrj/the_blue_tax/	The ‘Blue Tax’

8390y6bv	I'm only 20 years old, but I already find it so fucking hard being a man and especially when your abuser is your own mother. I've been following this sub for some time, and within that time I've come to the horrifying realization that the narrative will always be pinned against me. As long as I'm male and my abuser is female, courts will always be biased against me. The public will always be biased against me. If it's revelaed that I was the true victim and that my mom has always been the agressor and the abuser, most likely that still won't change the biases people have placed against me. People will always go through the extreme mental gymnastics to have me take accountability for someone's abuse onto myself. It got me thinking back on all the times my mom made police threats, and if those threats went through how I was almost close to facing this battle even when I was too young to know how unjust the system is.  Some background: I live with my mom and grandma, my dad abandoned me before my birth, I've endured a lifetime amount of abuse from my emotionally and physically abusive mother. I had behavioral problems when I was younger and went through a lot of corporal punishments that extended past the typical belt whoopings. As early as 8 years old, my mom - 300 pounds - would sit on me - a scrawny ass kid at the time - to keep me from running away from her while she punched and whooped me. I held my arms up to block her blows and to try to push her away from me so I can get out from under her. She'd grab my wrist and bite the side of it hard enough to have me screaming and crying and forced to keep my arms at my side and away from my face while she needed to do what she had to do. When it still seemed like my behavior needed to be corrected, my mom found a power over me in the form of knives. From age 8 to 13, my mom threatened to either stab me or herself as a disciplining tactic. She'd chase me around the small apartments we lived in with knives varying in size from a stake knife to the kind of knife you see Michael Myers carry. She'd hold the knife close to me to get me to stop crying because 'I'm too emotional to be a boy' and that she can say what she needed to say without me running away.   Cut to me at age 13, I was going through the typical puberty stages most boys went through at that age: becoming taller than their mother, becoming biologically stronger even if I was still skinny, and having longer arms for longer reach. This was before I was aware of how much I was growing and this night in particular made me realize that. My mom was coming at me again with the typical - either belt whoopings, punches, pushing me back, or all three - and I was instinctively defending myself as I did since I was 8. Now, this was the age where it was no longer "acceptable" for me to defend myself. Because I was taller than my mom and my arms were longer and stronger, I was better at keeping my mom away from me by pushing her back. I never pushed my mom again after this night, which you'll come to know why, but when I did it was never violent. I never pushed her hard enough to have her tumbling back or having her back hit against the wall nor the floor. I softly pushed her away as I was backing away to maintain the distance between us, except my mom kept advancing and I had no choice but to keep pushing her away.   Later that night, my mom called me into her room. She was sitting at the edge of her bed with the house phone in her hand. She was contemplating calling the police on ME and telling them I pushed her. She was even crying, playing victim, and saying things like 'What do you think they \[the police\] will do if I told them my son pushed me? Do you really want to grow up abusing your mother like you did tonight? Do you want to treat your wife like this when you're older??' Looking back I realize this is my mom emotionally abusing and gaslighting me, but at the time I genuinely thought I was being abusive and I was crying, praying to never grow up to be the kind of guy to hit their mother and wife, any woman for that matter. I think at that moment my mom found a new hold over me: police threats. For all the times following after when she physically assault me, I never pushed her but I still instinctively raised my arms up to block myself from her. She'd either have a fist or a belt, or both, in one hand and a phone in the other, and threatened to call the police if I didn't put my arms down in the next five seconds. That way, she can still keep hitting me without me blocking any of her attacks. My defense system was taken away and I was at my most angriest when I just had to stand and take the abuse, cause she even threatened to call the police if I ran away or hid from her and even flinched when she raised her fist. She'd even tell me to stand up if I was hit to the ground or if the pain was just that unbearable, or else that would be another police threat. I would just stand there, trying not to cry cause that would be another police threat right there, with my hands at my side balled into a fist. She'd notice this and always said 'What you balling your fists for? Are you going to hit me? Do you want to hit me?' and just make the assumption that I was on the verge of punching her which would incline her with more police threats.  I'm going to leave a link for Pt 2 when I post that soon.	1642981936.0	sb7ol7	/r/MensRights/comments/sb7ol7/my_abusive_mothers_history_of_making_police/	My abusive mother's history of making police threats, Pt 1

h394ibm1	Personally, I never understood it. Like, duh straight guys love to see and check out hot girls. How is that abnormal?  I mean unless they act creepy, predatory or just very wrong around it. I see not even a single problem about guys checking out girls' bodies.  Girls can do it too, you know. But this is just my opinion.  What do you think?  EDIT: Guys please don't be misogynist with the "chad" parts. It's true, it's a bit annoying that women have much higher dating standards compared to guys. However, that doesn't mean they don't get a choice or an opinion towards guys checking out(especially if these guys "gaze" too long) Same with guys towards women and "female gaze"  For me, I really don't care whether they allow a handsome man to check them out while an ugly man not to do that. But I care when feminists are being misandrist and making this weird term "male gaze" even though both genders do it.  EDIT2: Guys please don't use incel terms and ideology, we have to be better than feminists. Also I understand male gaze now, it's still total bullshit but now I get that it's related to art more than it's related to the actual world.	1642987642.0	sb9oli	/r/MensRights/comments/sb9oli/what_do_you_guys_think_about_the_male_gaze/	What do you guys think about the "male gaze"?

a1yxamy8	Hi people, the monosphere made me believe that not getting on tinder was due to female selectivity or that they are extremely shallow.  https://preview.redd.it/enthrugzzjd81.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe72b42a1d005d89a7ec5de989e2a02d4d1b0d8  With that idea in my mind I got a little upset, I even thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life because of the high superficiality.  But I started to question that 80/20 rule and I said: And how many male and female users are there in the app on which the app was based? no one in the manosphere asked that question, and bingo:  https://preview.redd.it/nt41ut3i0kd81.png?width=1195&format=png&auto=webp&s=8feef1597afe0f5b9a2c0df73c67a6b636c55d1c  And when I discovered this it opened up a whole world of ideas and reasons or causes for relationship problems.  It is pure basic mathematics, 1000 men for 200 women gives you a 0.2 chance to have a match and if we add to that that many men turn right thousands of times, that complicates the woman to see all those options.  Brutally saturating the market and complicating things for flirting.  It makes all the sense in the world that women are selective, if you have a store and you see that there is a great demand for customers but little product, you raise the price and pay the highest bidder as simple as that.  Also dating apps only account for %17 of marriages regardless of the app company.  This data gave me some sense and explanation to things, not what the red pill tells you.  This discovery was a year and a half ago, and I have improved in my confidence and fear of talking to women and  does it seem to work.  I'm 22 years old and I've quit the apps and I've flirted in University, and I've done much better, I'm not so shy anymore and I'm just being myself and not pretending to be someone else.  I don't pretend to be bad, good, provider, I just show myself as I am.  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/fkbari2p1kd81.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f1a575422f2a4ed41b1a6c2e3461456d5842896  &#x200B;  About ok cupid exactly the same thing happens......  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/iokdponk2kd81.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=70099a667a17247675c4d373cef1ca1ca4c5e3c3	1642995144.0	sbc6tw	/r/MensRights/comments/sbc6tw/about_tinder_dating/	About Tinder dating.....
2w4gvfml	# The Modern Woman’s Guide to Life, and to Defeating The Patriarchy  The below is an incomplete list. Feel free to suggest points I may have missed.  **Home**  · Be cautious of helping around the house. That can be seen as bowing to The Patriarchy. When your spouse asks for help, make sure to consider his request in the context of The Patriarchy. You should be declining his requests for help often. If he becomes despondent, and/or ceases asking for help, that’s a sign that you are succeeding over The Patriarchy.  · You may feel an innate urge towards leaving Corporate America, and staying home to raise you children. Remember, this is an instinct borne of thousands of years of evolution. It must be suppressed. It is much more important to rise in Corporate America, and outsource child raising to caretakers and other lesser individuals.  **Career**  · As society has advanced and shed its old ways, people have come to realize the value of Diversity, particularly in management roles. Contrary to olden times, when hiring was done based on merit, you should plan to have a leg-up on getting hired. Also, expect quick movement up to management ranks.  · When in management, remember that You are the one who is In Charge. Do not solicit advise from more experienced peers, and certainly don’t solicit advise from your direct reports. Doing so would be seen as a sign of weakness. Rather, direct people what needs to be done. Anyone who pushes back is likely a member of The Patriarchy.  **Society**  · Every male-owned small business is looking to cheat you. Do not believe anything from your mechanic, home contractor, or anyone else. You know what is best, regardless of your experience in any of these fields. Once you make your demands known, you may find some of these businesses are hesitant to work with you. Don’t worry, that’s just a sign of their membership in The Patriarchy.  · It’s important to have a constant focus on Environmental issues, particularly Global Warming. Do not question the underlying motives of the existing narrative. Also, don’t worry about your own personal actions, as they can never make a difference. It’s not important for you to make any changes in your daily life, rather simply remember to repeat and support the existing narrative.  · It’s equally important to have a constant focus on Social Justice issues. Again, do not question any underlying motives of the existing narrative. Particularly the possibility of Social Justice Issues being used as a distraction from growing wealth inequality, and the relentless rise of a corporate oligarchy. Remember, the United States is the most racist, cop killing-est, Patriarchal country on the face of the earth. Don’t pay any attention to anyone who says otherwise, particularly those who are using so-called “Data.”	1642999528.0	sbdl55	/r/MensRights/comments/sbdl55/satire_the_modern_womans_guide_to_life_and_to/	[Satire] The Modern Woman’s Guide to Life, and to Defeating The Patriarchy

cc3iqycu	This is a long one, so brace yourself for this essay.  My dad has been a duck hunter most of his life. When I was a kid, I was interested as to why he tried his best to shoot Drakes (males) and not Hens (females). He explained to me that it takes a lot of work for the hens to raise their ducklings and carry their eggs to term. Therefore, males were less of a hinderance to population growth. Also, males can breed with many females.  As I grew older, I noticed this pattern in the world of biology and other forms of hunting as well.   In deer hunting, it is more commonplace to shoot the males to help control the population. In the world of insects, males are sometimes eaten after coitus or are sacrificed for certain purposes.  In our world, we (the human race) have seen the horrors of the world wars and thanks to our social media and news platforms, have seen the horrors that go on in our own country (racism, sexism in the form of misandry and misogyny as well as various injustices). What bothers me is how we are numbed or ignorant of the human cost, especially when many males are being affected.   I’m not implying that women don’t deserve attention for their problems, it’s just kinda sad how males are ignored when talking about human costs that affect males more.   We try to forget/ ignore how young men were sent to the battlefields of the First World War by the thousands, never to return. In addition to the First World War, how the Second World War saw allied soldiers in the invasion of Normandy basically be viewed as assets, not necessarily people. Not to mention the Holocaust (that did kill many women as well, not ignoring that fact) that ended so many lives. I will admit it’s a good thing we do our best to not forget the Holocaust and how atrocious it was, just wanted to include it to show I’m not ignoring the obvious.  Also, the draft (at least in the U.S) being mandatory for all males and how during the World Wars and Vietnam the draft actively sent men to war, weather they wanted to go or not. I have seen many times on this sub where after an attack or tragedy, how it is stated how many women and children died while men aren’t even mentioned.   What’s also terrifying is how female pedophiles are swept under the rug and many people refuse to admit that there are female pedophiles. It seems like every month, at least one female teacher gets caught having sex with a minor (not saying that all female teachers should be treated like pedophiles).  It’s even better how we see sexually active females as being empowered, but very sexually active guys are fuckboys or sex addicts. Even when it comes to sexually inactive individuals, females are being seen as being empowered for not letting their standards down and just sleeping with anyone. Guys are viewed as virgin losers.  The point I’m trying to make with all this rambling is how it seems like our world reflects the simpler and natural world many animals live in, despite all our innovations. We try to save and care for the females while males are seen as somewhat expendable.   I find it funny that people are amazed at the suicide rate and depression statistics for men, when males are treated as expendable, that’s kinda bound to happen, which is really unfortunate.	1643043053.0	sbqjpn	/r/MensRights/comments/sbqjpn/something_i_as_well_as_many_others_i_assume_have/	Something I (as well as many others I assume) have noticed in the world.

eki4oaha	In most of the countries, women may file fake rape cases and practically come out of this without any punishment if the court rules the complaint is fake. So, many people suggest that they should be given punishment for fake rape cases, and which I too believe is true. But, if such a law is created then women might get more afraid to file true rape cases, especially against powerful people. But we do not want that too - true rapists must be punished. So is there a way to come out of this dilemma? Should such a law be created?	1643021806.0	sbjlg0	/r/MensRights/comments/sbjlg0/a_dilemmatic_question_about_creating_new_antirape/	A dilemmatic question about creating new anti-rape laws?
h394ibm1	I find it extremely annoying that "transphobia" as a term gets thrown around but nobody notices that it's actually misandry.  As an example, TERFs are not "transphobic" they are misandrists. They don't hate transwomen because they are trans or something, they hate them because they were men.  Yet nobody calls them out on this. It's insane how people only hate them because they are transphobic but not because they are misandrists. Notice how only transwomen get insulted, ***never*** transmen.  Are we, men, so ignored that 1% of population getting offended by TERFs is more important than offending half the population?  I wanted to say something about this because I have just seen articles about J.K Rowling's transphobic tweets. Even though she has some good points(Rape by individuals who have penises should definitely not be considered rape by women) I noticed that most of her tweets are feminists sexist garbage that actually come from her hatred for men than anything to do with women's rights.	1643061538.0	sbxr3d	/r/MensRights/comments/sbxr3d/i_find_it_very_annoying_that_people_dont_notice/	I find it very annoying that people don't notice that the source of transphobia is misandry.

That being said, the above link is basically a girl (not sure where she is from) who posted that she has absolute no sympathy for Indian and Chinese men who cant find wives. And why is she hateful to Asian men...due to aborting of the girl child ? Let me explain down below.  Lets get one thing straight...killing of foetus just because the child didnt turn out to be a boy and instead a girl is beyond wrong. I will definitely say one thing as an Indian man who is going to the west, that back in the 90s, 80s and the period way before that, there were so many instances of these cases occuring in India. That was the past.  India of today (despite its many challenges contributing to the fact it has over 1 billion population), has advanced in terms of giving women rights and safety....which has led to the drastic cutdown of wrongful termination of foetuses.  The only instances where this happens is across backward villages and even people are slowly their minds there and embracing indian girls. And tell me if im wrong, go on the link above and you are going to see the whole crowd of people hating on indian and chinese men just because they are asian. This is so damn ridiculous beyond all measure and to me. The world and the same people on that post are the ones who go through their lives preaching that racism is wrong but when it comes to a post, hating on men specifically from Asia...thats when they let their hate for Asian men out.  One of the biggest reasons in my opinion why there is a huge uprise of MGTOW and mens rights back in India is because so many men are sick and tired of indian women living in their protected bubble due to being raised by their parents all their lifes, and behaving entitled due to how much society caters to them that they feel they get a free pass for critizing Indian men and simultaneously, have this idea that they are these perfect creatures. I could go on and on about how many false accusations and false rapes are happening in India but the moment you voice that to a lot of these Indian girls, they shame your masculinity and your manhood.  &#x200B;  Sorry but this was a rant from my end. Dont get me wrong, mens rights are important...irrespective to men of all countries but when society outright behaves racis and discriminates men based on their color and skin, thats what pisses me off.	1643011120.0	sbgwg1	/r/MensRights/comments/sbgwg1/its_kind_of_a_shame_on_how_a_lot_of_indian_or/	Its kind of a shame on how a lot of Indian or Chinese men are being discriminated upon in todays world !

8trqcm3p	How do you view the argument "not all men"? It's often said by people like us who are tired of men getting blamed for the fault of a certain member of the male gender. I believe it is a good argument if elaborated properly. But, just saying "not all men" may not be enough.   I came across a supposedly counter argument to this which goes along the lines of "if you're given 3 cakes, but 1 cake is poisonous, you wouldn't eat any".   My counter argument for this is "about 4% of humans are sociopaths, should i avoid everyone then?"   I'm severely uneducated in this, so I appreciate your inputs on this regard.  Thanks in advance.

ih2hp08	Bitter working dad of a 1 month old here.   My company gives 1 week paid paternity leave which ,as far as I can tell, might even be above average for US companies. Obviously Mothers typically get a few months and the reasoning is surely to feed baby, heal from birth and bond with baby. As a new dad I’m suddenly fucking baffled that standard corporate /company policy suggests the following:  - Moms are expected to tend to themselves and child essentially alone (without the father) from day 1 - Dads are expected NOT to need equivalent time off to bond with baby - Dads are expected NOT to need equivalent time to adjust to the massive and disrupting life change - Dads are effectively expected to skip or tend to related baby appts and tasks outside work hours. - Dads are expected to work alongside women who themselves receive 12X more paid leave for the same life event.  I’m trying to understand how equality and fairness are present in this glaring discrepancy.  Im trying to understand why it’s ok to get pressure to return to work for the Father of a newborn while the Mom is understood to be out of reach, tending to matters far and above the importance of work.  I’m trying to understand why we are still sending the message that a father’s presence in the home , and their newborns life, is secondary and less important than the mother’s.

After receiving no help from the opposite sex I turned to the great men of this reddit and I confronted transgendered X in my home. I explained how misandry to me is the exact same as racism or sexism. It then became a argument how not all men are bad but most are but you're okay Japanagan. I laid down my foot and said we wouldn't talk about this in my household. I served in the US army to fight for equality and equal opportunity for all. I stood by that and still stand by that. X explained to me that they're sexist a d can't stand men. I ended the conversation and called family Y and told them they need to fix X or find a new place to live. I haven't heard anything back from either of them and I'm still seething. I refuse to be even something so small as friends with a racist or a sexist. I do not stand for discrimination and will fight to end it in all aspects of my life. It took longer for this update as I have been working but I felt it would be kind as to give everyone an update. I don't want to get into all that I've done for X and Y but I've bent over backwards and fought for them and their lives even while I'm now just a normal everyday Joe. I'm sick of it.

bu9ad8qc	Anesthesia is Not Effective for Mutilating Genitals of Infants   General Anesthesia  Putting infants to sleep is too dangerous for babies. Only local anesthesia is safe.    Sucrose "Our findings indicate that sucrose is not an effective pain relief drug. This is especially important in view of the increasing evidence that pain may cause short and long-term adverse effects on infant neurodevelopment," said Dr Rebecca Slater   https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/02/babies-sugar-pain-relief-warning  Sugar?  Are you KIDDING ME???? You think SUGAR will help a baby better deal with having his genitals flayed like a fish? I'm REALLY not from this planet.  You all are criminally DUMB!!!!!   Lidocaine “The adrenal cortisol response to surgery was not significantly reduced by the administration of lidocaine.”   https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3731671/  Dorsal Nerve Block and Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic Cream “Based on 35 clinical trials involving 1,997 newborns, it can be concluded that DPNB (Dorsal Penile Nerve Block) and EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic Cream) do not eliminate circumcision pain. None of the studied interventions completely eliminated the pain response to circumcision.”   https://www.cochrane.org/CD004217/NEONATAL_pain-relief-for-neonatal-circumcision   Why you ask?  The penile nerves are far too complex.  They are NUMEROUS and have many cords extending out into the skin.  While you may block the dorsal nerve the peroneal nerve is impossible to block and it innervates the plantar surface of the male genitals including the most sensitive part the frenulum which is destroyed during mutilation.   They are never fully numb because the dorsal nerve block doesn't block the pudendal nerve which innervates the plantar surface aka the most sensitive part the frenulum.  It is impossible without general anesthesia to stop the pain.  No matter WHAT YOUR CHILD WILL FEEL INTENSE PAIN!!!!  There is no numbing method available that is safe for infants that significantly reduces the immense pain of circumcision. 55% of the time no numbing method is used and much lower percentage In the past.   Innervation of the most sensitive part of the penis by perineal nerve is why EVERY single mutilation will carry extreme pain and psychological damage.  You simply can't remove the most sensitive part of a child without pain.  You can't put them under general anesthesia because it is too dangerous and the child might not wake up.  The best doctors have is the dorsal nerve block.  The creme and the sucrose sucker are every bit as stupid and asinine as they sound.  You go have a surgery on your genitals with a fu@king sucker.  Imagine rubbing a creme on your genitals and having a surgery. You should know kids are more sensitive to pain so it’s worse for them. Plus they don’t understand what’s happening. You do. Imagine how YOUR child will have the same horrible experience if you choose this for them. Imagine it happened to you or your husband. It’s trauma and it’s life long.   In this abstract you see the obvious cultural ignorance that the glans is the most sensitive part of the penis and therefore more valuable then the foreskin upon which rests the entire ridiculous notion that the foreskin or middle half of a man's penis has no value sexually.  Any intact man or even mutilated men can assure you with a few finger strokes that the underside or the lateral raphe, which is the line that goes up the underside of the male, is by far more sensitive then the glans.  Sorrells and Taylors studies debunk this cultural myth that American doctors fall for so easily as you can with your own finger.   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3629761   Circumcision of neonates and children without appropriate anaesthesia is unacceptable practice  https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0310057X1204000318  Abstract    Circumcision is painful surgery and appropriate intraoperative anaesthesia and postoperative analgesia is required. This is recognised in the policies of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and the majority of Australian State Health Departments. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence exists that neonatal circumcision continues to be performed in Australia with either no anaesthesia or with inadequate anaesthesia. This paper presents the evidence that neonatal circumcision is painful and reviews the available anaesthetic techniques. The authors conclude that general anaesthesia is arguably the most reliable way of ensuring adequate anaesthesia, although this may mean deferment of the procedure until the child is older. Local or regional anaesthesia for neonatal circumcision ideally requires a separate skilled anaesthetist (other than the proceduralist) to monitor the patient and intervene if the anaesthesia is inadequate. Topical anaesthesia with lignocaine-prilocaine (EMLA) cream is insufficient.   I have 2 intact boys. Happy and healthy. We don’t believe in genital mutilation. It also permanently alters the brain from the extreme pain no matter what 'numbing' agent they use.

9fw0j5yn	 The student council is meeting tomorrow and I want to suggest to raise awareness for men's problems but I am afraid of being labeled an incel/sexist/right-wing because of it. I understand why we have some groups for women only but to be honest - I don't feel welcome at my university as a man. It is really hard to describe my feeling because I understand the very real problem of sexism against women and that they may don't feel safe but at the same time I think the majority of men are being treated unfairly since they don't get any resources they may need. For example:  1. We got a study group for women only that is announced from many official sources every semester, like professors, study council, telegram channels etc.. We don't have a men only study group or one regardless of gender and the moment I would create and announce one, I would be socially dead. 2. Our only male course guidance (of three) retired and got replaced by a female one. I would have found it great if we used some resources to find another male one so that everyone (regardless of gender) can choose who they would like to go to out of personal reasons. If we had only male advisors, there would be an uproar. 3. The treatment of males in the study council itself sometimes is... weird. We had a team meeting for an event and our team leader said the we need to have a woman in it because we were all men. After I said that none of the women were interested in this event as we publicly announced it, he said he will just write one directly to ask to join us. This never happened in a group with all women.  So all I want to ask for tomorrow is if anyone has ideas what we could do to make our men feel more welcome/included/safe and I am really worried that even this question alone is enough to label me as an sexist incel or whatever words are being used right now. I do not want to say "Let's take away the safe spaces for women since there aren't any for men!" but I think it'll be taken that way. Just want everyone to have access to the same kind of resources and I am going to stand up for that, even if it brings tension to the student council which will make me leave it.

15it3r	Bell Hooks didn't use the phrase toxic masculinity very often.  Her writings largely predate the adoption of that phrase. But she did write a lot about the different ways she thought men and masculinity were defective, and she echoed the message that men need to change and redefine what masculinity is.  Some of her biggest examples though focused on black men in particular.  According to her, black men are bad fathers, bad husbands, and can't keep themselves out of jail long enough to establish functional families.  If you didn't know, many of these points have roots with white supremacy, and go all the way back to the era of slavery in the United States.  She blames all of this on black masculinity, which she says comes from black men trying to emulate the white ideal of masculinity (because their "maleness" is attracted to the "white patriarchy").  She goes into great detail about how rap music, pornography, pimping, and hustling, are the reasons that black men are unstable and unsuccessful in society.  But then she also says that black men have always been this way, even in Africa (seemingly contradicting herself in the process, and repeating another tried white supremacist myth).  Bonus points go to her views about interracial dating.  According to her, black men are too weak to handle black women, so that's why they try to date white women.  But those relationships never work because she says that white women are also weak.  Her solution?  White men (who are strong) should date black women (who are also strong).  Bell Hooks is largely credited with laying the groundwork for 4th wave intersectional feminism.  She is the icon that feminists point to when they talk about intersectional feminism and why they believe it to be better than the 3rd wave.  But to me, this doesn't look intersectional.  It looks like a black woman (with a fetish for white men) desperately trying to be accepted by white people, and by white feminism in particular.  And in doing so she adopted all of the traditional white prejudices against black men. Effectively using black men as a punching bag to gain white social acceptance for black women.  Her books *We Real Cool* and *Ain't I A Woman* are riddled with these prejudices. Wherein she also says, without irony, that it's black women whom people are the most prejudiced against in society.  And I think we really ought to be asking why this message struck such a large chord with feminists that they had to invent a brand new term, and start a new "wave", for it.  If you want to see some excerpts from her books, look no further than these threads on Twitter:  https://twitter.com/RezistansM/status/1149181945206792192   https://twitter.com/RezistansM/status/1471505895725010944  https://twitter.com/RezistansM/status/1204434280937656320  https://twitter.com/AfriThinka/status/1471541672253210630  And don't get me started on her views about male sexuality, and in particular gay male and black male sexuality. She argued that gay men prove that sexual depravity is caused by masculinity because gay men are also sexually depraved.  And her views on black male sexuality are even worse.  Following with her theme of repurposing white supremacist rhetoric, she paints black men as being uniquely predatorial.  She describes how black men rape so many black women that they run out of victims and have to move on to raping white women, and other black men, to satisfy their desires.  Implying that white fears over black rapists are justified because black men engage in a violent "black patriarchy" which is responsible for "gangsta culture".  Bell Hooks was not an icon for tolerance and acceptance.  She was a racist bigot, a misandrist, and a homophobe.  Her ideas have created division and hatred across modern society, and they need to be dismantled if we want to make any progress towards equality.	1643143850.0	scnlcy	/r/MensRights/comments/scnlcy/we_often_say_that_nobody_would_call_black_people/	We often say that nobody would call black people toxic, because it would be seen as racist.

ly77b7	 www.change.org/MattBillon  On November 24th,2021, a famous and well loved Canadian comedian by the name of Matt Billon hung himself. Despite this, very few comedians are willing to talk about the elephant in the room, that he was shunned and canceled by our own community for 3 years for something he was innocent of.  Matt was 42 years old  He had been in comedy close to 20 years.  To question this do so would knock over a house of cards; implicating a system of endemic corruption, fraud, pageantry and nepotism:  The things that Matt faced were frankly both unethical and immoral. I believe the focus should be directed to what happened opposed to who's responsible. If you are someone that believes in punishment then go ahead and go after those you feel deserve it, but I on the other hand would rather ensure that for the future these types of events do not happen again.  I hope that a supportive and open place for comedy exists and can be something that is protected and made so that all comedians and people in the industry can feel at home at regardless of where they came from. That accusations require proof and due process before we take on the zeal of the mob.  I wish that we can talk to each other and discover the truth without resorting to hysteria.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  In the words of a friend of Matts.  "Matt Billon was the kindest to all new and senior comedians. He had the love and respect from all the top pros as a great worker and a genuinely great guy to be around.  Horrible loss for stand up comedy.  And for real. Fuck all the fakes that turned their backs to him or even went out of their way to ruin his career, and now giving loving eulogies like you really cared. Stand up is full of the most spineless backstabbing cowards and Matt stood out amongst all of you for having integrity and kindness and professionalism."  I too am outraged by many of these backstabbing eulogies.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  Matt came runner for the Sirus XM Top Comic in 2015. This guaranteed him a prime spot for the JFL Gala. Matt was unable to attend due to health reasons but was guaranteed by Ben Miner(SIrusXMTopComic) and the JFL booker (Lara Rae) that he could get it whenever he was ready.  He never got his Gala.  Matt also told me that the year he came runner up, he won the popular vote but was denied access to look at the judges cards. He thought it was very strange.  Chanty Marostica on the other hand won the Sirus XM Top Comic in 2018 and would also win 2 Canadian comedy awards as well as a Juno Nomination. This would in effect make Chanty one of the most decorated comedians in Canada.  In February 2019, Billon was headlining a show with Marostica at the Hubcap Comedy Festival in Moncton, New Brunswick. He ran into Marostica before taking the stage, and made a point of congratulating them on their recent SiriusXM win.  During his headliner set, Billon made a lighthearted joke about trans athletes and how their inclusion was going to make women’s sports more exciting—a joke Billon had told plenty of times before, including in front of Tommy Chong who was present at the festival and a crowd of (appreciative) queer audiences.  "I'm excited for transsexuals finally being accepted into prime time sports, it means that that the WNBA ....is finally going to be watchable"  When he returned to the comics’ table backstage, Marostica had already departed, leaving a handwritten note informing Billon that they (i.e., Marostica) were trans and was devastated by the joke.  "Matt you asshole  I'm trans  Chanty"  By the time he’d finished his second set, Billon’s Facebook page was flooded with accusations of transphobia, following on Marostica’s social-media call out of Billon as a bigot.  He repeatedly tried to reach out to Marostica, offering to have a private conversation, or even a public discussion. He also tried to apologize for hurting their feelings. But as is usually the case in such controversies, these gestures only made the public attacks worse.  Billon received private messages expressing support—including from members of the queer community in Winnipeg, Marostica’s home town—telling him that this kind of behavior was typical of Marostica, and that he had done nothing wrong. In public, however, the silence was deafening. According to Billon, none of his fellow comedians stood up to defend his character. It was the cowardice of his friends and colleagues that hurt most, he later told me.  Matt said that what was hardest was having his fellow comedians abandon him during that time.  “None of his fellow comedians stood up to defend his character. It was the cowardice of his friends and colleagues that hurt most”-life of a comedian can be hard and brutal- article.  Chanty had a history of histrionics and has cancelled several male comedians, all of whom had done little with no evidence of malice. It would include Comedians Boyd Bank and Hunter Collins also over similarly innocent incidents. All three of the people who Chanty had cancelled had similar reputations, they were secure in themselves, well liked, funny and popular in the community .  I interviewed Matt for an article in July.(Article at the Bottom) We hoped that the article would bring Matt vindication and justice. We received a lot of positive support and thanks from around the world. Despite that, we received no public acknowledgement from anyone in in the Canadian comedy industry as it seemed to close to the nose.  He told me that Ben Miner and the JFL booker were polite but illusive as to when he would get his JFL gala spot; he asked if was about the Chanty incident , they casually dismissed that notion. It was only later that he heard that the JFL booker was in full support of Chanties attacks on social media.  But in October 2019, it was revealed that Chanty Marositca was involved in multiple sexual misconduct allegations with several female comedians.  Not everyone agreed to keep Marostica’s downfall out of public view, however. One video about the claims against the comedian has been viewed almost 800,000 times (making it several orders of decimal magnitude  more popular than Marostica’s actual comedy).  This was the work of the taboo-busting Montreal duo known as Aba & Preach—aka comedian Aba Atlas and Erich “Preach” Étienne who revealed the story to the world. Atlas also criticizes the growth of so-called “safe space” comedy rooms, which promise comedians an environment free of sexist jokes and other forms of retrograde humor. Atlas noted that these venues, paradoxically, can become breeding grounds for predation by engendering a false sense of security; and by allowing abusers to virtue signal as a means to address the cognitive dissonance created by their own wrongdoing (a phenomenon known in psychology, more broadly, as “self-licensing”). The video ends with a call to action directed at the media organizations that had been giving Marostica so much positive attention:  https://youtu.be/3ahyv5EpTj4  "I want all the big media outlets … CBC Radio, CTV—all the ones who’ve been putting Chanty up, all the time, as some kind of icon and role model for us to follow—I want you guys to come out and say something about this too, right? You guys want to take the time to bash Louis C.K. because he’s on a big platform, but what happens when one of your own is engaged in far more egregious forms of abuse? Everybody wants to be self-righteous, but nobody wants to look at themselves and their own behaviour.”  Despite their video reaching over 800 thousand view, this scandal was not reported by any mainstream Canadian or comedic journalistic body, of course until my article in the Quillete last August.  Well why you may ask? Because any investigation would render Chanty's comedic and moral authority moot as well as to those who granted them their powers. When we examine Chanty's comedy, it's mediocre at best and is undeserving of the top awards. At lease Louie C.K was funny and still he didn't sexually assault anyone.  Chanty's meteoric rise was in large part due to diversity, inclusion and equity policies that fraudulently license them to the status of "made man", making chanty untouchable. That was up until their own allegations came to light.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiClXLot3BA&t=1s  I invite you to look at Chanties Comedy Video's and the comments in the comment section.  I am a fan of all comedic arts, Chanties work is at at best, cringe worthy.  Why was it never acknowledged by Sirius XM, Ben Miner, JFL , the CBC, CTV or the Junos. Well I can tell you what It probably would make the establishment look like . It was conveniently ignored and swept under the rug. Chanty was the poster child of diversity, inclusion and equity in Canadian Comedy. An investigation would bring out more skeletons.  Matt was never issued an apology, Sirius XM never was investigated, the Juno's have never been audited as It should have done 2 years ago. Chanty Marostica quickly disappeared from social media, avoiding any social accountability and all discourse involving Chanty was erased; business continued as usual.  A business that supports pageantry over merit, identity politics over what is funny or truth.  At the end of 2019, Matt never got his vindication or acknowledgement for his pain from any of his peers or from the comedy institutions. Matt Billion had friends who worked in the Comedy industry who could have broken the silence, but non of them choose to do so..  last August I help write an article for the Quilette to help clear Matt's name and to systematically describe the structures of corruption in Canadian Comedy (Article on the Bottom). It was the first major publication of its kind detailing how and why behavior like this is prominent. We sent it to every newspaper and outlet. We sent it to the CBC, Ctv, the Junos, Sirus XM ect.... all fell on deaf ears as they've all have written glowing reviews and pieces of Marostica, most of which are still up and available online and on Youtube. By ignoring the elephant in the room, they can pretend it never happened at all. Business as usual.  In my research, I've interviewed dozens of comedians who've been ostracized and silenced by their community, often disproportionately or for no cause at all. They speak with a raw pain in their voices. Many of them have symptoms of post traumatic stress and relive their wounds again and again. These conversations are usually furtive, because public acknowledgement of the bullying will only earn more abuse. There is no justice, no accountability, not even a basic recognition that harm has been done.  Matt was different. He generally loved everyone and didn't speak much ill, not even of Chanty. But when I interviewed him he was honest regarding what happened and spoke very coolly, which is atypical for a canceled comedian.  But when we talked about his friends in comedy not defending his character, he voice betrayed him. For a small moment, you could hear a muffled scream suppressed in the back of his voice.  "My collogues, my fellow comedians,  they abandoned me.  They're cowards!"  I often hear those words when I'm alone, writing.  I'm not angry at Chanty Marostica but I'm outraged by the flagrant behavior of people like Chanty. I'm outraged with the institutions and people to enable behavior like this and it tortures me.  To speak out is to be made a target.  We have a duty to truth.  “Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us guiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.”  ― Dietrich Bonhoeffer  I'm furious. I am mad. I am tortured. I'm often in pain because of how hopeless it seems at times trying to express temperance to this insanity. .  My heart is with Matt, his friends and his family but it does not salve my outrage regarding this flagrant corruption and nepotism and fraud. I’m scared that if we’re unable to bring light to these matters, that the world may spiral into greater darkness ? I'm scared of being pushed into that dark.  I have good evidence suggesting that the Juno's and Sirius XM comedy awards are divorced from merit, choosing diversity, inclusion and equity as one of their main criterion for artistic success; not merit. This leads to creating an environment that is homogeneous, intolerant individualism and unfair. Like Chanty Marostica, Comedians and artists who follow in chanties footsteps are rewarded.  I invite you to look up Chanty Marostica's album and that of all recent Juno and Sirius Xm nominees and winners. Most of them are unequivocally banal, unfunny, unprovocative, unprofane and unprofound; resembling the out of the mill blasé CBC comedy junk lack any commercial viability or audience.  I often get rebottled with, since comedy subjective? No it's not. Funny is when there's a violation in ones expectations, it's when we make the absurd mundane and the mundane absurd. Comedy always lives within the realm of truth and if we're not able to speak it, then we've failed at our vocation.  That's my opinion.  Why don’t you look at Chantys work and come up with your own ?  I would like Matt Billon to get his vindication  I want justice.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfFZaVJ-XsU  This is a video interview of Matt Billon from last year, describing what had happened to him.

8390y6bv	[Part 1 Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/sb7ol7/my_abusive_mothers_history_of_making_police/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3): Thank you to those who read the first part. I appreciate the comments and especially the resources and suggestions some of you have bought up. I may be unable to do a lot of things in my current position, but I can at least research and later apply all that's been said to me. Lemme get started with Part 2.  My mom's first power over me was threatening to stab me or herself with kitchen knives as a discipling tactic when I was only 8 up to when I was 13 years old. Starting at 13, something that was mainly present throughout my early teen years, my mom's new power over me was in the form of police threats. She took away my defense system little by little to make sure I wouldn't protect myself or fight back against her abuse unless I wanted to have my reputation and future ruined with a false abuse allegation. Overtime, the more she got carried away with that power and the more she started using it for a lot of trivial reasons. Back when she used knife threats, she'd walk in my room with the knife already in her hand just to tell me to do a chore or something without me talking back, even though it was never something I would have talked back against. For the police threats, she'd ask me questions, mainly about puberty and girls and sex, and depending if I was uncomfortable answering or finding it hard to answer her questions she would threatned to call the police if I didn't respond. If she thought I was lying, she still threatned the same thing if she were to ever find out I was lying which I never did since my future was practically at stake. I remember one time, all this still taking place when I was 13 if not 14 at the time, my mom and I were sitting in the car and we were having an intense conversation. I can't remember what the topic was, but if I had to guess it was probably something as small as school or even smaller than that. The conversation only became intense when my mom wasn't seeing eye to eye, and instead of maurely talking it through like what I was trying to accomplish, she only become irrational as per usual. We weren't raises our voices, nor were we cutting each other off which is very rarely that's ever happened in moments like this. Hell, she wasn't even trying to fight me. Despite all that said, she suddenly blew up and said "HOW ABOUT I CALL THE COPS AND LIE TO THEM AND GET YOU ARRESTED, HUH!? WHO DO YOU THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BELIEVE!? YOU, THE CHILD OR ME, THE MOTHER!? A BOY HITTING ON HIS OWN MOTHER!!"  I spoke to my grandma while my mom was out busy with errands. I was hoping and expecting she'd say something along the lines of how messed it was for mom to be abusing her power as an adult and my parent, not to mention saying she was going to lie to the police and have my life ruined to win an argument, or lying to the police in general. Instead, she went on this long lecture about how 'family isn't supposed to call the police on each other. Family is important. We're supposed to love each other. We don't say we're gonna call the cops on each other one day and the next, and the next.' Near the end of her lecture, she basically treated the situation like it was a problem BOTH my mom and I had to deal with and not it being my mom who's the only one inciting this crap.   I asked for legal advice in a sub not too long ago and someone asked if my grandma would be able to play as my alibi if I ever did have to take things to court or get a lawyer if my mom ever does put me in jail one of these days. Realistically, no. She wouldn't. When I was younger, she would always save me from my mom's abuse and even used to fight for me. Call it old age, or just tired of going through the same routine for years at this point, but my grandma adapted this passive, enabling behavior that still pursists to this day. Back when I was 9 years old while my mom and I were living in my grandma's apartment, grandma would just sit in the living room drinking coffee and watching TV while my mom dragged and locked me in the bedroom with her while she abused me with belt whoopings, knife threats, punches to the face. I would cry, scream, shout for Nana to come help me but she never came. Depending on whether my mom abused me a certain day or not, grandma was always ashamed to take me grocery shopping with her because of my whoop marks and bumps visible all over my arms and legs. Not to mention, my bloodshot eyes from crying so much if the dried tear marks on my cheeks didn't say otherwise. There were small cuts that appeared on my arms and legs too, not bleeding but bright red and easy to notice. She was ashamed not because my mom put me in that physical state but because 'I don't want anyone thinking I'M the one who hit you that badly. Ooh, Lord! There's something wrong with that girl \[my mom.\] Ooh, Lord she made this kid look like this and people will be thinking I'M the only beating you this badly.'   I thought it was weird for Nana to always mumble this under her breath because nobody ended up confronting her about my physical state. No adults, not even the Walmart security guards and the occassional officer present looked in my direction aside from a passing glance and no one was giving Nana any weird looks or treating her passive aggressively. The only people intently looking at me was kids, kids who were my age or younger just staring at me and somehow sensing my sadness despite how neutral I tried to look or how much I was trying to turn my frown into a straight line if possible. Looking back maybe adults did notice but they chose not to do anything or they hid their reactions at the sight of me very well. That would explain the kids looking at me since kids are known to stare at people. They were probably seeing the same things others were but because of their young age, they didn't know better than to avert their eyes like everyone else. Even when I was dropped off at school in a fairly similar state, no teachers or other adults noticed aside from a few peers who only took the opportunity to make fun of all the spots - which were really scars - all over my arms and legs and how red my eyes were. Making fun of a boy their age crying and especially making fun of me when I protested and said it was "allergies that always made my eyes red!" I now wonder if the same thing would've slide if I were a girl walking around in that state, or instead of my grandma it was my grandfather taking me out in public like that.  I got completely side tracked from the whole 'mom's history of police threats' intent of this post. I'll make a part 3 about the times my mom threatened to put me on Beyond Scared Straight, threatened to put me in boot camps because of my "sensitivity," and even times where my reputation was almost at stake in school. I'll edit a link in place of this sentence for Part 3.	1643161594.0	scu0xa	/r/MensRights/comments/scu0xa/my_abusive_mothers_history_of_making_police/	My abusive mother's history of making police threats, Pt 2

mj8lymc	I saw [this post ](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CYpjdoOB1rZ/?utm_medium=copy_link) about women's fear while walking outside (being cautious at all time, constantly looking left and right even when she's alone) and there were lots of people replying to comments (mostly women sharing their stories and experiences) to tell them how men got it worse.    To me, this is an ineffective way to bring men's right into the conversation. Instead of understanding and relating and showing support, such as "I, as a dude, also got this feeling sometime, I live in the hood and it's pretty dangerous here. I'm sorry you feel that way, it sucks.", They make it about themselves, they make it into a competition to see who got it worse basically.    Imagine you tell someone "I had a bad day, couldn't sleep.". They reply "you got a bad day? I got the worst day! I haven't slept for 3 days! I don't eat either and you think you got it bad! What a joke!" Does that sound like a good friend to you?    This "who got it worse" is unfortunately common (in personal lives and in men/women rights). I talk about how I have been catcalled since I was 13 and a guy replied with "I would rather get catcalled in my hood than dodge stray bullets". While gun violence is a serious matter, that's not the point. I wouldn't tell a guy sharing his gun violence experience in the hood that "I got sexually assaulted!". Just because you got a problem doesn't make the other's any less of an issue that needs dealing with.     If you talk about men's getting falsely accused of sexual harassment, I wouldn't comment about women's getting harassed. That is rude and lack of social skills.    Another thing I have noticed is that these "I got it worse" people don't seem to be looking for solutions nor allies, they just want to compete. That isn't real *men's right*, men's right is well, to make it simple, bringing light into the problems that men have been facing and helping men. I don't see how competing against feminism gonna help with that.    In short, we should be working *together*, showing eachother support, not against eachother because we are on the same side, it's not men's problems Vs women's, the source of our problem is the same thing; inequality. We should be fighting that *together*.	1643203927.0	sd61uj	/r/MensRights/comments/sd61uj/the_way_to_raise_mens_right_and_awareness_is_not/	The way to raise men's right and awareness is not competing against women's and vise versa.
