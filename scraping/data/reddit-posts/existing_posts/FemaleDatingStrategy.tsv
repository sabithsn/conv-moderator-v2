v4qqb	When it comes to stories of wedding days and newlyweds - one thing always seemingly popped out all over the internet - the tale about "crazy" mother-in-laws who are seemingly hell-bent of making the life of her son's new wife miserable.  And this is common all over the globe. Hear all that stories about the MIL wear white dresses or straight-up wedding dresses to their sons' wedding? Meanwhile the wife's mother are often overly welcoming and accommodating of the new husband.  I believe it is part of the pickmeism situation due to their own dysfunctional relationship with a LVM husband. Often severely neglected, lonely and desperate for attention - they result to raise their sons as "second husband" and project all their repressed desire of love and attention to their sons. And since their sons do rely on them and growing up, give all their attention and love to the mom - when it times for the son to grow, leave the nest and build his on family - the mother become "crazy" from fear of being left alone and neglected - so they see the girlfriend/wife as "monster" and are trying to steal their "love" away.  That's why these "crazy" MIL stories often have a rather weird, incestuous vibe to it. Chloe\_ explain the phenomena pretty well here:  [Mama‚Äôs Baby: Why Sons are Not Husbands!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3fEtSu3-fs&t=1s)  Let's hear from the ladies who may have more direct experience with this!

I used to scroll through male-dominated subreddits pretty frequently, but now I just feel annoyed when I do.  There‚Äôs just too many annoying jokes about sex/genitals on other subreddits. I could be scrolling through a gardening subreddit and some scrote is talking about flower bulbs looking like balls and how they‚Äôre bigger than OP‚Äôs. Like, is that really necessary??  I‚Äôm just sick of reading material from the manosphere.	1642355659.0	s5ha95	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5ha95/i_only_read_femaledominated_subreddits_now/	I only read female-dominated subreddits now

67owdy62	As the title says. Back in my pre FDS days I thought I had pretty high standards but the truth is, I let men play me. I even once pursued a guy once because I really thought he was in to me ü§Æ (he wasn‚Äôt, he just liked the attention)  When I was in my early thirties, I went through a very painful divorce ( he cheated and was lazy and selfish) I was panicking that I would be single forever and cried a lot. I did lower my standards and met/dated some right fuckn weirdos. Awful!  So anyway, since discovering FDS and having extremely high standards, surprise, surprise, no man I‚Äôve met can reach them and you know what? That is okay.   I am truly set for life now. I live in a large old Victorian flat in a nice area which is clean and tidy at all times! I‚Äôm also mortgage-free, which feels amazing! I have a decent IT career and looking to specialise which means a bunch of studying and a big exam. Which I‚Äôm able to do as I don‚Äôt have to devote all of my spare time to a partner.   I am not telling you ladies not to get out there and try and date but if like me, you‚Äôve just had back-to-back scumbags and users don‚Äôt feel too cast-down or disheartened if you choose to be alone! It‚Äôs absolutely liberating. It‚Äôs the first time in my life I‚Äôve felt at peace and I have no intentions of dating again for the rest of my life! Ps I‚Äôm from the UK so I‚Äôm not shamed for being unmarried and childless thank god, although it would be good if this was normalised if not encouraged.	1642358832.0	s5ig4l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5ig4l/i_am_a_40_years_old_and_havent_dated_for_2_years/	I am a 40 years old and haven‚Äôt dated for 2 years and for the first time in my life, felt at peace with it.

h57msag5	We often discuss and share what I would call *External* Red Flags: behaviours observed in the potential suitor. For example: they don't respond quickly enough, their messages are short, they rarely initiate, they left you on read, they were online but didn't respond, they fall off the radar during the weekends, etc.  I would like to provide you with some Internal Red Flags in regards to texting. These urges stem from insecurity, and when acted upon, will render you in PickMe territory.  If you notice these Internal Red Flags, do not merely suppress the urge to behave in these ways. **Ditch the person who triggered you to feel this insecure.** *Acting* like you're cool and aloof, is playing into their mind games. *Acting* like you're happy and content while you are not, is self-betrayal.  If these tendencies recur with multiple suitors, Level Up before stepping back into the dating pool. Read up on attachment theory: you may be Anxious-Preoccupied. This makes you a target for abuse.  # Internal Red Flags  üö© You are consciously timing your texts back so you don't seem too clingy.  üö© You are preoccupied by the text conversation, ruminating and reading too much into things.  üö© You are **compulsively** checking your phone for a response, or waiting by your phone.  üö© You are **compulsively** checking their online or last-seen status, or checking for read-receipts.  üö© You drop everything to engage with them during the slithers of time they are available.  üö© You are blaming yourself, questioning what you did wrong to have 'caused' such distant treatment from their side.  üö© You suppress communicating your needs and worries regarding your texting related anxiety, in fear of being judged, ignored, or rejected.  üö© You are jumping through hoops in hopes of getting their attention: sending songs and links and memes and pics and vids and...  üö© You occasionally try to overcome your anxiety by acting distant yourself: sending late/short replies on purpose, only to become angry when this does not coax a reaction from your partner.  üö© You feel relief when you finally get a response.  &#x200B;  *(Expanded from my comment originally made on the post* ["I just fell asleep" Men that won't say goodnight or just dip from convos"](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s4fful/i_just_fell_asleep_men_that_wont_say_goodnight_or/).  u/barbedwiredaisycrown *requested them to be made into a post.

d7oax4lp	This is my first FDS thread, and I am still learning so much in this community thanks to you intelligent, enlightened women of all backgrounds. If I could offer just one small nugget of wisdom, based on my previous long term relationships and a marriage, it is this:  ***Find out if he was a loser in the past before you get involved with him. Trust me.***  Now, we have different ideas of what constitutes a loser in this situation, versus the societal idea of what makes a man a loser. For a lot of women, a man who is a loser is someone who hasn't leveled up to his potential in life, or who outright refuses to work on his issues and shortcomings, or is not financially independent, or can't flirt worth crap, or is hostile against women for his own personal failings, so on so forth. For some, the idea of a loser is probably someone who abuses themselves as well as other people, or someone who steals money to get their fix and not care who they hurt along the way, or someone who is a creep to people who are in a vulnerable position, ie much older men creeping on teenage girls, for example.  These are all very obvious examples and are insta-block-and-delete-able.  However, it is also good to be especially careful with the kind of loser that we all may have known in our formative years; the geeky guys who got bullied back in the day. The guys who seem smart but waste it on video games instead of studying. The guys who seem sweet, artsy, and maybe tormented, but couldn't get the popular girl to notice him (or that she was secretly filmed by him.. ew.). The guys who got rejected or dumped by a girl they were seriously in love with, and never found peace from it. The guys who had seriously spent years in his youth without any friends around him, and never sought help for that. The "late bloomers", if you will, who never got around to having a serious relationship or had sex before, before YOU came along.  These men are waiting for a woman... just *one* woman... to give him the benefit of the doubt, to fix him, to save him. And then, he unleashes all hell on her, as a way to get back at everyone, especially against other women, for making him feel inferior for all those years. That's all it takes. **One woman.** And that very same woman, could unfortunately, be you.  As a way to vet for this, just simply ask how his high school and college years went. That's it. Men are emotional when it comes to the past. They will open the floodgates-sometimes quite literally, tears and all-about how badly they were treated, how lonely or out of place they've felt, the whole nine yards. They reminiscent about things for far too long, much longer than women do, which is a bit strange, since we were always taught that it is women who are very emotional and teary-eyed about her years in her heyday. But in my experience? It is men, who never let go of the past. It is men, who cannot get over their exes, or the one who got away, whoever she is, and it will be YOU who will pay dearly for THOSE women's actions.  Women, on the other hand, at least from my observation, who got bullied back then, tend to try her best to bounce back from that, whether it's by losing weight and becoming healthier, or learning how to socialize better, or uses those experiences in order to be kinder to people around her. Men, by and large, don't use negative experiences to become a better person, but as an excuse to become fucking assholes to everyone around them.  The nerdy male aesthetic really took off especially during the 2000s, when being geeky and emo or twee or w/e was all the rage, and women were especially punished for wanting Chad when they could have chosen the nice guy in the glasses and grandpa sweater who could write her poems. And honestly? It was a horrible fucking mistake to let it get to me, and make me think I should give Mr Foreveralone a chance.  So to cap it off in a short sentence: If he was a loser back then, don't go out with him. You will be his dragon to slay for his own issues, instead of the princess that you really are, to be cherished by a man who's actually worth it.  Don't go out with ex-losers.	1642364190.0	s5kgw2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5kgw2/please_for_your_own_sake_find_out_if_he_was_a/	Please, for your own sake: Find out if he was a loser before.
74116cjl	I was very much socialized to believe that all women are catty and b*tchy, so for much of my life I had a hard time trusting them and forming close relationships with them. I really believed other women had a target on my back, and that we were all sort of in competition with one another. It was like being on IRL Bachelor except the men looked like sad Seth Rogans.   FDS has helped me realize that my attitude was pure internalized misogyny, and that women are actually incredible! Now I see women in a completely different light and my relationships with them are much more positive as a result. I no longer feel threatened or intimidated. Not saying trust is granted immediately because of course we still must vet our friends, but I feel much more confident about the process of forming female friendships.   Thanks for helping me snap out of it, FDS!	1642369058.0	s5mas2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5mas2/fds_thank_you_for_helping_me_to_open_my_heart_to/	FDS: thank you for helping me to open my heart to women
xotnn	Hello, ladies and happy Sunday! I made a short comment about this a few days ago and it seemed some of you were interested in hearing my story. i‚Äôll try to keep it mostly bullet points because the whole story could get long.   I‚Äôll jusy start by saying that this NVM borderline drove me crazy with his mind games. he was wholly inconsistent during the entirety of our short lived relationship. the first couple of weeks he love bombed me. after that he would disappear for several hours at times. beyond these obvious red flags i‚Äôll just dive right into the red flags on fire.   He mentioned regularly how he would never get married because he didn‚Äôt want to lose anything   he lived with his mother and still does several years later   he was most often unemployed, slept all day and stayed up all night smoking and playing video games   believes he is smarter than everyone else but could barely afford to feed himself   has a *huge* inflated self importance and massive ego, to the point of delusion   borrowed money from me when he was in a tight spot and then resented me for having the money to loan him, even tho I‚Äôll never get it back. this one really seemed to eat at him.   after all that he left me for a coke addict but instead of telling me that, he made a public spectacle of things and caused a huge fallout that affected our entire social group instead of owning up to meeting someone else. side note: this is a clear pattern, he love bombs people for a while and then drops them for someone else.   years later reached out and apologized for his behavior. then chose one of my friends to start dating (a new one he had not known before) I was totally fine with this, obviously. the girl was aware of his behavior and I wasn‚Äôt going to insert myself, we weren‚Äôt that close anyway so it didn‚Äôt mean anything to me. he tried so hard to make me jealous of her, but I never was because I just didn‚Äôt care. then he randomly blocked me again. I blocked back.  i‚Äôm happily married and have been for a while now. my husband is so nice to me and we have a beautiful life. meanwhile NVM is on around relationship #9 since me from what i‚Äôve heard thru the grapevine. all of which have been ‚Äúthe one‚Äù	1642369176.0	s5mcf3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5mcf3/my_story_of_the_worst_nvm_i_allowed_in_my_life/	My story of the worst NVM I allowed in my life, back in my pickmesha days üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

hrnht7l8	I believe Savannah casually mentioned this REDFLAG to watch out for. I wish I could remember which episode so I could correctly quote her, but I remember her words brought up a VERY clear memory for me.   I was once offered an extremely expensive piece of antique furniture to marry a man.   This woman, my at-the-time boyfriend's mother, was walking me around her expensive, well-decorated home. We were casually chatting and I mentioned I really liked a certain piece. She said she had just bought it and then bluntly added  ‚Äî  "If you marry my son I will give it to you." It was like plea for help honestly. I wish I could've seen my own face! I definitely remember one eyebrow raising very high.   This woman was so desperate to get rid of her own son that she basically offered me thousands of dollars!   I believe that was what Savannah was talking about. To watch out if your boyfriend's mother is trying to foist him onto you. Is she trying to free her own self from the bondage of a man baby?

I'm sick of seeing posts where the mother is blamed for all of the child's issues because she was abusive growing up. I had the same childhood. It was awful. And everyday I wondered why my father didn't try to help.  Women abuse their children, of course. Single mom's or divorcees can be awful people, believe me I know, but why didn't our fathers ask us.

86ugvp1g	If you‚Äôre new to the ‚Äúrooms‚Äù you are likely experiencing a lot of pain right now. You are confused. You are scared. You are not sure if you can live life without your substance of choice. Your skin feels like its crawling. Everyone at the meeting is inundating you with their brand of recovery: ‚Äúdo you have a sponsor; just don‚Äôt drink; one day at a time; keep coming back; it works if you work it...‚Äù They are all well meaning, and they genuinely believe in what they are telling you. You will feel like you are surrounded by love and support.   You‚Äôll feel safe when you hear the rules of that meeting: ‚Äúwe suggest men support men and women support women.‚Äù Then when you go to leave, men WILL follow you to your car to ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù to talk to you about the program.   Despite the rules, no one will do anything to stop it when it happens. If you ask for support, they will tell you ‚Äúprinciples over personality.‚Äù In other words, AA‚Äôs reputation comes before your need for safety. If you write a letter to AA‚Äôs World Service Organization, they will tell you that all meetings are self-governing, and that issue needs to be taken up at that meeting‚Äôs business meeting . You then plead for support at the business meeting. Not one man will step up and say: yes, we will assure you that this room is safe, and we will tell ALL MEN WHO HARASS WOMEN NOT TO RETURN. Instead, you will be told to go to a women‚Äôs meeting, so rapey men can continue to harass, rape, and murder women with impunity at co-ed meetings.   I spent 5 WHOLE years in the program. I did what I was told. Eventually, I would become one of the reputable female leaders of my home group. At 1.5 years sober my Mom died, while I was in the middle of a divorce, moving out of my married house, and sending my oldest of to college. I was considered a rock star to do all of that, without picking up a drink. AA earned the credit. Not me. According to AA, I am powerless, and if I didn‚Äôt have G-d on my side, I would have drank and eventually died with my mother. I believed it. I preached it.   But, also, deep down inside, my intuition (that I was told to ignore because it‚Äôs just my addiction trying to kill me) was telling me to find support somewhere else.   6 months after my Mom died, I had an argument with someone I believed was a friend. She had been continuing to use AA directives to attempt to make me feel better about my grief. I made it very clear on numerous occasions that being told to: make a gratitude list, help others, and that my grief was self centered fear, was not helpful.  I kindly shared what she could do instead - just hold space for me - that is all - just listen. Instead, mid-argument, when I was completely out of steam from begging my friends to telling me how to grieve, I screamed at the top of my lungs: MY FUCKING MOM DIED!!!!!!!!! The friend‚Äôs response: SO FUCKING WHAT. WE ARE SO TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT YOUR MOM AND YOU USUNG HER DEATH TO MISBEHAVE. This was only 6 months after her death, a few days before my first birthday without my Mom.   Even in the rawest most vulnerable moment in my life, I was not granted empathy. AA seems to only reserve that for people you should forgive, like rapist.   I was 2 years sober at that time. I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without AA? 2 years in, and, as you can read, I was getting hurt more than I was getting helped - there was enough bullshit that could plausibly give me permission to walk away. I stayed for 3 more years, lest I wanted to drink and die.   In that time, I supported at least  50 or more women with their early recovery. I profoundly value the time I spent with all the women I walked with. All of them shared raw, intimate, details of their painful childhoods, adolescents, and adulthood - these deeply vulnerable truths were shared with me, in trust of me. I will never forget every tear I watched fall down a recovering woman‚Äôs cheek. I could never bring myself to direct them to handle their trauma as directed by AA.    I am a trauma survivor. I am the person who was told (as directed in the literature) to apologize to a man who witnessed (and harassed me about it the day after it happened) my rape, for the resentment I had against him (because I ignored him when I saw him working at a diner I frequented).   ‚ÄúWhy did you ignore that bus person when he said ‚Äúgood morning?‚Äù   ‚ÄúBecause he witnessed my rape, and told me all the details when I woke up covered in blood, in a mocking manner, that I wanted it.   ‚ÄúOh, that sounds like a resentment to me; you need pray for him, apologize for being rude, and work on forgiveness because he is obviously a very sick man.‚Äù   This is AA direction. You are born an alcoholic, and alcoholics are inherently selfish, self-centered, and self-seeking, even when they are victims. Everything I did that didn‚Äôt measure up to AAs criteria for a spiritual awakening was summed up as ‚Äòyour alcoholism‚Äô, and ‚Äòyour innate fuckedupness,‚Äô and that I have to do better to work on forgiveness and ‚Äúletting go, and letting G-d.‚Äù  My final straw was a couple of years after a dear AA friend of mine was brutally attacked by her ex-boyfriend, while sleeping (he was 10 years sober). He would have killed her if a neighbor didn‚Äôt hear her screams. He spent 2 years in prison. When he was released, he was accepted back into the AA community with open arms. I had to listen to him cry about how terribly he regretted his behaviors, as if it was akin to stealing his mama‚Äôs purse. She killed herself shortly after he was released. Rumors about what she could have done differently to avoid being tortured, ran their course.  In this moment, I tried to imagine telling her to write down a list of all the resentments she had, directing her to outline her part in the resentment (was she selfish, self centered, self seeking, or dishonest), followed up by her apologizing to all of those she resented? How about making her outline a sex inventory as well, where all of her sexual behaviors are weighed in columns of shame. I couldn‚Äôt imagine it, because it is unethical, and no reasonable person with a even mild moral fiber would make such absurd suggestions. She died because of AA‚Äôs irresponsibility, and unwillingness to address the violent misogyny that is rampant in AA.   The light went on and I couldn‚Äôt turn it off, no matter what threats AA was proposing about my future without AA. I was not born alcoholic. I did not need to shame my behaviors. I did not need to blame myself for my rape because of my drinking. I was not powerless. I did not have to listen to men tell their stories, which included them bragging about all the women they abused, under the guise of humility. I did not have to pray for or forgive my rapist, nor excuse their behaviors because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust sick‚Äù. I did not need to turn my life over to a male-run organization. I did not need to serve another alcoholic to process my mother‚Äôs shocking death. I did not need to walk miles in the snow to get to a meeting, when I should have been home making snow angels with my kids. And I certainly did not need get better at accepting men harassing newcomer women.   I did not need to do any of these things to stay sober. Neither do you. You have choices, and you are not going to drink and die, if you don‚Äôt use AA. I‚Äôve been sober for more years out of AA, than in. You can too.   I have a feeling that comments to this post will be met with, ‚Äúbut it works for me‚Äù and ‚Äútake what you need, and leave the rest‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how I sponsor women or how women sponsor me‚Äù. Not only have I heard it all, Ive said it all. AA was my lifeline and no one could convince me otherwise, despite my own suspicions, I‚Äôd double down to protect AA.   Please don‚Äôt ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù ‚Äúnot all meetings‚Äù  me.   I‚Äôm not here to tell anyone how to recover. If AA works for you, that makes me very happy. I celebrate all recovery, regardless of the route of administration.   But this is FDS, and we are here to support maximizing female benefit, and I owe it to my sisters to warn them of the dangers of being a woman in male spaces, from my own experience.   If you are struggling to find a safe space to be sober, please feel free to outreach me via dm.

yz5qp	TL;DR: never date a man who constantly talks shit about the mother of his children.  My friend met this guy on Tinder and considered him talking openly about being a single dad a "huge green flag". Told her to ask if a mother is still in the picture, and he replied with a wall of text belittling the woman and giving a suspiciously detailed account of how she ruined their family and how he suffered because of the divorce.  I warned my friend that it's too elaborate to be the truth and a normal person would never spill everything to a total stranger and I'm ready to bet anything that he's the one who fucked up their marriage and got the custody by sheer coincidence.  Well, too bad I didn't insist actually betting on it, would be much richer now. Turned out I was 100% right and a judge gave him custody only because his ex-wife needed to move to another city for work and he coached children to tell how they have dozens of friends in school (they're don't because he never allows them to go anywhere after classes or invite classmates over) and feel suicidal from the idea of "starting over in another place".   So my friend was a free nanny for several months while he lied to her about them getting married and having more children (she wants a big family, like at least 5 kids), but only if she "proved" being worthy aka doing all the housewife shit without any ring and at her own expenses.	1642424162.0	s63fhi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s63fhi/a_few_months_ago_told_my_friend_dating_a/	A few months ago told my friend dating a particular single dad is a mistake, she said I'm being prejudiced. Today sent me a long paragraph about how right I was.
5eyjl40e	From Readers Write, my all-time favorite section:      "**IN THE EARLY** years of my marriage I started a journal. Day after day I would steal a few moments to write: on a bench by the playground swings; in a chair beside my mother at the nursing home; or just before collapsing on my unmade, laundry-covered bed. It was a difficult time. My father had died unexpectedly after what was supposed to have been a routine medical procedure. My mother, always depressive and nervous, was slipping into dementia. I had a rambunctious toddler we suspected was on the autism spectrum and a baby who needed to be strapped to my chest from sunup to sundown. The journal writing was a desperate attempt to carve out some space for myself amid the chaos of caring for others.  And it helped. I filled countless notebooks over the years with my sloppy, sometimes angry handwriting. Eventually a central theme emerged: my empty marriage. I realized I was unsupported by my husband while also being responsible for too many other people. Everyone who needed me, though, genuinely needed me. I didn‚Äôt begrudge them. It was my husband I resented: the man who came and went without an inkling about the household, made some money, interacted with us minimally, and fell asleep easily, as only a person who depends on someone else can. Perhaps because this realization was unwelcome, or because my time was stretched too thin, I shelved the journals and stopped writing.  Soon after that, my marriage began to implode. We had fights in which I would ask for respect, emotional support, agency. He would remind me that he had a job that kept him busy. (So did I.) He would point out that he had, in fact, taken out the trash every week and done some grocery shopping. His checklist of what it took to be a good partner and parent was shockingly simple. Coming from a working-class immigrant family, though, I couldn‚Äôt fight his logic. Work, trash, and groceries equaled survival.  When we moved to another house, I threw away my dusty journals. I was pregnant with a third baby, and our prospects weren‚Äôt good. If my husband was content with this pared-down version of me, I decided, I could be, too.  Years later, when I finally gave him an ultimatum ‚Äî to be present with me or leave ‚Äî he asked, ‚ÄúWho will take out the trash?‚Äù I was stung by the implication that my worth was paid for in garbage-removal services, and embarrassed that his question also made me nervous: What if I couldn‚Äôt survive without his help, minimal as it was?  I now have the answer: my teenage boys and I take out the trash every Wednesday, with lots of laughter and good-natured complaining. It takes all of five minutes. Trash night is a weekly reminder of my independence and capability, of the cohesion of this family with me at the helm. I‚Äôve almost come to enjoy it."	1642428677.0	s64w2o	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s64w2o/the_sun_magazine_inspiring_post/	The Sun magazine inspiring post

amm3tygb	I recently broke up with an initially seeming-HVM who turned out to be a "Mr. Sensitive" from Lundy Bancroft's *Why Does He Do That?* If you're not familiar with the Mr. Sensitive profile, I suggest [this FDS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/p771vi/why_does_he_do_that_by_lundy_bancroft_has_a_whole/) or [this blog post](https://www.muchnessmama.com/profile-of-an-abuser-mr-sensitive/). The blog post almost perfectly describes my experience.  Mr. Sensitive is one of the most insidious types of abusers because of his convincing cover. He frequently comes across as gentle, caring, and deeply empathetic. Because of this, it can be difficult to see the abuse/manipulation as it starts to creep into the relationship.  Instead of anger and rage, Mr. Sensitive uses his sadness, vulnerability, and hurt feelings to control you. He may never lay a hand on you, but he subtly goads you into proving your worth by constantly being hurt by something you did or did not do. Over time, the implicit message that you're not "good enough" erodes your self esteem. If you're constantly focused on how to avoid injuring him, and on proving how much you love and care for him, you can't put your energy into your own wants and needs.  Because I know how difficult this can be to detect, I wanted to share two real-life examples from my relationship, as a case study in how this dynamic may play out. For brevity, I'll split the stories into two posts.  First, I want to say that out of context, this anecdote will make the relationship seem like it was entirely awful, but that's rarely the case at the beginning. He had so many of the traits I was looking for -- Handsome, fit, incredibly intelligent, thoughtful, successful in his career and extremely well-off financially, similar hobbies and values, generous and affectionate, great sex, in therapy and seemed committed to his personal growth and development.. I wouldn't have spent two minutes with him if he hadn't shown these positive traits.  I recognize that the desire to return to how good things were in the beginning is an incredibly seductive force, and is the reason I didn't immediately leave. However, rest assured that I saw what was happening, I gave it as much of the benefit of the doubt as I could, and I got out fairly quickly after these incidents. **I respectfully ask that any advice or "you should have..." comments are offered gently, as otherwise this can be re-traumatizing for victims**. I also feel very confident that I recognize where I should have done better, and overall feel very proud of myself for recognizing what was happening, holding firm to my boundary, and not staying for very long.  Now, for the story.  # Weaponized Trauma  A bit of context is important. He shared with me early on that he had PTSD from his past emotionally abusive relationship. I remember a red flag going up when he told me that, because Bancroft stated that men who claim abuse are frequently the abuser. I made a mental note of it, to continue to observe and vet. As more details came out, I felt more comfortable believing his story. He eventually told me that his ex had been an escort, though she hadn't revealed that to him until they had been together for some time. Despite not really being ok with it, he continued to stay with her for several years. He also told me she had a personality disorder. He didn't share many details, but from what I gathered there were some violent episodes on her part.  At the time of the incident in question, our relationship had been going wonderfully. There had been conflict, a few instances where I felt suspicious that he was using his intense "sad" emotions to gain the upper hand, but nothing that felt too far beyond the realm of normal relationship annoyances and couple conflict. We also had many instances of healthy communication and conflict resolution to balance it out. Overall, I was immensely happy.  One evening, he took me out for dinner and a play. As the show was about to begin, I made a passing comment about how I thought I'd like to try out for community theatre. Acting is something I have a talent for, that I had hadn't a chance to pursue for a while. I assumed he would be happy for me for deciding to pursue one of my passions.  The rest of our evening was lovely, until we were about to go to bed. He made a matter-of-fact comment about how when I told him I wanted to audition for a play, his first thought was "What if she's in a play and she has to kiss someone?" but then he sort of dismissed it himself, like "Haha, but you wouldn't do that."  I looked at him and said "No, I would take a part with a stage kiss."  The exact sequence of events at this point is murky to me because it was so confusing and hurtful, but I do remember certain beats. I remember that he started shaking and trembling. I remember telling him "I don't understand, it's just acting?" and him saying "She would say it was just acting too." I remember saying "I don't know what you need right now?" and him saying "I want you to tell me you won't do it," and telling him very firmly that I wasn't going to agree to that.  Then, I remember him saying how it's not that he doesn't trust me, it's the idea of someone else potentially having desire for me, and getting to act on that desire, that is incredibly painful for him.  This put up a HUGE red flag for me, and my own past trauma was triggered. This was very, very similar to things that a physically and verbally abusive ex boyfriend had said to me, that boiled down to the belief that I was responsible for managing other men's attraction to me in order to spare his feelings.  I was having an intense emotional response at this point, almost a "fight or flight" response where I felt I needed to fight to very clearly establish that this was not ok with me, what he was asking was controlling, and I was not going to agree to it. At the same time, I was doing my best to repress those feelings in order to soothe my boyfriend in his panicked state.  The rest of it is a bit of a blur, but as he started to calm down he asked me to hold him and caress him. I continued to stuff down my feelings to soothe him, until I just couldn't anymore. I excused myself to another room and cried on the floor, feeling so hurt and confused, and questioning whether I could stay in this relationship if this was what it was going to be like.  When I came back, he was panicking that I would leave him, and then I was expected to comfort him about that instead. I felt so, so drained.  After that night, we spent some time trying to resolve the issue, but the heart of the conflict seemed to shift over time.  At first, it was about how we would handle the situation in question. I offered to agree to not take any roles with a stage kiss for X amount of time, if he committed to working through the painful feelings that brought up in him. He refused, insisting that he had already "done the work" and his trauma wasn't something he would ever get over. I offered to let him come to rehearsals, read the script, meet the person in question... None of that was acceptable to him.  Then, it became more about how I would handle his emotions. The narrative was, "Well, I could try to be ok with this, but it would be so difficult for me, and I would need so much emotional caretaking and reassurance from you, and you struggle with that, so I don't know that we would survive it." I remember that feeling almost like emotional blackmail, "If you do this thing, I will make it so unpleasant for you that you'll wish you hadn't done it."  Then, the core issue wasn't how we would handle me being in a play with a stage kiss, it was my behavior that night. Now the narrative was that he was having a trauma response, and the "one" time he really needed me (in reality he had had two or three episodes that were similar to this one, just not as intense) I wasn't there to support him and comfort him, and therefore he didn't trust me to meet his needs, and was distancing himself from me. I felt like I was being punished with withdrawn affection for asserting a boundary, and I was expected to re-earn the level of love and affection he had been giving me up until that point. It felt awful.  Never mind how hurt and scared I felt in that moment, that my own trauma had been triggered, his pain was what mattered. Right up until the end, I don't remember him ever showing any curiosity or concern about what I was experiencing, how hurt and scared I was, or my emotional experience. All I wanted was for him to say, "Clearly I have more work to do to address the pain I'm bringing from my last relationship to this relationship. It makes sense to me why that night was scary and hurtful to you, I'm committed to doing better and making sure that my trauma doesn't hurt you or prevent you from doing the things you love." And then of course, action to back it up.  But he wouldn't. And I feel fairly confident in saying that he wouldn't because this wasn't about him working through his trauma, it was about *leveraging his trauma to gain my compliance.*  Looking back, one of the most disturbing things about this incident is that what he was describing as a "trauma response" didn't start when he first had painful thoughts about someone kissing me in a play, *it started when I said no.*  It was awful, but I'm so thankful that I also recognized what was happening, my intuition was screaming at me that this was wrong, and I was able to use that information to leave shortly after.  I hope this story can be helpful to other women, and helps you to identify signs of this type of abuser in your lives. 	1642440037.0	s699fs	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s699fs/case_study_of_dating_mr_sensitive_part_i/	Case Study of Dating Mr. Sensitive, Part I: Weaponized Trauma

He said he could not be honest bc I'm an overreactor, just like how I'm overreacting now. Then he goes on to say that he's been dealing with people overreacting about his age for years. It gets old (lol). He said it if wasn't a big deal, I wouldn't be bringing it up, accussed me of being fascinated with his age and said he would never do that to me.  I am soooo thankful for FDS and that post on a foolproof vetting strategy.

Men don't have to do anything, not even care enough to buy a ring. I have read a post by a woman, whose partner said he wanted to have a baby with her. She needed to figure out how to tell him she wants to get married first, she did and he proposed without a ring on Christmas.  I would be dead embarassed.	1642460677.0	s6hqgr	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6hqgr/he_proposed_and_a_few_days_later_we_went_ring/	'He proposed and a few days later we went ring shopping'

5eyjl40e	Someone mentioned here about being told that she was "good for" a man, then realizing what a shitshow he was. Quick vetting strategy: **center yourself, and ask "is this good for me?"** Your immediate physical and emotional reactions will tell you all you need to know. If you're in doubt, and you ask out loud, other people's reactions, including micro-expressions, will tell you the truth.   It's a good way to get away from pickme thinking, where all of our energy is expended being good for a man, good to a man, doing for him, and being subservient, while denying your needs and wants. What does he do for you? how often? how much effort? with what attitude? A truly healthy relationship should be mutual, reciprocal, with give and take on a fairly even basis. It won't always be equal; that's not life, but it will even out over time.   Quick example: let's say you're out shopping, and you see something and think of your guy. You want to buy it for him, but something stops you. Suddenly you realize it's been x amount of time since he bought you anything. So you don't buy it. And you re-evaluate him and your relationship to gauge if he and his effort are enough for you.   Or conversely, you see something, realize he just bought you something, and you realize you've been giving to each other regularly for a long time. You buy it, think nothing more about it, because you know your relationship is reciprocal and mutual.	1642463055.0	s6imvh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6imvh/always_ask_reciprocally/	always ask reciprocally

tfi8qd	No, he‚Äôs not ‚Äúin the process of a separation.‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not in a ‚Äúdead bedroom‚Äù and ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt had sex with his wife for over 2 years and not attracted to her.‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not finding ‚Äúthe perfect time to leave‚Äù because ‚Äúit‚Äôs Christmas next month, and her birthday is next week!‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not continuing to be with her for the ‚Äúkids‚Äù.  No, he‚Äôs not ‚Äúmadly in love with you‚Äù and you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhis soulmate‚Äù.  Yes, he‚Äôs using you for cheap, easy sex. Plain and simple.  These men are never actually separated or in the process of a divorce. They will never leave their wives for you. They‚Äôre happy having their cake and eating it too.  You will continue to be his plaything while he continues coming up with every excuse in the book as to why ‚Äúnow isn‚Äôt the right time to leave her babe‚Äù, and how if you continue squandering more of your youth away, he will leave her and you‚Äôll finally be together!  Ok, so what about the minuscule amount of times where a man actually leaves his wife for you? If he‚Äôs willing to cheat on his wife and destroy his marriage for you, he‚Äôs willing to cheat ON YOU AS WELL.  Married men who actively cheat on their wives are the shit stains of the earth. Never entertain these men ever. Don‚Äôt believe them when they tell you that they‚Äôre going through a separation. ALWAYS verify! I‚Äôd go as far as messaging his wife confirming if his story or true or not. Watch him shit his pants when you even suggest it.  Please don‚Äôt give up your precious time and dignity and fall for these pieces of shit. I cannot stress this enough, but I thought I would remind y‚Äôall that this is a tale as old as time and many people continue to fall for it.

8lbmtjtl	Early twenties here. FDS opens your eyes to patriarchal conditioning.   **Men don't want you to trust your emotions or have boundaries because it makes them unable to manipulate and abuse you.**   **MEN DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK**   1. I vaguely remember the words, but my mother recently recalled the event and confirmed that yes, I did say it to my father : "That is what a father should be like." This was when I was around 5-7. And it was in relation to me observing how my father's friend "X" treated his own daughters: with love, warmth, and compassion.  **A child can sense when they are not loved. A woman does as well.**  **A child can sense when they are fake loved. A woman can as well.**  **A child can tell they are not loved enough. Us women can as well**  I dare say, a child is highly attuned to their emotional self and can accurately feel and understand the emotional availabily of others and the amount of emotional feedback they are getting. **We can as well.**  What I think a child cannot do properly at that age is "analyse" it and connect the events in a more conscious "complex" manner. It happens unconsiously, which translates to emotions when we are children. When we are grown up, we can analyse. And what is an LV's/NV's/ZV's greatest enemy? A woman who begins to **think**.    What stops us from trusting our emotions and instincts is patriarchal conditioning: we are hysterical, emotional, weak, "don't be like a child", "no man will want you if you do xyz", " cry baby" , "grumpy hag", **"men don't like emotional women"** , **"don't think too much about it**", **"just go with the flow"**  If **child me** knew that she deserved love and compassion, what made adult me think she deserved less?   2. Obviously, my father took offense to that statement. I was a child. He held a grudge. Also repeatedly mentioned that why don't I go have "X" as my father. Instead of analysing his own behaviour- a GROWN  man with a decade age gap from my mum, and find out why his own child felt a lack of love, he decides to ... punish me with his cold behaviour. Result? I got anxiously attached (and later avoidantly attached). I can say it with confidence because I vividly remember the insistent anxious urge to please him, to make him love me, to prove that I am worthy of his love, to idolise him, to think that he is the best father in the world.   3. Concurrent with all the above, I was aware that my father was abusive to my mother. Men think that children won't see and understand, but we do. I was and still am acutely aware of how my father was, in my child's mind "not good" to my mother.  **How a man treats his wife affects how a man treats their daughter(s)**   **Women, no father is better than an abusive father. Whether it's emotional, financial, and/or physical abuse. No man is better than an abusive man. Being single is better than having a bf/being married**  4. Forgiveness. I never will forgive. And it's okay to never forgive. Fathers are meant to protect their children. Men know how dangerous other men are. Fortunately or unfortunately, at that young age I realised that **men love other men, he will love and believe and trust his other friend "Y" more than me... because men are right** And as a child I sensed it, and so I never revealed it. It still haunts me, and I get an immense sense of satisfaction, emotional justice and joy when I hear about Y's misfortunes from the grapevine.   **Leave. It doesn't get better. It never gets better. You will develop even more painful scars.**  Healing takes a while. It can feel like you are stuck in a contant wave and then there is a sudden flick of a switch. You may never forgive your abuser, and it's 100% valid. Instead of forgiveness, decenter men from your life and see them for who they truly are. **Forgive yourself from doubting yourself**.   **We are conditioned to not reveal men's bad behaviour towards us. So when you hear a negative account of a man from your vetted friends, believe them (HV men will also hint at an LV man's behaviour, however beware it might also be an LVM posing as an HVM to gain your favour)**  If it wasn't for FDS, I would still have been grappling with forgiveness. Religious leaders love to preach about forgiving the man, their entitlement to it, and their superiority to women hence expectations of women's submission to them. **Men choose to forgive, women are TOLD to forgive.**  For years I couldn't forgive, and it just made me more angry, more hateful towards my abusers, and inexplicably more angry at myself - **I was at war with myself because I was betraying my emotions, and minimising my hurt.**   For years I was stuck in a wave of emotions, of perpetual anger and hatred, an inability to forgive my abusers, but now as I am writing all this down, I felt the flick of a switch. I forgive myself.   - **My emotions are valid.**  - My anger is valid.  - I don't **need** or **should** or **have to** forgive.  - **I am entitled to never forgive**.  - **Men are not entitled to my forgiveness**  - **My experiences are valid**  - **I am not alone**  - **I am not imagining things nor am I hysterical**  - **I have the right to feel angry and to never forgive abusers**   And that finally makes me feel at peace with myself. It's draining. It's relieving.   I believe good men exist. But there are more LV, ZV and NV men than HV men. **What men don't like is boundaries because then they can't manipulate you and abuse you**  Edited for grammar mistakes, clarity and formatting.	1642500091.0	s6u2g4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6u2g4/fds_changed_me_and_gave_me_a_healgasm/	FDS changed me and gave me a heal-gasm.

5d02esag	I am not a mean person, truly, i know it weird to say this in writing but i‚Äôm really not a nasty, awful person that picks on people for no good reason, neither am i condescending or patronising. I‚Äôve always been confident, nice enough to make plenty of friends, i get along with people in general, rarely do i have major problems or fights with others. Yet, since i‚Äôve started at my new job, i‚Äôve been made fun of and picked on more than my entire high school life. I don‚Äôt know what i did wrong but for some reasons, my coworkers enjoy poking fun at me for no reason. I tried laughing it off when it was just one guy but others joined in and i couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. So one day, i just snapped.   There‚Äôs this ongoing joke that i don‚Äôt work hard at work because when I first started, meaning my first week, i didn‚Äôt pull my weight enough. Obviously by my third week i was in full swing but the guys I work with, because there‚Äôs only two other girls that work at my place and I don‚Äôt see them that often since their work hours are different, still joke around about it. Highly exaggerated of course, they act like I fucking stood in a corner and stared into space for ten hours. I did my job of course. I could handle the jokes, even if they made me feel like shit, I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that can‚Äôt handle a joke at their expense every now and again. I would joke back or laugh it off. That was until one brand new coworker, who honestly was just a compete dickhead to begin with fuck I hate him so bad, that had just started a few days ago began joining in with the jokes and that‚Äôs when i just got so sick in my stomach. It was after most of the customers left and the place was pretty quiet, we were standing around, talking and then the conversation stirred toward me. One of our regular customers, who we all hate, said he applied to start working at our store and when he left the guys were laughing about it, talking about how he‚Äôd never get hired and then one worker said ‚Äúcan you imagine working with him? He wouldn‚Äôt do shit. He‚Äôd make *** look good‚Äù.   I just so sick y‚Äôall, I was almost finishing a eleven hour shift, no lunch, forgot to go on my break and the guy who made the joke was a new part timer who just clocked in. I blew up on them, when they finished laughing because gosh it was so funny eh? I asked them what the fuck was their problems, how they were all dickheads and told them all to go fuck themselves. I also told them I‚Äôd go to the manager and let him know how I felt about the way I was being treated by them (everyone is terrified of our manger). They were so shocked it was insane, did they really have no idea I didn‚Äôt like the jokes?   Idk, maybe it was because they were all men, older than me (I‚Äôm 18) and i just felt so tired of being ridiculed and patronised but i couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore, not when i had some guy who JUST started cracking hurtful jokes. It‚Äôs like he saw the way they treated me, constantly being demeaning and thought‚Äî aah this is my calling, lemme join in real quick.   Now at work, we do not converse, don‚Äôt talk unless necessary and we are very civil with each other. I have four other male coworkers (for some reason the girls i work with are never this way with me, we get along so well) and they act like i‚Äôm some hysterical monster that‚Äôs going to erupt if they say good morning.  I was just so sick of being picked on and made fun of and being the one that everyone is laughing at, it didn‚Äôt feel good. Like i would be wiping down a table and one of them would walk past and say, ‚Äúwow! i didn‚Äôt know ** could clean‚Äù ‚Äúfinally ** is doing some work around here‚Äù like i haven‚Äôt been doing a overtime hour shift for the last three days. It got to them calling me stupid when i‚Äôd ask them a question about anything tbh, or an idiot. I hated the way new coworkers were joining in, i just wanted to be friends with them, i wanted to just get along and be a team. I know i screwed it up, but they knew i didn‚Äôt like those jokes, i never laughed at them. i told them it felt hurtful, now i‚Äôm not a good team player? now i‚Äôm excluded for conversations and feel like an outsider? why? because i just wanted to be treated well and with a little respect? Im glad the jokes have stopped and they barley meet my eye. it‚Äôs better than whatever the fuck was going on before. i was dreading going to work every morning, i would just sob on the bus ride home. i don‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm content with that. Sure work would be so much more fun if we got along with one another but I truly don‚Äôt care if they think I was being sensitive or emotional about it. I knew it was bad when my supervisor (who is also a woman) asked me one day why I let them talk to me like that. Just constant constant demeaning things, all the god damn time like just be nice please, I‚Äôm begging you, just be kind. If I had to scream at them till they thought me unhinged, then so be it. At least now they don‚Äôt dare to crack even the smallest of jokes around me, even if I just want to joke around a little and chat with them. Oh well, I‚Äôd rather feel bored at work than I‚Äôm the verge of tears everyday.	1642537641.0	s76ze9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s76ze9/being_disrespected_at_work/	Being disrespected at work
11avbw	My HVM father always told me that experiences can make you bitter or better, and I agree. YOU decide if you learn from a bad experience and YOU  have the power to avoid making it again. Here‚Äôs how I process my cringey pick-me behavior from years ago:  (1) Get reminded of a time you debased yourself for a man‚Äôs approval or ignored a major red flag.   (2) Don‚Äôt fight it; experience the memory and remember how small, sad, and pathetic you felt when you prioritized a man‚Äôs opinion over your own dignity and happiness. Journal your thoughts if that works for you.   (3) Take a moment to be Captain Hindsight and list off your shoulda-woulda-coulda‚Äôs. Roll your eyes at your past self. Think of what you should‚Äôve/would‚Äôve/could‚Äôve done differently.   (4) Accept that it is in the past and nothing can change that, but recognize that the future is entirely in your control.   (5) Forgive your past self for making mistakes. Be patient with your younger self, as she did not have the wisdom you possess now. We‚Äôve been conditioned to accept abuse from men and there‚Äôs no shame in falling for society‚Äôs lies. There‚Äôs only shame in doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.   (6) Promise yourself that you‚Äôll never make yourself feel that way again, and be proud of all the progress you‚Äôve made. Celebrate how far you‚Äôve come since then and how much stronger you‚Äôve gotten. Pat yourself on the back for getting out of a shitty situation. Cringing at past behaviors means we‚Äôre learning, growing, and evolving- it‚Äôs unpleasant but it‚Äôs a good thing!   (7) Finally, and most important of all, SHARE your wisdom with your sisters. Help them avoid the mistakes you made. Exchange stories and strategies. Say something when you see a queen accepting shitty treatment. Be supportive when a woman in your life needs help breaking free. Uplift the women in your life and arm them with the knowledge that we don‚Äôt owe men anything! Preach the gospel of FDS and turn your negative experience into something positive and constructive!   If you learn from a mistake, then you‚Äôve paid tuition for the school of life. If you don‚Äôt learn and repeat your mistake, then you‚Äôve just wasted your time. It‚Äôs important to remember our experiences, but beating yourself up doesn‚Äôt help.   Every shitty man I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune of interacting with taught me something that I added to my list of ‚Äúred flags/absolutely nots.‚Äù Make a physical list if you need to! You can vet men more efficiently if you have a mental checklist that is constantly being updated. I knew I had found my HVM when he checked off every requirement and my constant vetting has yet to uncover any dealbreakers.  Edit: Reworded some things, added some more detail. Also wanted to add that I‚Äôm a very data-driven strategist and I love this sub because it‚Äôs a place where we can amass data, share experiences, and support each other fiercely. Keep your heads and standards high, queens!	1642541962.0	s78ntb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s78ntb/forgive_yourself_for_past_mistakes_with_men_but/	Forgive yourself for past mistakes with men, but never forget

v4qqb	When it comes to stories of wedding days and newlyweds - one thing always seemingly popped out all over the internet - the tale about "crazy" mother-in-laws who are seemingly hell-bent of making the life of her son's new wife miserable.  And this is common all over the globe. Hear all that stories about the MIL wear white dresses or straight-up wedding dresses to their sons' wedding? Meanwhile the wife's mother are often overly welcoming and accommodating of the new husband.  I believe it is part of the pickmeism situation due to their own dysfunctional relationship with a LVM husband. Often severely neglected, lonely and desperate for attention - they result to raise their sons as "second husband" and project all their repressed desire of love and attention to their sons. And since their sons do rely on them and growing up, give all their attention and love to the mom - when it times for the son to grow, leave the nest and build his on family - the mother become "crazy" from fear of being left alone and neglected - so they see the girlfriend/wife as "monster" and are trying to steal their "love" away.  That's why these "crazy" MIL stories often have a rather weird, incestuous vibe to it. Chloe\_ explain the phenomena pretty well here:  [Mama‚Äôs Baby: Why Sons are Not Husbands!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3fEtSu3-fs&t=1s)  Let's hear from the ladies who may have more direct experience with this!

67owdy62	As the title says. Back in my pre FDS days I thought I had pretty high standards but the truth is, I let men play me. I even once pursued a guy once because I really thought he was in to me ü§Æ (he wasn‚Äôt, he just liked the attention)  When I was in my early thirties, I went through a very painful divorce ( he cheated and was lazy and selfish) I was panicking that I would be single forever and cried a lot. I did lower my standards and met/dated some right fuckn weirdos. Awful!  So anyway, since discovering FDS and having extremely high standards, surprise, surprise, no man I‚Äôve met can reach them and you know what? That is okay.   I am truly set for life now. I live in a large old Victorian flat in a nice area which is clean and tidy at all times! I‚Äôm also mortgage-free, which feels amazing! I have a decent IT career and looking to specialise which means a bunch of studying and a big exam. Which I‚Äôm able to do as I don‚Äôt have to devote all of my spare time to a partner.   I am not telling you ladies not to get out there and try and date but if like me, you‚Äôve just had back-to-back scumbags and users don‚Äôt feel too cast-down or disheartened if you choose to be alone! It‚Äôs absolutely liberating. It‚Äôs the first time in my life I‚Äôve felt at peace and I have no intentions of dating again for the rest of my life!

h57msag5	We often discuss and share what I would call *External* Red Flags: behaviours observed in the potential suitor. For example: they don't respond quickly enough, their messages are short, they rarely initiate, they left you on read, they were online but didn't respond, they fall off the radar during the weekends, etc.  I would like to provide you with some Internal Red Flags in regards to texting. These urges stem from insecurity, and when acted upon, will render you in PickMe territory.  If you notice these Internal Red Flags, do not merely suppress the urge to behave in these ways. **Ditch the person who triggered you to feel this insecure.** *Acting* like you're cool and aloof, is playing into their mind games. *Acting* like you're happy and content while you are not, is self-betrayal.  If these tendencies recur with multiple suitors, Level Up before stepping back into the dating pool. Read up on attachment theory: you may be Anxious-Preoccupied. This makes you a target for abuse.  # Internal Red Flags  üö© You are consciously timing your texts back so you don't seem too clingy.  üö© You are preoccupied by the text conversation, ruminating and reading too much into things.  üö© You are **compulsively** checking your phone for a response, or waiting by your phone.  üö© You are **compulsively** checking their online or last-seen status, or checking for read-receipts.  üö© You drop everything to engage with them during the slithers of time they are available.  üö© You are blaming yourself, questioning what you did wrong to have 'caused' such distant treatment from their side.  üö© You suppress communicating your needs and worries regarding your texting related anxiety, in fear of being judged, ignored, or rejected.  üö© You are jumping through hoops in hopes of getting their attention: sending songs and links and memes and pics and vids and...  üö© You occasionally try to overcome your anxiety by acting distant yourself: sending late/short replies on purpose, only to become angry when this does not coax a reaction from your partner.  üö© You feel relief when you finally get a response.  &#x200B;  *(Expanded from my comment originally made on the post* ["I just fell asleep" Men that won't say goodnight or just dip from convos"](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s4fful/i_just_fell_asleep_men_that_wont_say_goodnight_or/).  u/barbedwiredaisycrown *requested them to be made into a post.

d7oax4lp	This is my first FDS thread, and I am still learning so much in this community thanks to you intelligent, enlightened women of all backgrounds. If I could offer just one small nugget of wisdom, based on my previous long term relationships and a marriage, it is this:  ***Find out if he was a loser in the past before you get involved with him. Trust me.***  Now, we have different ideas of what constitutes a loser in this situation, versus the societal idea of what makes a man a loser. For a lot of women, a man who is a loser is someone who hasn't leveled up to his potential in life, or who outright refuses to work on his issues and shortcomings, or is not financially independent, or can't flirt worth crap, or is hostile against women for his own personal failings, so on so forth. For some, the idea of a loser is probably someone who abuses themselves as well as other people, or someone who steals money to get their fix and not care who they hurt along the way, or someone who is a creep to people who are in a vulnerable position, ie much older men creeping on teenage girls, for example.  These are all very obvious examples and are insta-block-and-delete-able.  However, it is also good to be especially careful with the kind of loser that we all may have known in our formative years; the geeky guys who got bullied back in the day. The guys who seem smart but waste it on video games instead of studying. The guys who seem sweet, artsy, and maybe tormented, but couldn't get the popular girl to notice him (or that she was secretly filmed by him.. ew.). The guys who got rejected or dumped by a girl they were seriously in love with, and never found peace from it. The guys who had seriously spent years in his youth without any friends around him, and never sought help for that. The "late bloomers", if you will, who never got around to having a serious relationship or had sex before, before YOU came along.  These men are waiting for a woman... just *one* woman... to give him the benefit of the doubt, to fix him, to save him. And then, he unleashes all hell on her, as a way to get back at everyone, especially against other women, for making him feel inferior for all those years. That's all it takes. **One woman.** And that very same woman, could unfortunately, be you.  As a way to vet for this, just simply ask how his high school and college years went. That's it. Men are emotional when it comes to the past. They will open the floodgates-sometimes quite literally, tears and all-about how badly they were treated, how lonely or out of place they've felt, the whole nine yards. They reminiscent about things for far too long, much longer than women do, which is a bit strange, since we were always taught that it is women who are very emotional and teary-eyed about her years in her heyday. But in my experience? It is men, who never let go of the past. It is men, who cannot get over their exes, or the one who got away, whoever she is, and it will be YOU who will pay dearly for THOSE women's actions.  Women, on the other hand, at least from my observation, who got bullied back then, tend to try her best to bounce back from that, whether it's by losing weight and becoming healthier, or learning how to socialize better, or uses those experiences in order to be kinder to people around her. Men, by and large, don't use negative experiences to become a better person, but as an excuse to become fucking assholes to everyone around them.  The nerdy male aesthetic really took off especially during the 2000s, when being geeky and emo or twee or w/e was all the rage, and women were especially punished for wanting Chad when they could have chosen the nice guy in the glasses and grandpa sweater who could write her poems. And honestly? It was a horrible fucking mistake to let it get to me, and make me think I should give Mr Foreveralone a chance.  So to cap it off in a short sentence: If he was a loser back then, don't go out with him. You will be his dragon to slay for his own issues, instead of the princess that you really are, to be cherished by a man who's actually worth it.  Don't go out with ex-losers.	1642364190.0	s5kgw2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5kgw2/please_for_your_own_sake_find_out_if_he_was_a/	Please, for your own sake: Find out if he was a loser before.
74116cjl	I was very much socialized to believe that all women are catty and b*tchy, so for much of my life I had a hard time trusting them and forming close relationships with them. I really believed other women had a target on my back, and that we were all sort of in competition with one another. It was like being on IRL Bachelor except the men looked like sad Seth Rogans.   FDS has helped me realize that my attitude was pure internalized misogyny, and that women are actually incredible! Now I see women in a completely different light and my relationships with them are much more positive as a result. I no longer feel threatened or intimidated. Not saying trust is granted immediately because of course we still must vet our friends, but I feel much more confident about the process of forming female friendships.

xotnn	Hello, ladies and happy Sunday! I made a short comment about this a few days ago and it seemed some of you were interested in hearing my story. i‚Äôll try to keep it mostly bullet points because the whole story could get long.   I‚Äôll jusy start by saying that this NVM borderline drove me crazy with his mind games. he was wholly inconsistent during the entirety of our short lived relationship. the first couple of weeks he love bombed me. after that he would disappear for several hours at times. beyond these obvious red flags i‚Äôll just dive right into the red flags on fire.   He mentioned regularly how he would never get married because he didn‚Äôt want to lose anything   he lived with his mother and still does several years later   he was most often unemployed, slept all day and stayed up all night smoking and playing video games   believes he is smarter than everyone else but could barely afford to feed himself   has a *huge* inflated self importance and massive ego, to the point of delusion   borrowed money from me when he was in a tight spot and then resented me for having the money to loan him, even tho I‚Äôll never get it back. this one really seemed to eat at him.   after all that he left me for a coke addict but instead of telling me that, he made a public spectacle of things and caused a huge fallout that affected our entire social group instead of owning up to meeting someone else. side note: this is a clear pattern, he love bombs people for a while and then drops them for someone else.   years later reached out and apologized for his behavior. then chose one of my friends to start dating (a new one he had not known before) I was totally fine with this, obviously. the girl was aware of his behavior and I wasn‚Äôt going to insert myself, we weren‚Äôt that close anyway so it didn‚Äôt mean anything to me. he tried so hard to make me jealous of her, but I never was because I just didn‚Äôt care. then he randomly blocked me again. I blocked back.  i‚Äôm happily married and have been for a while now. my husband is so nice to me and we have a beautiful life. meanwhile NVM is on around relationship #9 since me from what i‚Äôve heard thru the grapevine. all of which have been ‚Äúthe one‚Äù	1642369176.0	s5mcf3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s5mcf3/my_story_of_the_worst_nvm_i_allowed_in_my_life/	My story of the worst NVM I allowed in my life, back in my pickmesha days üôÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

hrnht7l8	I believe Savannah casually mentioned this REDFLAG to watch out for. I wish I could remember which episode so I could correctly quote her, but I remember her words brought up a VERY clear memory for me.   I was once offered an extremely expensive piece of antique furniture to marry a man.   This woman, my at-the-time boyfriend's mother, was walking me around her expensive, well-decorated home. We were casually chatting and I mentioned I really liked a certain piece. She said she had just bought it and then bluntly added  ‚Äî  "If you marry my son I will give it to you." It was like plea for help honestly. I wish I could've seen my own face! I definitely remember one eyebrow raising very high.   This woman was so desperate to get rid of her own son that she basically offered me thousands of dollars!   I believe that was what Savannah was talking about. To watch out if your boyfriend's mother is trying to foist him onto you. Is she trying to free her own self from the bondage of a man baby?

I'm sick of seeing posts where the mother is blamed for all of the child's issues because she was abusive growing up. I had the same childhood. It was awful. And everyday I wondered why my father didn't try to help.  Women abuse their children, of course. Single mom's or divorcees can be awful people, believe me I know, but why didn't our fathers ask us.

You are not sure if you can live life without your substance of choice. Your skin feels like its crawling. Everyone at the meeting is inundating you with their brand of recovery: ‚Äúdo you have a sponsor; just don‚Äôt drink; one day at a time; keep coming back; it works if you work it...‚Äù They are all well meaning, and they genuinely believe in what they are telling you. You will feel like you are surrounded by love and support.   You‚Äôll feel safe when you hear the rules of that meeting: ‚Äúwe suggest men support men and women support women.‚Äù Then when you go to leave, men WILL follow you to your car to ‚Äúinnocently‚Äù to talk to you about the program.   Despite the rules, no one will do anything to stop it when it happens. If you ask for support, they will tell you ‚Äúprinciples over personality.‚Äù In other words, AA‚Äôs reputation comes before your need for safety. If you write a letter to AA‚Äôs World Service Organization, they will tell you that all meetings are self-governing, and that issue needs to be taken up at that meeting‚Äôs business meeting . You then plead for support at the business meeting. Not one man will step up and say: yes, we will assure you that this room is safe, and we will tell ALL MEN WHO HARASS WOMEN NOT TO RETURN. Instead, you will be told to go to a women‚Äôs meeting, so rapey men can continue to harass, rape, and murder women with impunity at co-ed meetings.   I spent 5 WHOLE years in the program. I did what I was told. Eventually, I would become one of the reputable female leaders of my home group. At 1.5 years sober my Mom died, while I was in the middle of a divorce, moving out of my married house, and sending my oldest of to college. I was considered a rock star to do all of that, without picking up a drink. AA earned the credit. Not me. According to AA, I am powerless, and if I didn‚Äôt have G-d on my side, I would have drank and eventually died with my mother. I believed it. I preached it.   But, also, deep down inside, my intuition (that I was told to ignore because it‚Äôs just my addiction trying to kill me) was telling me to find support somewhere else.   6 months after my Mom died, I had an argument with someone I believed was a friend. She had been continuing to use AA directives to attempt to make me feel better about my grief. I made it very clear on numerous occasions that being told to: make a gratitude list, help others, and that my grief was self centered fear, was not helpful.  I kindly shared what she could do instead - just hold space for me - that is all - just listen. Instead, mid-argument, when I was completely out of steam from begging my friends to telling me how to grieve, I screamed at the top of my lungs: MY FUCKING MOM DIED!!!!!!!!! The friend‚Äôs response: SO FUCKING WHAT. WE ARE SO TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT YOUR MOM AND YOU USUNG HER DEATH TO MISBEHAVE. This was only 6 months after her death, a few days before my first birthday without my Mom.   Even in the rawest most vulnerable moment in my life, I was not granted empathy. AA seems to only reserve that for people you should forgive, like rapist.   I was 2 years sober at that time. I didn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without AA? 2 years in, and, as you can read, I was getting hurt more than I was getting helped - there was enough bullshit that could plausibly give me permission to walk away. I stayed for 3 more years, lest I wanted to drink and die.   In that time, I supported at least  50 or more women with their early recovery. I profoundly value the time I spent with all the women I walked with. All of them shared raw, intimate, details of their painful childhoods, adolescents, and adulthood - these deeply vulnerable truths were shared with me, in trust of me. I will never forget every tear I watched fall down a recovering woman‚Äôs cheek. I could never bring myself to direct them to handle their trauma as directed by AA.    I am a trauma survivor. I am the person who was told (as directed in the literature) to apologize to a man who witnessed (and harassed me about it the day after it happened) my rape, for the resentment I had against him (because I ignored him when I saw him working at a diner I frequented).   ‚ÄúWhy did you ignore that bus person when he said ‚Äúgood morning?‚Äù   ‚ÄúBecause he witnessed my rape, and told me all the details when I woke up covered in blood, in a mocking manner, that I wanted it.   ‚ÄúOh, that sounds like a resentment to me; you need pray for him, apologize for being rude, and work on forgiveness because he is obviously a very sick man.‚Äù   This is AA direction. You are born an alcoholic, and alcoholics are inherently selfish, self-centered, and self-seeking, even when they are victims. Everything I did that didn‚Äôt measure up to AAs criteria for a spiritual awakening was summed up as ‚Äòyour alcoholism‚Äô, and ‚Äòyour innate fuckedupness,‚Äô and that I have to do better to work on forgiveness and ‚Äúletting go, and letting G-d.‚Äù  My final straw was a couple of years after a dear AA friend of mine was brutally attacked by her ex-boyfriend, while sleeping (he was 10 years sober). He would have killed her if a neighbor didn‚Äôt hear her screams. He spent 2 years in prison. When he was released, he was accepted back into the AA community with open arms. I had to listen to him cry about how terribly he regretted his behaviors, as if it was akin to stealing his mama‚Äôs purse. She killed herself shortly after he was released. Rumors about what she could have done differently to avoid being tortured, ran their course.  In this moment, I tried to imagine telling her to write down a list of all the resentments she had, directing her to outline her part in the resentment (was she selfish, self centered, self seeking, or dishonest), followed up by her apologizing to all of those she resented? How about making her outline a sex inventory as well, where all of her sexual behaviors are weighed in columns of shame. I couldn‚Äôt imagine it, because it is unethical, and no reasonable person with a even mild moral fiber would make such absurd suggestions. She died because of AA‚Äôs irresponsibility, and unwillingness to address the violent misogyny that is rampant in AA.   The light went on and I couldn‚Äôt turn it off, no matter what threats AA was proposing about my future without AA. I was not born alcoholic. I did not need to shame my behaviors. I did not need to blame myself for my rape because of my drinking. I was not powerless. I did not have to listen to men tell their stories, which included them bragging about all the women they abused, under the guise of humility. I did not have to pray for or forgive my rapist, nor excuse their behaviors because they‚Äôre ‚Äújust sick‚Äù. I did not need to turn my life over to a male-run organization. I did not need to serve another alcoholic to process my mother‚Äôs shocking death. I did not need to walk miles in the snow to get to a meeting, when I should have been home making snow angels with my kids. And I certainly did not need get better at accepting men harassing newcomer women.   I did not need to do any of these things to stay sober. Neither do you. You have choices, and you are not going to drink and die, if you don‚Äôt use AA. I‚Äôve been sober for more years out of AA, than in. You can too.   I have a feeling that comments to this post will be met with, ‚Äúbut it works for me‚Äù and ‚Äútake what you need, and leave the rest‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how I sponsor women or how women sponsor me‚Äù. Not only have I heard it all, Ive said it all. AA was my lifeline and no one could convince me otherwise, despite my own suspicions, I‚Äôd double down to protect AA.   Please don‚Äôt ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù ‚Äúnot all meetings‚Äù  me.   I‚Äôm not here to tell anyone how to recover. If AA works for you, that makes me very happy. I celebrate all recovery, regardless of the route of administration.   But this is FDS, and we are here to support maximizing female benefit, and I owe it to my sisters to warn them of the dangers of being a woman in male spaces, from my own experience.   If you are struggling to find a safe space to be sober, please feel free to outreach me via dm.

yz5qp	TL;DR: never date a man who constantly talks shit about the mother of his children.  My friend met this guy on Tinder and considered him talking openly about being a single dad a "huge green flag". Told her to ask if a mother is still in the picture, and he replied with a wall of text belittling the woman and giving a suspiciously detailed account of how she ruined their family and how he suffered because of the divorce.  I warned my friend that it's too elaborate to be the truth and a normal person would never spill everything to a total stranger and I'm ready to bet anything that he's the one who fucked up their marriage and got the custody by sheer coincidence.  Well, too bad I didn't insist actually betting on it, would be much richer now. Turned out I was 100% right and a judge gave him custody only because his ex-wife needed to move to another city for work and he coached children to tell how they have dozens of friends in school (they're don't because he never allows them to go anywhere after classes or invite classmates over) and feel suicidal from the idea of "starting over in another place".   So my friend was a free nanny for several months while he lied to her about them getting married and having more children (she wants a big family, like at least 5 kids), but only if she "proved" being worthy aka doing all the housewife shit without any ring and at her own expenses.	1642424162.0	s63fhi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s63fhi/a_few_months_ago_told_my_friend_dating_a/	A few months ago told my friend dating a particular single dad is a mistake, she said I'm being prejudiced.

5eyjl40e	From Readers Write, my all-time favorite section:      "**IN THE EARLY** years of my marriage I started a journal. Day after day I would steal a few moments to write: on a bench by the playground swings; in a chair beside my mother at the nursing home; or just before collapsing on my unmade, laundry-covered bed. It was a difficult time. My father had died unexpectedly after what was supposed to have been a routine medical procedure. My mother, always depressive and nervous, was slipping into dementia. I had a rambunctious toddler we suspected was on the autism spectrum and a baby who needed to be strapped to my chest from sunup to sundown. The journal writing was a desperate attempt to carve out some space for myself amid the chaos of caring for others.  And it helped. I filled countless notebooks over the years with my sloppy, sometimes angry handwriting. Eventually a central theme emerged: my empty marriage. I realized I was unsupported by my husband while also being responsible for too many other people. Everyone who needed me, though, genuinely needed me. I didn‚Äôt begrudge them. It was my husband I resented: the man who came and went without an inkling about the household, made some money, interacted with us minimally, and fell asleep easily, as only a person who depends on someone else can. Perhaps because this realization was unwelcome, or because my time was stretched too thin, I shelved the journals and stopped writing.  Soon after that, my marriage began to implode. We had fights in which I would ask for respect, emotional support, agency. He would remind me that he had a job that kept him busy. (So did I.) He would point out that he had, in fact, taken out the trash every week and done some grocery shopping. His checklist of what it took to be a good partner and parent was shockingly simple. Coming from a working-class immigrant family, though, I couldn‚Äôt fight his logic. Work, trash, and groceries equaled survival.  When we moved to another house, I threw away my dusty journals. I was pregnant with a third baby, and our prospects weren‚Äôt good. If my husband was content with this pared-down version of me, I decided, I could be, too.  Years later, when I finally gave him an ultimatum ‚Äî to be present with me or leave ‚Äî he asked, ‚ÄúWho will take out the trash?‚Äù I was stung by the implication that my worth was paid for in garbage-removal services, and embarrassed that his question also made me nervous: What if I couldn‚Äôt survive without his help, minimal as it was?  I now have the answer: my teenage boys and I take out the trash every Wednesday, with lots of laughter and good-natured complaining. It takes all of five minutes. Trash night is a weekly reminder of my independence and capability, of the cohesion of this family with me at the helm. I‚Äôve almost come to enjoy it."	1642428677.0	s64w2o	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s64w2o/the_sun_magazine_inspiring_post/	The Sun magazine inspiring post

amm3tygb	I recently broke up with an initially seeming-HVM who turned out to be a "Mr. Sensitive" from Lundy Bancroft's *Why Does He Do That?* If you're not familiar with the Mr. Sensitive profile, I suggest [this FDS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/p771vi/why_does_he_do_that_by_lundy_bancroft_has_a_whole/) or [this blog post](https://www.muchnessmama.com/profile-of-an-abuser-mr-sensitive/). The blog post almost perfectly describes my experience.  Mr. Sensitive is one of the most insidious types of abusers because of his convincing cover. He frequently comes across as gentle, caring, and deeply empathetic. Because of this, it can be difficult to see the abuse/manipulation as it starts to creep into the relationship.  Instead of anger and rage, Mr. Sensitive uses his sadness, vulnerability, and hurt feelings to control you. He may never lay a hand on you, but he subtly goads you into proving your worth by constantly being hurt by something you did or did not do. Over time, the implicit message that you're not "good enough" erodes your self esteem. If you're constantly focused on how to avoid injuring him, and on proving how much you love and care for him, you can't put your energy into your own wants and needs.  Because I know how difficult this can be to detect, I wanted to share two real-life examples from my relationship, as a case study in how this dynamic may play out. For brevity, I'll split the stories into two posts.  First, I want to say that out of context, this anecdote will make the relationship seem like it was entirely awful, but that's rarely the case at the beginning. He had so many of the traits I was looking for -- Handsome, fit, incredibly intelligent, thoughtful, successful in his career and extremely well-off financially, similar hobbies and values, generous and affectionate, great sex, in therapy and seemed committed to his personal growth and development.. I wouldn't have spent two minutes with him if he hadn't shown these positive traits.  I recognize that the desire to return to how good things were in the beginning is an incredibly seductive force, and is the reason I didn't immediately leave. However, rest assured that I saw what was happening, I gave it as much of the benefit of the doubt as I could, and I got out fairly quickly after these incidents. **I respectfully ask that any advice or "you should have..." comments are offered gently, as otherwise this can be re-traumatizing for victims**. I also feel very confident that I recognize where I should have done better, and overall feel very proud of myself for recognizing what was happening, holding firm to my boundary, and not staying for very long.  Now, for the story.  # Weaponized Trauma  A bit of context is important. He shared with me early on that he had PTSD from his past emotionally abusive relationship. I remember a red flag going up when he told me that, because Bancroft stated that men who claim abuse are frequently the abuser. I made a mental note of it, to continue to observe and vet. As more details came out, I felt more comfortable believing his story. He eventually told me that his ex had been an escort, though she hadn't revealed that to him until they had been together for some time. Despite not really being ok with it, he continued to stay with her for several years. He also told me she had a personality disorder. He didn't share many details, but from what I gathered there were some violent episodes on her part.  At the time of the incident in question, our relationship had been going wonderfully. There had been conflict, a few instances where I felt suspicious that he was using his intense "sad" emotions to gain the upper hand, but nothing that felt too far beyond the realm of normal relationship annoyances and couple conflict. We also had many instances of healthy communication and conflict resolution to balance it out. Overall, I was immensely happy.  One evening, he took me out for dinner and a play. As the show was about to begin, I made a passing comment about how I thought I'd like to try out for community theatre. Acting is something I have a talent for, that I had hadn't a chance to pursue for a while. I assumed he would be happy for me for deciding to pursue one of my passions.  The rest of our evening was lovely, until we were about to go to bed. He made a matter-of-fact comment about how when I told him I wanted to audition for a play, his first thought was "What if she's in a play and she has to kiss someone?" but then he sort of dismissed it himself, like "Haha, but you wouldn't do that."  I looked at him and said "No, I would take a part with a stage kiss."  The exact sequence of events at this point is murky to me because it was so confusing and hurtful, but I do remember certain beats. I remember that he started shaking and trembling. I remember telling him "I don't understand, it's just acting?" and him saying "She would say it was just acting too." I remember saying "I don't know what you need right now?" and him saying "I want you to tell me you won't do it," and telling him very firmly that I wasn't going to agree to that.  Then, I remember him saying how it's not that he doesn't trust me, it's the idea of someone else potentially having desire for me, and getting to act on that desire, that is incredibly painful for him.  This put up a HUGE red flag for me, and my own past trauma was triggered. This was very, very similar to things that a physically and verbally abusive ex boyfriend had said to me, that boiled down to the belief that I was responsible for managing other men's attraction to me in order to spare his feelings.  I was having an intense emotional response at this point, almost a "fight or flight" response where I felt I needed to fight to very clearly establish that this was not ok with me, what he was asking was controlling, and I was not going to agree to it. At the same time, I was doing my best to repress those feelings in order to soothe my boyfriend in his panicked state.  The rest of it is a bit of a blur, but as he started to calm down he asked me to hold him and caress him. I continued to stuff down my feelings to soothe him, until I just couldn't anymore. I excused myself to another room and cried on the floor, feeling so hurt and confused, and questioning whether I could stay in this relationship if this was what it was going to be like.  When I came back, he was panicking that I would leave him, and then I was expected to comfort him about that instead. I felt so, so drained.  After that night, we spent some time trying to resolve the issue, but the heart of the conflict seemed to shift over time.  At first, it was about how we would handle the situation in question. I offered to agree to not take any roles with a stage kiss for X amount of time, if he committed to working through the painful feelings that brought up in him. He refused, insisting that he had already "done the work" and his trauma wasn't something he would ever get over. I offered to let him come to rehearsals, read the script, meet the person in question... None of that was acceptable to him.  Then, it became more about how I would handle his emotions. The narrative was, "Well, I could try to be ok with this, but it would be so difficult for me, and I would need so much emotional caretaking and reassurance from you, and you struggle with that, so I don't know that we would survive it." I remember that feeling almost like emotional blackmail, "If you do this thing, I will make it so unpleasant for you that you'll wish you hadn't done it."  Then, the core issue wasn't how we would handle me being in a play with a stage kiss, it was my behavior that night. Now the narrative was that he was having a trauma response, and the "one" time he really needed me (in reality he had had two or three episodes that were similar to this one, just not as intense) I wasn't there to support him and comfort him, and therefore he didn't trust me to meet his needs, and was distancing himself from me. I felt like I was being punished with withdrawn affection for asserting a boundary, and I was expected to re-earn the level of love and affection he had been giving me up until that point. It felt awful.  Never mind how hurt and scared I felt in that moment, that my own trauma had been triggered, his pain was what mattered. Right up until the end, I don't remember him ever showing any curiosity or concern about what I was experiencing, how hurt and scared I was, or my emotional experience. All I wanted was for him to say, "Clearly I have more work to do to address the pain I'm bringing from my last relationship to this relationship. It makes sense to me why that night was scary and hurtful to you, I'm committed to doing better and making sure that my trauma doesn't hurt you or prevent you from doing the things you love." And then of course, action to back it up.  But he wouldn't. And I feel fairly confident in saying that he wouldn't because this wasn't about him working through his trauma, it was about *leveraging his trauma to gain my compliance.*  Looking back, one of the most disturbing things about this incident is that what he was describing as a "trauma response" didn't start when he first had painful thoughts about someone kissing me in a play, *it started when I said no.*  It was awful, but I'm so thankful that I also recognized what was happening, my intuition was screaming at me that this was wrong, and I was able to use that information to leave shortly after.  I hope this story can be helpful to other women, and helps you to identify signs of this type of abuser in your lives. 	1642440037.0	s699fs	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s699fs/case_study_of_dating_mr_sensitive_part_i/	Case Study of Dating Mr. Sensitive, Part I: Weaponized Trauma

He said he could not be honest bc I'm an overreactor, just like how I'm overreacting now. Then he goes on to say that he's been dealing with people overreacting about his age for years. It gets old (lol). He said it if wasn't a big deal, I wouldn't be bringing it up, accussed me of being fascinated with his age and said he would never do that to me.

Men don't have to do anything, not even care enough to buy a ring. I have read a post by a woman, whose partner said he wanted to have a baby with her. She needed to figure out how to tell him she wants to get married first, she did and he proposed without a ring on Christmas.

5eyjl40e	Someone mentioned here about being told that she was "good for" a man, then realizing what a shitshow he was. Quick vetting strategy: **center yourself, and ask "is this good for me?"** Your immediate physical and emotional reactions will tell you all you need to know. If you're in doubt, and you ask out loud, other people's reactions, including micro-expressions, will tell you the truth.   It's a good way to get away from pickme thinking, where all of our energy is expended being good for a man, good to a man, doing for him, and being subservient, while denying your needs and wants. What does he do for you? how often? how much effort? with what attitude? A truly healthy relationship should be mutual, reciprocal, with give and take on a fairly even basis. It won't always be equal; that's not life, but it will even out over time.   Quick example: let's say you're out shopping, and you see something and think of your guy. You want to buy it for him, but something stops you. Suddenly you realize it's been x amount of time since he bought you anything. So you don't buy it. And you re-evaluate him and your relationship to gauge if he and his effort are enough for you.   Or conversely, you see something, realize he just bought you something, and you realize you've been giving to each other regularly for a long time. You buy it, think nothing more about it, because you know your relationship is reciprocal and mutual.	1642463055.0	s6imvh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6imvh/always_ask_reciprocally/	always ask reciprocally

tfi8qd	No, he‚Äôs not ‚Äúin the process of a separation.‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not in a ‚Äúdead bedroom‚Äù and ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt had sex with his wife for over 2 years and not attracted to her.‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not finding ‚Äúthe perfect time to leave‚Äù because ‚Äúit‚Äôs Christmas next month, and her birthday is next week!‚Äù  No, he‚Äôs not continuing to be with her for the ‚Äúkids‚Äù.  No, he‚Äôs not ‚Äúmadly in love with you‚Äù and you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúhis soulmate‚Äù.  Yes, he‚Äôs using you for cheap, easy sex. Plain and simple.  These men are never actually separated or in the process of a divorce. They will never leave their wives for you. They‚Äôre happy having their cake and eating it too.  You will continue to be his plaything while he continues coming up with every excuse in the book as to why ‚Äúnow isn‚Äôt the right time to leave her babe‚Äù, and how if you continue squandering more of your youth away, he will leave her and you‚Äôll finally be together!  Ok, so what about the minuscule amount of times where a man actually leaves his wife for you? If he‚Äôs willing to cheat on his wife and destroy his marriage for you, he‚Äôs willing to cheat ON YOU AS WELL.  Married men who actively cheat on their wives are the shit stains of the earth. Never entertain these men ever. Don‚Äôt believe them when they tell you that they‚Äôre going through a separation. ALWAYS verify! I‚Äôd go as far as messaging his wife confirming if his story or true or not. Watch him shit his pants when you even suggest it.  Please don‚Äôt give up your precious time and dignity and fall for these pieces of shit. I cannot stress this enough, but I thought I would remind y‚Äôall that this is a tale as old as time and many people continue to fall for it.

8lbmtjtl	Early twenties here. FDS opens your eyes to patriarchal conditioning.   **Men don't want you to trust your emotions or have boundaries because it makes them unable to manipulate and abuse you.**   **MEN DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK**   1. I vaguely remember the words, but my mother recently recalled the event and confirmed that yes, I did say it to my father : "That is what a father should be like." This was when I was around 5-7. And it was in relation to me observing how my father's friend "X" treated his own daughters: with love, warmth, and compassion.  **A child can sense when they are not loved. A woman does as well.**  **A child can sense when they are fake loved. A woman can as well.**  **A child can tell they are not loved enough. Us women can as well**  I dare say, a child is highly attuned to their emotional self and can accurately feel and understand the emotional availabily of others and the amount of emotional feedback they are getting. **We can as well.**  What I think a child cannot do properly at that age is "analyse" it and connect the events in a more conscious "complex" manner. It happens unconsiously, which translates to emotions when we are children. When we are grown up, we can analyse. And what is an LV's/NV's/ZV's greatest enemy? A woman who begins to **think**.    What stops us from trusting our emotions and instincts is patriarchal conditioning: we are hysterical, emotional, weak, "don't be like a child", "no man will want you if you do xyz", " cry baby" , "grumpy hag", **"men don't like emotional women"** , **"don't think too much about it**", **"just go with the flow"**  If **child me** knew that she deserved love and compassion, what made adult me think she deserved less?   2. Obviously, my father took offense to that statement. I was a child. He held a grudge. Also repeatedly mentioned that why don't I go have "X" as my father. Instead of analysing his own behaviour- a GROWN  man with a decade age gap from my mum, and find out why his own child felt a lack of love, he decides to ... punish me with his cold behaviour. Result? I got anxiously attached (and later avoidantly attached). I can say it with confidence because I vividly remember the insistent anxious urge to please him, to make him love me, to prove that I am worthy of his love, to idolise him, to think that he is the best father in the world.   3. Concurrent with all the above, I was aware that my father was abusive to my mother. Men think that children won't see and understand, but we do. I was and still am acutely aware of how my father was, in my child's mind "not good" to my mother.  **How a man treats his wife affects how a man treats their daughter(s)**   **Women, no father is better than an abusive father. Whether it's emotional, financial, and/or physical abuse. No man is better than an abusive man. Being single is better than having a bf/being married**  4. Forgiveness. I never will forgive. And it's okay to never forgive. Fathers are meant to protect their children. Men know how dangerous other men are. Fortunately or unfortunately, at that young age I realised that **men love other men, he will love and believe and trust his other friend "Y" more than me... because men are right** And as a child I sensed it, and so I never revealed it. It still haunts me, and I get an immense sense of satisfaction, emotional justice and joy when I hear about Y's misfortunes from the grapevine.   **Leave. It doesn't get better. It never gets better. You will develop even more painful scars.**  Healing takes a while. It can feel like you are stuck in a contant wave and then there is a sudden flick of a switch. You may never forgive your abuser, and it's 100% valid. Instead of forgiveness, decenter men from your life and see them for who they truly are. **Forgive yourself from doubting yourself**.   **We are conditioned to not reveal men's bad behaviour towards us. So when you hear a negative account of a man from your vetted friends, believe them (HV men will also hint at an LV man's behaviour, however beware it might also be an LVM posing as an HVM to gain your favour)**  If it wasn't for FDS, I would still have been grappling with forgiveness. Religious leaders love to preach about forgiving the man, their entitlement to it, and their superiority to women hence expectations of women's submission to them. **Men choose to forgive, women are TOLD to forgive.**  For years I couldn't forgive, and it just made me more angry, more hateful towards my abusers, and inexplicably more angry at myself - **I was at war with myself because I was betraying my emotions, and minimising my hurt.**   For years I was stuck in a wave of emotions, of perpetual anger and hatred, an inability to forgive my abusers, but now as I am writing all this down, I felt the flick of a switch. I forgive myself.   - **My emotions are valid.**  - My anger is valid.  - I don't **need** or **should** or **have to** forgive.  - **I am entitled to never forgive**.  - **Men are not entitled to my forgiveness**  - **My experiences are valid**  - **I am not alone**  - **I am not imagining things nor am I hysterical**  - **I have the right to feel angry and to never forgive abusers**   And that finally makes me feel at peace with myself. It's draining. It's relieving.   I believe good men exist. But there are more LV, ZV and NV men than HV men. **What men don't like is boundaries because then they can't manipulate you and abuse you**  Edited for grammar mistakes, clarity and formatting.	1642500091.0	s6u2g4	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6u2g4/fds_changed_me_and_gave_me_a_healgasm/	FDS changed me and gave me a heal-gasm.

2xydqhx3	I get super anxious before dates, I think it‚Äôs because old is so unnatural you‚Äôre just being tossed next to someone you know nothing about and seeing whether you like them or not. I get a lot of attention from guys and never have a hard time with them in a normal setting but before and OLD date I find myself struggling to relax, be myself and feel calm in my body. No one notices when I‚Äôm like this, I‚Äôve always been told I seem very calm all the time but it‚Äôs just not fun to feel this way.  I‚Äôve taken a 1.5 years off dating and felt ready to start again. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs fair to tell myself I can only date again once my anxiety is gone, but I‚Äôd love some tips you guys use to remind yourself dates are literally zero reason for anxiety.

5d02esag	I am not a mean person, truly, i know it weird to say this in writing but i‚Äôm really not a nasty, awful person that picks on people for no good reason, neither am i condescending or patronising. I‚Äôve always been confident, nice enough to make plenty of friends, i get along with people in general, rarely do i have major problems or fights with others. Yet, since i‚Äôve started at my new job, i‚Äôve been made fun of and picked on more than my entire high school life. I don‚Äôt know what i did wrong but for some reasons, my coworkers enjoy poking fun at me for no reason. I tried laughing it off when it was just one guy but others joined in and i couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. So one day, i just snapped.   There‚Äôs this ongoing joke that i don‚Äôt work hard at work because when I first started, meaning my first week, i didn‚Äôt pull my weight enough. Obviously by my third week i was in full swing but the guys I work with, because there‚Äôs only two other girls that work at my place and I don‚Äôt see them that often since their work hours are different, still joke around about it. Highly exaggerated of course, they act like I fucking stood in a corner and stared into space for ten hours. I did my job of course. I could handle the jokes, even if they made me feel like shit, I didn‚Äôt want to be that person that can‚Äôt handle a joke at their expense every now and again. I would joke back or laugh it off. That was until one brand new coworker, who honestly was just a compete dickhead to begin with fuck I hate him so bad, that had just started a few days ago began joining in with the jokes and that‚Äôs when i just got so sick in my stomach. It was after most of the customers left and the place was pretty quiet, we were standing around, talking and then the conversation stirred toward me. One of our regular customers, who we all hate, said he applied to start working at our store and when he left the guys were laughing about it, talking about how he‚Äôd never get hired and then one worker said ‚Äúcan you imagine working with him? He wouldn‚Äôt do shit. He‚Äôd make *** look good‚Äù.   I just so sick y‚Äôall, I was almost finishing a eleven hour shift, no lunch, forgot to go on my break and the guy who made the joke was a new part timer who just clocked in. I blew up on them, when they finished laughing because gosh it was so funny eh? I asked them what the fuck was their problems, how they were all dickheads and told them all to go fuck themselves. I also told them I‚Äôd go to the manager and let him know how I felt about the way I was being treated by them (everyone is terrified of our manger). They were so shocked it was insane, did they really have no idea I didn‚Äôt like the jokes?   Idk, maybe it was because they were all men, older than me (I‚Äôm 18) and i just felt so tired of being ridiculed and patronised but i couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore, not when i had some guy who JUST started cracking hurtful jokes. It‚Äôs like he saw the way they treated me, constantly being demeaning and thought‚Äî aah this is my calling, lemme join in real quick.   Now at work, we do not converse, don‚Äôt talk unless necessary and we are very civil with each other. I have four other male coworkers (for some reason the girls i work with are never this way with me, we get along so well) and they act like i‚Äôm some hysterical monster that‚Äôs going to erupt if they say good morning.  I was just so sick of being picked on and made fun of and being the one that everyone is laughing at, it didn‚Äôt feel good. Like i would be wiping down a table and one of them would walk past and say, ‚Äúwow! i didn‚Äôt know ** could clean‚Äù ‚Äúfinally ** is doing some work around here‚Äù like i haven‚Äôt been doing a overtime hour shift for the last three days. It got to them calling me stupid when i‚Äôd ask them a question about anything tbh, or an idiot. I hated the way new coworkers were joining in, i just wanted to be friends with them, i wanted to just get along and be a team. I know i screwed it up, but they knew i didn‚Äôt like those jokes, i never laughed at them. i told them it felt hurtful, now i‚Äôm not a good team player? now i‚Äôm excluded for conversations and feel like an outsider? why? because i just wanted to be treated well and with a little respect? Im glad the jokes have stopped and they barley meet my eye. it‚Äôs better than whatever the fuck was going on before. i was dreading going to work every morning, i would just sob on the bus ride home. i don‚Äôt anymore and I‚Äôm content with that. Sure work would be so much more fun if we got along with one another but I truly don‚Äôt care if they think I was being sensitive or emotional about it. I knew it was bad when my supervisor (who is also a woman) asked me one day why I let them talk to me like that. Just constant constant demeaning things, all the god damn time like just be nice please, I‚Äôm begging you, just be kind. If I had to scream at them till they thought me unhinged, then so be it. At least now they don‚Äôt dare to crack even the smallest of jokes around me, even if I just want to joke around a little and chat with them. Oh well, I‚Äôd rather feel bored at work than I‚Äôm the verge of tears everyday.	1642537641.0	s76ze9	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s76ze9/being_disrespected_at_work/	Being disrespected at work
11avbw	My HVM father always told me that experiences can make you bitter or better, and I agree. YOU decide if you learn from a bad experience and YOU  have the power to avoid making it again. Here‚Äôs how I process my cringey pick-me behavior from years ago:  (1) Get reminded of a time you debased yourself for a man‚Äôs approval or ignored a major red flag.   (2) Don‚Äôt fight it; experience the memory and remember how small, sad, and pathetic you felt when you prioritized a man‚Äôs opinion over your own dignity and happiness. Journal your thoughts if that works for you.   (3) Take a moment to be Captain Hindsight and list off your shoulda-woulda-coulda‚Äôs. Roll your eyes at your past self. Think of what you should‚Äôve/would‚Äôve/could‚Äôve done differently.   (4) Accept that it is in the past and nothing can change that, but recognize that the future is entirely in your control.   (5) Forgive your past self for making mistakes. Be patient with your younger self, as she did not have the wisdom you possess now. We‚Äôve been conditioned to accept abuse from men and there‚Äôs no shame in falling for society‚Äôs lies. There‚Äôs only shame in doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome.   (6) Promise yourself that you‚Äôll never make yourself feel that way again, and be proud of all the progress you‚Äôve made. Celebrate how far you‚Äôve come since then and how much stronger you‚Äôve gotten. Pat yourself on the back for getting out of a shitty situation. Cringing at past behaviors means we‚Äôre learning, growing, and evolving- it‚Äôs unpleasant but it‚Äôs a good thing!   (7) Finally, and most important of all, SHARE your wisdom with your sisters. Help them avoid the mistakes you made. Exchange stories and strategies. Say something when you see a queen accepting shitty treatment. Be supportive when a woman in your life needs help breaking free. Uplift the women in your life and arm them with the knowledge that we don‚Äôt owe men anything! Preach the gospel of FDS and turn your negative experience into something positive and constructive!   If you learn from a mistake, then you‚Äôve paid tuition for the school of life. If you don‚Äôt learn and repeat your mistake, then you‚Äôve just wasted your time. It‚Äôs important to remember our experiences, but beating yourself up doesn‚Äôt help.   Every shitty man I‚Äôve ever had the misfortune of interacting with taught me something that I added to my list of ‚Äúred flags/absolutely nots.‚Äù Make a physical list if you need to! You can vet men more efficiently if you have a mental checklist that is constantly being updated. I knew I had found my HVM when he checked off every requirement and my constant vetting has yet to uncover any dealbreakers.  Edit: Reworded some things, added some more detail. Also wanted to add that I‚Äôm a very data-driven strategist and I love this sub because it‚Äôs a place where we can amass data, share experiences, and support each other fiercely.

8kfwbg2b	There is an Instagram page known in my country which is against sharing nudes. The message is "dont Share" and they say that they are feminists And then they make a post on "how to send nudes safelly"????? Everyone in the comments are praising the message. Am I the only one who sees this as very danger and very against feminism? And one tip is to send the nude with a watermark with his name all over the picture, so if you see or someone sees the nude, knows who leaked it. I think that is even worse. I think it encourages more the men to send to his friends! Like "here's my girl, She even puts my name all over the nude" its like a tattoo or ownership. I just wanted to know what you think, i feel very lonely on this topic.	1642501523.0	s6ufge	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s6ufge/liberal_feminism_at_its_best/	Liberal feminism at its best

bj3r5vwf	Hey everyone. So this guy I am dating FaceTimed me last Thursday. It was sweet, nothing too deep. We‚Äôve went on one date before omicron hit, hence why we resorted to that one FaceTime recently. Usually he never lets more than 2 days go by without texting me first. He always initiates more between the two of us. He did ask me on that FaceTime once again how I preferred talking‚Äîwhether through FaceTime or phone calls‚Äîto which I said face-to-face but since omicron is a thing I know it‚Äôs hard. I also said it‚Äôs difficult to FaceTime/call when my family is around a lot but we‚Äôll have to see how that goes. Before this I have expressed that I‚Äôm not much of a texter and he‚Äôs aware of that.   We‚Äôve been talking for 1.5 months now. After that Thursday he had work (he works in healthcare) for 3 days back-to-back (14th, 15th, 16th). I know this because he sent me his schedule for this month and the next. The conversation on Thursday after the FaceTime ended with his reply to something I said. Not something that I needed to further respond too. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since Thursday. I‚Äôm aware he‚Äôs off the 17th, 18th, 19th.   Where does FDS stand with messaging first when you‚Äôve been talking for a while? Should I assume he‚Äôs ghosting and move on or should I drop a quick text asking if everything‚Äôs alright? Or some other rephrasing? Thank you!  Edit: Thank you to everyone who replied!

7rbqon55	Ok ladies, for a long time I balked at the ‚Äúno casual sex‚Äù rule. I continued to have casual hook ups. While my partners I chose were always physically attractive and I was lucky enough to almost always experience orgasm, something about it always felt off after. Basically I need advice on how to quit this. I go on dates frequently and almost always end up sleeping with them. I hate how little self control I have, although I know it‚Äôs stopping me from meeting a proper man. The issue is that I really enjoy having sex and feel tempted. I think it‚Äôs mostly validation or FOMO maybe but I‚Äôm sick of it. I realized that I‚Äôve been acting this way for 10 years, since I lost my virginity! I‚Äôve had serious relationships throughout but have had many hook ups between. Neither the relationships or the hook ups are satisfying anymore. So i need to know, does anyone else have this problem? Anyone else been so brainwashed by sex posi culture that you can‚Äôt even  comprehend making a man wait???	1642563840.0	s7gkwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7gkwb/casual_sex_confusion/	Casual Sex Confusion

4ez63o53	We know this applies to romantic relationships with men. And no lurkers, I don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúacting uninterested and being childish‚Äù.   This‚Äôll be (if he wanted to he would) but what they would‚Ä¶ goes hard as diamonds when it comes to other men. I need that kind of motivation from a male partner because I‚Äôve seen many be very capable of going all out. Only, for favor of other men.   Difference is, women aren‚Äôt requiring the gauntlet to be run to receive our love. Cause it‚Äôd be crazy to ask them to swallow a gold fish for a date w a woman. Do they subconsciously require hardship to truly value a relationship? Maybe.  I mean not easy to be or feel good enough for. Excited to better themselves to be considered. Not easy to continue to deserve membership. Very easy to be ejected from the organization/inner circle/perks/favor/trust/ LOVE/ a continuing relationship for the future.   Ever intimately known a man pledging a fraternity:  The humiliation they know they‚Äôll endure and are super ready for it because IT‚ÄôS WORTH IT! Sleep deprivation, sexual embarrassment, alcohol poising, torture of other men & women, basic underling lowly treatment. They know it‚Äôs coming and they are clawing to be allowed the privilege of this to be loved by these other men eventually.   Country clubs:  They must be vouched for by a member. After that the other men vote on him. They do a background check, vet his family background and how likely they are to embarrass the organization or act unsavory. Men will jump through hoops and pay thousands in order to be part of a country club. They instruct their loved ones on how to behave when vetted (which they will be) they will better themselves in many ways in order to secure a spot. Because they care and they want it. They value it.  Secret societies: You know what they are if you‚Äôve known someone in it or trying to be & grown ass men from 30-90 years old value being a part of this more than they value their children, wives or even parents.   Watching a friends husband be emotionally abusive to her for years and scramble to be seen as a worthy candidate was the last straw for me. I had to get yalls perspective. He agonized about every outfit. Thought day and night about his criminal record. Planned dates to take high up members on to get to know them. Genuinely cared and valued this relationship with these other men he didn‚Äôt even know.   I‚Äôve never ever in my life seen a man care hard like what I‚Äôve described here toward a woman. Ever. I‚Äôve never seen a man value or care for a woman the way I‚Äôve seen them value and care for these male relationships. What is this? Does it take the hunger games for a man to find value in a person or relationship?   One thing is for sure and it‚Äôs something we should learn from. Men do not accept other men (in these situations) without extreme effort and hardship.  Edit: this is very USA centric. If you know of other versions of this non US based,  please share.	1642570306.0	s7in9n	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7in9n/on_hard_to_get_hard_to_keep_what_men_value/	On ‚Äúhard to get & hard to keep‚Äù what men value & respect & men courting prestigious organizations.

e4q3rpt7	Context: I went out on 4 dates with a man I met on Bumble last month and he and I had the best chemistry/ connection ever and he represented all HV characteristics. For the first time I was actually feeling like I can let my guards down.   Then, yesterday as I was cleaning my OLD up, I went back to his profile and realised he had listed his height 4-5" taller than what he is in person (I am 5'2" and I wear 4" heels and he was eye level with me so he certainly wasn't 5'11" as was listed). Height has NEVER been a point of contention for me as I am about to explain why, but the whole lie made me feel incredibly betrayed and I was questioning if I should look past it or end things with him.   &#x200B;  I decided to ask my father, who I believe is the personification of high value.   &#x200B;  My father is 5'5" and it would not be considered tall by social standards (especially in the country I am from) at all. He is the most confident man I have met, he has never been bothered by his height.   &#x200B;  He told me, "that lying about somthing as trivial and as easily provable is a giant character flaw - a moral glitch. It is manipulative and trying to push someone's boundaries. It is extremely telling of how the person would conduct themselves in their day to day life."  My father thinks, "that sure, being short does narrow your dating pool -- incredibly so, but even if that meant for him to stay alone for the rest of his life, he would gladly have done so, but to think about deceiving someone to like you? That is "criminal". Especially in matters like choosing a life partner -- no relationship much less as long term as a spouse should be predicated on a lie. It is telling of not only your lack of moral compass but your parents as well, who clearly did not teach you that honesty is the best virtue."  &#x200B;  He added, "apart from the blatant lack of moral values, it is also teling of how the person views themselves -- that they lack the basic confidence in their worth to attract a person just by being who they are. If they feel that they themselves would not be accepted BECAUSE of their height, then why should anyone else have the responsibility to accept them?"   &#x200B;  "Okay, so what the dating world is cut-throat? There are still men who will proudly claim they are 5'5"  and they are willing to stay alone if no one accepts them for who they are. And those men are way more valuable than someone who is 5'8" but claims to be 5'11"."  &#x200B;  He said, "think about it, would you lie about something, anything for the sole purpose of someone to like you? Why then, would you accept some one who does? Morality is not just doing the right things, it is accepting the right behaviours from others as well."  &#x200B;  I am so extremely grateful  for my dad, and I take a pledge that I will not let him down by picking someone who will not be able to match up to the standards he has shown time and again, men are supposed to uphold.   &#x200B;  I truely do not care about height. I do howver care about honesty, integrity and moral judgement.

6iogwrnl	Unfortunately, I can't credit the person I originally heard this from, as it's been a long time and it took me quite a couple of days to realize how good this exercise is, so now I can't find her. But if you need an easy way to find out if someone is a good fit just do this:  Imagine a person looking at you, your partner, and your entire relationship. They can see every aspect, so not only do they know the up and downsides, but everything you would never even admit to your friends and family. And they say **you deserve this**.  Does this make you feel sad? Embarrassed? Guilty? Are you asking yourself, is this really all I deserve? Can I really not get someone better than THIS? Queen, you're not with the right person. You very easily COULD do a lot better and you should.  When someone says to you that you deserve your partner you should be proud and happy. You should say "Hell yes, I deserve a competent partner who loves me and makes my life better."  You can do this with any person you willingly chose to be in your life.

15guc4	This fetish is me telling men on the internet to stop shoehorning the discussion of porn into ANY topic.   "No one is impressed you watch porn"   "No one cares you looked up porn on the internet"  "No one cares what kind of porn you like to watch"   "No one cares if this woman looks like one of your favourite porn actors"   "No one cares you might fap to this image"   Someone said it here recently that they're tired of porn being mentioned everywhere on this site, even in the most unrelated places. It's time those kind of comments are shamed because they add absolutely nothing to any discussion.   The internet is full of porn, there's even a Broadway song about it. Anyone who has used the internet knows its mostly porn, its easily accessible and the vast majority of the male population around the world watches it - you wouldnt brag about wiping your own ass clean, why brag about fapping? No one cares man, no one is impressed, you look like a clown bragging.	1642600636.0	s7qo6o	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s7qo6o/basically_just_discovered_a_new_fetish_for_myself/	Basically just discovered a new fetish for myself

h57msag5	It hit me yesterday. Casual sex doesn't serve me.  Took me a while to internalise this because in the Milennial Gay Scene, pretty much all relationships start out as (drunk) hook-ups. I was doing mental gymnastics thinking: *"I don't have to fear pregnancy or physical harm like the other FDS ladies, because I only have sex with women! And sex is fun! So why not?"*  It doesn't serve me to get emotionally invested in a complete stranger, because of the hormones and illusion of intimacy caused be sex. It doesn't serve me to chip away at my reputation, by sleeping with people who barely put in any effort to get in my pants (a reputation as 'easy' will absolutely make it so nobody sees you as relationship material, I've paid attention to the gossip in my dating pool). It doesn't serve me to crush my self-esteem, when I find out I was used for sex by someone I grew to have feelings for. It doesn't serve me to subject myself to (valid) guilt, when I've used someone else for sex while I didn't truly care about them.  **It makes absolutely no sense to have casual sex with someone I actually want to have a relationship with.** It just puts me in a position where I'm vulnerable, anxious if they reciprocate my feelings, hooked on having sex with them, and get put in a total PickMe mindset. **I will have gone all-in emotionally and physically, while they haven't put a single chip on the table.** Even if a relationship blossomed from the initial casual hook-ups, THE RELATIONSHIP WILL HAVE BEEN BUILT ON SEX, NOT EMOTIONAL INTIMACY/COMPATIBILITY.  **It makes absolutely no sense to have casual sex with someone I don't want a relationship with either.** It's not the sex I crave, it's intimacy. Sure it feels exciting and fun while we're having sex, but afterwards it just feels awkward and empty. Potential HV suitors that I *actually* want to have sex with, will likely be put off by me having a FWB/fuckbuddy. Heck, I wouldn't want to date someone with a FWB/fuckbuddy either!  Not having sex outside of a monogamous relationship, and having a vetting period before relationship potential is even on the table, is the *bare minimum* to ask. It'll weed out LV dweebs who are just after using me for easy sex, are emotionally unavailable, or won't commit. This vetting strategy truly protects my interests.

7w26njtc	I'll be turning 40 this year.  8 years ago I got serious about learning financial literacy and eliminated all my debt, purchased a home I intend to pay off well before my 15-year mortgage term, and educated myself about smart investing.  My small net worth is growing even though I make a modest salary in non-profit social service role.    But coming up on this milestone birthday and having hit these positive financial turning points, I realized the decision about whether to consider getting married at some point has firmly switched over to "no, no matter how high value he is (or appears to be)."  Not only to I refuse to potentially jeopardize the financial security I'm building with some man whose mask may come off at some point, at 40 *I no longer have time to make the types of financial mistakes you can outlive in your twenties*.    A boyfriend or husband can ruin your financial life and destroy your credit through drugs, alcohol, gambling, bad housing choices, stupid, speculative investments, or in the worst of our pick-me days, being a hobosexual and mooching off our entire income. But if you're young enough, you can, over time, work your way out of that mess and still have time to save for retirement.  But after 40, you've got far less room for mistakes because you've got far fewer years before you can't or won't want to work anymore.    And get this--a study by Voya Financial says that up to 60% of Americans are forced to retire earlier than they anticipated due to health concerns and/or their industry changing or declining around them (look no further than the pandemic to see how fast your work life can be turned upside down).  The day is coming when you won't be able to work, and you need to build the financial security not just to weather that with dignity but have a retirement you deserve.  (I am childfree and I realize that the choice not to marry is harder for Queens who want children.  I also recognize that some Queens have a much steeper path to financial self-sufficiency due to institutionalized racism and other systemic barriers.)  But for me, I am clear that if HVM of the Year shows up, I will choose "live together separately," basically perpetual dating.  It's the only thing that makes sense for my lifestyle and goals, and at my age I do not need the emotional satisfaction of the traditional life milestone of a wedding and being "Mrs." and so forth (not knocking those for anyone to whom they are valuable).  Moral of the story: don't just get that bread, *use it well*.  Delayed gratification is your friend.  Use some cool distance to evaluate the potential financial implications of dating and marriage decisions, or ask a friend to help you get that distance.  Get out of debt, and invest in yourself first.  **If you do this, you actually can date and marry with far less risk.  "FU money" is not just for jobs but for relationships too.  And the financial skills and emotional strength you have built through your money journey will make you better able to create and enforce boundaries with others, because you've already done it with yourself.**	1642625202.0	s8033c	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8033c/the_inverse_relationship_between_financial/	The Inverse Relationship Between Financial Maturity and Marriage Desirability
2yli403o	I‚Äôm sure many of you are familiar with Sherry Argov‚Äôs works including ‚ÄòWhy men love bitches‚Äô which are great in helping you assert healthy boundaries.  One piece of advice she gives is to be casual with the new man in your life because he is expecting you to want him to commit or define the relationship and he will resist this if it comes from you. So if you don‚Äôt, the theory goes, he becomes the one who wants to become serious rather than the one trying to avoid being ‚Äòtrapped‚Äô by a woman. Argov even recommends not talking about how you are looking for a serious relationship with marriage as something to follow within a reasonable amount of time for some months.   How does this work in a world where ‚Äòsituationships‚Äô are a thing and that a casual, undefined ‚Äòrelationship‚Äô is actually the goal for so many people? How can you reasonably expect a man to know you are marriage minded if for the first few months (as per the Argov advice) you avoid any talk of the future or being serious? How do you make your expectations clear without committing the ‚Äòsin‚Äô of giving the man control over the relationship by appearing too invested?	1642625228.0	s803er	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s803er/how_to_avoid_a_situationship/	How to avoid a situationship?

Honestly just to see the amount of girls come forward about matching with and texting the same guy from dating apps only to be ghosted shortly after just further proves dating apps are not it.

iths1z33	\*Disclaimer: I think FDS would tell me to not date seriously at my age, and I know now that I should be focusing my life on friendships and career advancement rather than dating. But this is something very big that happened to me and I feel as if I can‚Äôt move on completely without dissecting and understanding this from a radfem perspective. I really admire the mindsets of the women/femmes in this subreddit and hope to be more polished and with a stronger backbone like y‚Äôall as I continue maturing. I'm hoping to post my experience here for critical feedback/advice so that I can build my intuition and never allow myself to be treated like this again. I also hope that someone here can learn from my mistakes, too.   I met a seemingly HVM my last year of college. I thought that he was HV initially because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt like other men‚Äù in terms of being ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù and was pretty good at cooking. He was also very well versed and similar to me in terms of political belief (which is rare and something crucial for me), but slowly showed that his beliefs on gender were still very conservative.  He trauma spilled about his childhood sexual, physical, and emotional abuse from his family on the second day we met. At the time, I saw it as a yellow flag, but he convinced me that he was actually just being open about the topic after feeling ashamed about it for so long. He mentioned that he worked on coming to terms with it through therapy and had been working on himself for a while. I thought that was a good sign. Boy, was I wrong.  I had sex with him early on, and he explicitly told me he wanted sex and not a relationship. I told him I was ok with it because I had another guy I was FWB with at the time. He didn‚Äôt want to be seen in public with me, in fear that someone we knew would see us together. I felt that we were getting close emotionally, and he requested to learn more about me. I let him see my online journal, which I realize now was a mistake.   When I was younger, I was very much sold on the ideas of libfem, that I could become empowered through having casual sexual relationships with men. I had several of these relationships with men from OLD before I met him. These relationships weren‚Äôt the healthiest, and I really didn‚Äôt know what I was doing at the time. I was very lost and looking for male validation. I know now that I was using them to fill a void in me, rather than dealing with feeling broken and sad (which is 100% ok and healthy!). Through reading my journal, he came across entries that detailed my encounters with them, which showed I was a pickme with minimal boundaries.   Some time later, he came to me sad because he knew that ‚ÄúI wasn't his,‚Äù and he suggested becoming exclusive. I was unsure about it because it felt like we were moving really fast, but I eventually agreed because I thought that being exclusive wasn‚Äôt the same as being in a relationship. However, once we became exclusive, we did not establish boundaries around the differences of being in a relationship versus being exclusive. We basically became boyfriend and girlfriend at that point.   In our relationship, he began projecting his insecurities onto me. He told me he was uncomfortable and disgusted with my past. it got to a point where almost every day he asked about the sizes of the men I had been with, how good the sex with them was, etc. He wanted to be the biggest and the best out of all of them. It felt so weird to me that he was competing with men he had never met, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt come up with answers to those questions. How was I supposed to recall the exact size of a dick I had seen in dim lighting for a couple seconds? (This is honestly laughable now and cringey as hell, but he really tormented me with it at the time) I would tell him that I didn‚Äôt know, or that I couldn‚Äôt be sure, and he would accuse me of lying.   He continuously monitored my Instagram activity and private messages. He repeatedly asked me to delete and unfollow people from OLD, even though I told him that the request was controlling (it is, right?). I eventually gave in and unfollowed them, but it felt like that just made things worse.   I felt like he was treating me like an object. Everything we did was very sexual, which I thought was ok when we were FWB, but after getting into a relationship, it didn‚Äôt get better. Before meeting me, he had a porn addiction. He later confessed to looking up girls who looked like me and masturbating to them before we met in person. The pickme in me was slightly flatteredü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSMH. I tried time and time again to establish sexual boundaries, but he disregarded them. He eventually coerced me to have sex with him multiple times and constantly asked me to do increasingly kinkier things with him. I feel so awful just thinking about it because I know I was just being used and abused by this guy.   Then it escalated even more. He recognized that I had abandonment issues and told me that I wouldn‚Äôt leave him even if he hit me. He constantly criticized me over every little thing and shamed/judged me for having been sexually promiscous. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around him and do everything I could to regain his trust. It was horrible and my mental health was shit.   I called him out on being abusive and controlling and sexually coercive. He then proceeded to blame it on me and said that he was only reacting to my past and wouldn‚Äôt have done this if it was another girl who was sexually pure. He eventually admitted that he was abusive, but his apologies always circled back to blaming me. He even accused me of gaslighting and abusing him when I told him he was a misogynist because he treated me like an object. What makes me more scared is that he‚Äôs in grad school training to become a teacher. I can‚Äôt imagine him being a very good role model to children in their formative years. I contemplated reporting him to his program but I‚Äôm not sure if people would even believe me. There‚Äôs so many other little terrible things that I didn‚Äôt get to mention because this post is incredibly long already, so if you‚Äôve read to this point, thank you so much and I appreciate you lots, sis. <3  I can't believe I accepted this sort of treatment. I was depressed for the first month or two and have never felt so low in my life. I'm also scared because during the relationship it felt like I wasn‚Äôt able to think logically, which prevented me from fully seeing what was happening and leaving at the first sight of a red flag. Or honestly, the first couple red flags‚Ä¶there were so many. Any advice or words of support is appreciated, I‚Äôm about to hit 5 months out of this toxic toxic relationship and have been reading FDS like the bible for the past few weeks. I wasn‚Äôt able to talk about this fully with anyone except my therapist, and have only mentioned parts of it to friends because I was so ashamed and buried a lot of the memories because they were so painful. I have been reading some books and they've been helpful too. I hope to be able to heal from this and am still a believer of love, except I want to be focusing energy on relational healing in close female friendships for now.	1642661699.0	s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/	A story from a recovering pickme & libfem.

It's not about men and women bringing the exact same thing to straight relationships, because women already bring much more to relationships in general and are challenged much more by them (more at risk, more societal pressure, etc.). This is why it makes sense to have men pay, why they'll likely get called out more on behaviors, why they may have more to learn in EQ/social skills, and so on.

c776znyg	Marital rape is currently not a crime in India. Indian men are arguing that by criminalizing marital rape, the institution of marriage will be destroyed. They believe that if marital rape is considered a crime, a lot of false cases will be filed against men (do they think that marital rape will cease to exist if it is not criminalized? )  Indian men are using the #MarriageStrike hashtag on Twitter to protest against the criminalization of marital rape. They are threatening to boycott marriage if marital rape is criminalized in India.   I'm shocked that so many men are openly advocating their support for marital rape. Pickmes are agreeing with these views and are also protesting against alimony laws (they think it's unfair that men actually have to pay for their wives' often-unseen labor).   This entire situation seems like a masterclass in negging to me. Men participating in actions that harm women (marital rape in this case) and then crying about the possibility of being a victim of a false-rape case.    In all honesty, I hope such men do choose to not marry. Indian women already deal with a lot of bs, they don't need to worry about rapist husbands.

6m49ufx8	As a recovered pickmiesha I feel so much shame and regret for getting plastic surgery. As a child from a toxic family (LVM father) I had NO sense of confidence in self. That lack of confidence combined with the childhood trauma of having a LVM father really affected me, and I feel that had I been able to see and unpack all of it I would've probably not gotten any type of surgery. My lack of confidence and self worth just lead me to do it for all the wrong reasons. To feel "pretty" and (ultimately) get the attention of men. Of course at the time I was completely unaware of this and totally bought into the libfem idea of "I'm doing it for ME!" (the things we tell ourselves, eh?)  Does anyone else who has awakened from their pickmiesha days feel this way? I don't know how to shake the deep shame, especially since I still have lingering effects from the surgery (some small numbness in areas). I look at old pictures of myself and honestly wish I had never gotten anything done. Not because the surgery made me look bad, but moreso just bc I now know just how sick and damaged I was-- and I love myself now and feel so much shame and regret for putting myself under the knife.  If anyone else has a similar feeling/experience please share. And for ladies who are considering plastic surgery. I ask you to please really REALLY think about it and to work out any and all of your emotional & psychological issues before going under the knife. Make sure that you fully love yourself before making that decision-- and if you do fully love yourself make sure that ultimately your decision is ONLY for (the attention & adoration of) YOU.  &#x200B;  Edit: Wow. I have been so touched by each and every one of your stories, responses, words of wisdom, advice and support. I wrote this literally in the middle of the night while in the deepest pit of shame and sadness. It even took me this long to look at the post because I was so ashamed to have spoken out the pain I felt inside. However, I am glad I took that risk. Your support, stories and responses have given me the confidence to tell my mom about my shame--- and about the numbness from my surgery. This was something I had been carrying for 10+ years and not told a soul, but speaking my truth and not hiding in shame is the first step to healing and acceptance. Thank you all again so so much.

dtznrnwq	Hi ladies! There is an issue in modern dating I can't seem to figure out and I am hoping the FDS community has answers.  Men and women will be talking, vetting, planning dates. I understand when a man gets frustrated by the woman's vetting and sees his own failure he will take himself out of the running by blocking / ghosting etc. What I don't understand is when a man and woman are getting to know each other, maybe the first few dates have happened, maybe the first date is on the calendar and the man BLOCKS the woman.   There is no heads-up or warning to this. No argument, no conflict, again, dates are *on the calendar* and so when the woman reaches out, she discovers she is blocked. When this has happened to me, I block back as soon as possible so I don't have to deal with any weird surprises down the line.  But why do men do this? I don't understand this at all. Why **block** someone you've planned dates with? Is simply planning the date the ego boost? Is there fear of being upfront? What exactly is going on here? I don't know if it's relevant, but I notice the men who do this usually have ADD / ADHD.	1642715422.0	s8txhc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/	Men Who Block For No Reason?

gsv78	This got a lot of upvotes on ASKFDS but no replies so I wanted to see if anyone here had insight. I had a really weird encounter not so long ago and I'm feeling confused about it. Background info: I've been friends with a guy for around 2 years, we were never extremely close but we'd hang out occasionally, and since we have a lot of similar skills in the cyber security space that aren't super easy to come by we'd also share new things we learned. I made it clear to him I had no interest in a relationship by openly saying that I have no interest in a relationship an absurd amount of times. He asked me out once and I shut it down quick, I never felt pressured nor did he do anything weird like stand too close or try too hard to randomly touch me (the normal creep factors of trying to move things from friends to more), so I didn't think anything of it.   In December he told me that a friend of his had a client who he couldn't take on because his small business was super busy. I had mentioned before that I wanted to do a project before the end of the year, so it was kind of perfect. I said I'd help if we went 50/50 since he would be bringing the client and doing half of the work and I'd be doing the other half. He was really adamant on waiting 3 weeks to do the initial proposal which I said was a really long time and that with projects for bigger clients you want to move as quickly as possible. But since he was extremely insistent on waiting the full 21 days to finish our proposal I said okay. We spent 3 weeks hanging out and working and meeting up (daily), and then 2 days before we were about to show the proposal suddenly he tells me his friend actually decided to take the client because he was taking too long to reach out. Already this seemed like a red flag but I already knew there was a chance things would fall apart because of how long he wanted to wait, so I didn't think too much about it and just cut my losses. Like I said, we'd been friends for 2 years, so I brushed it off. We stopped meeting up to work since there was no reason to anymore.   But then he said he had another person who would potentially be interested in something similar and so I agreed we could just repurpose what we'd worked on. I agreed to just go ahead and try our proposal on someone else, which led to hanging out more again and all that. But when it came closer to the time to do it, something came up. This became a pattern for the next 2 weeks of things out of his control happening that made it impossible to do what we were trying to do.   I also noticed a few random lies he had told me. For example, he told me one of his roommates was making $10k a month as a d\*\*ler, I thought that was absurd but he kept assuring me that he was making that much and selling to the entireity of our area. I don't do anything like that so I just brushed it off as his roommate trying to look cooler than he is. Then when we were hanging out, he mentions his roommates GF may be pregnant to which I said that's great, but he said his roommate doesn't have the money for a kid. I brought up the $10k lie he had told me and he said he didn't remember saying that or he was probably overexaggerating when he said that because his roommate makes closer to $3k a month. Lying is a huge turn off for me, but this confirmed that he was the one lying to me, not his roommate lying to him.   He also did over exaggerate when talking about other stuff but I chalked it up to personality (think ‚ÄúBEST pizza‚Äù or ‚ÄúMOST EXPENSIVE Italian restaurant‚Äù), now I‚Äôm not sure if that was a red flag I missed.   I ghosted him, blocked all his social media, etc.. today his friend reached out to me in my DM requests just saying "Hi Iceyboo", I ignored it. He also has been texting me a ton asking me why I'm being distant and ghosting him etc.. but honestly I don't feel like responding nor do I care to reply.   All in all, I understand I just wasted 5 weeks and this guy is defo a liar. But I wanted to know if anyone has experienced something similar?   I just feel confused by what happened.   Is there a word or term for what happened here? Any advice or personal anecdotes that are similar would really help assuage the confusion I‚Äôm feeling.	1642722101.0	s8w84l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/	Has a man ever lied to you about potential opportunities/working on common goals to spend more time with you? *discussion*

36w6bfjp	I was in two relationships for half of my 20s, and those men sucked so much life out of me. Since being single and hardly dating in the past year and a half, I've rediscovered so much about myself and my interests, for example:  \- I'm a super calm and stable person. I used to cry on a twice weekly schedule with my ex, he made me think I was emotionally unstable and anxious, in our arguments he would aggravate me so much that I'd yell and cry. Turns out he was the problem, and I'm an exceptionally stable person and only external circumstances will bring me to tears. I have maybe cried 3-4 times since breaking up with him. Obviously, I haven't yelled at anyone since him, and I never yelled at anyone before him.  \- I'm a very social person, extroverted person. My ex liked to think he was the gregarious one, but in truth he was just a narc that needed attention on him at all times. In truth, no one considers him a close friend other than whoever his supply is at the moment. Comparatively I have really strong support systems around me, and have managed to make so many new friends since.  \- I love new food, and especially fine dining and good cocktails. My ex was such a picky eater that it sucked the joy out of eating out and cooking.  \- I love reading fiction and I love watching history documentaries. Without him I actually have had time to rediscover old hobbies that I enjoy, instead of trying to bond with him over stuff only he enjoyed (i.e. video games ü§¢)  Those of you that have been single for a while, what have you been surprised and happy to rediscover about yourself without the presence of someone toxic sucking your energy out and telling you lies about who you are?	1642727425.0	s8y34s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y34s/whatve_you_rediscovered_about_yourself_since/	What've you rediscovered about yourself since being single?
h57msag5	It grinds my gears to witness my PickMe friends being self-destructive and in complete denial about their toxic relationships. It's ALL they ever talk about, and they NEVER follow my advice!   It's like they're holding onto an electric fence, complaining about how it hurts, but when I tell them to just LET GO they'll give me a lengthy speech: *"Like, it hurts, but it's such a rush too! And if you get used to it, the pain is really more of a dull tingling feeling. The shock isn't constant either, just occasional pulses. The good outshines the bad for me. But yeah, the shocks hurt like hell! ...No I don't want to let go, I just want to vent about the pain I'm experiencing! Why aren't you supporting me??"*  So I've begun setting iron boundaries, to protect myself from becoming collateral damage as a result of their weak boundaries. Because I really do get frustrated beyond belief by their ongoing stupidity. Sure, make mistakes. It's your life. But I'm not staying around for live updates about you setting yourself up for failure and abuse.  *Example: Recently texted a PickMe friend to shut up about her situationship with an expat from now on (she's convinced their 2 month fling is actually a budding romance that'll cross borders, she's in complete denial about being Future Faked). Told her to not even mention the expat's name when we hang out with just the two of us. I'm 100% willing to drop her if she doesn't respect my boundary.*   Queens, please tell FDS about the PickMe friends you've cut from your life!	1642727723.0	s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/	Tell us about the PickMe friend(s) you ditched!
cw7827nc	Watched the new episode of And Just Like That. No spoilers, but Miranda and Steve continue to go back and forth about their marriage and Steve says straight out Miranda has been waffling about whether he's good enough for her or not their whole relationship. That's the truth because Steve is what happens when you settle. He was a bartender, a drunken one night stand that Miranda met in a bar after a fight with Carrie. He kept chasing Miranda until she agreed to date him.   They dated but he broke up with her because she was high-flying Harvard-educated attorney with a lifestyle he couldn't afford. He orbited around though until she took him back out of boredom and loneliness. He asked for exclusivity but Miranda said to Carrie, "I'm not dating anyone else but I'm so ambivalent about Steve...What if someone better comes along?" Steve said he loved her and asked to move in, Miranda agreed and it seemed like love. Until he moved in to her gorgeous apartment and started leaving skid marks on his underwear-when she was kind enough to do his laundry. He acted like a helpless child, watching cartoons and getting a puppy while she did all the work. She said to him, "I'm sick of being the adult, we're supposed to be equals! I want a partner. I'm tired of being the mom!" She broke up with him with those words. Very FDS. But trying to be the Cool Girl, she let him orbit some more. Long story short, Steve got testicular cancer and was left with one ball. Miranda had pity sex with him and got pregnant. Miranda was afraid she would never get pregnant again being reproductively challenged, so she had the baby, tying her to Steve for life. They finally married when the baby was one and she takes on all responsibility in his life, including his mother with dementia.   Outside of sex, Miranda was never excited about Steve but she was afraid. Afraid of never getting married and having kids, afraid of not keeping up with her friends. So she settled. And 17 years later, her husband is still the same guy she was ambivalent about-a guy with a high school education and no real hobbies, who wants to sit around and watch tv every night. In other words, exactly who he was when they dated. Miranda is still growing. She was a lawyer, but is now getting a master's in Public Policy. She's well-travelled, well-read, ambitious, and bold and she has a circle of friends who are just the same and her husband in a Brooklynite who has probably never travelled further than New Jersey.   I think Miranda is excited about Che, but really I think she's just so bored with Steve she'd be equally excited by any real adult. This should be inspiration to every FDS lady to never settle. I know, things can look bleak. And Steve seemed like a good enough guy for a long time. After Miranda left him for trying to make her Mommy Bangmaid, he levelled up, opened his own bar, developed a little ambition. He was a good father when their child was born. And it was the early 2000s, I don't think women had realized they deserved more than that collectively yet. So she married him and she's still paying for it. Hold out, ladies. Miranda has said she'd rather be alone at this point. While most women aren't having a big late-in-life queer affair, I think most women in their 50s or above are tired of their husbands. Tired of the routine of marriage to someone they were probably never all that excited about.   Remember ladies, sex fades. We do absolutely deserve earth-shattering sex with our committed partners, but it should not be the foundation of the relationship. Miranda's relationship with Steve was built on sex and sustained with emotional anxiety she couldn't do better. Instead of trying or being content alone, she tried to make sex enough. And so she was trapped with a man she had little in common with, not background, interests, values. Just a child and a life. Do the work now or you'll have to pay later.	1642728550.0	s8ygwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8ygwb/steve_from_sex_and_the_city_is_what_happens_when/	Steve from Sex and the City is what happens when you settle
8estq45x	Although I've only been dating my current boyfriend for about a year so it's too early to call him a HVM, he's treated me well and is what I would want in a romantic partner. He doesn't watch porn or follow/like girls/women with social media thirst trap influencer accounts (of his own accord, not because I "forced" him to); he drives us to all of our dates and pays for the gas, food, and events; he covers our hotel accommodations if we stay overnight in other cities; and he frequently surprises me with cute little gifts even when there's no special occasion (and of course, on actual special occasions such as my birthday, Valentine's/Christmas, or our anniversary, he'll go all out). Besides this, he has a fairly well-paying job for someone of his age, respects both of his parents and regularly keeps in touch with his family, and is hard-working, ambitious, and has a kind heart.  All this being said, I'm honestly sick of his LVM/pickme friends. For context, my boyfriend went to university in a different city, but moved to the city where I currently live when he graduated college and got a job here. Because of this, he doesn't have many close friends in this city aside from one LVM/pickme boyfriend/girlfriend who both happened to get a job here, too. This past year, my boyfriend has made a lot of other friends, but compared to 5 years of knowing this LVM/pickme couple, 1 year of getting to know his new friends hasn't been enough time for him to have as much of a genuine human connection with them as with his old buddies.  The LVM/pickme aren't necessarily "bad" people, and I know that they're both good friends to my boyfriend, but I don't enjoy hanging out with them, nor do I feel particularly comfortable that these are the "type" of people that my boyfriend would choose to keep in his close friends circle (after all, we wouldn't want to be friends with people who don't bring value to our lives, and over time, we become more similar to the people who we choose to surround ourselves with, so it concerns me that these are the type of people he enjoys being around).  The LVM/pickme pair are both social media influencers on tiktok (the LVM has over a million followers while the pickme has several tens of thousands), and their content honestly makes me cringe. **The pickme has videos that are supposed to be "cute" but which honestly just make me sad... For example: a video where she's trying to get affection from the boyfriend but he's busy on his phone or playing video games, a different video where she shows various ways of "getting the boyfriend's attention" such as by slipping under his arm when he's typing on his laptop, and one of the most recent videos where she said that she and her boyfriend haven't gone on a date in two years (even though they've only been together for three years...) so she decided to surprise him by making a custom game for them to decide their date night ideas.**  It's not just on social media that their relationship feels off to me. **I've met both of them in person, and the boyfriend joked that the girlfriend "used to be ugly back then" and he wouldn't have dated her if she didn't have a "glow up." Besides that, both of them actively check out people of the opposite sex and tell their partner about it, and then they both talk about it, which makes me nauseous because they're okay with the idea of sexualizing random strangers.**  My boyfriend has other LVM/pickme acquaintances (for example, pickmes that post provocative photos on social media as a sign of "fEmAlE eMpOwErMeNt" when it's really just catering to the heterosexual male gaze), but these are people who he's known since his childhood or teenage years, and who he's not close to anymore (and he never likes any of these types of photos/videos of theirs). For example, to be fair, I also have LVM/pickme "friends" who aren't actually my "real" friends anymore but who are more just like people that I knew from back then, and who I just haven't explicitly cut out of my life, but who I never talk to anymore. I think everyone has a lot of friends from when we used to be kids or teenagers, and statistically, a lot of them are bound to grow up into LVM/pickmes during adulthood, and as long as we're not close to these types of people anymore, then it's okay.  These old acquaintances aren't a problem, but this LVM/pickme couple who live in our city give me a bad vibe, even if both of them have only ever been good friends to my boyfriend and decent people to me when I met them. I just don't know if it's possible to reconcile these types of low value people with a high value romantic relationship of my own.	1642731002.0	s8zap2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/	When a Boyfriend Has LVM/Pickme Friends

But I am sensing from my circle, online (even elsewhere on Reddit), and what I hear about, a "no more strictly casual" Zeitgeist shift. I do think it's a general trend in society, a new intolerance for abuse, along the same lines as women (and men) no longer putting up with jobs they hate a la The Great Resignation. I feel like humans are finally not taking shit from others as much, from bosses, to scrotes.

dc7fqfp0	Queens, here's my theory and would love to hear your wisdom about this!  **Feeling irritation at someone's mannerisms is your intuition telling you that something is disingenuous about this person.**     We can sense the subtleties of facial expressions, hand movements, body movements not aligning with the sentiments the person is trying to convey.    **Backstory**:   For the past few months I have been vetting a man and I could not understand why his mannerisms irritated me so much!   Examples: His facial expressions were exaggerated, his hand movements were so annoying, the noises he made in lieu of laughing made me cringe, even the way he talked the pauses and cadence made my blood boil sometimes.    I felt like something was wrong with me like I was unable to accept someone for their unique personality traits or that I was unable to accept someone who was not as poised as I wanted, or whatever it was, I blamed myself.  This is not first that I have been around a man whose mannerisms irritated me.  He otherwise, was portraying some HVM qualities, he was attentive, caring, helpful, always planning the next date, sent me flowers weekly.  But something about his mannerisms made me cringe.    And then it hit me after realizing some other things that were off with this particular scrote.  (I ended things).  He annoyed me so much because he was being disingenuous and he was trying to be someone he was not, he was faking maturity and HVM qualities when in actuality he was an insecure passive aggressive scrote and my intuition was telling me that all along!  More and more red flags started popping up as he got more and more comfortable.  When I asked him about his over exaggerated facial expressions, he said he knows how to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù in public and around new people.  And that no one else in his life has had an issue with it, later he confessed one of his exes pointed it out as well.  He would forget things that he told me, contradict himself, pretend to know something about a certain topic he was actually clueless about, usually politics.   So glad to be done with this one!   Also, as an aside, a *vetting question to use in the initial dating process:* **What do you want out of life for your future wife/partner?**  The goal being to see if the person has ever thought about or if they have the ability to think about on the spot what they want out of life for a person they love or if they can even articulate care and wants for another person.  The one man I asked it to so far, drew a complete blank and had a difficult time answering this which was a red flag, IMHO.	1642800140.0	s9lblz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9lblz/irritating_mannerisms_are_a_red_flag_and_your/	Irritating mannerisms are a red flag and your intuition telling you that something is off!

410o4mj2	So basically I was at the grocery store behind a super long line of stuff that filled almost all of the conveyer belt.  The store was jammed so I didn't try to find a shorter line despite having only two items, and just got behind them.  From the jump I was getting pickme bad vibes from the girl and felt like she was kind of mean mugging me and gave me weird jealous vibes, so I just kind of got on my phone and ignored them.  So I wasn't paying attention until the very end of the checkout process when I suddenly notice that there's two seperate dividers within their order but theyre clearly paying together/chatting together.  There's a bunch of hair stuff at the end so at first I assume it's for her and he's making her pay separate while he pays for the groceries, which I think is pretty pathetically cheap.  But no- it's even worse.  She pays for the $300 worth of groceries, and he whips out his card for the $20 of hair products so he can style an early 2000s hair flip onto his middle aged head.  Even the check out lady was confused and initially tried to ring them up together until the embarrassed looking pickme had to specify, lol.  So after they finally check out I'm like thank God that mess is gone and it takes less than a minute for the lady to scan me and me to pay and leave.  I'm a pretty fast walker and I pass them at the start of the parking lot on my way to my car.  I parked in the back so I'm focused on getting to my car.  When I get there, I throw the items in the back, and as I'm putting my keys into the ignition and throwing my purse on the passenger seat and everything, I realize that the couple had parked a couple spots away from me, on the opposite side.  I also realize that the man is now sitting in the front seat, heat and lights on, while the woman loads the groceries into the back of his truck (of course it was a huge truck).  I just.... I'm speechless.  If this is what pickmes go through I find it genuinely hilarious yet also sad.  I also felt like the checkout lady was thinking wtf when it came to them as well as everyone else in line behind us (there were a lot since it took so long to check them out).  I actually took a picture of the checkout situation where you can see the dividers dividing the hair product but I dont want to post it because apparently photos on reddit can be traced or you can get info or whatever... but this was truly sad to witness.  It made me so grateful not to be a pickme.  And this was an attractive looking lady!     Also this was my last grocery run of the night, hence only grabbing two items, and the really cute checkout guy at the previous store was really flirting with me in a cute way.  I was just thinking.... in life you can either be a pickme loading a middle aged scrote's free groceries into his truck for him, or a hot single girl getting flirted with by the clerk with muscles and a cute face. You dont have to choose a sad pickme life!	1642816066.0	s9r146	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9r146/today_i_watched_a_scrote_make_a_pickme_pay_for/	Today I watched a scrote make a pickme pay for all the groceries and then load them into the car herself

172w3bkm	Hey ladies,   How do you vet men that come from high machismo cultures?   How do you test them, so that when they fail, you know right away they are misogynistic pieces of shit?   Conversely, how do you test to see if they are truly HVM, even though they may have observed LVM behavior in their upbringing/cultural environments?  In my experience, I listen to how he describes his relationship with his father and mother, and the relationship between the mother and father. Watch for the way he describes his most recent ex too.	1642825455.0	s9tze5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9tze5/when_dating_poc_men_that_come_from_patriarchal/	When dating POC men that come from patriarchal cultures...

7d1wafuk	I just recently saw a post about how men wanting to have sex with you isn‚Äôt the compliment you think it is and It inspired me to make a post of my own.   In my deep pick me days (basically wasn‚Äôt warned about anything regarding men..and even encouraged to have casual sex alas..) I did do one thing right. And that is to always date foreigners or people not directly involved in my day to day, so that if I chose to I‚Äôd never see them again.   Growing up I‚Äôd watch a lot of tv and the scenes that stuck out to me were when in high school the guys would tell everyone who they slept with and the girls reputation would be trashed and she‚Äôd suffer all kinds of abuse.   So this led me to not dating men who could have that effect on me and guess what.. I was right. Every single guy casual hookup or not has bragged to their bros or laughed about our encounters and not kept anything private. Even men who I never had intercourse with would do that because it‚Äôs a perverse way to get revenge on someone who rejected them. This one liar has tried to gain personal information on me and nudes (I keep blocking him) as a sadistic form of revenge for playing him just as much as he played me. But the saving grace in all those stories ? I can go about my day and work without being harassed due to many of them living in another country and not having access to any of the places I currently work at.   I believe that doing this is a good form of social protection especially if you‚Äôre still unsure of your vetting skills.	1642835540.0	s9wt2k	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9wt2k/male_degradationshaming_after_sexual_encounters/	Male degradation/shaming after sexual encounters

8r15jxb0	I know it's important to find a HV partner but regardless of how HV both people in a relationship are, one wanting kids and another not wanting kids is often not negotiable. Should we hence avoid dating men of occupations which involve working with children (eg. primary/secondary school teacher, child psychologist, pediatrician) if we don't want kids?  Yes, a lot of people pick their careers based on salary, job security, and how easy it will be to find a job as opposed to their interests (and unfortunately some men want to work with kids as they are pedophiles), but I guess some men want to work with kids as they love kids. I assume a lot of these men also want kids of their own. It's not that different from how most veterinarians probably like animals to some extent and probably already have or want pets.	1642847878.0	s9zsrv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9zsrv/should_we_avoid_dating_men_of_certain_occupations/	Should we avoid dating men of certain occupations if we don't want kids?

8jqlhqx3	This is a post alluding to Daniel Sloss's book called - : "Everyone  You Hate Is Going to Die: And Other Comforting Thoughts on Family,  Friends, Sex, Love, and More Things That Ruin Your Life"  To the ladies who aren't aware, Like I wasn't, before I picked the book - He is a stand-up Comedian by profession and this book just alludes to all the facts the FDS constantly swears by.   1. OLD IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME: He directly goes on to say that, old is a method of hooking up and mostly having a one-night stand. It is close to impossible to find a person worth your time and commitment. It is wild to think so that a man there would really want anything other than that.  2. TRUE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IS A RATHER DIFFICULT COMBINATION TO ACHIEVE- He goes on to say that he is friends with an amazing woman who he already had slept with and has no intention of EVER marrying.  He talks about how his father thinks this "best-friend" of his, he has strung along for years would end up being his wife but he denies it so clearly that it made me feel so embarrassed for this woman because it was like getting rejected. I'll skip through all the time he fucks her over and probably uses her for emotional support and as all time helpline.  3. DO NOT DO A MAN'S WORK FOR HIM- He might be a stand-up comedian but He straight up confesses that He wants to be the one who buys the ring and go down on one knee of his future wife. This is a man's domain and sure as hell, if the man ain't doing it, he ain't the one.  4. NO MAN/PERSON CAN FILL THE HOLE INSIDE YOUR CHEST - If you feel lonely with yourself, you need help. Cultivate yourself, show that love you have to yourself. Become a HVW and LIVE your life like a fcking main-character!  5. MEN KNOW WHO THEY WANT TO COMMIT TO AND WILL SHOW UP IF THEY ARE A HVM: In sharp contrast to his girl---friend who probably got the worst end of the deal. Men know what they want, and if they see it, they'll make sure you know.  Realize your worth, ladies. Keep vetting and stop settling.   6. MEN AREN'T BABIES, THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING: Next time you think about giving a man, the benefit of doubt, leave. (He brought a girl (for sex ofc) over to his "best friend's" house a day after they had sex and then she had to sit him down and explain to him, why that was wrong) Men are perfectly self-aware, and are just looking to test your limits. Put a full stop to these kind of relationships.   Thanks to fds, Women like us are able to a certain degree screen out LVM out of your lives. Please, Remember you worth ladies! We are all rooting for you!  &#x200B;  ##	1642877544.0	sa995z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sa995z/straight_from_the_horses_mouth_daniel_sloss/	Straight from the Horse's Mouth: Daniel Sloss

4z5y91wa	I was just watching a tiktok explaining how women on survival shows handle their menstrual cycle. She goes onto say they used to get a med box full of tampons, until the men started complaining about being at a disadvantage. So NOW, there is a single med box for all the women to share, in an area fully recorded, and only one woman is allowed at a time so as not to "conspire."   WHAT THE FUCK??????   Then, I was on the interesting asf subreddit and saw the one about women-only parking, and sure enough! Men are in the comments complaining!!!!!! They are actual grown ass males in the comments claiming sexism and discrimination because there is a section for women to be in view of the cameras in a well lit area ü•¥I actually can't believe it.

affrm017	EDIT: thank you so much for the responses, everyone! I‚Äôve been experiencing awful morning sickness (actually all-day sickness) so am trying to avoid screens, but I read all of your advice and I truly appreciate it.   Hi FDS ladies! I‚Äôd appreciate hearing your opinions on this situation:  I found out a couple days ago that I was pregnant. This was an accident, and I have no intention of keeping the fetus as I‚Äôm only 23 and still have a lot that I want to accomplish before I even think about becoming a mother. I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend (24) for 9 months, and he‚Äôs been really exemplar through all my vetting up until this point.  We‚Äôve agreed in the past that if I ever got pregnant, I would get an abortion. I reassured him that this was still the plan. However, I then asked him what he would do if I hypothetically decided I couldn‚Äôt go through with the abortion after all. His response was that he would panic and try to convince me to go through with it anyways. I think the answer I was hoping for was more like ‚Äúit wouldn‚Äôt be an ideal situation, but since we were both responsible I‚Äôd support you and the child as best as I could‚Äù. This whole interaction has put a bad taste in my mouth.   Ladies, am I reading too much into it? It might be relevant that I recently graduated and started my career back in September.

5587k26c	We've all heard of the trafficking concerns, the exploitation concerns, the profound effects on the viewer's brain chemistry and relationships with women. There's one more reason you should refuse to date men who watch porn, and why porn fans in general should be disqualified from dating.  Consider why men watch porn in the first place. It's quick, easy pleasure for them. That reason alone is enough for them to override every reason not to watch it, especially in a relationship. They will tell you this themselves. In the anti-porn groups I lead, a certain type of man is always too willing to barge in and insist that men NEEEEED this quick and easy release no matter what the cost.  But listen long enough and this reasoning has an even more selfish side. Sex is too much work for them. They don't want to put in the work for mutual pleasure. So if they can't use you like a masturbation sleeve, they'd much rather go off and jerk it to someone else. This type of man actively resents the expectation that he should reciprocate the action of you handing over your body for his pleasure. To this type of man, you "aren't entitled" to enjoy the act of satisfying a man.  "But I get off on making women cum!" Don't trust this, either. If they got their moves from porn, they're likely to poke their fingers inside you for a while and wonder why it's not working when they won't even attempt to find the right spots. Or stick to a porn-fueled routine in favor or your own communication of what actually works for you.  To them, the act of sex is almost exclusively limited to PIV. Your "foreplay" is giving him a blowjob. And if you don't spontaneously orgasm from those generous concessions on his behalf, that's your problem and not his responsibility to help you out. Why would you put that much pressure on him to delay his orgasm so you can enjoy yourself too? Don't you know how hard that is for a man? Going down on you or using his hands is unthinkable. Why would you expect him to perform sex acts that don't stimulate his penis? Don't you know what sex is all about? Silly girl.  Porn videos don't have expectations of them. The women are up for anything and will always enjoy themselves with no effort on the man's part. The male performer shows up, dick in hand, and the viewer gets to do the same. It's ironic that porn fans convince themselves that porn is just like sex, but will side-eye the idea of sex with a real woman in favor of a screen. Then they'll paint it as a failure of the women in their lives. I suspect many of the women for whom "orgasms aren't a big deal" came to this conclusion after being with this type of man long enough. I know this was the case for me.  What I'm getting at here is that to the porn viewer, sex is a completely one-sided act and it's the woman's responsibility to find her own pleasure while her body is used for entertainment. I'd say this is the result of porn binges, but I'm not convinced sex was any better for women in cavemen days.  A man worth bedding will understand that there's some effort involved in pleasuring his partner, but it's not the herculean endeavor that the pornsick crowd will claim. He'll take the time to find out what gets you going instead of taking cues from a screen.   This type of man is not concerned with making you happy in bed, and will see sex with you as an alternative means to his own pleasure. They'd rather have the porn. But because they also feel entitled to a "partner" to take care of them, they won't end things and will do the bare minimum to keep you around, wondering why you aren't enough for him and being miserable.  This is all assuming their dick still works.  Tl;Dr: Don't do guys who watch porn if you want a satisfying sex life.	1642912195.0	sal4lo	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sal4lo/one_more_reason_to_cut_off_men_who_watch_porn/	One more reason to cut off men who watch porn

8uuz5573	So lately I've been trying to focus on dropping the male orbiters out of my life. I know I should have done this a long time ago, but like any big change in life, it's been scary. Before you ask why I don't just block and delete this particular guy, it's because he knows where I live, he's local, he's weird, and I feel like the safest thing to do is to gradually back away until we move, which we will soon.   I've known this guy for a long time. Well, he messaged me out of the blue maybe half a year ago. Basic "how've you been, what have you been up to" type questions. He does this randomly sometimes, then disappears for awhile.   I realized that the randomness in when he would message me wasn't random at all, he was looking for somebody to be his therapist, somebody to make him feel better about himself, and to "shoot his shot" every now and then, to see if I'd gotten desperate enough to give him a chance yet. I wasn't a friend, I was somebdoy he could leech emotional labor off of when nobody else would talk to him.  A couple examples of how this has become crystal clear to me:  - **Constantly seeking validation every time he talks to me. He very obviously wants me to pat him on the back and congratulate him even though he's done nothing to warrant it.**  Ex: He started to learn a language very similar to the one I'm learning. The thing is, when he saw how much more progress I was making than him, he gave up on the app. When I spoke the language to him, he would criticize my pronunciation, despite it being near perfect (I'm in a language sharing Discord server). Whenever he would talk in the language, all he did was quickly mumble through the words in an attempt to sound fluent. I know a lot more than him, and could tell what he was doing.   - **I told him flat out multiple times I wasn't interested, and that I'm not sure we could really be friends if he was going to be weird about it. He said it was cool and he was over it. He was not.**  Ex: He kept making weird comments, and when I'd remind him I wasn't into him, he'd say things like like "It's okay, I wait for (my name)". Speaking in the third person was so fucking cringe, and he does it a lot. He clearly intends to "wait me out", and has told on himself multiple times.   - **He tries to make me jealous, even though I have less than zero interest in him. It's so desperate and gross, this is really what opened my eyes.**  Ex: He started talking to a girl on OLD, showed me pictures of her, ect. Just by looking at her, I knew that wasn't happening. He's a "multiple messages in a row over the course of several days" type of guy. Anyways, he stopped talking to me for a month or two. Then, "randomly" came back, with zero mention of her, who he had bragged about being so serious with before. My conclusion is she finally blocked him, and he needed another woman to pester.   - **He only talks about himself, and is a MAJOR sympathy fisherman. Think emo teen that grew up physically, but not at all emotionally.**  Ex: He will deadass message me completely out of the blue, and say something like, "Awful day, yours was probably better than mine", and nothing else. Past me might have asked "oh what happened??". But current me realizes that he never extends the same courtesy back my way, so I refuse to do it for him. Last time I literally responded with something like, "Probably is, I had a pretty good day". Naturally, he ignored it completely, tried once more to get me to ask about his day, but I played dumb and dodged it. After that, it was very suddenly "time for him to sleep".   Basically, this dude is awful, and I really wish I could just block and delete and be done with it. I regret ever letting him know where I live. He's completely low value in every single possible way. Bad looks, bad hygiene, bad social skills, bad personality, bad physique, bad skillset (or lack of), bad job/education, ect. There is literally nothing appealing about this guy.   The thing is, most of those things he can change, but he's just a lazy person. I have no sympathy for him, and I hope that being short and boring with him and not really engaging will cause him to eventually lose interest and go find somebody else to pester. As I've gradually distanced myself, it feels freeing to not have somebody leeching emotional energy out of me.   Thanks for listening to my rant. Do you guys have any similar stories of desperate orbiters that used to hang around, or even still do? Do you have any tips for safely cutting them out? Feel free to rant with me.	1642920934.0	sanl38	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sanl38/gradually_dropping_a_male_orbiter/	Gradually dropping a male orbiter
8estq45x	How do you all do it? And no, I don't mean what foundation you apply, or how you style your eyeliner, or what color eyeshadow you use - I mean, how do you do it, how do you reconcile slathering your face and body with products that have direct associations with the beauty industry (a name which I find so ironic because it wouldn't be able to make profits if people didn't feel ugly, or at least some degree of simply not being "as beautiful" as they potentially could, or beautiful enough), with the idea of being a woman who simply wants to express herself independent of the male gaze?  I find that I look "prettier" with conventional makeup on, but I know that this idea of "pretty" is largely shaped by heterosexual male preference and the beauty industry, which is saturated with scrotes and pickmes. Even when I do "unconventional" makeup that isn't typically "sexy," such as bold lip colors, bright eye palettes, and nose art (which are probably too eccentric and unattractive to the normal heterosexual man whose brain has been too fried by the makeup styles seen in porn, and so anything "artsy" like this is probably a turnoff), I still feel a bit uncomfortable, because even though I know that bold patterns and bright colors aren't exactly catering to male heterosexuality, it's nonetheless makeup, and the makeup industry, and the entire beauty industry, profit off of women shelling out hundreds or thousands of dollars into these practically useless products - hundreds or thousands of dollars that could otherwise be used for a productive/fulfilling hobby/skill, or to invest, or to save for retirement, etc.  Besides this dilemma, I feel like makeup culture in general is just plain misogynistic. If we do our hair and makeup, people judge us as more attractive, even though it's actually a very "fake" attractiveness that can only be achieved with product and labor. **If we don't do our hair and makeup, and just do a basic skincare routine of cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF, we're suddenly "tired" or "sick," even though this is the default state of any regular human being. So many men are going about, not moisturizing, and not using sunscreen, but I guess that's normal, and therefore, somehow acceptable**, so it confuses me as to why women are held to such a different standard.  \---  **I've always disliked the beauty industry, but I've been having an especially hard time coping with all of this now because my boyfriend's mom owns an eyelash salon.** His mom and dad were immigrants who came to this country dirt poor - the dad was an engineer who invested his savings until there was enough money to start up the mom's company, then the mom made it really big (first starting off with nails and now specializing in eyelashes), and because of her hard work, the family now has millions of dollars in assets and is living a very comfortable life, literally the epitome of the American Dream. I realize that without this salon business, my boyfriend's family could have never become so wealthy; that being said, I still have every right to hate fake nails (some of which are so horrendously long to the point that they're honestly impractical and unhygienic) and I still have every right to hate fake eyelashes (which, like fake nails, serve no actual function/purpose, and both of which remind me of porn culture, whether explicitly or through other avenues such as social media influencers). **I still have every right to despise these things, but I honestly feel like I can't talk to my boyfriend about them because it could be misinterpreted as hating his mom for taking advantage of such a profitable business idea which just happens to be in the very industry that I have such a deep and burning hatred for. To be honest, I feel extremely frustrated. It's not just my boyfriend that I can't talk to about this - I can't talk to anyone that I know in real life when it comes to these issues, and it's an extraordinarily isolating and lonely path to walk down, when the only thing to keep you company is your own thoughts, since no one else seems to agree, or if they do agree, they just don't feel as strongly and passionately about these things as you do.**  I know that some of you ladies might like nails and eyelashes for your own reasons, the same way that some of you ladies probably appreciate makeup as an art form, for example. I just feel like I'm constantly doing mental gymnastics in my head because fake long nails and fake long eyelashes literally wouldn't exist without misogynistic beauty standards and porn culture, so how can I not hate them? And yet my boyfriend's mom, a successful and powerful businesswoman, literally grew her wealth this way, so how can I blame her for making money, even if it was "at the expense" of other women shelling out cash for nails and eyelashes?  \---  I feel the same way about the first part of my post as well - I'm constantly doing mental gymnastics, wondering how in the world it's possible to truly wear makeup "for ourselves" - and I think the reason I can never seem to come to a happy conclusion is because, deep down, I know that no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that it's really "just for us," nothing really is, when it comes to beauty. **What we perceive as beautiful, is shaped by our experiences throughout our entire childhood and adulthood. What we perceive as pretty, is shaped by our culture and our society. What we perceive as attractive, is warped by toxic beauty standards and porn culture, whether we like it or not, and whether we consciously realize it or not, and yes, we can fight it, but it takes years of unlearning, and years of unconditioning.** We can delude ourselves all day long, saying that we do it because we genuinely enjoy it, independent of *man*kind, and doing it truly for the empowerment of *woman*kind, but the pessimist in me (just kidding, what I meant to say is, the realist) highly doubts this. I'm sure all of you ladies have read this quote by Atwood many times by now, but it seems to ring especially true for such a topic as this, for *"even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else.

5iysyw7g	I went out last night and saw how obvious the LVM are. They are desperate!   I was at an event where I wanted to meet people and network, but didn‚Äôt even get to speak to the women. Men swarmed the few women that were there and ignored the other men. At one point, I was having a serious conversation about work, and the guy next to me interrupted the other guy, acted like he was invisible, and tried his best to impress me at random.   I do NOT like feeling like some trophy to be won. Best part? They knew I have a bf, but they didn‚Äôt care.   I like my bf for the fact that he sees other men as possible friends and has banter with them.   Pre FDS, I was oblivious and wanted friends so much, that if a man spoke to me, I felt cherished that he wanted to be my friend. Now my first thought is - you trying to get with me? ü§®	1642946375.0	sau8s7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sau8s7/socialising_with_men_pre_fds_vs_post_fds/	Socialising with men pre FDS vs post FDS
avgpm6cu	When I was severely, suicidally depressed a couple of years ago the medication completely put me off sex. Sometimes I wanted to want sex, but I couldn‚Äôt feel arousal, stimulation or any sort of intimate desire at all. My fianc√©, who in many ways had been incredibly supportive throughout my illness did not support this for long. It was all ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just try‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind if you don‚Äôt orgasm‚Äù or ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs a big part of our relationship‚Äù and other such whiney shite.  A few times I gave him and let him have his sex, but unsurprisingly it was a dreadful experience for me. Letting this man who was supposed to be ‚Äòthe love of my life‚Äô and who had ‚Äòbeen so supportive so would it really hurt so much just to give him this, since I haven‚Äôt been much fun recently‚Äô masturbate into my myopic body triggered all sorts of depressive responses. I later realised in therapy the root cause of my depression was sex abuse at the hands of grown men (the worst being one of my teachers) as a teenager, so letting my fianc√© have one-sided sex with my body was the worst possible thing I could have done for recovery. It made me so fucking miserable, and even more worthless, but it was keeping him happy and rElAtIoNsHiPs ArE cOmPrOmIsE.  Anyway, one day through the depressed fog I refused to have sex. I chanced across a teeny particle of self-respect and put my foot down. And his response was to huff and stomp his way up to our bedroom with his laptop, put on some porn film and wank his way back to sanity. As though releasing his semen was an inalienable human right. At the time I was relieved - all ‚Äúfor the love of god, why doesn‚Äôt he just do that all the time‚Äù but now my (mostly) recovered self is absolutely outraged at the disrespect I was tolerating in my own home:   A) Tolerating him thinking he had a right to shagging my body when I wasn‚Äôt interested. B) That he was willing to whittle away at my not being interested, implying that I owed him sex because our relationship was now boring. C) That he could even enjoy sex that his partner, the supposed love of his life, wasn‚Äôt interested in. D) That his response to not getting his way was to revert to porn. E) That a porn film was used as punishment/leverage - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not giving me what I want so now I have a right to get it from looking at other women, if you‚Äôve got a problem with that you‚Äôll have to give me sex‚Äù. F) That he thought marrying me and still being a porn user were in any way compatible. That I ALSO thought his marrying me and still being a porn user were in any way compatible.  Anyway, over the last 18 months I‚Äôve dumped his ass, sold our house by myself (he literally refused to help) quit my shit, misogynistic, supposedly high status job and started retraining in something I actually like AND finally reported pedo teacher to the police after 12 years.

5eyjl40e	Many of you know I'm widowed, been widowed several years. I'm also passively open to companionship, provided the guy has his own house, and we keep money separate. I'm childfree, and refuse to be a step-mother. I've mentioned before that I'm also a long-time chatter, and that I leave it on in the background while playing games and reading online. Furthermore, some of you know I have an online "stalker", The Idiot With 10,000 Names, who is everything I despise in a human and specifically in a man: not bright, traditional, conservative, religious, a single father, quite often someone who negs, and attempts to manipulate in the most clumsy and pathetic of ways which I see through every time. However, his one talent is changing nicks, so I can't just block and delete for good. I play whack-a-mole with this moron.  This guy has repeatedly said he wants to meet me in person. People and men don't intimidate me; I've been called the intimidating one since I'm no-nonsense, put up with no shit ever, and am just all business when dealing with people I don't know. He clearly "wants" me; he makes it clear he adores my (50+, plain, average) looks. Okay, whatever, there's someone for everyone, and I am, alas, his type.   A recent post here, about how men truly hate women and want to humiliate them, made me think of this guy immediately. It made my spidey senses tingle. Think of Bella when the guys surrounded her and Edward could read their (most probably rape-y) thoughts. I've asked him, though, why would you spend hundreds of dollars to come to Louisiana, for at most a 30 minute coffee date, maybe a dinner date? He never has an answer. I've used my words and told him, I'm not going back to your hotel room (because he'd have to get a hotel room, and rent a car). I'm not at all going to be alone with a male stranger I've never met before, big no thanks to being raped and murdered. This always sets him back on his heels. I suppose an object isn't supposed to think about her own safety and any possible harm. An object isn't supposed to set boundaries.   I honestly think this guy hates and despises me with a white-hot anger surpassing the sun. I think I'm his "type" in that I would be a conquest for him on many levels. I have a deep suspicion that this guy may have mental/emotional issues, so because most conversations go off the rails quickly with love-bombing, lack of logic, weirdness, an in-person meeting would just be kryptonite. So for you, my FDS queens, here's what this means. Here's what to watch out for to know when a man hates women, you in particular, because you are a superior being compared to him. Rather than look inside, feel bad, then start leveling up, he will do everything in his power, rape and murder included, to bring you down. This is why the bar is in hell and stays in hell: men's lack of looking inward and choosing to better themselves, and taking out their anger and frustration on women.  In no particular order, if you have any or all of these qualities (not saying I do, but most), watch out if a man you're dating starts to neg you, not appreciate you, resent you, gets angry for no discernible, logical reason:  \-- you are educated, and yes, this can include having a high school diploma  \-- you are university educated and degreed  \-- you work in your field and/or have used your degree to get a start in one field, and advance your skills to work in another field  \-- you are a Western woman  \-- you have facility with English and/or your own language and are fluent and well-spoken  \-- you are employed (or retired), and do not have to depend on a man to support you  \-- you don't have kids, make it clear you've never wanted any, and emphasize that freedom means way more to you than having a traditional family (they particularly hate that)  \-- you are either not religious, or if you do attend, you are skeptical, a doubter, a questioner (they want to use religion to control and dominate)  \-- you have good critical thinking skills, question what he says, don't take what he says on faith, and look for deeper meanings and lies, evasions, half-truths  \-- you center and prioritize your own wants and needs above those of any man  \-- you have boundaries and limits that you set clearly, and no matter what he says, those boundaries and limits stand firm  Honestly, I could go on and on. I look forward to hearing from you: how do you know when you are way more HV than x male? What tips you off? How do you deal with getting away from him, cutting things off?	1642955421.0	saxf52	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/saxf52/im_not_intimidated_by_much_but_the_thought_of/	I'm not intimidated by much, but the thought of meeting with this dude puts me back on my heels

7osmnunj	I just opened reddit without being logged in and saw men on the front page comforting each other about their ED and swearing it's normal üëÄ   Ummm...what? It's not normal. It's something that happens naturally to old men (who's sperm is no longer safe to the gene pool), but not ‚Äãmen in their teens 20s and 30s.   They're telling each other it's from poor diet and depression and that tweaking their food (EAT MORE LEAN MEAT BRO) is the answer üò¨   It's from porn. How is that not obvious. It's from horrific abuse to the body and mind. Instead of coping on Reddit (and with podcasts ü§≠üôÑ) why don't they cut the addiction? I mean are they seriously going to dissociate via porn for their entire prime years? They are seriously choosing to normalize self induced premature aging instead of walking away from the pixels.   üíÄ  Edit: lol at all the Reddit cares messages and threats from kings with ED.

2e3xhoud	Hello ladies!   I was wondering if any of you talked about FDS and the impact it has had in your lives during therapy sessions and how that turned out.  I am not necessarily referring to FDS points in the handbook such as continuous vetting, having strong standards and boundaries, and our continuous growth and levelling-up.  What I am referring to is FDS as a whole community and the different topics that we cover in this sub such as: the well-deserved criticism of men and society in this sub, how women are lied to from an early age to accept less than deserved, about the patriarchal society that we live in, etc.	1642970127.0	sb364t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb364t/do_you_talk_to_your_therapist_about_fds/	Do you talk to your therapist about FDS?

tfi8qd	This is extremely difficult for me to write about, and it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve thought about for quite some time. So please bear with me if my thoughts aren‚Äôt organized.  Thinking about this always brings tears to my eyes and makes me livid. I am sure others can relate to my story.  I am almost 30 years old. A majority of my 20s was spent with a man who wasted my time promising marriage, 7 years to be exact. A portion of my late 20s was also spent with a man who consistently lied to me about how much I meant to him, and the things he would sacrifice/give up to be with me.  To no surprise, both of these men strung me along for years. They picked up on my incredibly low self esteem and self worth, and knew I would tolerate empty promises and less than the bare minimum. In your 20s, you think you have all the time in the world. You are naive enough to believe that people are being honest about their intentions with you, and are excited about a future together.  Now that I‚Äôm approaching 30, I really feel like I wasted the best years of my life on men who truly didn‚Äôt deserve it. In my 20s, I saw many people I knew happily getting engaged and married within a reasonable timeframe. As much as I was happy for them and wished them an incredible future, deep down I was fuming with jealousy.  Being in these 2 relationships made me question my entire self worth. Was I not worthy of being committed to? Was I not worthy of being treated with dignity? Was I not worthy of being well taken care of with a man who *truly* believes that I‚Äôm his dream girl, in his eyes? Why was everyone else getting treated much better than I was? Is it something to do with my looks? Is it the fact I wasn‚Äôt assertive enough?  Now, approaching my 30s, I know that I got manipulated and taken advantage of because I gave men the benefit of the doubt. I truly believed they were honest about their intentions with me. It had nothing to do with my looks, or the fact that I need to be treated lesser than my peers. It was their issues, not mine.  Now, I hold some deep rooted resentment for men. Deep down, I believe that a majority of men aren‚Äôt serious about their intentions, are porn addicted, or are active cheaters. ‚ÄúApproaching the wall‚Äù makes me feel like I wasted my youth in dead end relationships with people who didn‚Äôt deserve an ounce of attention from me.  Unfortunately, this makes dating exceptionally tough but also exceptionally easy at the same time. I can filter out men with my eyes closed. I can see who‚Äôs trying to be in a relationship as a means to an end. I can see who‚Äôs not truly ‚Äúinto me‚Äù, and would happily cheat on me or watch porn to satisfy themselves. I can also realize the men lying through their teeth about their intentions regarding marriage.  I have been to therapy regarding the resentment I hold, but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs entirely a bad thing. My resentment has made me more assertive and on high alert while courting men. I know when my time is being wasted, and know its not a compatible relationship long term.  I now have a timeline in my head for my relationship goals that are reasonable for a person approaching 30. I‚Äôm tired into being gaslight about my expectations being unreasonable. I‚Äôm tired of being strung along.  I know my worth and I know that I‚Äôll only share   with someone who respects me and cherishes me. I am not in a position to fall for lies again. My resentment is part of my growth and life journey.	1642973660.0	sb4joz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb4joz/harbouring_resentment_in_future_relationships/	Harbouring resentment in future relationships

63sdvkz3	Many women have learned that, in today‚Äôs dating climate, unfavorable or even abusive relationships with men will deprive them of our most precious resources: **time and health**.    Think of how many opportunities ‚Äì including academic, professional, and financial ones ‚Äì you have missed out on due to all the added stress and trauma a man has put you through, often repeatedly (reminder: do not beat yourself up about it, so long as you recognize all that you have learned from your experiences; use that knowledge to your advantage). How hard it was to nurse yourself back to sanity, confidence, and peace. How much all this unnecessary heartache has took from you.   Therefore, if you have found yourself in a relationship with a NV/LV man, this post is for **you**. Use it as a resource to help yourself make one of the most important choices a woman can make to level up her life ‚Äì end the relationship.   So, how do you start the process of detaching yourself from him? I suggest that you use the following as a guide to your relationship/‚Äúsituationship‚Äù:    ‚Äî **Ask for support and accountability:** Tell your *trusted* friend, relative, and/or therapist that you want to leave your relationship. Do not be afraid to ask for guidance, support, and encouragement. Let them know that you are in the process of getting ready to leave your LV/NVM, and ask that they keep you accountable in case you regress on your decision to end the relationship.   ‚Äî **Practice reflection and self-compassion:** Be it under a therapist‚Äôs supervision or on your own, reflect on all the shitty, painful moments that have been done to you; do not hesitate to put the blame where it belongs: did he gaslight to, lie, manipulate, and abuse you to get his way? Write that down. Explore how these traumatic events/manipulations played part in creating the trauma bond you now have. Understand that it‚Äôs important to **not** beat yourself down for staying in a relationship with an abusive man. Practice self-compassion and ensure that you are taking good care of yourself.   ‚Äî **Let yourself be angry:** You are a woman who deserved to be treated with respect, gentle love, and care. You deserved to be taken seriously, your aspirations supported, your effort cherished. Recognize that your anger is absolutely valid. Use this emotion to put yourself first and cut off anyone who does not have your best interest at heart.    ‚Äî **Journal through the process:** Start a journal (an electronic one, which can be protected by a password). Write all of your feelings down. Write out your *own* strategy of dealing with the heartache that will come up post-breakup. How do you plan to handle it? What can you do to soothe yourself in a healthy, gentle way?   ‚Äî **Plan out the breakup:** What do you need to do before the breakup? Clean up your social media, go private? Decide which friends of his (suggested: all of them, him included) you will block? What will you text him when you finally decide to end the relationship? Will you need to meal-prep to ensure that you are eating healthy? Will you set aside 30 minutes a day to have a light workout, release the tension/stress stored in your body? Think about it thoroughly, to ensure that you do not engage with him post-breakup.   So far, that is all.

172w3bkm	I always wondered why men chose the avenue of arranged marriage, selecting who their mothers picked for them instead of becoming independent, leveling up, becoming HVM, and potentially finding dream girl/HVW!      These men would **rather** secure family inheritance, honor, comfort, and assets over the chance of mutually fulfilling, spiritually bonding love (and sex) with DreamGirl! I mean, yeah, it requires work to level up and be a virtuous man! Anything good will require work and sacrifice. But such men whine, bitch, and complain that they‚Äôre not happy and they‚Äôre not free once they realize they married whom their parents wanted, that they don‚Äôt even like. Time to get some accountability for your actions, you manbaby!     Is the explanation for this solely patriarchy? Or is there more to the story? Emotional blackmail? Oppressive cultural norms? Is it a cultural cycle that is difficult to break through?      I was under the impression that men from such cultures, especially the high value ones, will rise up, be resilient, break away from parents‚Äô totalitarian control, and become independent of oppressive values, especially once these men and their families have immigrated to Western countries....	1643002637.0	sbejfn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbejfn/ladies_have_you_noticed_any_trends_of_men_who/	Ladies, have you noticed any trends of men who chose arranged marriages vs. leveling themselves up to be independent of the patriarchal culture?
4830whsh	I frequently see FDS rescue missions here. But is it really worth it? Have you had any real success stories with rescue missions? Most people aren't looking for solutions, just a shoulder to cry on. I have tried to subtly suggest many girls to read the handbook, and even have offered them advice when they literally asked for it, but no luck. PickMes live out of the validation of men. They don't see the worth in themselves. It makes me angry. So many kind, beautiful, smart girls are falling for abuse. It sucks to see your friends continuing their PickMe ways, year after year.  Long story short, a few days ago I tried to warn a groomed girl, now a woman about her on-off fianc√© of over a DECADE. Let's call her Mary. They have kids and her fianc√© is active in the super conservative right wing politics. This man had groomed her since she was a literal child, and has stringed her on for years, without a marriage, as a side chick. A friend posted on social media this man (who is her ex from over 10 years ago) had sent her DMs out of the blue in the middle of the night, calling her an ugly, fat wh\*re and c\*nt who is desperate and won't ever find anyone. I usually don't meddle, but I do believe women need to stand up for each other. I wish the girls my ex cheated me on had contacted me. So I sent the screenshots to Mary, and what do I get? She sends me walls of texts for days, calling me a wh\*re for trying to ruin her "perfect" relationship, calling my friend with awful names, and after this her fianc√© attacks me as well. So I block them both.  Moral of the story? PickMes don't want help or advice. In their bad moments they just want to be your emotional garbage bin, but they won't take any advice. They think they know better. Just keep a good distance to them, and if they happen to be your friend, maybe offer them some kind words once they've finally dumped their LVMs and found their self worth. I'm so tired of this.	1643021398.0	sbjhmt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbjhmt/is_it_really_worth_trying_to_help_pickmes/	Is it really worth trying to help PickMes?
yz5qp	So, a friend just sent me an article and it begins like this:  *"In early January, Brooks Nader, a 26-year-old Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, was walking home alone from a night out in New York when she received a disturbing iPhone notification telling her she was carrying an ‚Äúunknown accessory‚Äù.*   *‚ÄúThis item has been moving with you for a while,‚Äù the alert read. ‚ÄúThe owner can see its location.‚Äù That‚Äôs when she knew ‚Äúsomething wasn‚Äôt right‚Äù.*   *Nader discovered that somebody had slipped an Apple AirTag into her coat pocket while she was sitting in a restaurant earlier. Unbeknown to her, the device tracked her location for four hours before Apple‚Äôs abuse prevention system triggered the notification to her phone".*  I just spent at least 20 minutes staring at my screen after reading this. AirTag costs only 29$ and if you don't use an iPhone, like me, there's no chance of you finding out until it's too late.   Looks like now I need to find a coat with no pockets, just in case, to wear it in public places.	1643023103.0	sbjxtz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbjxtz/apple_airtag_a_perfect_tool_for_stalking/	Apple AirTag: a perfect tool for stalking
4uhoo7n5	So I recently left a job and whilst I was there I came across three pickme colleagues based on the things they told me about their partners/lives.  Colleague one was married with children and mentioned to me how her husband had never gone to her child‚Äôs school to collect the kid, so the teachers had no idea who the dad was, and that one day she asked her husband to collect their child after school, and I could hear this over the teams call as we were WFH, she kept telling him to hurry up and leave and where exaclty to go, and for some reason he was taking a long time to leave even though it was already 15mins past the time my colleague normally leaves to collect the child. What kind of a useless dad doesn‚Äôt get their child from school ever.  Colleague two and I shared a commute so we‚Äôd often sit next to each other and talk. She mentioned that she had been engaged for over 2 years and dating for 5 with no wedding date. Now colleague two was highly impressive she had multiple degrees, spoke over 5 different languages fluently and had worked and studied in many different countries. She also showed me photos of herself from a few years ago and she was very attractive back then. When I met her she looked about a decade older than her actual age. I never really connected the dots til one day I met her spouse on the commute home. He was a scrote in every sense of the word. My colleague introduced me to him and he was instantly very rude/annoyed by my presence. I assumed because I was WOC that he was just racist. So I just spoke to my colleague and avoided looking in his direction. During the entire commute the scrote took jabs at my colleague, called her dumb, pretended to box her, belittled something she said whilst talking to me, and to top it off the scrote was nowhere near as accomplished as my colleague in-fact he worked in a warehouse and looked like a junkie imo. The thing I realised was that this scrote had aged my once beautiful colleague so she no longer looked like she did a few years ago. Before I said goodbye to my colleague that day I overheard her ordering and paying for takeout for her and the scrote, he didn‚Äôt even offer to pay or cook for her the douche   Colleague three mentioned to me how she bought a house with her bf of 7 years and now they broke up and shes trying to buy his share of the house and for the time being he still lives there with her. She said she realised she didn‚Äôt want to marry or have kids with him, but then went onto say how they still act like a couple despite being broken up   Just foolishness all round	1643026992.0	sbl15w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbl15w/pickmes_at_work/	Pickmes at work

7j04w333	How is this movie such a great highly regarded and awarded classic showing the ‚Äútrue nature‚Äù of love when half way through- when they‚Äôve already been freakin heavy like rabbits- she discovers HE HAS A WIFE.  And her reconciling herself to that fact is *barely* covered, he just has a death scare and they decide to conveniently forget/ overlook it because she‚Äôs so gLaD tO hAvE hIm bAcK  They don‚Äôt even try to make it more palatable by saying it‚Äôs a distant union of convenience and not love, or the wife is difficult to deal with etc etc. Nothing!  Idk, i think it was mentioned lightly in the beginning before they meet and develop an attraction but I didn‚Äôt really catch it so I was as shocked as anyone when they go to that bar together and someone else loudly spills the beans.  Ugh. That just made the rest of it so unromantic and kind of sleazy to me. But the movie itself is still kind of held up as this model of the nature of true love.

iths1z33	\*Disclaimer: I think FDS would tell me to not date seriously at my age, and I know now that I should be focusing my life on friendships and career advancement rather than dating. But this is something very big that happened to me and I feel as if I can‚Äôt move on completely without dissecting and understanding this from a radfem perspective. I really admire the mindsets of the women/femmes in this subreddit and hope to be more polished and with a stronger backbone like y‚Äôall as I continue maturing. I'm hoping to post my experience here for critical feedback/advice so that I can build my intuition and never allow myself to be treated like this again. I also hope that someone here can learn from my mistakes, too.   I met a seemingly HVM my last year of college. I thought that he was HV initially because he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt like other men‚Äù in terms of being ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù and was pretty good at cooking. He was also very well versed and similar to me in terms of political belief (which is rare and something crucial for me), but slowly showed that his beliefs on gender were still very conservative.  He trauma spilled about his childhood sexual, physical, and emotional abuse from his family on the second day we met. At the time, I saw it as a yellow flag, but he convinced me that he was actually just being open about the topic after feeling ashamed about it for so long. He mentioned that he worked on coming to terms with it through therapy and had been working on himself for a while. I thought that was a good sign. Boy, was I wrong.  I had sex with him early on, and he explicitly told me he wanted sex and not a relationship. I told him I was ok with it because I had another guy I was FWB with at the time. He didn‚Äôt want to be seen in public with me, in fear that someone we knew would see us together. I felt that we were getting close emotionally, and he requested to learn more about me. I let him see my online journal, which I realize now was a mistake.   When I was younger, I was very much sold on the ideas of libfem, that I could become empowered through having casual sexual relationships with men. I had several of these relationships with men from OLD before I met him. These relationships weren‚Äôt the healthiest, and I really didn‚Äôt know what I was doing at the time. I was very lost and looking for male validation. I know now that I was using them to fill a void in me, rather than dealing with feeling broken and sad (which is 100% ok and healthy!). Through reading my journal, he came across entries that detailed my encounters with them, which showed I was a pickme with minimal boundaries.   Some time later, he came to me sad because he knew that ‚ÄúI wasn't his,‚Äù and he suggested becoming exclusive. I was unsure about it because it felt like we were moving really fast, but I eventually agreed because I thought that being exclusive wasn‚Äôt the same as being in a relationship. However, once we became exclusive, we did not establish boundaries around the differences of being in a relationship versus being exclusive. We basically became boyfriend and girlfriend at that point.   In our relationship, he began projecting his insecurities onto me. He told me he was uncomfortable and disgusted with my past. it got to a point where almost every day he asked about the sizes of the men I had been with, how good the sex with them was, etc. He wanted to be the biggest and the best out of all of them. It felt so weird to me that he was competing with men he had never met, and I honestly couldn‚Äôt come up with answers to those questions. How was I supposed to recall the exact size of a dick I had seen in dim lighting for a couple seconds? (This is honestly laughable now and cringey as hell, but he really tormented me with it at the time) I would tell him that I didn‚Äôt know, or that I couldn‚Äôt be sure, and he would accuse me of lying.   He continuously monitored my Instagram activity and private messages. He repeatedly asked me to delete and unfollow people from OLD, even though I told him that the request was controlling (it is, right?). I eventually gave in and unfollowed them, but it felt like that just made things worse.   I felt like he was treating me like an object. Everything we did was very sexual, which I thought was ok when we were FWB, but after getting into a relationship, it didn‚Äôt get better. Before meeting me, he had a porn addiction. He later confessed to looking up girls who looked like me and masturbating to them before we met in person. The pickme in me was slightly flatteredü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSMH. I tried time and time again to establish sexual boundaries, but he disregarded them. He eventually coerced me to have sex with him multiple times and constantly asked me to do increasingly kinkier things with him. I feel so awful just thinking about it because I know I was just being used and abused by this guy.   Then it escalated even more. He recognized that I had abandonment issues and told me that I wouldn‚Äôt leave him even if he hit me. He constantly criticized me over every little thing and shamed/judged me for having been sexually promiscous. I felt like I had to walk on eggshells around him and do everything I could to regain his trust. It was horrible and my mental health was shit.   I called him out on being abusive and controlling and sexually coercive. He then proceeded to blame it on me and said that he was only reacting to my past and wouldn‚Äôt have done this if it was another girl who was sexually pure. He eventually admitted that he was abusive, but his apologies always circled back to blaming me. He even accused me of gaslighting and abusing him when I told him he was a misogynist because he treated me like an object. What makes me more scared is that he‚Äôs in grad school training to become a teacher. I can‚Äôt imagine him being a very good role model to children in their formative years. I contemplated reporting him to his program but I‚Äôm not sure if people would even believe me. There‚Äôs so many other little terrible things that I didn‚Äôt get to mention because this post is incredibly long already, so if you‚Äôve read to this point, thank you so much and I appreciate you lots, sis. <3  I can't believe I accepted this sort of treatment. I was depressed for the first month or two and have never felt so low in my life. I'm also scared because during the relationship it felt like I wasn‚Äôt able to think logically, which prevented me from fully seeing what was happening and leaving at the first sight of a red flag. Or honestly, the first couple red flags‚Ä¶there were so many. Any advice or words of support is appreciated, I‚Äôm about to hit 5 months out of this toxic toxic relationship and have been reading FDS like the bible for the past few weeks. I wasn‚Äôt able to talk about this fully with anyone except my therapist, and have only mentioned parts of it to friends because I was so ashamed and buried a lot of the memories because they were so painful. I have been reading some books and they've been helpful too. I hope to be able to heal from this and am still a believer of love, except I want to be focusing energy on relational healing in close female friendships for now.	1642661699.0	s8cruu	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8cruu/a_story_from_a_recovering_pickme_libfem/	A story from a recovering pickme & libfem.

dkgbnnyv	Explains so much about FDS to me, and easy to remember and understand. It's not about men and women bringing the exact same thing to straight relationships, because women already bring much more to relationships in general and are challenged much more by them (more at risk, more societal pressure, etc.). This is why it makes sense to have men pay, why they'll likely get called out more on behaviors, why they may have more to learn in EQ/social skills, and so on. Sharing so you have this in your back pocket.	1642648514.0	s88nkw	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s88nkw/new_easy_slogan_equity_over_equality/	New easy slogan: Equity over equality.
c776znyg	Marital rape is currently not a crime in India. Indian men are arguing that by criminalizing marital rape, the institution of marriage will be destroyed. They believe that if marital rape is considered a crime, a lot of false cases will be filed against men (do they think that marital rape will cease to exist if it is not criminalized? )  Indian men are using the #MarriageStrike hashtag on Twitter to protest against the criminalization of marital rape. They are threatening to boycott marriage if marital rape is criminalized in India.   I'm shocked that so many men are openly advocating their support for marital rape. Pickmes are agreeing with these views and are also protesting against alimony laws (they think it's unfair that men actually have to pay for their wives' often-unseen labor).   This entire situation seems like a masterclass in negging to me. Men participating in actions that harm women (marital rape in this case) and then crying about the possibility of being a victim of a false-rape case.    In all honesty, I hope such men do choose to not marry. Indian women already deal with a lot of bs, they don't need to worry about rapist husbands.

6m49ufx8	As a recovered pickmiesha I feel so much shame and regret for getting plastic surgery. As a child from a toxic family (LVM father) I had NO sense of confidence in self. That lack of confidence combined with the childhood trauma of having a LVM father really affected me, and I feel that had I been able to see and unpack all of it I would've probably not gotten any type of surgery. My lack of confidence and self worth just lead me to do it for all the wrong reasons. To feel "pretty" and (ultimately) get the attention of men. Of course at the time I was completely unaware of this and totally bought into the libfem idea of "I'm doing it for ME!" (the things we tell ourselves, eh?)  Does anyone else who has awakened from their pickmiesha days feel this way? I don't know how to shake the deep shame, especially since I still have lingering effects from the surgery (some small numbness in areas). I look at old pictures of myself and honestly wish I had never gotten anything done. Not because the surgery made me look bad, but moreso just bc I now know just how sick and damaged I was-- and I love myself now and feel so much shame and regret for putting myself under the knife.  If anyone else has a similar feeling/experience please share. And for ladies who are considering plastic surgery. I ask you to please really REALLY think about it and to work out any and all of your emotional & psychological issues before going under the knife. Make sure that you fully love yourself before making that decision-- and if you do fully love yourself make sure that ultimately your decision is ONLY for (the attention & adoration of) YOU.  &#x200B;  Edit: Wow. I have been so touched by each and every one of your stories, responses, words of wisdom, advice and support. I wrote this literally in the middle of the night while in the deepest pit of shame and sadness. It even took me this long to look at the post because I was so ashamed to have spoken out the pain I felt inside. However, I am glad I took that risk. Your support, stories and responses have given me the confidence to tell my mom about my shame--- and about the numbness from my surgery. This was something I had been carrying for 10+ years and not told a soul, but speaking my truth and not hiding in shame is the first step to healing and acceptance. Thank you all again so so much.

dtznrnwq	Hi ladies! There is an issue in modern dating I can't seem to figure out and I am hoping the FDS community has answers.  Men and women will be talking, vetting, planning dates. I understand when a man gets frustrated by the woman's vetting and sees his own failure he will take himself out of the running by blocking / ghosting etc. What I don't understand is when a man and woman are getting to know each other, maybe the first few dates have happened, maybe the first date is on the calendar and the man BLOCKS the woman.   There is no heads-up or warning to this. No argument, no conflict, again, dates are *on the calendar* and so when the woman reaches out, she discovers she is blocked. When this has happened to me, I block back as soon as possible so I don't have to deal with any weird surprises down the line.  But why do men do this? I don't understand this at all. Why **block** someone you've planned dates with? Is simply planning the date the ego boost? Is there fear of being upfront? What exactly is going on here? I don't know if it's relevant, but I notice the men who do this usually have ADD / ADHD.	1642715422.0	s8txhc	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8txhc/men_who_block_for_no_reason/	Men Who Block For No Reason?

gsv78	This got a lot of upvotes on ASKFDS but no replies so I wanted to see if anyone here had insight. I had a really weird encounter not so long ago and I'm feeling confused about it. Background info: I've been friends with a guy for around 2 years, we were never extremely close but we'd hang out occasionally, and since we have a lot of similar skills in the cyber security space that aren't super easy to come by we'd also share new things we learned. I made it clear to him I had no interest in a relationship by openly saying that I have no interest in a relationship an absurd amount of times. He asked me out once and I shut it down quick, I never felt pressured nor did he do anything weird like stand too close or try too hard to randomly touch me (the normal creep factors of trying to move things from friends to more), so I didn't think anything of it.   In December he told me that a friend of his had a client who he couldn't take on because his small business was super busy. I had mentioned before that I wanted to do a project before the end of the year, so it was kind of perfect. I said I'd help if we went 50/50 since he would be bringing the client and doing half of the work and I'd be doing the other half. He was really adamant on waiting 3 weeks to do the initial proposal which I said was a really long time and that with projects for bigger clients you want to move as quickly as possible. But since he was extremely insistent on waiting the full 21 days to finish our proposal I said okay. We spent 3 weeks hanging out and working and meeting up (daily), and then 2 days before we were about to show the proposal suddenly he tells me his friend actually decided to take the client because he was taking too long to reach out. Already this seemed like a red flag but I already knew there was a chance things would fall apart because of how long he wanted to wait, so I didn't think too much about it and just cut my losses. Like I said, we'd been friends for 2 years, so I brushed it off. We stopped meeting up to work since there was no reason to anymore.   But then he said he had another person who would potentially be interested in something similar and so I agreed we could just repurpose what we'd worked on. I agreed to just go ahead and try our proposal on someone else, which led to hanging out more again and all that. But when it came closer to the time to do it, something came up. This became a pattern for the next 2 weeks of things out of his control happening that made it impossible to do what we were trying to do.   I also noticed a few random lies he had told me. For example, he told me one of his roommates was making $10k a month as a d\*\*ler, I thought that was absurd but he kept assuring me that he was making that much and selling to the entireity of our area. I don't do anything like that so I just brushed it off as his roommate trying to look cooler than he is. Then when we were hanging out, he mentions his roommates GF may be pregnant to which I said that's great, but he said his roommate doesn't have the money for a kid. I brought up the $10k lie he had told me and he said he didn't remember saying that or he was probably overexaggerating when he said that because his roommate makes closer to $3k a month. Lying is a huge turn off for me, but this confirmed that he was the one lying to me, not his roommate lying to him.   He also did over exaggerate when talking about other stuff but I chalked it up to personality (think ‚ÄúBEST pizza‚Äù or ‚ÄúMOST EXPENSIVE Italian restaurant‚Äù), now I‚Äôm not sure if that was a red flag I missed.   I ghosted him, blocked all his social media, etc.. today his friend reached out to me in my DM requests just saying "Hi Iceyboo", I ignored it. He also has been texting me a ton asking me why I'm being distant and ghosting him etc.. but honestly I don't feel like responding nor do I care to reply.   All in all, I understand I just wasted 5 weeks and this guy is defo a liar. But I wanted to know if anyone has experienced something similar?   I just feel confused by what happened.   Is there a word or term for what happened here? Any advice or personal anecdotes that are similar would really help assuage the confusion I‚Äôm feeling.	1642722101.0	s8w84l	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8w84l/has_a_man_ever_lied_to_you_about_potential/	Has a man ever lied to you about potential opportunities/working on common goals to spend more time with you? *discussion*

36w6bfjp	I was in two relationships for half of my 20s, and those men sucked so much life out of me. Since being single and hardly dating in the past year and a half, I've rediscovered so much about myself and my interests, for example:  \- I'm a super calm and stable person. I used to cry on a twice weekly schedule with my ex, he made me think I was emotionally unstable and anxious, in our arguments he would aggravate me so much that I'd yell and cry. Turns out he was the problem, and I'm an exceptionally stable person and only external circumstances will bring me to tears. I have maybe cried 3-4 times since breaking up with him. Obviously, I haven't yelled at anyone since him, and I never yelled at anyone before him.  \- I'm a very social person, extroverted person. My ex liked to think he was the gregarious one, but in truth he was just a narc that needed attention on him at all times. In truth, no one considers him a close friend other than whoever his supply is at the moment. Comparatively I have really strong support systems around me, and have managed to make so many new friends since.  \- I love new food, and especially fine dining and good cocktails. My ex was such a picky eater that it sucked the joy out of eating out and cooking.  \- I love reading fiction and I love watching history documentaries. Without him I actually have had time to rediscover old hobbies that I enjoy, instead of trying to bond with him over stuff only he enjoyed (i.e. video games ü§¢)  Those of you that have been single for a while, what have you been surprised and happy to rediscover about yourself without the presence of someone toxic sucking your energy out and telling you lies about who you are?	1642727425.0	s8y34s	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y34s/whatve_you_rediscovered_about_yourself_since/	What've you rediscovered about yourself since being single?
h57msag5	It grinds my gears to witness my PickMe friends being self-destructive and in complete denial about their toxic relationships. It's ALL they ever talk about, and they NEVER follow my advice!   It's like they're holding onto an electric fence, complaining about how it hurts, but when I tell them to just LET GO they'll give me a lengthy speech: *"Like, it hurts, but it's such a rush too! And if you get used to it, the pain is really more of a dull tingling feeling. The shock isn't constant either, just occasional pulses. The good outshines the bad for me. But yeah, the shocks hurt like hell! ...No I don't want to let go, I just want to vent about the pain I'm experiencing! Why aren't you supporting me??"*  So I've begun setting iron boundaries, to protect myself from becoming collateral damage as a result of their weak boundaries. Because I really do get frustrated beyond belief by their ongoing stupidity. Sure, make mistakes. It's your life. But I'm not staying around for live updates about you setting yourself up for failure and abuse.  *Example: Recently texted a PickMe friend to shut up about her situationship with an expat from now on (she's convinced their 2 month fling is actually a budding romance that'll cross borders, she's in complete denial about being Future Faked). Told her to not even mention the expat's name when we hang out with just the two of us. I'm 100% willing to drop her if she doesn't respect my boundary.*   Queens, please tell FDS about the PickMe friends you've cut from your life!	1642727723.0	s8y6si	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8y6si/tell_us_about_the_pickme_friends_you_ditched/	Tell us about the PickMe friend(s) you ditched!
cw7827nc	Watched the new episode of And Just Like That. No spoilers, but Miranda and Steve continue to go back and forth about their marriage and Steve says straight out Miranda has been waffling about whether he's good enough for her or not their whole relationship. That's the truth because Steve is what happens when you settle. He was a bartender, a drunken one night stand that Miranda met in a bar after a fight with Carrie. He kept chasing Miranda until she agreed to date him.   They dated but he broke up with her because she was high-flying Harvard-educated attorney with a lifestyle he couldn't afford. He orbited around though until she took him back out of boredom and loneliness. He asked for exclusivity but Miranda said to Carrie, "I'm not dating anyone else but I'm so ambivalent about Steve...What if someone better comes along?" Steve said he loved her and asked to move in, Miranda agreed and it seemed like love. Until he moved in to her gorgeous apartment and started leaving skid marks on his underwear-when she was kind enough to do his laundry. He acted like a helpless child, watching cartoons and getting a puppy while she did all the work. She said to him, "I'm sick of being the adult, we're supposed to be equals! I want a partner. I'm tired of being the mom!" She broke up with him with those words. Very FDS. But trying to be the Cool Girl, she let him orbit some more. Long story short, Steve got testicular cancer and was left with one ball. Miranda had pity sex with him and got pregnant. Miranda was afraid she would never get pregnant again being reproductively challenged, so she had the baby, tying her to Steve for life. They finally married when the baby was one and she takes on all responsibility in his life, including his mother with dementia.   Outside of sex, Miranda was never excited about Steve but she was afraid. Afraid of never getting married and having kids, afraid of not keeping up with her friends. So she settled. And 17 years later, her husband is still the same guy she was ambivalent about-a guy with a high school education and no real hobbies, who wants to sit around and watch tv every night. In other words, exactly who he was when they dated. Miranda is still growing. She was a lawyer, but is now getting a master's in Public Policy. She's well-travelled, well-read, ambitious, and bold and she has a circle of friends who are just the same and her husband in a Brooklynite who has probably never travelled further than New Jersey.   I think Miranda is excited about Che, but really I think she's just so bored with Steve she'd be equally excited by any real adult. This should be inspiration to every FDS lady to never settle. I know, things can look bleak. And Steve seemed like a good enough guy for a long time. After Miranda left him for trying to make her Mommy Bangmaid, he levelled up, opened his own bar, developed a little ambition. He was a good father when their child was born. And it was the early 2000s, I don't think women had realized they deserved more than that collectively yet. So she married him and she's still paying for it. Hold out, ladies. Miranda has said she'd rather be alone at this point. While most women aren't having a big late-in-life queer affair, I think most women in their 50s or above are tired of their husbands. Tired of the routine of marriage to someone they were probably never all that excited about.   Remember ladies, sex fades. We do absolutely deserve earth-shattering sex with our committed partners, but it should not be the foundation of the relationship. Miranda's relationship with Steve was built on sex and sustained with emotional anxiety she couldn't do better. Instead of trying or being content alone, she tried to make sex enough. And so she was trapped with a man she had little in common with, not background, interests, values. Just a child and a life. Do the work now or you'll have to pay later.	1642728550.0	s8ygwb	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8ygwb/steve_from_sex_and_the_city_is_what_happens_when/	Steve from Sex and the City is what happens when you settle
8estq45x	Although I've only been dating my current boyfriend for about a year so it's too early to call him a HVM, he's treated me well and is what I would want in a romantic partner. He doesn't watch porn or follow/like girls/women with social media thirst trap influencer accounts (of his own accord, not because I "forced" him to); he drives us to all of our dates and pays for the gas, food, and events; he covers our hotel accommodations if we stay overnight in other cities; and he frequently surprises me with cute little gifts even when there's no special occasion (and of course, on actual special occasions such as my birthday, Valentine's/Christmas, or our anniversary, he'll go all out). Besides this, he has a fairly well-paying job for someone of his age, respects both of his parents and regularly keeps in touch with his family, and is hard-working, ambitious, and has a kind heart.  All this being said, I'm honestly sick of his LVM/pickme friends. For context, my boyfriend went to university in a different city, but moved to the city where I currently live when he graduated college and got a job here. Because of this, he doesn't have many close friends in this city aside from one LVM/pickme boyfriend/girlfriend who both happened to get a job here, too. This past year, my boyfriend has made a lot of other friends, but compared to 5 years of knowing this LVM/pickme couple, 1 year of getting to know his new friends hasn't been enough time for him to have as much of a genuine human connection with them as with his old buddies.  The LVM/pickme aren't necessarily "bad" people, and I know that they're both good friends to my boyfriend, but I don't enjoy hanging out with them, nor do I feel particularly comfortable that these are the "type" of people that my boyfriend would choose to keep in his close friends circle (after all, we wouldn't want to be friends with people who don't bring value to our lives, and over time, we become more similar to the people who we choose to surround ourselves with, so it concerns me that these are the type of people he enjoys being around).  The LVM/pickme pair are both social media influencers on tiktok (the LVM has over a million followers while the pickme has several tens of thousands), and their content honestly makes me cringe. **The pickme has videos that are supposed to be "cute" but which honestly just make me sad... For example: a video where she's trying to get affection from the boyfriend but he's busy on his phone or playing video games, a different video where she shows various ways of "getting the boyfriend's attention" such as by slipping under his arm when he's typing on his laptop, and one of the most recent videos where she said that she and her boyfriend haven't gone on a date in two years (even though they've only been together for three years...) so she decided to surprise him by making a custom game for them to decide their date night ideas.**  It's not just on social media that their relationship feels off to me. **I've met both of them in person, and the boyfriend joked that the girlfriend "used to be ugly back then" and he wouldn't have dated her if she didn't have a "glow up." Besides that, both of them actively check out people of the opposite sex and tell their partner about it, and then they both talk about it, which makes me nauseous because they're okay with the idea of sexualizing random strangers.**  My boyfriend has other LVM/pickme acquaintances (for example, pickmes that post provocative photos on social media as a sign of "fEmAlE eMpOwErMeNt" when it's really just catering to the heterosexual male gaze), but these are people who he's known since his childhood or teenage years, and who he's not close to anymore (and he never likes any of these types of photos/videos of theirs). For example, to be fair, I also have LVM/pickme "friends" who aren't actually my "real" friends anymore but who are more just like people that I knew from back then, and who I just haven't explicitly cut out of my life, but who I never talk to anymore. I think everyone has a lot of friends from when we used to be kids or teenagers, and statistically, a lot of them are bound to grow up into LVM/pickmes during adulthood, and as long as we're not close to these types of people anymore, then it's okay.  These old acquaintances aren't a problem, but this LVM/pickme couple who live in our city give me a bad vibe, even if both of them have only ever been good friends to my boyfriend and decent people to me when I met them. I just don't know if it's possible to reconcile these types of low value people with a high value romantic relationship of my own.	1642731002.0	s8zap2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s8zap2/when_a_boyfriend_has_lvmpickme_friends/	When a Boyfriend Has LVM/Pickme Friends

1dwnzysp	So apparently an LVM who was dating half of NYC went viral on TikTok a few days ago. The man literally posted his workplace ON his dating profile, yet today there are thinkpieces about PrIvacY and   how awful the WOMEN were to warn others about his lovebombing and ghosting. It's a tale as old as time ‚Äî women's perspectives being shut down as "gossip" and "mean" when all we're doing is helping our fellow sisters avoid time wasters. Also, this is a good cautionary tale about OLD.

But I am sensing from my circle, online (even elsewhere on Reddit), and what I hear about, a "no more strictly casual" Zeitgeist shift. I do think it's a general trend in society, a new intolerance for abuse, along the same lines as women (and men) no longer putting up with jobs they hate a la The Great Resignation. I feel like humans are finally not taking shit from others as much, from bosses, to scrotes.

dc7fqfp0	Queens, here's my theory and would love to hear your wisdom about this!  **Feeling irritation at someone's mannerisms is your intuition telling you that something is disingenuous about this person.**     We can sense the subtleties of facial expressions, hand movements, body movements not aligning with the sentiments the person is trying to convey.    **Backstory**:   For the past few months I have been vetting a man and I could not understand why his mannerisms irritated me so much!   Examples: His facial expressions were exaggerated, his hand movements were so annoying, the noises he made in lieu of laughing made me cringe, even the way he talked the pauses and cadence made my blood boil sometimes.    I felt like something was wrong with me like I was unable to accept someone for their unique personality traits or that I was unable to accept someone who was not as poised as I wanted, or whatever it was, I blamed myself.  This is not first that I have been around a man whose mannerisms irritated me.  He otherwise, was portraying some HVM qualities, he was attentive, caring, helpful, always planning the next date, sent me flowers weekly.  But something about his mannerisms made me cringe.    And then it hit me after realizing some other things that were off with this particular scrote.  (I ended things).  He annoyed me so much because he was being disingenuous and he was trying to be someone he was not, he was faking maturity and HVM qualities when in actuality he was an insecure passive aggressive scrote and my intuition was telling me that all along!  More and more red flags started popping up as he got more and more comfortable.  When I asked him about his over exaggerated facial expressions, he said he knows how to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù in public and around new people.  And that no one else in his life has had an issue with it, later he confessed one of his exes pointed it out as well.  He would forget things that he told me, contradict himself, pretend to know something about a certain topic he was actually clueless about, usually politics.   So glad to be done with this one!   Also, as an aside, a *vetting question to use in the initial dating process:* **What do you want out of life for your future wife/partner?**  The goal being to see if the person has ever thought about or if they have the ability to think about on the spot what they want out of life for a person they love or if they can even articulate care and wants for another person.  The one man I asked it to so far, drew a complete blank and had a difficult time answering this which was a red flag, IMHO.	1642800140.0	s9lblz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9lblz/irritating_mannerisms_are_a_red_flag_and_your/	Irritating mannerisms are a red flag and your intuition telling you that something is off!

410o4mj2	So basically I was at the grocery store behind a super long line of stuff that filled almost all of the conveyer belt.  The store was jammed so I didn't try to find a shorter line despite having only two items, and just got behind them.  From the jump I was getting pickme bad vibes from the girl and felt like she was kind of mean mugging me and gave me weird jealous vibes, so I just kind of got on my phone and ignored them.  So I wasn't paying attention until the very end of the checkout process when I suddenly notice that there's two seperate dividers within their order but theyre clearly paying together/chatting together.  There's a bunch of hair stuff at the end so at first I assume it's for her and he's making her pay separate while he pays for the groceries, which I think is pretty pathetically cheap.  But no- it's even worse.  She pays for the $300 worth of groceries, and he whips out his card for the $20 of hair products so he can style an early 2000s hair flip onto his middle aged head.  Even the check out lady was confused and initially tried to ring them up together until the embarrassed looking pickme had to specify, lol.  So after they finally check out I'm like thank God that mess is gone and it takes less than a minute for the lady to scan me and me to pay and leave.  I'm a pretty fast walker and I pass them at the start of the parking lot on my way to my car.  I parked in the back so I'm focused on getting to my car.  When I get there, I throw the items in the back, and as I'm putting my keys into the ignition and throwing my purse on the passenger seat and everything, I realize that the couple had parked a couple spots away from me, on the opposite side.  I also realize that the man is now sitting in the front seat, heat and lights on, while the woman loads the groceries into the back of his truck (of course it was a huge truck).  I just.... I'm speechless.  If this is what pickmes go through I find it genuinely hilarious yet also sad.  I also felt like the checkout lady was thinking wtf when it came to them as well as everyone else in line behind us (there were a lot since it took so long to check them out).  I actually took a picture of the checkout situation where you can see the dividers dividing the hair product but I dont want to post it because apparently photos on reddit can be traced or you can get info or whatever... but this was truly sad to witness.  It made me so grateful not to be a pickme.  And this was an attractive looking lady!     Also this was my last grocery run of the night, hence only grabbing two items, and the really cute checkout guy at the previous store was really flirting with me in a cute way.  I was just thinking.... in life you can either be a pickme loading a middle aged scrote's free groceries into his truck for him, or a hot single girl getting flirted with by the clerk with muscles and a cute face. You dont have to choose a sad pickme life!	1642816066.0	s9r146	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9r146/today_i_watched_a_scrote_make_a_pickme_pay_for/	Today I watched a scrote make a pickme pay for all the groceries and then load them into the car herself

172w3bkm	Hey ladies,   How do you vet men that come from high machismo cultures?   How do you test them, so that when they fail, you know right away they are misogynistic pieces of shit?   Conversely, how do you test to see if they are truly HVM, even though they may have observed LVM behavior in their upbringing/cultural environments?  In my experience, I listen to how he describes his relationship with his father and mother, and the relationship between the mother and father. Watch for the way he describes his most recent ex too.	1642825455.0	s9tze5	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9tze5/when_dating_poc_men_that_come_from_patriarchal/	When dating POC men that come from patriarchal cultures...

7d1wafuk	I just recently saw a post about how men wanting to have sex with you isn‚Äôt the compliment you think it is and It inspired me to make a post of my own.   In my deep pick me days (basically wasn‚Äôt warned about anything regarding men..and even encouraged to have casual sex alas..) I did do one thing right. And that is to always date foreigners or people not directly involved in my day to day, so that if I chose to I‚Äôd never see them again.   Growing up I‚Äôd watch a lot of tv and the scenes that stuck out to me were when in high school the guys would tell everyone who they slept with and the girls reputation would be trashed and she‚Äôd suffer all kinds of abuse.   So this led me to not dating men who could have that effect on me and guess what.. I was right. Every single guy casual hookup or not has bragged to their bros or laughed about our encounters and not kept anything private. Even men who I never had intercourse with would do that because it‚Äôs a perverse way to get revenge on someone who rejected them. This one liar has tried to gain personal information on me and nudes (I keep blocking him) as a sadistic form of revenge for playing him just as much as he played me. But the saving grace in all those stories ? I can go about my day and work without being harassed due to many of them living in another country and not having access to any of the places I currently work at.   I believe that doing this is a good form of social protection especially if you‚Äôre still unsure of your vetting skills.	1642835540.0	s9wt2k	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9wt2k/male_degradationshaming_after_sexual_encounters/	Male degradation/shaming after sexual encounters

8r15jxb0	I know it's important to find a HV partner but regardless of how HV both people in a relationship are, one wanting kids and another not wanting kids is often not negotiable. Should we hence avoid dating men of occupations which involve working with children (eg. primary/secondary school teacher, child psychologist, pediatrician) if we don't want kids?  Yes, a lot of people pick their careers based on salary, job security, and how easy it will be to find a job as opposed to their interests (and unfortunately some men want to work with kids as they are pedophiles), but I guess some men want to work with kids as they love kids. I assume a lot of these men also want kids of their own. It's not that different from how most veterinarians probably like animals to some extent and probably already have or want pets.	1642847878.0	s9zsrv	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/s9zsrv/should_we_avoid_dating_men_of_certain_occupations/	Should we avoid dating men of certain occupations if we don't want kids?

8jqlhqx3	This is a post alluding to Daniel Sloss's book called - : "Everyone  You Hate Is Going to Die: And Other Comforting Thoughts on Family,  Friends, Sex, Love, and More Things That Ruin Your Life"  To the ladies who aren't aware, Like I wasn't, before I picked the book - He is a stand-up Comedian by profession and this book just alludes to all the facts the FDS constantly swears by.   1. OLD IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME: He directly goes on to say that, old is a method of hooking up and mostly having a one-night stand. It is close to impossible to find a person worth your time and commitment. It is wild to think so that a man there would really want anything other than that.  2. TRUE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN IS A RATHER DIFFICULT COMBINATION TO ACHIEVE- He goes on to say that he is friends with an amazing woman who he already had slept with and has no intention of EVER marrying.  He talks about how his father thinks this "best-friend" of his, he has strung along for years would end up being his wife but he denies it so clearly that it made me feel so embarrassed for this woman because it was like getting rejected. I'll skip through all the time he fucks her over and probably uses her for emotional support and as all time helpline.  3. DO NOT DO A MAN'S WORK FOR HIM- He might be a stand-up comedian but He straight up confesses that He wants to be the one who buys the ring and go down on one knee of his future wife. This is a man's domain and sure as hell, if the man ain't doing it, he ain't the one.  4. NO MAN/PERSON CAN FILL THE HOLE INSIDE YOUR CHEST - If you feel lonely with yourself, you need help. Cultivate yourself, show that love you have to yourself. Become a HVW and LIVE your life like a fcking main-character!  5. MEN KNOW WHO THEY WANT TO COMMIT TO AND WILL SHOW UP IF THEY ARE A HVM: In sharp contrast to his girl---friend who probably got the worst end of the deal. Men know what they want, and if they see it, they'll make sure you know.  Realize your worth, ladies. Keep vetting and stop settling.   6. MEN AREN'T BABIES, THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE DOING: Next time you think about giving a man, the benefit of doubt, leave. (He brought a girl (for sex ofc) over to his "best friend's" house a day after they had sex and then she had to sit him down and explain to him, why that was wrong) Men are perfectly self-aware, and are just looking to test your limits. Put a full stop to these kind of relationships.   Thanks to fds, Women like us are able to a certain degree screen out LVM out of your lives. Please, Remember you worth ladies! We are all rooting for you!  &#x200B;  ##	1642877544.0	sa995z	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sa995z/straight_from_the_horses_mouth_daniel_sloss/	Straight from the Horse's Mouth: Daniel Sloss

affrm017	EDIT: thank you so much for the responses, everyone! I‚Äôve been experiencing awful morning sickness (actually all-day sickness) so am trying to avoid screens, but I read all of your advice and I truly appreciate it.   Hi FDS ladies! I‚Äôd appreciate hearing your opinions on this situation:  I found out a couple days ago that I was pregnant. This was an accident, and I have no intention of keeping the fetus as I‚Äôm only 23 and still have a lot that I want to accomplish before I even think about becoming a mother. I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend (24) for 9 months, and he‚Äôs been really exemplar through all my vetting up until this point.  We‚Äôve agreed in the past that if I ever got pregnant, I would get an abortion. I reassured him that this was still the plan. However, I then asked him what he would do if I hypothetically decided I couldn‚Äôt go through with the abortion after all. His response was that he would panic and try to convince me to go through with it anyways. I think the answer I was hoping for was more like ‚Äúit wouldn‚Äôt be an ideal situation, but since we were both responsible I‚Äôd support you and the child as best as I could‚Äù. This whole interaction has put a bad taste in my mouth.   Ladies, am I reading too much into it? It might be relevant that I recently graduated and started my career back in September.

5587k26c	We've all heard of the trafficking concerns, the exploitation concerns, the profound effects on the viewer's brain chemistry and relationships with women. There's one more reason you should refuse to date men who watch porn, and why porn fans in general should be disqualified from dating.  Consider why men watch porn in the first place. It's quick, easy pleasure for them. That reason alone is enough for them to override every reason not to watch it, especially in a relationship. They will tell you this themselves. In the anti-porn groups I lead, a certain type of man is always too willing to barge in and insist that men NEEEEED this quick and easy release no matter what the cost.  But listen long enough and this reasoning has an even more selfish side. Sex is too much work for them. They don't want to put in the work for mutual pleasure. So if they can't use you like a masturbation sleeve, they'd much rather go off and jerk it to someone else. This type of man actively resents the expectation that he should reciprocate the action of you handing over your body for his pleasure. To this type of man, you "aren't entitled" to enjoy the act of satisfying a man.  "But I get off on making women cum!" Don't trust this, either. If they got their moves from porn, they're likely to poke their fingers inside you for a while and wonder why it's not working when they won't even attempt to find the right spots. Or stick to a porn-fueled routine in favor or your own communication of what actually works for you.  To them, the act of sex is almost exclusively limited to PIV. Your "foreplay" is giving him a blowjob. And if you don't spontaneously orgasm from those generous concessions on his behalf, that's your problem and not his responsibility to help you out. Why would you put that much pressure on him to delay his orgasm so you can enjoy yourself too? Don't you know how hard that is for a man? Going down on you or using his hands is unthinkable. Why would you expect him to perform sex acts that don't stimulate his penis? Don't you know what sex is all about? Silly girl.  Porn videos don't have expectations of them. The women are up for anything and will always enjoy themselves with no effort on the man's part. The male performer shows up, dick in hand, and the viewer gets to do the same. It's ironic that porn fans convince themselves that porn is just like sex, but will side-eye the idea of sex with a real woman in favor of a screen. Then they'll paint it as a failure of the women in their lives. I suspect many of the women for whom "orgasms aren't a big deal" came to this conclusion after being with this type of man long enough. I know this was the case for me.  What I'm getting at here is that to the porn viewer, sex is a completely one-sided act and it's the woman's responsibility to find her own pleasure while her body is used for entertainment. I'd say this is the result of porn binges, but I'm not convinced sex was any better for women in cavemen days.  A man worth bedding will understand that there's some effort involved in pleasuring his partner, but it's not the herculean endeavor that the pornsick crowd will claim. He'll take the time to find out what gets you going instead of taking cues from a screen.   This type of man is not concerned with making you happy in bed, and will see sex with you as an alternative means to his own pleasure. They'd rather have the porn. But because they also feel entitled to a "partner" to take care of them, they won't end things and will do the bare minimum to keep you around, wondering why you aren't enough for him and being miserable.  This is all assuming their dick still works.  Tl;Dr: Don't do guys who watch porn if you want a satisfying sex life.	1642912195.0	sal4lo	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sal4lo/one_more_reason_to_cut_off_men_who_watch_porn/	One more reason to cut off men who watch porn

Without fail, in the comment section, men write, " I wonder what she did to him?" or something to that effect.

8uuz5573	So lately I've been trying to focus on dropping the male orbiters out of my life. I know I should have done this a long time ago, but like any big change in life, it's been scary. Before you ask why I don't just block and delete this particular guy, it's because he knows where I live, he's local, he's weird, and I feel like the safest thing to do is to gradually back away until we move, which we will soon.   I've known this guy for a long time. Well, he messaged me out of the blue maybe half a year ago. Basic "how've you been, what have you been up to" type questions. He does this randomly sometimes, then disappears for awhile.   I realized that the randomness in when he would message me wasn't random at all, he was looking for somebody to be his therapist, somebody to make him feel better about himself, and to "shoot his shot" every now and then, to see if I'd gotten desperate enough to give him a chance yet. I wasn't a friend, I was somebdoy he could leech emotional labor off of when nobody else would talk to him.  A couple examples of how this has become crystal clear to me:  - **Constantly seeking validation every time he talks to me. He very obviously wants me to pat him on the back and congratulate him even though he's done nothing to warrant it.**  Ex: He started to learn a language very similar to the one I'm learning. The thing is, when he saw how much more progress I was making than him, he gave up on the app. When I spoke the language to him, he would criticize my pronunciation, despite it being near perfect (I'm in a language sharing Discord server). Whenever he would talk in the language, all he did was quickly mumble through the words in an attempt to sound fluent. I know a lot more than him, and could tell what he was doing.   - **I told him flat out multiple times I wasn't interested, and that I'm not sure we could really be friends if he was going to be weird about it. He said it was cool and he was over it. He was not.**  Ex: He kept making weird comments, and when I'd remind him I wasn't into him, he'd say things like like "It's okay, I wait for (my name)". Speaking in the third person was so fucking cringe, and he does it a lot. He clearly intends to "wait me out", and has told on himself multiple times.   - **He tries to make me jealous, even though I have less than zero interest in him. It's so desperate and gross, this is really what opened my eyes.**  Ex: He started talking to a girl on OLD, showed me pictures of her, ect. Just by looking at her, I knew that wasn't happening. He's a "multiple messages in a row over the course of several days" type of guy. Anyways, he stopped talking to me for a month or two. Then, "randomly" came back, with zero mention of her, who he had bragged about being so serious with before. My conclusion is she finally blocked him, and he needed another woman to pester.   - **He only talks about himself, and is a MAJOR sympathy fisherman. Think emo teen that grew up physically, but not at all emotionally.**  Ex: He will deadass message me completely out of the blue, and say something like, "Awful day, yours was probably better than mine", and nothing else. Past me might have asked "oh what happened??". But current me realizes that he never extends the same courtesy back my way, so I refuse to do it for him. Last time I literally responded with something like, "Probably is, I had a pretty good day". Naturally, he ignored it completely, tried once more to get me to ask about his day, but I played dumb and dodged it. After that, it was very suddenly "time for him to sleep".   Basically, this dude is awful, and I really wish I could just block and delete and be done with it. I regret ever letting him know where I live. He's completely low value in every single possible way. Bad looks, bad hygiene, bad social skills, bad personality, bad physique, bad skillset (or lack of), bad job/education, ect. There is literally nothing appealing about this guy.   The thing is, most of those things he can change, but he's just a lazy person. I have no sympathy for him, and I hope that being short and boring with him and not really engaging will cause him to eventually lose interest and go find somebody else to pester. As I've gradually distanced myself, it feels freeing to not have somebody leeching emotional energy out of me.   Thanks for listening to my rant. Do you guys have any similar stories of desperate orbiters that used to hang around, or even still do? Do you have any tips for safely cutting them out? Feel free to rant with me.	1642920934.0	sanl38	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sanl38/gradually_dropping_a_male_orbiter/	Gradually dropping a male orbiter
8estq45x	How do you all do it? And no, I don't mean what foundation you apply, or how you style your eyeliner, or what color eyeshadow you use - I mean, how do you do it, how do you reconcile slathering your face and body with products that have direct associations with the beauty industry (a name which I find so ironic because it wouldn't be able to make profits if people didn't feel ugly, or at least some degree of simply not being "as beautiful" as they potentially could, or beautiful enough), with the idea of being a woman who simply wants to express herself independent of the male gaze?  I find that I look "prettier" with conventional makeup on, but I know that this idea of "pretty" is largely shaped by heterosexual male preference and the beauty industry, which is saturated with scrotes and pickmes. Even when I do "unconventional" makeup that isn't typically "sexy," such as bold lip colors, bright eye palettes, and nose art (which are probably too eccentric and unattractive to the normal heterosexual man whose brain has been too fried by the makeup styles seen in porn, and so anything "artsy" like this is probably a turnoff), I still feel a bit uncomfortable, because even though I know that bold patterns and bright colors aren't exactly catering to male heterosexuality, it's nonetheless makeup, and the makeup industry, and the entire beauty industry, profit off of women shelling out hundreds or thousands of dollars into these practically useless products - hundreds or thousands of dollars that could otherwise be used for a productive/fulfilling hobby/skill, or to invest, or to save for retirement, etc.  Besides this dilemma, I feel like makeup culture in general is just plain misogynistic. If we do our hair and makeup, people judge us as more attractive, even though it's actually a very "fake" attractiveness that can only be achieved with product and labor. **If we don't do our hair and makeup, and just do a basic skincare routine of cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF, we're suddenly "tired" or "sick," even though this is the default state of any regular human being. So many men are going about, not moisturizing, and not using sunscreen, but I guess that's normal, and therefore, somehow acceptable**, so it confuses me as to why women are held to such a different standard.  \---  **I've always disliked the beauty industry, but I've been having an especially hard time coping with all of this now because my boyfriend's mom owns an eyelash salon.** His mom and dad were immigrants who came to this country dirt poor - the dad was an engineer who invested his savings until there was enough money to start up the mom's company, then the mom made it really big (first starting off with nails and now specializing in eyelashes), and because of her hard work, the family now has millions of dollars in assets and is living a very comfortable life, literally the epitome of the American Dream. I realize that without this salon business, my boyfriend's family could have never become so wealthy; that being said, I still have every right to hate fake nails (some of which are so horrendously long to the point that they're honestly impractical and unhygienic) and I still have every right to hate fake eyelashes (which, like fake nails, serve no actual function/purpose, and both of which remind me of porn culture, whether explicitly or through other avenues such as social media influencers). **I still have every right to despise these things, but I honestly feel like I can't talk to my boyfriend about them because it could be misinterpreted as hating his mom for taking advantage of such a profitable business idea which just happens to be in the very industry that I have such a deep and burning hatred for. To be honest, I feel extremely frustrated. It's not just my boyfriend that I can't talk to about this - I can't talk to anyone that I know in real life when it comes to these issues, and it's an extraordinarily isolating and lonely path to walk down, when the only thing to keep you company is your own thoughts, since no one else seems to agree, or if they do agree, they just don't feel as strongly and passionately about these things as you do.**  I know that some of you ladies might like nails and eyelashes for your own reasons, the same way that some of you ladies probably appreciate makeup as an art form, for example. I just feel like I'm constantly doing mental gymnastics in my head because fake long nails and fake long eyelashes literally wouldn't exist without misogynistic beauty standards and porn culture, so how can I not hate them? And yet my boyfriend's mom, a successful and powerful businesswoman, literally grew her wealth this way, so how can I blame her for making money, even if it was "at the expense" of other women shelling out cash for nails and eyelashes?  \---  I feel the same way about the first part of my post as well - I'm constantly doing mental gymnastics, wondering how in the world it's possible to truly wear makeup "for ourselves" - and I think the reason I can never seem to come to a happy conclusion is because, deep down, I know that no matter how much we try to convince ourselves that it's really "just for us," nothing really is, when it comes to beauty. **What we perceive as beautiful, is shaped by our experiences throughout our entire childhood and adulthood. What we perceive as pretty, is shaped by our culture and our society. What we perceive as attractive, is warped by toxic beauty standards and porn culture, whether we like it or not, and whether we consciously realize it or not, and yes, we can fight it, but it takes years of unlearning, and years of unconditioning.** We can delude ourselves all day long, saying that we do it because we genuinely enjoy it, independent of *man*kind, and doing it truly for the empowerment of *woman*kind, but the pessimist in me (just kidding, what I meant to say is, the realist) highly doubts this. I'm sure all of you ladies have read this quote by Atwood many times by now, but it seems to ring especially true for such a topic as this, for *"even pretending you aren't catering to male fantasies is a male fantasy: pretending you're unseen, pretending you have a life of your own, that you can wash your feet and comb your hair unconscious of the ever-present watcher peering through the keyhole, peering through the keyhole in your own head, if nowhere else. You are a woman with a man inside watching a woman.

5iysyw7g	I went out last night and saw how obvious the LVM are. They are desperate!   I was at an event where I wanted to meet people and network, but didn‚Äôt even get to speak to the women. Men swarmed the few women that were there and ignored the other men. At one point, I was having a serious conversation about work, and the guy next to me interrupted the other guy, acted like he was invisible, and tried his best to impress me at random.   I do NOT like feeling like some trophy to be won. Best part? They knew I have a bf, but they didn‚Äôt care.   I like my bf for the fact that he sees other men as possible friends and has banter with them.   Pre FDS, I was oblivious and wanted friends so much, that if a man spoke to me, I felt cherished that he wanted to be my friend.

avgpm6cu	When I was severely, suicidally depressed a couple of years ago the medication completely put me off sex. Sometimes I wanted to want sex, but I couldn‚Äôt feel arousal, stimulation or any sort of intimate desire at all. My fianc√©, who in many ways had been incredibly supportive throughout my illness did not support this for long. It was all ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just try‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind if you don‚Äôt orgasm‚Äù or ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs a big part of our relationship‚Äù and other such whiney shite.  A few times I gave him and let him have his sex, but unsurprisingly it was a dreadful experience for me. Letting this man who was supposed to be ‚Äòthe love of my life‚Äô and who had ‚Äòbeen so supportive so would it really hurt so much just to give him this, since I haven‚Äôt been much fun recently‚Äô masturbate into my myopic body triggered all sorts of depressive responses. I later realised in therapy the root cause of my depression was sex abuse at the hands of grown men (the worst being one of my teachers) as a teenager, so letting my fianc√© have one-sided sex with my body was the worst possible thing I could have done for recovery. It made me so fucking miserable, and even more worthless, but it was keeping him happy and rElAtIoNsHiPs ArE cOmPrOmIsE.  Anyway, one day through the depressed fog I refused to have sex. I chanced across a teeny particle of self-respect and put my foot down. And his response was to huff and stomp his way up to our bedroom with his laptop, put on some porn film and wank his way back to sanity. As though releasing his semen was an inalienable human right. At the time I was relieved - all ‚Äúfor the love of god, why doesn‚Äôt he just do that all the time‚Äù but now my (mostly) recovered self is absolutely outraged at the disrespect I was tolerating in my own home:   A) Tolerating him thinking he had a right to shagging my body when I wasn‚Äôt interested. B) That he was willing to whittle away at my not being interested, implying that I owed him sex because our relationship was now boring. C) That he could even enjoy sex that his partner, the supposed love of his life, wasn‚Äôt interested in. D) That his response to not getting his way was to revert to porn. E) That a porn film was used as punishment/leverage - ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not giving me what I want so now I have a right to get it from looking at other women, if you‚Äôve got a problem with that you‚Äôll have to give me sex‚Äù. F) That he thought marrying me and still being a porn user were in any way compatible. That I ALSO thought his marrying me and still being a porn user were in any way compatible.  Anyway, over the last 18 months I‚Äôve dumped his ass, sold our house by myself (he literally refused to help) quit my shit, misogynistic, supposedly high status job and started retraining in something I actually like AND finally reported pedo teacher to the police after 12 years.

5eyjl40e	Many of you know I'm widowed, been widowed several years. I'm also passively open to companionship, provided the guy has his own house, and we keep money separate. I'm childfree, and refuse to be a step-mother. I've mentioned before that I'm also a long-time chatter, and that I leave it on in the background while playing games and reading online. Furthermore, some of you know I have an online "stalker", The Idiot With 10,000 Names, who is everything I despise in a human and specifically in a man: not bright, traditional, conservative, religious, a single father, quite often someone who negs, and attempts to manipulate in the most clumsy and pathetic of ways which I see through every time. However, his one talent is changing nicks, so I can't just block and delete for good. I play whack-a-mole with this moron.  This guy has repeatedly said he wants to meet me in person. People and men don't intimidate me; I've been called the intimidating one since I'm no-nonsense, put up with no shit ever, and am just all business when dealing with people I don't know. He clearly "wants" me; he makes it clear he adores my (50+, plain, average) looks. Okay, whatever, there's someone for everyone, and I am, alas, his type.   A recent post here, about how men truly hate women and want to humiliate them, made me think of this guy immediately. It made my spidey senses tingle. Think of Bella when the guys surrounded her and Edward could read their (most probably rape-y) thoughts. I've asked him, though, why would you spend hundreds of dollars to come to Louisiana, for at most a 30 minute coffee date, maybe a dinner date? He never has an answer. I've used my words and told him, I'm not going back to your hotel room (because he'd have to get a hotel room, and rent a car). I'm not at all going to be alone with a male stranger I've never met before, big no thanks to being raped and murdered. This always sets him back on his heels. I suppose an object isn't supposed to think about her own safety and any possible harm. An object isn't supposed to set boundaries.   I honestly think this guy hates and despises me with a white-hot anger surpassing the sun. I think I'm his "type" in that I would be a conquest for him on many levels. I have a deep suspicion that this guy may have mental/emotional issues, so because most conversations go off the rails quickly with love-bombing, lack of logic, weirdness, an in-person meeting would just be kryptonite. So for you, my FDS queens, here's what this means. Here's what to watch out for to know when a man hates women, you in particular, because you are a superior being compared to him. Rather than look inside, feel bad, then start leveling up, he will do everything in his power, rape and murder included, to bring you down. This is why the bar is in hell and stays in hell: men's lack of looking inward and choosing to better themselves, and taking out their anger and frustration on women.  In no particular order, if you have any or all of these qualities (not saying I do, but most), watch out if a man you're dating starts to neg you, not appreciate you, resent you, gets angry for no discernible, logical reason:  \-- you are educated, and yes, this can include having a high school diploma  \-- you are university educated and degreed  \-- you work in your field and/or have used your degree to get a start in one field, and advance your skills to work in another field  \-- you are a Western woman  \-- you have facility with English and/or your own language and are fluent and well-spoken  \-- you are employed (or retired), and do not have to depend on a man to support you  \-- you don't have kids, make it clear you've never wanted any, and emphasize that freedom means way more to you than having a traditional family (they particularly hate that)  \-- you are either not religious, or if you do attend, you are skeptical, a doubter, a questioner (they want to use religion to control and dominate)  \-- you have good critical thinking skills, question what he says, don't take what he says on faith, and look for deeper meanings and lies, evasions, half-truths  \-- you center and prioritize your own wants and needs above those of any man  \-- you have boundaries and limits that you set clearly, and no matter what he says, those boundaries and limits stand firm  Honestly, I could go on and on. I look forward to hearing from you: how do you know when you are way more HV than x male? What tips you off?

7osmnunj	I just opened reddit without being logged in and saw men on the front page comforting each other about their ED and swearing it's normal üëÄ   Ummm...what? It's not normal. It's something that happens naturally to old men (who's sperm is no longer safe to the gene pool), but not ‚Äãmen in their teens 20s and 30s.   They're telling each other it's from poor diet and depression and that tweaking their food (EAT MORE LEAN MEAT BRO) is the answer üò¨   It's from porn. How is that not obvious. It's from horrific abuse to the body and mind. Instead of coping on Reddit (and with podcasts ü§≠üôÑ) why don't they cut the addiction? I mean are they seriously going to dissociate via porn for their entire prime years? They are seriously choosing to normalize self induced premature aging instead of walking away from the pixels.   üíÄ  Edit: lol at all the Reddit cares messages and threats from kings with ED. Guys I know youre accustomed to your Reddit fam of coomers coddling you about this kind of stuff and I know you‚Äôre feeling weirdly defensive about your precious pixels, but here is some well intentioned advice: Kick your porn addiction while you‚Äôre still young. because you do have a problem.

2e3xhoud	Hello ladies!   I was wondering if any of you talked about FDS and the impact it has had in your lives during therapy sessions and how that turned out.  I am not necessarily referring to FDS points in the handbook such as continuous vetting, having strong standards and boundaries, and our continuous growth and levelling-up.  What I am referring to is FDS as a whole community and the different topics that we cover in this sub such as: the well-deserved criticism of men and society in this sub, how women are lied to from an early age to accept less than deserved, about the patriarchal society that we live in, etc.	1642970127.0	sb364t	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb364t/do_you_talk_to_your_therapist_about_fds/	Do you talk to your therapist about FDS?

tfi8qd	This is extremely difficult for me to write about, and it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôve thought about for quite some time. So please bear with me if my thoughts aren‚Äôt organized.  Thinking about this always brings tears to my eyes and makes me livid. I am sure others can relate to my story.  I am almost 30 years old. A majority of my 20s was spent with a man who wasted my time promising marriage, 7 years to be exact. A portion of my late 20s was also spent with a man who consistently lied to me about how much I meant to him, and the things he would sacrifice/give up to be with me.  To no surprise, both of these men strung me along for years. They picked up on my incredibly low self esteem and self worth, and knew I would tolerate empty promises and less than the bare minimum. In your 20s, you think you have all the time in the world. You are naive enough to believe that people are being honest about their intentions with you, and are excited about a future together.  Now that I‚Äôm approaching 30, I really feel like I wasted the best years of my life on men who truly didn‚Äôt deserve it. In my 20s, I saw many people I knew happily getting engaged and married within a reasonable timeframe. As much as I was happy for them and wished them an incredible future, deep down I was fuming with jealousy.  Being in these 2 relationships made me question my entire self worth. Was I not worthy of being committed to? Was I not worthy of being treated with dignity? Was I not worthy of being well taken care of with a man who *truly* believes that I‚Äôm his dream girl, in his eyes? Why was everyone else getting treated much better than I was? Is it something to do with my looks? Is it the fact I wasn‚Äôt assertive enough?  Now, approaching my 30s, I know that I got manipulated and taken advantage of because I gave men the benefit of the doubt. I truly believed they were honest about their intentions with me. It had nothing to do with my looks, or the fact that I need to be treated lesser than my peers. It was their issues, not mine.  Now, I hold some deep rooted resentment for men. Deep down, I believe that a majority of men aren‚Äôt serious about their intentions, are porn addicted, or are active cheaters. ‚ÄúApproaching the wall‚Äù makes me feel like I wasted my youth in dead end relationships with people who didn‚Äôt deserve an ounce of attention from me.  Unfortunately, this makes dating exceptionally tough but also exceptionally easy at the same time. I can filter out men with my eyes closed. I can see who‚Äôs trying to be in a relationship as a means to an end. I can see who‚Äôs not truly ‚Äúinto me‚Äù, and would happily cheat on me or watch porn to satisfy themselves. I can also realize the men lying through their teeth about their intentions regarding marriage.  I have been to therapy regarding the resentment I hold, but I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs entirely a bad thing. My resentment has made me more assertive and on high alert while courting men. I know when my time is being wasted, and know its not a compatible relationship long term.  I now have a timeline in my head for my relationship goals that are reasonable for a person approaching 30. I‚Äôm tired into being gaslight about my expectations being unreasonable. I‚Äôm tired of being strung along.  I know my worth and I know that I‚Äôll only share   with someone who respects me and cherishes me. I am not in a position to fall for lies again. My resentment is part of my growth and life journey.	1642973660.0	sb4joz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sb4joz/harbouring_resentment_in_future_relationships/	Harbouring resentment in future relationships

63sdvkz3	Many women have learned that, in today‚Äôs dating climate, unfavorable or even abusive relationships with men will deprive them of our most precious resources: **time and health**.    Think of how many opportunities ‚Äì including academic, professional, and financial ones ‚Äì you have missed out on due to all the added stress and trauma a man has put you through, often repeatedly (reminder: do not beat yourself up about it, so long as you recognize all that you have learned from your experiences; use that knowledge to your advantage). How hard it was to nurse yourself back to sanity, confidence, and peace. How much all this unnecessary heartache has took from you.   Therefore, if you have found yourself in a relationship with a NV/LV man, this post is for **you**. Use it as a resource to help yourself make one of the most important choices a woman can make to level up her life ‚Äì end the relationship.   So, how do you start the process of detaching yourself from him? I suggest that you use the following as a guide to your relationship/‚Äúsituationship‚Äù:    ‚Äî **Ask for support and accountability:** Tell your *trusted* friend, relative, and/or therapist that you want to leave your relationship. Do not be afraid to ask for guidance, support, and encouragement. Let them know that you are in the process of getting ready to leave your LV/NVM, and ask that they keep you accountable in case you regress on your decision to end the relationship.   ‚Äî **Practice reflection and self-compassion:** Be it under a therapist‚Äôs supervision or on your own, reflect on all the shitty, painful moments that have been done to you; do not hesitate to put the blame where it belongs: did he gaslight to, lie, manipulate, and abuse you to get his way? Write that down. Explore how these traumatic events/manipulations played part in creating the trauma bond you now have. Understand that it‚Äôs important to **not** beat yourself down for staying in a relationship with an abusive man. Practice self-compassion and ensure that you are taking good care of yourself.   ‚Äî **Let yourself be angry:** You are a woman who deserved to be treated with respect, gentle love, and care. You deserved to be taken seriously, your aspirations supported, your effort cherished. Recognize that your anger is absolutely valid. Use this emotion to put yourself first and cut off anyone who does not have your best interest at heart.    ‚Äî **Journal through the process:** Start a journal (an electronic one, which can be protected by a password). Write all of your feelings down. Write out your *own* strategy of dealing with the heartache that will come up post-breakup. How do you plan to handle it? What can you do to soothe yourself in a healthy, gentle way?   ‚Äî **Plan out the breakup:** What do you need to do before the breakup? Clean up your social media, go private? Decide which friends of his (suggested: all of them, him included) you will block? What will you text him when you finally decide to end the relationship? Will you need to meal-prep to ensure that you are eating healthy? Will you set aside 30 minutes a day to have a light workout, release the tension/stress stored in your body? Think about it thoroughly, to ensure that you do not engage with him post-breakup.   So far, that is all.

172w3bkm	I always wondered why men chose the avenue of arranged marriage, selecting who their mothers picked for them instead of becoming independent, leveling up, becoming HVM, and potentially finding dream girl/HVW!      These men would **rather** secure family inheritance, honor, comfort, and assets over the chance of mutually fulfilling, spiritually bonding love (and sex) with DreamGirl! I mean, yeah, it requires work to level up and be a virtuous man! Anything good will require work and sacrifice. But such men whine, bitch, and complain that they‚Äôre not happy and they‚Äôre not free once they realize they married whom their parents wanted, that they don‚Äôt even like. Time to get some accountability for your actions, you manbaby!     Is the explanation for this solely patriarchy? Or is there more to the story? Emotional blackmail? Oppressive cultural norms? Is it a cultural cycle that is difficult to break through?      I was under the impression that men from such cultures, especially the high value ones, will rise up, be resilient, break away from parents‚Äô totalitarian control, and become independent of oppressive values, especially once these men and their families have immigrated to Western countries....	1643002637.0	sbejfn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbejfn/ladies_have_you_noticed_any_trends_of_men_who/	Ladies, have you noticed any trends of men who chose arranged marriages vs. leveling themselves up to be independent of the patriarchal culture?
4830whsh	I frequently see FDS rescue missions here. But is it really worth it? Have you had any real success stories with rescue missions? Most people aren't looking for solutions, just a shoulder to cry on. I have tried to subtly suggest many girls to read the handbook, and even have offered them advice when they literally asked for it, but no luck. PickMes live out of the validation of men. They don't see the worth in themselves. It makes me angry. So many kind, beautiful, smart girls are falling for abuse. It sucks to see your friends continuing their PickMe ways, year after year.  Long story short, a few days ago I tried to warn a groomed girl, now a woman about her on-off fianc√© of over a DECADE. Let's call her Mary. They have kids and her fianc√© is active in the super conservative right wing politics. This man had groomed her since she was a literal child, and has stringed her on for years, without a marriage, as a side chick. A friend posted on social media this man (who is her ex from over 10 years ago) had sent her DMs out of the blue in the middle of the night, calling her an ugly, fat wh\*re and c\*nt who is desperate and won't ever find anyone. I usually don't meddle, but I do believe women need to stand up for each other. I wish the girls my ex cheated me on had contacted me. So I sent the screenshots to Mary, and what do I get? She sends me walls of texts for days, calling me a wh\*re for trying to ruin her "perfect" relationship, calling my friend with awful names, and after this her fianc√© attacks me as well. So I block them both.  Moral of the story? PickMes don't want help or advice. In their bad moments they just want to be your emotional garbage bin, but they won't take any advice. They think they know better. Just keep a good distance to them, and if they happen to be your friend, maybe offer them some kind words once they've finally dumped their LVMs and found their self worth. I'm so tired of this.	1643021398.0	sbjhmt	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbjhmt/is_it_really_worth_trying_to_help_pickmes/	Is it really worth trying to help PickMes?
yz5qp	So, a friend just sent me an article and it begins like this:  *"In early January, Brooks Nader, a 26-year-old Sports Illustrated swimsuit model, was walking home alone from a night out in New York when she received a disturbing iPhone notification telling her she was carrying an ‚Äúunknown accessory‚Äù.*   *‚ÄúThis item has been moving with you for a while,‚Äù the alert read. ‚ÄúThe owner can see its location.‚Äù That‚Äôs when she knew ‚Äúsomething wasn‚Äôt right‚Äù.*   *Nader discovered that somebody had slipped an Apple AirTag into her coat pocket while she was sitting in a restaurant earlier. Unbeknown to her, the device tracked her location for four hours before Apple‚Äôs abuse prevention system triggered the notification to her phone".*  I just spent at least 20 minutes staring at my screen after reading this. AirTag costs only 29$ and if you don't use an iPhone, like me, there's no chance of you finding out until it's too late.   Looks like now I need to find a coat with no pockets, just in case, to wear it in public places.	1643023103.0	sbjxtz	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbjxtz/apple_airtag_a_perfect_tool_for_stalking/	Apple AirTag: a perfect tool for stalking
4uhoo7n5	So I recently left a job and whilst I was there I came across three pickme colleagues based on the things they told me about their partners/lives.  Colleague one was married with children and mentioned to me how her husband had never gone to her child‚Äôs school to collect the kid, so the teachers had no idea who the dad was, and that one day she asked her husband to collect their child after school, and I could hear this over the teams call as we were WFH, she kept telling him to hurry up and leave and where exaclty to go, and for some reason he was taking a long time to leave even though it was already 15mins past the time my colleague normally leaves to collect the child. What kind of a useless dad doesn‚Äôt get their child from school ever.  Colleague two and I shared a commute so we‚Äôd often sit next to each other and talk. She mentioned that she had been engaged for over 2 years and dating for 5 with no wedding date. Now colleague two was highly impressive she had multiple degrees, spoke over 5 different languages fluently and had worked and studied in many different countries. She also showed me photos of herself from a few years ago and she was very attractive back then. When I met her she looked about a decade older than her actual age. I never really connected the dots til one day I met her spouse on the commute home. He was a scrote in every sense of the word. My colleague introduced me to him and he was instantly very rude/annoyed by my presence. I assumed because I was WOC that he was just racist. So I just spoke to my colleague and avoided looking in his direction. During the entire commute the scrote took jabs at my colleague, called her dumb, pretended to box her, belittled something she said whilst talking to me, and to top it off the scrote was nowhere near as accomplished as my colleague in-fact he worked in a warehouse and looked like a junkie imo. The thing I realised was that this scrote had aged my once beautiful colleague so she no longer looked like she did a few years ago. Before I said goodbye to my colleague that day I overheard her ordering and paying for takeout for her and the scrote, he didn‚Äôt even offer to pay or cook for her the douche   Colleague three mentioned to me how she bought a house with her bf of 7 years and now they broke up and shes trying to buy his share of the house and for the time being he still lives there with her. She said she realised she didn‚Äôt want to marry or have kids with him, but then went onto say how they still act like a couple despite being broken up   Just foolishness all round	1643026992.0	sbl15w	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sbl15w/pickmes_at_work/	Pickmes at work
8y4h454d	>‚ÄúBackfooting‚Äù is a manipulation tactic where a man accuses a woman of something bad to put her on the back foot, causing her to behave defensively and **in a way that is beneficial to him** to prove she is not like that.  >We coined this phrase in [Part 2](https://www.patreon.com/posts/lundy-bancroft-2-61130117?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_campaign=postshare) of our interview with Lundy Bancroft.

67jwaddn	I am a senior in undergraduate and am moving to NYC after college in a few months. I met a guy who was visiting a mutual friend of mine at my college and we talked all night (he was pretty shy but we clicked). He goes to school in NYC and will also be living there so he said once I go up to the city, to let him know and he would take me on a date. He asked for my snapchat üö©(One of Gen Z's main form of communication) and we added each other. He was not pressuring at all, the same religion, comes from a sturdy family, is well-educated, and no red flags when it comes to his social media presence.   A few days later, his friend and I were talking about him one night and he was saying his friend is super shy but was into me and for me to reach out. I stated that I will not reach out and it does not matter if he's shy --  **he will reach out if he wants to.**  I get a message from him the next morning letting me know again that he will take me out when I go up and that his friend said I was going up soon (false, he was just drunk telling him that). We started snapping back and forth but **he wasn't saying anything of value so I left him on opened/read.** I snapped him a couple days later while I was out with friends and I left him on read for a second time and he immediately said (he was drunk I think) "don't leave me opened respond! I want to see your face you're so pretty!" He also mentioned again he will take me out when I go up. I don't know if I was being crass but I basically mentioned him flying me out to see me sooner and he told me to look at flights but he is on a budget since he just quit his job and went to 3 dinners that week (I don't know if he is living on his own means since he's also an undergraduate). I literally asked him if he's ever thought about budgeting or dieting. I also asked him if he knew how to manage his funds since he's a finance major ü§° and that the flight fare was not even bad. He suggested we wait until I go up there for when I look at apartments. Since then, we've been barely snapping back and forth after 20 hour intervals with no conversation of value.   **What do we do in situations like these where communication is a blank space? I have thought about just leaving him on opened/read and leaving it be? Or just give him my phone number and say I'm not into snapchatting and he can text me from his number so I can just let him know when I go up.

u9mr7	From Sarah McDugal [link to her Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/sarahmcdugalauthor/posts/504273184394713) of [Wilderness to Wild, a community for those experiencing abuse in the faith community](https://www.wildernesstowild.com/):    Young women often face a painful question:    ‚ÄúI‚Äôve discovered that my boyfriend/fianc√© has been watching porn, hiding debt, sexting girls, chatting with other girls, not telling me he‚Äôs out drinking, gambling on the side, etc‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI love him SO much, and I can‚Äôt imagine life without him. He‚Äôs a really amazing boyfriend/fianc√©, and he‚Äôs promised to get help. Should I REALLY break up with him/cancel the wedding? Shouldn‚Äôt I stick around to prove my support and commitment?‚Äù  Sweet, beautiful girl ‚Äî let me share some profoundly painful and hard-earned wisdom with you‚Ä¶    (No mentor or parent or friend can tell you what to do in this dilemma. You must decide for yourself what level of betrayal you‚Äôre willing to live with as your baseline of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.)    But few will take the time to give you a raw, brutal glimpse into what very likely lies ahead should you decide to stay.  Right now, I‚Äôm going to give you that gift. If you marry him now, here‚Äôs what I can *almost certainly* guarantee for your future.     You will:    - live in fear, not in love.    - keep experiencing these discoveries or disclosures over and over again, and they will NOT hurt less with time.     - develop a mysterious chronic illness, cancer,  or autoimmune condition.    - become conditioned to doubt the goodness and safety of all men everywhere.     - find yourself compulsively checking his devices, your bank accounts, and other data sources to try and reassure yourself that he‚Äôs currently not cheating or putting the family in debt.     - work two or three jobs to help him pay off the debt incurred from reckless financial decisions and addictive choices.  - live in constant self-doubt because his words and actions often don‚Äôt add up and you can‚Äôt trust your reality.     - lose confidence in yourself as a human and in your value as a woman, due to his emotional abandonment and sexual mistreatment.     - experience depression and anxiety, while also noticing that your children are showing symptoms of depression and anxiety.  - have to care for yourself and your kids without his help (or even despite his disdain) when you are sick or in poor health.  - live in constant fear that he may act out pornographic fantasies with your girlfriends or on your children.    - flee for safety if/when he DOES act out those fantasies on your children.    - spend the remaining years of your kids‚Äô childhoods tethered to him via a hostile court system. - work your hands to the bone despite your chronic illness(es) to feed, clothe, and educate your little ones, while he continues to rack up debt and spend thousands on his addictions while dodging child support.  - weep your way home after every court-mandated child exchange because the courts WILL award him unsupervised parenting time regardless of his addictions or proclivities. - yell at God and struggle with your faith because of the unrelenting years of double abuse and failure to be protected by those in power. - face mountains of legal, medical, and therapy bills directly resulting from trying to survive the impact of his behaviors.     - or‚Ä¶ you may never choose to leave, believing you are trapped in this because of your kindhearted and trusting initial vow, and live out your days a hollow, lifeless shell of the vibrant and beautiful woman you are now.     If you choose to stay, if you choose to marry him despite what you‚Äôve discovered, you are altering the trajectory of your next several decades of life, to very likely include a daily existence of deception, domestic violence, sexual abuse, betrayal, adultery, fraud, litigation abuse, and trauma for the next generation.     Yes, you could survive it.    Yes, you could become a warrior in the process.  Yes, you may find healing on the other side.  But if you already know what you know now, why choose to walk into hell?  If there‚Äôs one thing you can do right now to love him well ‚Äî it is to wish him recovery and walk away at the first sign of broken boundaries, double life, and addictive behaviors. He can get clean, find healing, and become healthy and whole ‚Äî without you.  Whatever dilemmas you face, precious young woman, make sure you ponder ALL the ramifications and make a fully informed choice.  Your 40-year-old self will thank you.  üíó  > Sarah McDugal	1643074314.0	sc1hhp	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sc1hhp/ive_discovered_that_my_boyfriendfianc√©_has_been/	‚ÄúI‚Äôve discovered that my boyfriend/fianc√© has been watching porn, hiding debt, sexting girls, chatting with other girls, not telling me he‚Äôs out drinking, gambling on the side, etc‚Ä¶" Here's what the future holds for you if you stay with him.
u8ugxyu	Hi ladies, I'm starting to multi-date now and since it's my first time doing it I'd appreciate some advice and pointers. I'd normally post this in the weekly thread, but it seems those have been stopped for a while.   I'm dating multiple men who meet my criteria and I just want to know how you ladies approach this. Do you let the other guys you're dating other men? For example, had a date on Saturday night which went ok. I told this other man that and his ego was bruised to the point where he stalked the date guy's IG and started mocking him. Needless to say I blocked Mr. Bruised Ego afterwards.   If those men are also dating other women, how do you take that? What's the FDS stance on this?   Also, how do you not let physical affection affect your judgement? My love language is physical touch and even the slightest thing like hand holding clouds my judgement.

7cg57uq6	If you're  like me and come from a 'complicated' family, even from childhood I knew things like politics etc were for someone with a 'shiny' past.   I didn't want to imagine reporters digging up the sins of me or people I loved even if I often didn't like them.   As a result, I believe I have deliberately sabotaged myself.   I was panicked that if I did reach any level of success that the messiness of my life would make it so the familiar jeers would be back.   Sometimes I think if we have been through trauma, it feels safer just to put your head down and hope that no one notices you.   We all know what happens to women who rise.   I hope you will join me in overcoming shame in order to make one more step to making your life better.   Regardless of if other people think it wasn't a shaming act, if it wasn't your fault, or if you happily participated, if you feel shame from it, that might be something to explore esp in therapy or in books oft recommended here.  Whatever is keeping you from the same levelling up as me, trauma, fear, and that thing that keeps you up at 2am.   Maybe it is childhood/teen trauma. Maybe it is the worry that your past as a sugar baby will discredit you if it comes out, the nude photos you sent to that guy who seemed alright at the time, an infidelity, shoplifting and all of the responses to trauma, making an already hard hole even harder to climb out of.  If you believe you truly have something to 'repent' for, make peace with that and find a way to give back through volunteering or educating.   This is not meant to be an I'm cured post. I don't believe going to your first yoga class will cure social anxiety.   But for those of us with trauma, I beg of you to get the help (if you can) to take the first step to gain your confidence back. To learn that you are capable, valuable and unique.   You are not your shame.   I, a klutzy, dorky, middle-aged mother, will be going to uni as a second attempt. I am 40 years old and it is my time to begin.   I hope it is your time as well.	1643078065.0	sc2td3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sc2td3/are_you_unconsciously_sabotagingpunishing/	Are you unconsciously sabotaging/punishing yourself because of past shame?
172w3bkm	I hope none of you experience this, but I think this is a very important discussion to be had. Women need to be vigilant of the subtle and obvious ways men will use to abuse, especially if they choose to escalate.     Even in my personal life, I did not know I was emotionally, mentally, and verbally abused by a man that I loved until my own brain fog cleared. After reading the symptoms, my trauma finally made sense. My ex would hit inanimate objects when enraged. I wonder if this would have eventually been my face.	1643084572.0	sc4yw7	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sc4yw7/what_are_warning_signs_that_the_man_may_become/	What are warning signs that the man may become physically abusive?

850v9qv5	Hi Ladies, has anyone heard of G.L Lambert (@8plus9 on twitter)?  He wrote   Men Don't Love Women Like you  Ho Tactics  Unicorn Delusion etc  &#x200B;  I appreciated his books when I was younger and it saved me a lot of stress. He had some advice on how to have standards, let men work, men should pay for dates etc. But I heavily disagreed on his take that women should approach men.  However, as I have gotten older, I read the books again and still hold some truths. But I see a lot of misogyny in his language, I do not like the way he insults women and how ge goes on about all the horrible things he did when he was single (cheating, using girls for sex etc) I am like what is your point of sharing all this? Yet he never talks about his relational failings or something doing him dirty.... Now he has a website for women to pay for his "advice" (9.99 USD)  &#x200B;  I feel he says enough to empower women but ultimately makes sure they feel insecure enough to buy his content, that is some abusive sh\*t  &#x200B;  General thoughts on him?	1643109912.0	scbjhy	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scbjhy/thoughts_on_gl_lambert_relationship_expert_8plus9/	Thoughts on G.L Lambert?

5boqgd7x	I have been dating what seemed to be a HVM the last 6 months. I decided I really liked him and it was time for me to know if this was a relationship that was going to work out.   I went ahead and started vetting that with conversations about the future. I didn‚Äôt like his answers. He wanted us to keep going until those issues arose (career change, moving, differences in beliefs. etc). After hearing that and considering my own feelings, I decided to end it.   Why?   1. I don‚Äôt need to date someone for 2 years to figure out how I feel. My time is valuable. I shouldn‚Äôt have to wait 2 years for him to figure it out.   2. Agreeing to work for a relationship and make decisions to put it first is the bare minimum. Any hesitation, any postponement means it‚Äôs already doomed.   3. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much you like him. If it‚Äôs not reciprocated, you haven‚Äôt lost a thing.   FDS, I‚Äôve saved my time, protected my feelings and lost dead weight.   Never stop vetting, trust your gut, and make sure you‚Äôre getting what you want.	1643123607.0	scfxnn	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scfxnn/trust_your_feelings_and_the_strategy/	Trust your feelings and the strategy
5eyjl40e	Luvmyvulvaxoxo said, " Puberty is singularly the WORST time in any woman‚Äôs life. Suddenly at 12 (sometimes earlier) all these GROWN ass men start leering at you and making you uncomfortable. It doesn‚Äôt stop for another 2 decades and then suddenly we‚Äôre invisible."  My story first, then I want to hear from FDS queens.  I had my first period when I was 9 years old. My mother barely explained what it was, due to her own body shame, which I unconsciously internalized, although I already had a fair bit going on from being an overweight girl. This didn't help. Having a period was in no way at all whatsoever celebrated, although my mother did do one very weird thing: she displayed my soiled panties for my father to see! I didn't see where she put them at first, another room we didn't use much, but as soon as I did, I swiped them and ran to put them in the dirty clothes hamper. Freaked me out. I should add too that I was raised Southern Baptist, which was all about denying the flesh, flesh is bad/sinful, develop your inner person, attend to your soul first and foremost. In some ways good, because it puts emphasis on developing one's mind and personality and being a truly good person, but really harmful in that it encourages people to care a lot less about the only body we have for this life.  The whole experience of puberty was a freak-out. I knew, as a middle schooler, that I could possibly get pregnant as a child. I had always known from single digits I very much wanted to be married and happy, and had never wanted kids, and getting my period in single digits went a long, long way toward cementing my childfree status forever. I've always had toxophobia, and knew down deep in my bones I had zero vocation, talent, desire for kids, and would be a bad mother. Just thinking of having kids filled me with dread, disgust, despair; I'd feel trapped just thinking of it. I grew up in rural north Louisiana, back in the 70s, so there were no school counselors or girls only groups to discuss issues with. I suffered in silence. I had no desire to date anyway, having grown up with the same group from kindergarten, so I waited til my dad was going to remarry, then started dating as a junior in high school in my new city. And I was ADAMANT and careful about birth control every single time even through the hormonal haze of late teens to late 20s.  Eventually what I did was pile on weight, in a childish way to avoid being too visible. I saw what prettier girls were going through, and I "thought" (except it wasn't actual thinking, more like just operating on childish instinct and lizard-brain) that if I put on weight, men wouldn't see me or comment or harass. And mostly it worked. I didn't realize I was genetically prone to weight gain, so after college, around age 25 when metabolism drops again, I really started to put on weight and it spiraled out of control. Also, growing up in 70s and 80s in the Deep South, absolutely nothing was taught about nutrition, so I was what my sister and I called an "unreconstructed eater" -- if it tastes good, eat it! I also have subluxing knees, diagnosed in my 20s, so I couldn't trust my body. I've had some PTSD from my knees, so that also contributed to body image issues, not working out, not knowing what was going on with my body.  Fast forward to 2003, I was diagnosed with syndrome X, which is type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure. I got on meds and changed my lifestyle that week: joined a gym (all I could do at 425 lbs was swim and walk, so I started where I was), stopped all full-sugar sodas, and started improving my diet. Now I weigh around 250, with a little less than 90 lbs to go. I've lost 175 lbs so far. Somewhere around my mid-30s, I decided to give up the body hate talk, and I learned to like and mostly accept my body. With every pound I lost, life got easier. It's been years since I've been given the "fat hate" look. I'm treated better, now that I'm basically average sized. Down here in the South, I'm not at all the heaviest woman in a room anymore.    I've never been all that visible, and now at 53, I'm invisible and glad because of the freedom it gives me out in public, BUT it feels safe, finally, to take the weight off, given that I'm tougher, stronger, more experienced, and have experienced that middle age shift of take no shit ever, which was pretty much always there anyway from childhood. I just now have the gravitas of age to back me up instead of youthful bravada.  I'd be interested to hear what puberty is like from women who are conventionally attractive. What did you go through? How did you deal? How have things changed in your dealings with yourself, with men, with society? For older FDS queens, what has been your experience?	1643123865.0	scg0vi	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scg0vi/we_need_to_talk_about_being_overly_visible_then/	we need to talk about being overly visible, then invisible

4k5q5nww	LVMs always say women get abused because they go after badboy Chad and if women give 'nice guys' or incels a chance, they will treat their gfs well.  But we women know that's not true. We see women get abused by their unattractive bfs or husbands evenly if not more so. The way a man treats his partner is determined only by his character, nothing else. And a man's character really shows when he believes he has power over his partner, whether it's emotional power, financial power or physical power.  They will drop the nice guy mask and start abusing his partner.  And through history, men are power hungry and have a deep desire to feel superior to people beneath him and men lack of character would eventually abuse the power. That's why men cause so much violence ,blood, crimes and wars throughout history and will do so in the future.    In today's world, your average man doesn't have power over anyone, they are losers. But their nature doesn't change. That's why those violent porns are so popular among them and things like bdsm,  choking, anal and spanking, you know all those disgusting 'kinks'. It's the only way for loser men to get a shred of sense of power, by abusing women that choose them.  My point is: women are abused not because they choose badly, it's because they give men a taste of power and since most men are LVMs so they will take advantage of that power.	1643127537.0	scheje	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scheje/nearly_all_men_can_stand_adversity_but_if_you/	Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man‚Äôs character, give him power
765eiop8	I know what the handbook says, but I see a lot of people here reference ‚Äúback in my pickme days‚Äù and then bring up something that was just a regular mistake. Call it a lapse in judgment, na√Øvet√©, or ignorance, but most of the time, it wasn‚Äôt changing who they were or behaving in a manner that would increase their chances of being ‚Äúchosen.‚Äù So why use ‚Äúpick-me‚Äù? Are you feeling undue remorse (stop that! We all make mistakes and you know better now ü§ó)? Does it make you feel like you‚Äôve made more progress than you really have?   This has been on my mind since running into a former coworker this weekend. Long story short, I found out that a long ago ex was cheating on me. With the life experience I have now, it‚Äôs not surprising and I see red flags I was oblivious to before lol If I could have a do over with what I know now, I would avoid him. I was never a pickme, though. I never acted contrary to my core values, much less change who I was so he would stay with me. I think my biggest mistake was thinking the 10 year age gap (I was 19) meant he was wiser, stabler, more mature, and all around better than he actually was.   If you need a comparison, my friend‚Äôs cousin is a pick-me, and it still makes me sad to think about. She rehomed her dogs because her boyfriend doesn‚Äôt like dogs. She changed her major because he said she would be better at the one he picked. And now she‚Äôs thinking of terminating a pregnancy she doesn‚Äôt want to terminate because‚Ä¶you guessed it.   So sisters, give yourself the love and understanding you ideally would give a friend if she just did something dumb. Give yourself an extra helping if both if you really were a pick-me because you‚Äôve come a long way. Basically don‚Äôt needlessly drag yourself.	1643131158.0	scire3	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scire3/what_do_you_think_a_pickme_is_and_why_do_you/	What do *you* think a pick-me is, and why do you think you used to be one?

kzlt1ja	So I've been dating this guy and checked out his apartment recently. He moved in about a week or two ago, so it's not a big deal to me that it's not fully furnished and some things are still in boxes.  I love interior design and projected a bit lol. I asked if he's excited to decorate his new spot. He got weird and said he doesn't think a guy should decorate his own apartment. Prior to this, he has given me some "men do this and women do that" vibes, so this made it pretty clear. He explained that he thinks if he brings girls over, they'd find it "weird" if the place was fully decorated and furnished. I definitely think he was implying it being "gay", but he didn't say it directly. He said that women want to decorate their guy's apartment because they want a guy who is a "project". I'm literally just laughing inside. Like we are just casually talking and this guy literally tells me he strives to be a project for his future girlfriend. Like we don't have enough projects in our own lives. Ridiculous.  I'm not seeing him further, but find male "logic" fascinating. Putting aside how ridiculous and sexist all that was, it's just bad male strategy in so many ways. Like from my dates, this guy does give me the vibes that he's not full-on fuckboy and wants a real relationship. However, what happens when/if that girl LEAVES? It's a GIRLFRIEND, not a fiance or wife. Like all your decorations remind you of her. Your furniture reminds you of her. It's just a recipe of lonely boy sadness if it doesn't work out with this girlfriend. And you put yourself in that situation. When you strive to be someone's project, I can only imagine how much of your identity is lost at the end of a relationship. This is probably one reason why so many men lose their minds after a breakup.   I just truly value how furnishing and decorating effects your mood and every day life, and this would just be bad strategy on anyone's part. I love interior design and like to vet a guy's apartment to see what their creativity is like in terms of interior design. Like if we were to live together, what would that look like? I would like to build a future home WITH someone, not as a personal project of mine.	1643140535.0	scmc56	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scmc56/guy_i_dated_thinks_a_woman_should_design_and/	Guy I dated thinks a woman should design and furnish his new apartment.

b5i0o4qm	I found today and dear ladies, I couldn't wait more to tell you all! We already know that girls/models from OF are making little cash, paying 20% fee from every transaction and being able to get money only once per month. And here comes the parasites!  1. Different groups of men who  buy content and post the content in telegram channels, the access to channel is free. The money comes for adds from casino, gambling, games, betting on sport and adds for another channels from memes /crypto/couches etc.  2. Different groups of men buy packages/find on forums etc of models and resale for lower price, he bought for 25$ and resale for 3-5$ to 100-200 people . 3. just buying in groups everyone donate 1-2$ or more and put for free for internet points (reddit, 4chan) 4. payed access like subscription, also low price to channel or forum or account and people who always buy/steal/find  pics and  fill regularly with content.  So what we have, a naive girl who found on tiktok referral links and bought into fancy life of of model who also gets her share from signing up to this pyramid, for pics of her ass barely made 100$ with a 20% tax. Her pics got into one or more scheme and owner of channels and accounts made a good bag, they also get their percent from every loose in casino/bets. All the men involved keep their anonymity, the girl remained broke and without reputation or chance to get a normal job.	1643140620.0	scmda6	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scmda6/who_else_make_money_from_all_of_except_the_women/	Who else make money from all OF except the women involved
6wzvmu3l	Context: My ex was 23 living with his parents... and I was 20 at the time. He has a weird attachment to his parents , esp his mom. He would also compete with me on the "whose more independent and struggled more?" category, and it would manifest in his actions in such subtle ways. He would act like I was a child that didn't know how to do anything ‚Äì so he could feel better about himself. This is something I remember he did that made me realize he was actually the child.   One random day at his home, his mother was going to change his bedsheets and then he tells his mom "can you teach her how to change a bed?" And I was like ?????? What?  His mom (who is a sweet woman) was like "Come here! I'll show you!"  Important thing to note: I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BED WTF. I never gave him the impression that I didn't! I was so confused when he looks at me and tells me its an important thing to learn.  I felt so awkward that he just left me to his mom, and I didn't have the guts to tell her no (which he weaponized later on) So I was just stuck helping her make a bed while she gave the tutorial.   At another time, my ex and I were having sex at night, and it was near my menstrual cycle date and it induced my period to come early. It was dark so neither of us realized until he went to the bathroom first to clean up ‚Äì and saw blood on him. The second he mentioned it, I gasped and looked down at the bed and saw that I leaked a little on his white bedsheets. I profusely apologized and luckily he was calm about it and made a few "looks like a murder scene" jokes here and there (it didnt even lol, it was a small blood stain)  What threw me off is when he said to just throw the bedsheets into the laundry basket so his mom could clean it ... and I was like Hol Up. "I'm not letting your mom clean my period stain. Why can't you?"  He said "it's not a big deal, she'll understand. Or I can just tell her the blood is from something else."   His mom seeing the blood isn't an issue because she's an understanding woman... the problem is, is that it wasn't her responsibility to clean my mess. I kept asking him why can't he just do it before I asked "you do your own laundry right?" He said nothing so I sighed and said "I'm taking the sheets and I'll clean them."   So it was 1am when I got home and got to clean the sheets. Why did I do it really? Well he made me feel adequate about the whole "learning how to change bedsheets" tutorial that I wanted to prove I can hold my own and clean my own mess. What I never noticed is that he didn't take responsibility because he probably didn't know how to, didn't want to or just wanted to involve his mom in our relationship AGAIN, or was training me to be a Mom with benefits - maybe all of the above?    I think i'd make a part two on his weird behaviour with his mom so that people can see why its such a red flag to date a mamas boy. Ladies, if your man can't take care of a damn period stain, or his own clothes for the matter, and his bedsheets?

3xf04kzm	Ladies... I'm not sure when I had the idea to do this, but I'm loving the effect it has on men and wanted to share it with you! Hope it's not a repost, also I'm not a native...  So, my strategy.  It's simple. Just pretend you can't cook at all. Except noodles or something very easy. 3 dishes or so, that's all.  Pretend you can't bake either. Say you'll let everything burn. Tell them about it. Let them know.   Some men will sort out themselves immediately "what, you suck at cooking?? Try harder" which is perfect. Away they go!  Others offer to give advice and that's where it gets interesting... how do they give advice? Are they rude, are they annoyed, do they make fun of you? Sort them out.   Will they offer to cook for you and take this opportunity to get to your place for the first "date" aka try to just get into your kitchen so they get a chance to get you into bed?   Will they offer advice, kindly, and will you like the way they talk to you while giving the advice? Will they handle your apparent weakness with care and empathy and respect? How is their reaction when you decline advice given to you? Like when they say to put X into Y and you tell them you didn't like the outcome, will they react in a way which makes you feel secure and respected? Will they try harder to give advice that suits your taste better?  Their reaction says so much about their personally and how they handle your weaknesses, especially something that is seen as something a woman has to be able to do, like cooking.   I found that the men who passed this test are insanely more pleasant to be around than any other men I was in contact with before applying this.  Let me now what you think!	1643142352.0	scn14d	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scn14d/pretend_you_cant_cook/	Pretend you can't cook
7d1wafuk	I‚Äôve come to a point in my life where I‚Äôm truly over desperately seeking anyone out, I‚Äôm in a relationship but even if that doesn‚Äôt work out I‚Äôm over my pick me phase. Looking back I thought about the different aspects of female socialization and how it plays into our dating lives as adults. Granted my own environment was horrible, toxic, but the media romance genre has a lot to do with it as well. I used to be so curious about relationships and would idealize them, and since no one would tell me anything ü§°. I got my information from teen dramas and erotica/romance novels and all they had in common? Romanticized violence, abuse, and general mistreatment. ¬´¬†X was my captor and I was his sex slave and I‚Äôd been in the dungeon for a week.. here he comes he‚Äôs so attractive and powerful as he pulls my hair and forces me to look him in the eye¬†¬ª. When I read a sentence like this with wise adult eyes what do I see? Normalization of kidnapping, Stockholm syndrome, normalization of sexual abuse, degradation and female submission.   Then there‚Äôs tv shows where the guy cheats and it‚Äôs all ok because he‚Äôs saved her friend or whatever or he‚Äôs soulless(Buffy, etc) .

765eiop8	One of my friends finalized her divorce last week year. Thank goodness her parents have money because he was abusive and controlling to the end. If her parents had not paid for the divorce expenses, he would have bankrupted her quickly with all the times he tried to change things.  I‚Äôm not sure if I should feel bad for thinking, ‚ÄúWould it really be that bad if he‚Äôd follow through on all his threats to unalive himself?‚Äù It was his go-to method to guilt her to return when he‚Äôd beat her and she would leave. He tried it again when she left for the last time, again when she filed for divorce, and every time she made a reasonable request through her lawyer. She changed all her contact info and cut off anyone who still called themselves mutual friends, because he continued to make these threats even after the divorce was finalized.  She initially decided she just wants to ‚Äúhave fun,‚Äù  ‚Äúsee what‚Äôs out there,‚Äù and ‚Äúmake up for lost time.‚Äù And I‚Äôm not going to judge her because she met her ex when she was 18 and he was 35, she didn‚Äôt know what lovebombing was, and he spent the last 14 years telling her she‚Äôs ugly and no one will ever want her because of that and she‚Äôs ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äù (he was her first, not that it makes his statement any less f-cked up)  Well she ended up having what was supposed to be two flings. Despite agreeing each time that it was NSA, these scrotes tried to treat her like a girlfriend without the security of the title! Asking to borrow money, wanting to spend ‚Äúquality‚Äù time together on the weekend (yard work. One of them wanted her to come over and do yard work!), expecting her to act as their human appointment keeper.

dswzqmkd	I used to have a friend that is a forever girlfriend, now a single mother.  &#x200B;  You read about them on here, but when you meet one it's jarring. The desperation oozing from the woman who "playfully" negs her boyfriend over when they're getting married in front of his mother.   * Got her pregnant * Didn't marry her * 10 years pass * Still didn't marry her * He gets her pregnant again * Still didn't marry her * He ups and leaves in the middle of the night, saying he doesn't love her anymore and now he's a drunkard sleeping on mommy's couch * He ups and leaves her with a little girl and a 6 month old baby  You could always tell he didn't love her, the way they interacted. Something about the emptiness and regret in his eyes stuck out like a sore thumb. His reasons being that she bullied him. What did he say, that was so bad?  &#x200B;  Told him to clean up after himself, told him to stop spending money like he was rich (spend 4k on marvel toys all at once), told him he needs to help with the kids, he needs to get help for his alcoholism (fun story, one time he got wasted and asked his brothers if they wanted to take turns with his gf) and so on..I wanted to tell her something, but how do you tell them bluntly, "We could all tell. The second he didn't marry you when you first found out you were pregnant was the first red flag." without hurting feelings?   &#x200B;  If he strings you along for YEARS and you are both under the age of 25 then THROW HIM AWAY. When a man loves you, he will do everything and anything for you. I had a male coworker admit all of this to me. He talked about this woman he was obsessed with. She already had a boyfriend, but apparently he was "Abusive, lame. Didn't dress. Didn't deserve her. I could make her so much happier." typical suspicious incel talk. He told me: "I don't care if it's 30 years down the line and I'm married. If she hit me up I would immediately divorce my wife and go to her. I don't give a fuck." So you date around just to have a warm body? "Yeah pretty much. Other girls are like, whatever. But the second she tells me she wants me I'm dumping anyone for her." This guy deserves his own thread actually, but it ain't about him.   &#x200B;  DON'T LET A MAN STRING YOU ALONG.	1643157554.0	scslv8	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scslv8/a_forever_girlfriend_i_met/	A forever girlfriend I met
75lug	I personally really enjoy the book/ movie "The Joy Luck Club". I'm watching it tonight for the first time in years and there's a scene about one of the daughters, Lena, being in a "50/50" relationship. I don't want to give any spoilers, but watching it now I very much appreciate this part and how they depict the 50/50 lifestyle from a female perspective.  It helps me feel like women before us were just as sick of it as we are.	1643158444.0	scsx71	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scsx71/5050_is_bs/	50/50 is B.S.

6j9az56s	Y‚Äôall I just saw the worst pickme that I have EVER seen in my life. I am disgusted. They have been together for 20 YEARS, engaged for 15 years, they have 3 kids, 2 houses, own a business and she is ‚Äúsuing‚Äù him for $4,800 for not marrying her. In place of a wedding she is suing him so she can have a BachelorKnot party since they‚Äôre not getting married since he doesn‚Äôt want to. He has a counterclaim on the show of $2,300 for her because she lost the ring in 2007. She started and failed planning the wedding in 2005, 2008, 2013, 2017, and 2021.    The guy is pleading for his life trying to explain why he desperately doesn‚Äôt want to marry her and she‚Äôs begging him.  I don‚Äôt know whether to laugh or cry. I can‚Äôt imagine how d!ckmatized you have to be to go on national television and beg a man to marry you.  Steve tells him in the end the guy is the stupidest man he has ever met and ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been drinking the milk without buying the cow.‚Äù I won‚Äôt spoil his judgement for anyone who wants to watch but the entire segment was just one giant embarrassment on display.  If you care to watch, it‚Äôs the first 15 minutes of Judge Steve Harvey, Season 1, Episode 2 found here:  https://abc.com/shows/judge-steve-harvey/episode-guide/season-01/02-stuck-on-stupid	1643167696.0	scw3zh	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scw3zh/woman_goes_on_judge_steve_harvey_to_sue_fianc√©_of/	Woman goes on Judge Steve Harvey to ‚Äúsue‚Äù fianc√© of 15+ years for not marrying her.
5m71g9rq	Just wanted to make a quick post for awareness. I was just made aware of this and I don't know if this is widely known yet.  Check out one of the many websites by scrotecasters Fresh & Fit. They're a pretty forgettable dumbass duo and their motto is something like teaching guys how to get as much sex as they want and circumvent "female manipulation". Basically, they believe that it's some kind of scientific fact that women are resource hoarders and men only want sex and it's their job to teach men how to keep their resources and get sex by negging and deceiving women.  Long story short, there is a shockingly high amount of FDS lingo they use while describing pick-up artist and red-pill strategies, such as "how to make yourself a high value male" and the description is basically neg her and refuse to give her your shit unless you get what you want out of her, even then you can choose to not give her your shit. They're making money with misogyny courses. Trust me when I say these guys are absolutely the bumbest they come too. It's concerning to think about how even more insidious men are educating themselves on our strategies and actively thinking of ways to circumvent  them.  This may not be that surprising but I found it a bit disconcerting. Because (1) FDS is working and so it's making waves (2) the waves involve scrotes waking up to the fact that their narcissistic traits will not be tolerated anymore (3) retaliation in many forms, including claiming this language and trying to drive power away from us through confusion and appropriation.   I just wanted to urge everyone to be weary of guys who have started using this language. Vet, vet, vet and trust no one unless you're given clear and reliable reasons to.	1643169312.0	scwn55	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scwn55/warning_some_redpill_guys_have_started_adopting/	Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è Some red-pill guys have started adopting FDS lingo

b5i0o4qm	Part I [https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scmda6/who\_else\_make\_money\_from\_all\_of\_except\_the\_women/](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/scmda6/who_else_make_money_from_all_of_except_the_women/)  about onlyfans  When I was in school, I received a message on fb if I want to do web cam for some euro per month? I ignored. At the end of the semester a 9! grade girl was exposed on our local site (what was some kind of wall of shame ) for doing webcam with another older girl. Nobody put the question what this public shame site post cp, how happened that a platform allowed underage girls on it, did they was groomed etc, no! the girls where shamed and shamed for years.  So who are making the real money?   1. Landlords! A web cam model is working and may be living in a studio with another girls, in this studio are all tools, backgrounds and security guy. Everything is payed by their work.  2. Studio personal : agent (pimp) who recruit, security, "secretary " the girls may not know how to speak english so it's a person who type all the messages in chat.  3. Platforms. They pay a percent or a small part from transactions .  4. In my previous post i mentioned how 3d party men make money on OF girls.  Same men but on biggest scale.   \-A platform with cams have tens of mirror sites/clone sites where is re-translation  of what happens on main site. only real thing are the money transactions.  + they have a lot of adds for gambling, dating sites, more sites with p\*rn and cam girls. Girls got payed only from main site transactions, not the whole.  \-fully fake platforms that aren't affiliate with "main" one. A variant is to employ girls who do SW, to film them for hours, different outfits. And here comes the power of editing, so a platform would look real, with real time models but it's are all recordings.  \-p\*rn platforms from uploading the whole streams  \- Men create fake profiles on different sites, to scam another men for money, they crop and edit pics/video, find a lot of similar girls so they could mimic a real person posting. Basically a copy of OF activity.    With development of technology, AI, tons of materials available my prediction is that we would soon have tons of content with generated faces and bodies and real women will need to compete with them for a few tokens.     Also one important aspect and main argument in my part of the world for legalization is abuse from police. Police - are the biggest beneficiary of illegal SW. They are the pimps, they are the ones who got payed by pimps to not arrest them, in countries where sw isn't penal but administrative case (smoking near kids, traverse on red the street, litter) the "individuals" without the ties and cover from police got frequent arrests, during this arrests they got worst treatment possible.  So instead of pushing the police reform, they push for legalization of selling women. If it would be legal the police will happily handle the millions that they make to state budged and we will have more school and hospitals! Nobody will find ways for not paying taxes, nobody will need to pay the police for "protection". No more massage salons with trafficked girls form asia who don't speak local language. No more african students who got invited at job and got in s$x prison. Legalization will solve this problems, sure. Not the reforms and purges of system, not the mass education and new work places, not the equal pay.	1643180612.0	sczxrk	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sczxrk/who_else_make_money_from_sw_except_the_women_ii/	Who else make money from SW except the women II .

62k0o5j3	Just a quick note - my friends are all serious pick-me‚Äôs. I am also a rehabilitated pick-me. I grew up believing that I should give up everything for my man, he can watch porn, he can have many female friends, he can earn less money than me, we can be 50-50, all of it. FDS turned all of my beliefs upside down, and changed me for the better.  I dated a porn-addicted scrote in 2020 long-distance, who was broke, mentally unstable, short, and manipulative. After posting a vomit-inducting pick-me post on Reddit, an FDS member copied my post and all the members ridiculed me and tagged me in it. I was humiliated and angry. I posted garbage about FDS for a while, but after lurking on FDS, their posts spoke to me, and hovered in my head. I slowly realized this guy was LV. I ended things with him, still offering to be friends, where he ghosted me soon after because he could not get sex or nudes out of me. FDS changed my life.  Since that experience I‚Äôve deleted my dating apps and want to be single until my late 20s or possibly 30s. Don‚Äôt care about my biological clock. My friends can‚Äôt take it, I speak negative about men all the time. I have an abusive, nvm narcissist father. A lot of men in my family are lvm.  My brother is slowly turning into a narcissist. I simply don‚Äôt see enough about good men. I don‚Äôt. Especially not in my personal life. There are examples online and in history, but I‚Äôve never met a good example - at least not well enough to confidently call them a HVM. So when my friends remind me ‚ÄúnOt aLL MeN‚Äù after crying about abusive boyfriends and fathers, I find it hard to believe them.   One friend even told me I was jaded. JADED. I‚Äôm jaded because I want to protect my womb, earn money, live peacefully, look beautiful and be FREE because I don‚Äôt want a deadbeat LVM latching onto me??? Wow.   I don‚Äôt know how my friends go about with their lives, constantly crying about some ugly guy on OLD they knew for a month who ghosts them. I don‚Äôt want to suffer with them. Yes, when I date again, I‚Äôll have to sift through the garbage. But thanks to FDS I‚Äôll be kicking them to the curb if I get the ick or see red flags.	1643184227.0	sd0uw1	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd0uw1/my_friends_keep_telling_me_not_all_men/	My friends keep telling me, ‚Äúnot all men.‚Äù
7tlxpbtr	I'm working in the health care. I have a senior colleague who is brilliant in what he does and was respectful towards us, juniors. But once he came to know that I left my psychologically abusive husband, that senior is completely flipped now. He just can't stand me, can't even look at me.  He was greatly Benifetted at work from my collaboration. But the things are different now. Though I miss his vast knowledge about the work, I am so disappointed with his uncouth and immature behavior.	1643184539.0	sd0xf2	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd0xf2/an_observation/	An observation

172w3bkm	I am curious to hear if any of you ladies experienced the same.     I was placed on a pedestal. Yes, I was idealized, devalued, and discarded.   Nothing was ever his fault. He would pin the blame on everyone else but himself.   He rose his voice at me, he escalated verbal disagreements until it became abuse.   He wanted me to revolve around his schedule, frequently visiting me when he was free but when I tried to coordinate with him, he got upset and impatient. He kept tabs on me by coming to my place randomly, angry when I wasn't there. One time, he got mad at how sexually frustrated he was and said to not give him oral anymore because it wasn't pleasurable to him. He hated when I wore revealing clothing. He didn't want me to have male friends. He was wary of them. So many double standards. He never tried explaining the complexities of Desi culture to American culture. When I voiced my concerns how my boundaries were being encroached upon, he would not listen. He called me a "needy piece of shit" and "controlling as hell" when he got furious with me. Cycle of abuse was recurrent, with the honeymoon and devaluing. Walked on eggshells, never knowing what or when he was going to be upset. Withdrew affection from me when he got into his negative "moods."  &#x200B;  Quite frankly, I was treated as a possession. His property. And it did not feel good. I was insecure and anxiously attached as hell.	1643185209.0	sd134o	/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/comments/sd134o/ladies_who_have_dated_desi_or_muslim_how_did_the/	Ladies who have dated Desi or Muslim, how did the misogyny affect how you were treated in the relationship?
