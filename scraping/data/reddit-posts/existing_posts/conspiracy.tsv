d1y9cit2	I’m a 4th year electrical engineering student at a university in Ontario, Canada. I have 2 semesters left to get my degree and be done with it. They changed the vaccination policy for the winter semester so you are no longer permitted to attend on-campus if you are unvaxxed and without an exemption, not even if you get tested every 3 days. They have medical and creed exemption forms. I have to submit one by January 24. We are returning to in-person lectures at the end of this month. I don’t think I can do anything with the medical one since Drs here push the vaccine regardless of your conditions or they may lose their medical license.   The remaining option is exemption due to creed/religion. I basically have to explain why I am unable to be vaccinated due to my religion/creed and provide background on the creed and connect the belief to why I am requesting and exemption. Also, I can involve a religious leader in this form to sign me off for the exemption. This is under “Section 1 of the Ontario Human Rights Code.” They might contact me for additional information.  What concerns me is at the bottom of this form is an attestation where one of the points is “I understand that not every belief, opinion, expression, practice or matter of conscience is a creed under the Ontario Human Rights Code.”   Basically, I have never heard of an exemption request that didn’t get rejected. The classes I need to take do not have an online option as my program is relatively small. To make things worse, most people in this city are hardcore liberals and I doubt anyone in my classes is also against mandatory vaccination. I have no idea what to do and I feel alone and violated. I went through hell with this program and the thought of throwing away all the years of effort and suffering leaves me feeling devastated.   If anyone was able to get an approved exemption PLEASE let me know how you did it or of any advice your can offer.	1642781885.0	s9ednu	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9ednu/has_anyone_been_able_to_successfully_get_a/	Has anyone been able to successfully get a vaccine exemption at an Ontario University?

If you click on any of the individual age ranges, the Fully Vaccinated line is a flat line at the bottom of the graph.  Then I noticed that the x-axis cuts off on October 24th for all age ranges.

4dcktoad	After having just finished watching the "Sons of Sam" documentary on Netflix I became really interested in continuing Maury Terrys work on the investigation.  If anyone hasn't heard of this documentary or the Son of Sam killer (aka .44 caliber killer) from New York in the 70s  I highly recommend it watching it on Netflix.   It's made me realize how there very well could be a cult that exists in today's society similar to the one investigated by Maury Terry. I've never read his book but I plan on possibly getting a copy to see if there are any leads I could find on a Satanic cult that exists today. Also doing some research online...  At the end of the day everything comes down to a constant war between good and evil. And exposing the evil in the world should be our job as people who claim to be on the "good side". If anyone is interested in this case and want to actually try and connect any of it to current events that would be great!  I know it's pretty far fetched to say this but it is possible. We all know there's more going on behind the scenes so why not try to find out what/who exactly is involved.	1642782321.0	s9ejnl	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9ejnl/the_ultimate_evil/	The Ultimate Evil

kujlxei	Was waiting to post this until I was sure, but title pretty much explains it. I started seeing this girl a while back and she is pretty pro vax. I don’t understand it but in an effort to be supportive I took her in to get her booster and hold her hand. She got it and felt okay for the whole day, we hung out and we were close to each other the whole time, kissing and all. She was fine for a few days but then started developing symptoms. I tested myself with an at home test out of curiosity on Wednesday morning, came back negative, and she went to a drive up testing facility. She wasn’t feeling good so I went and brought her soup. Gave her a hug and a kiss on the forehead and left. Her results came in positive and since I was in close contact with her I just tested again about 30 minutes ago with another at home test.   Still negative… what’s going on? Starting to feel like this may be the biggest scam ever pulled off. Question remains. Why the shots? Why 100% vaccination with threats, if they not only don’t work, but can actually give you the virus?  Or maybe I just have a really strong immune system… idfk. Feels immensely sketchy.

5l5go993	This is just my personal opinion at the moment. It feels like they’re toying around with us. The government has been posting two opposite narratives in the MSM. Why would they do that?

70plyfip	This is pretty straightforward if you think about it.  A huge concern has been the amount of "baby boomers" that would be collecting social security soon that the government wouldn't be able to pay.  In addition, in the united states especially, a ton of people get put on insanely expensive treatment that they literally never pay back or owe because they die.  These sick people also get paid out the most insurance payments.  What's a simple solution?  Release covid and get rid of a few million of the most unhealthy people.  And in case you haven't realized, they've already done that.	1642784596.0	s9ffe6	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9ffe6/covid_was_part_of_the_depopulation_agenda_and/	Covid was part of the depopulation agenda and they already succeeded

5wvptdhw	-- okay hold onto your butts --  So the real worry about 5G is that it does in fact have the ability to have an increase in radiation through its waveband frequency.  It's proven they can turn up the dial.. kind of like a speedometer in a car, you can push it 120+ MPH but you rarely go past 60 MPH..   Okay, so 'they' increase the range frequency up and down little by little over time... which cause symptoms at close range. Sure, but you're never standing next to one all day, what do you care right?  Well here's the kicker.. like 99% of all spam calls are fake themselves and come from the same global phone farming agencies.. that's right there is no actual company that wants to extend your car warranty.. those numbers they leave, if they aren't cut off in the message are dead ends to no real source..  They are sent to you on purpose in a pattern to increase the radiation you receive from your phone. Phones light up like a Christmas tree with small band radiation every time a call comes in.   So why do some days you get no spam calls and others you get 8 in a day? An algorithm set to increase a radiation blanket to all cell phones.  You could even say they target some areas and specific people too..	1642785059.0	s9flno	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9flno/spam_calls_are_making_you_sick/	Spam Calls are making you sick

It's proven they can turn up the dial.. kind of like a speedometer in a car, you can push it 120+ MPH but you rarely go past 60 MPH..   Okay, so 'they' increase the range frequency up and down little by little over time... which cause symptoms at close range. Sure, but you're never standing next to one all day, what do you care right?  Well here's the kicker.. like 99% of all spam calls are fake themselves and come from the same global phone farming agencies.. that's right there is no actual company that wants to extend your car warranty.. those numbers they leave, if they aren't cut off in the message are dead ends to no real source..  They are sent to you on purpose in a pattern to increase the radiation you receive from your phone. Phones light up like a Christmas tree with small band radiation every time a call comes in.   So why do some days you get no spam calls and others you get 8 in a day? An algorithm set to increase a radiation blanket to all cell phones.

caq5aau	Ghislaine Maxwell is probably going to go free because apparently members of the jury commented badly about her before the trial.  NATO claims Russia is planning false flag attacks in Europe.   Media in NATO countries claimed that Russia is putting bounty on NATO soldiers Iraq and Afghanistan to make the west look weak.   USA is trying to put sanctions on Nord Stream gas pipeline.  CIA and blackwater are trying to cover up war crimes in Syria.  Big tech claims their fact checkers are basically opinion pieces. Similarly, mainstream news network often claims their news shows are 'basically fictional characters like Stephen Colbert'.  &#x200B;  ====  Amazon covered up deaths of several workers due to 'heart attack' or other health related issues in 2020 and 2021. Some say three workers died, some say the number can be up to a dozen.   We don't yet know if those workers were suffering from covid19, heart problem and bad working condition or vaccine side-effects. Amazon is the biggest company in the world, pretty good with covering up.  Amazon also forced workers to stay in a warehouse in middle of a hurricane, warehouse collapsed then workers got killed. They probably not gonna get any repercussion, conspiracy theorists even say that they gonna get funding from the government to build back better bunkers.  &#x200B;  ====  Are these news somehow connected?  What if big tech actually wants to cover up upcoming false flags? 'Censorship', 'deplatforming' or more correctly, 'shadow banning' is happening, but why? Maybe their end goal is to cover up next false flags?  Social media companies say they don't secretly block reach of a tweet, they don't 'Shadow Ban'. If their algorithm decides to block the reach of a tweet for some reason, it will announce it publicly.  But are they are lying?  Because the hated one is a youtuber who claimed that after he made a video about Australian plan to break encryption, youtube was ordered by some Australian deep state agency to secretly reduce the reach of the video.  Also, journalist Vicky Ward made a documentary called Chasing Ghislaine where she claimed Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein might be child trafficking on behalf of Mossad. People are not getting banned for calling Ghislaine Mossad on social media, usually their tweets are getting low visibility than usual.  'Maxwell trial leaker' was a twitter page which was apparently restricted or deleted by twitter because of the page linked Mossad with child trafficking.  Note that mainstream news media like BBC is actually keen on defending Ghislaine Maxwell. BBC invites Maxwell's brother to portray Ghislaine as a victim etc.  Slightly off topic, Cynthia Mckinney accused Mossad to help child trafficking in the USA a decade ago. She was also 'deplatformed'.  &#x200B;  ====  So that's why I am thinking, what's the end goal of all these big tech censorship? Is it possible big tech is planning something? Maybe trying to preemptively cover up false flag attacks to start war against Russia and Iran?  USS Liberty was attacked by Israel, official story was Israel didn't identify the ship properly. However some survivors claimed that Israel just wanted to start false flag attack into incite USA vs Egypt war.  Able Danger program is linked to 9/11. Colonel Anthony Shaffer claimed CIA covered up/outright deleted many data to protect false flags and Bin Laden connection(not his exact words). However he was humiliated and his carrier was over after blowing the whistle.  Now, what if big tech is distracting from upcoming cover ups? Food for thought.	1642786126.0	s9g099	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9g099/do_you_have_the_feeling_that_falseflagww3_is/	Do you have the feeling that false-flag-WW3 is looming in and you can't stop it?

9chak7hs	I work in Big Tech, most of my coworkers are addicted to social media, constantly face masked, double vaxxed and boosted nonstop regurgitating the narrative.  I have been here for years and have a reputation in my department as being "an angry conspiracy theorist" and "having a problem with authority", I do not fit in here ... but I work my balls off, and am really good at what I do.  So I am overhearing a couple of co workers talking about New York, and why so many New Yorkers are buying property around where I live. I brought up the Vaccine laws, and mentioned the 9 year old in NY who got arrested for not having a vaccine passport.  They both look at me and in unison "well she should have had it" and they look at each other and giggle at the fact they both said the same thing. (yes they are a gay/trans married couple extremely SJW) One of them mentions that "people who don't take the vaccine shouldn't be allowed in grocery stores or bars"  I respond "I thought you two were anti fascist."  Their demeanor changed entirely. One of them goes off:  "A deadly disease is killing millions, we all need to get vaxxed, Its not fascism, its the least you could do. People who aren't vaxxed shouldn't even be allowed in hospitals unless they are getting the vax... Like, if I get to the hospital and an unvaxxed person gets there at the same time , they better see me first or that's bullshit"  My response "The reasons you both are there is more important than anything when determining who gets seen first. What you said is the same as saying you want the unvaxxed to die"  His response "I do"  In that moment something truly glorious happened - His supervisor entered the convo with "I'm, unvaxxed."  Greatest deer in headlights look ever. "w-why not?" he asked legit terrified.  "Because it doesn't do anything. You can still get and spread covid after you're vaxxed. Besides I already had covid. So why would I get vaxxed when I have the antibodies?"  "I don't know" one of them answered in a confused tone.  I jump in again - "Studies from the UK are showing that people who are vaxxed dying at a much higher rate than unvaxxed." and I mentioned UK is getting rid of masks, and vaccine mandates in a couple weeks  A few moment later I overhear one of them say to the other "Oh shit. They were right"  The other responds "Why are they mandating it then?"  "I would say fascism, but maybe you prefer totalitarianism" I respond - Their supervisor has a mini laugh attack.  I then overheard the two them have a conversation about how "the angry conspiracy theorist in sales was actually right"  &#x200B;  I edited some of the grammar because I typed this really quick at work between meetings and found some typos....	1642788150.0	s9gscm	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9gscm/a_truly_beautiful_thing_just_happened_at_work/	A truly beautiful thing just happened at work
g8d4mnng	[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQlYoREuGLQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQlYoREuGLQ)  There is no "we". There is no Republican/ Democrat. There is only us and them. They live under completely different rules than those oppressive laws they’ve created to subdue us. As they drive us into total obedience through their web of systems, while stealing vast quantities of energy produced from our labor (and now our data), you become infinitely poorer. This makes them wealthy beyond comprehension, both through taxation rule making, and inflation labor theft. For them to continue to rule, they need the majority to perceive exactly what you perceive. Fox will continue to use psychology to mold the crystalized brains of the right wing to think conservatively. CNN will continue to nurture its enlightened following with propaganda to elevate the left into thinking liberally. While we fight over ideological bullshit, often inadequately described as fascist or communist thinking, they enslave us all, and live unimaginably extravagant lives provided by a "cheap as possible" slave labor force. The European banksters have made numerous, seemingly never-ending attempts, to gain control over the American Empire. Ever since our pappies told them to go “fuck off” during the Boston Tea Party of 1773. Well, they succeeded with total control 50 years ago, and most people don’t even know how it happened. Here is a brief history that may help you think outside of the Emerald Cities Pyramid Prison Walls, and help you understand why silver shoes glide so smoothly along the yellow brick road:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15V2-dt1w9A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15V2-dt1w9A)  **1.)** 1773 (No President) - Tea Act Of 1773 – This act was created to bail out the Rothschild owned East India Tea Company, who monopolized the tea industry in America. The Rothschilds wanted to raise taxes on the American colonies and take all the money for themselves. All because their business was going bankrupt in England, probably because they were buying all their family members the most extravagant palaces ever created in human history. The Boston Tea Party occurred by the gangsters of old, our Grand Pappies broke into all of the docked Rothschild ships, then dumped all their tea into the water. No taxation without representation mother fuckers... Rothschilds!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiBUGlt7hqo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiBUGlt7hqo)  **FREEDOM FROM EUROPEAN BANKING CONTROL BEGINS IN 1776**  **2.)** 1776 (George Washington) - 1st Civil War - America declares independence from the English banksters because of how pissed the Rothschilds got due to Grand Pappy dumping all their tea out. We don't want your shitty things Rothschilds. We’ll just send Benjamin Franklin to France to borrow money from the French Rothschilds, while we tell Washington to kick the English Rothschilds asses. After the War, we basically told France to go fuck off, we’re not paying you back, and only paid back the Dutch. I do have a soft spot for those wooden shoes wearing, dike building mother fuckers. Gotta love them dikes. The French got their money, after a few decades [**😎**](https://emojipedia.org/smiling-face-with-sunglasses/)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9I6B3c-u8E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9I6B3c-u8E)  **3.)** 1812 (James Madison-D) – War Of 1812 - The Banksters sent the entire British fleet… actually more like the Rothschild owned East India Tea Company’s fleet, to bombard Fort McHenry with cannon fire using over 200 war ships. All because the U.S. didn’t renew the 20 year charter for their Central Bank, The First Bank Of The United States, which our Grand Pappies told to go fuck off back in 1811. The Brits blasted the coast all night long with exploding cannon balls. The Star-Spangled Banner was written out of the destruction by a dude watching “the bombs bursting in air” from a British prisoner of war ship directly offshore. Fort McHenry's flag never fell, as the soldiers stacked their friends’ dead bodies alongside the flagpole to keep the flag flying. “Oh-oh say can you see...” Rothschilds.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxGNQE5ZLA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxGNQE5ZLA)  **4.)** 1835 (Andrew Jackson-D) - The Bank War - President Andrew Jackson vetoed the ability for The Second Bank Of The United States to create currency, which thwarted European banking control from the United States… again. They tried to kill his ass, but when the assassin pulled out his pistols, Jackson bitch slapped his ass with a cane and beat the dude into a bloody mess. Davy Crocket had to pull Jackson off before he killed the guy. Jackson had over 103 duels to his credit. Bringing duels back sure would level some corporate playing fields, but we have to demand our individual sovereignty back first... Rothschilds.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLXt5NBZds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDLXt5NBZds)  **EUROPEAN BANKING ELITES REGAIN CONTROL IN 1865**  **5.)** 1865 (Abraham Lincoln-R) - Lincoln said no, I ain’t taking you’re high interest loans, you European banker fucks. You’re not controlling me. Instead, I’m creating the Green Back (interest free currency) to pay for shit. And then, I’m creating the Secret Service to protect my ass and my new money. He did too. Created the Secret Service on April 14, 1865. European banksters didn’t like that shit. Dude went to the movies and got snipered the next day on April 15, 1865. Assassination successful. This is the beginning of European Banking control over the U.S., and they even gained control of the newly created Secret Service too. Fucking vampires.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWRONWtSGLY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWRONWtSGLY)  **6.)** 1873 (Ulysses Grant-R) - The Crime Of 1873 – What is up with these European bankers? Dudes stopped miners from being able to take their silver to the mint for free. Stopped silver dollars from getting created too. This set the stage for a single metal standard in gold, and began the attack on silver. Banksters.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ6gYt6SxyM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJ6gYt6SxyM)  **7.)** 1893 (Grover Cleveland-D) - Panic Of 1893 - Sherman Silver Act of 1890 caused silver to plummet in purchasing power, which then caused the railroads to fail, and then caused 20% unemployment. JP Morgan and the Rothschilds loaned the US Government shit loads of money to mortgage the country to them. Great job Cleveland!  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBZmp4vbkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbBZmp4vbkI)  **8.)** 1913 (Woodrow Wilson-D) - Federal Reserve Act/ The Revenue Act - With the country in debt to JP Morgan and the Rothschilds, leverage was created to take over the mortgaged US monetary system through the Federal Reserve, create an income tax, and establish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This is the year we lost sovereignty and the banksters took control of our labor fruits leaving us with nothing but fucking debt. People instantly became indentured servants to the banksters and freedom became a thing of the past.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AuoCww6Dtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AuoCww6Dtw)  **9.)** 1933 (Frankin Roosevelt-D) - Executive Order 6102 – This fucker stole all the gold. The US confiscates its citizens gold, as the mortgaged US probably had to pay its mortgagors. Banksters probably told old Franky boy that they owned the people now, so make them give us their gold, and the fucker did. Took it all.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyOW\_9n2F80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyOW_9n2F80)  **10.)** 1944 (Franklin Roosevelt-D) - Bretton Woods Agreement – Banksters got together when they were sure which side was gonna win, then made all the countries peg their currencies to the mortgaged United States dollar that the European Banking elite controlled. This way they could control all the countries currencies by manipulating the dollar. Probably would have made all the countries tie their currencies to Nazi marks if that side won, as they controlled Germany too.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOEAtz8-7hM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOEAtz8-7hM)  **11.)** Establishment of Key Organizations  1944 - World Bank established  1944 - IMF established  1945 - UN established  1945 - Food and Agriculture Organization established  1945 - UNESCO established  1947 - CIA established  1948 - Israel conquered  1948 - WHO established  1952 - NSA established  1954 - Bilderberg meetings established  1956 - INTERPOL established  1957 - International Atomic Energy Association established  1960 - OPEC established  1961 - World Food Programme established  1968 - Club of Rome established  1968 - LEAA established  1971 - World Economic Forum established  1971 - Gold Standard abolished  1971 - War on drugs created  1973 - DEA established  1973 - Trilateral Commission established  *“The Rockefeller Foundation played an important role in the transition from the League of Nations to the United Nations through its collaboration with two international organisations. The first was the Economic, Financial and Transit Department (EFTD) of the LoN. By financing its move to the United States and all of its work during the Second World War, the RF would allow it to make a major contribution to the reorganisation of the global economic order after 1945. The second organisation was the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), which the RF provided with staff, working methods, and a network of contacts around the world. The RF was thus deeply involved in the redefinition of the overall structure of the system of international organisations during WWII”*  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cJFjLoiSOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cJFjLoiSOc)  **12.)** 1963 (John Kennedy-D) - Executive Order 11110 – JFK said fuck the Secret Societies, then returned power to congress to create monetary notes. Called them “United States Notes” not “Federal Reserve Notes”, thereby stripping the Federal Reserve's power to loan money to the Government at interest. Created $4 billion worth. Banksters did not like Kennedy's attempt to re-establish freedom for the people of America. Assassination successful.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zR9Nqft5aQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zR9Nqft5aQ)  **13.)** 1965 (Lyndon Johnson-D) Federal Reserve established its dominance over the Presidency by not succumbing to Johnsons orders to lower interest rates, but the Fed said no, and raised interest rates anyway. Johnson backed down and the FED won. Pussy.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3tvaSSJoyI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3tvaSSJoyI)  **14.)** 1967 (Lyndon Johnson-D) Afroyim Vs. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 – Seems smart not to let dual citizens serve in government. Makes you wonder where their loyalties lie. Supreme court said fuck it, and changed shit in 1967 with a 5-4 vote, that’s for sure. Made it to where Americans could have dual citizenship, and those people can even hold power positions. Gangsters in other countries taking over our government? You decide.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDFsyNbEJvk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDFsyNbEJvk)  **PLANETARY ENSLAVEMENT BEGINS IN 1971**  **15.)** 1971 A (Richard Nixon-R) - Executive Order 11615 – This dude and his German gangster friend ‘Kissinger’ ended the entire metallic monetary system. Said screw it, we’ll just pay people paper and buy whatever the fuck we want with it. Afterall, it doesn’t cost anything to make, and since all the other currencies are pegged to the dollar, we’ll have total control of all global currencies by only having to control one. Knuck knuck knuck! It also gives us the ability to raise the Federal Funds rate to astronomical heights and begin filtering the interest payments away from US citizens and to the Fed owners… European Royalty through banking ownership, and all the globalist dual citizens that magically appeared after 1967… Ain’t that right Kissinger, you brilliant warrior you?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh163n1lJ4M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sh163n1lJ4M)  **16.)** 1971 B (Richard Nixon-R) - Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) created - Two weeks after ending the metallic monetary system to make America poorer and our Royal elitists richer, Nixon went on the news and said Vietnam ain’t enough war, we’re going to war with the American people too, and created the war on drugs. This was the beginning of enslaving the American people through bondage and eradicating that bullshit Constitution. Bondaged slave labors’ prison population at this time was 197,245 total slaves. It is of note to recognize that Old Klaus Schwabby also created the World Economic Forum in 1971… Fucking Nazis man.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tge4Ag5OPZ8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tge4Ag5OPZ8)  **17.)** 1973 A (Richard Nixon-R) - The DEA was established to militarize the police force. No knock warrants were created to put large dents in the 4th Amendment, and mandatory minimum sentencing requirements were pumped into law. This is the beginning of the Mortgaged US Corporation providing its subsidiary corporations with unlimited slave labor through the prison system. Time to get those drugs growing so we can get that free labor.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhEo9lRuKVI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhEo9lRuKVI)  1**8.)** 1973 B (Richard Nixon-R) - The Private Depository Trust Company founded (DTC), later also known as Cede & Co. People no longer own publicly traded companies, fuck man, we don’t even own ourselves no more. Neither do other countries either. The fucking DTC owns all the publicly traded companies in 131 other countries too. They even own your original birth certificate, making you property of DTC. At least they’re nice enough to allow us peasants to obtain contractual obligations of publicly traded companies through rental of shares though. That’s nice.  Cede Definition: To give up (power or territory).  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Uk0C8W2M0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-Uk0C8W2M0)  **19.)** 1982 (Ronald Reagan-R) - Trickle Down Economics - The Federal Reserve said fuck it, let’s take it all, then raised interest rates to a peak of 20%. This gave shitloads of money to the banksters. Then they lowered the top tax rate from 70% down to 28% to make their rich friends super fucking rich too, while making the poor even poorer. They even had the balls to not raise the minimum wage after all that shit. Only admin in history to do that. Afterall, making the poor poorer will help in increasing the bondaged slave labor force.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g5HlVwPPrM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8g5HlVwPPrM)  **20.)** 1984 (Ronald Reagan-R) - The "Comprehensive Crime Control Act". This shit here got rid of “innocent before proven guilty”. Made the “war on drugs” propaganda go mainstream too. D.A.R.E, let’s fry some eggs, call them a brain, and tell them it’s their brain on drugs. Then we can use the CIA to fly in a bunch of coke from Columbia and Nicaragua, and have people out in Cali cook into crack. After that we’ll have our crack epidemic and we can broadcast it throughout the country. The slaves will pour into the dungeons now.  Bondaged slave labor population  1971 - 197,245 total slaves  1985 - 742,579 incarcerated slaves  1985 - 2,147,570 slaves under state controlled indentured servitude  1985 - 3,011,500 total slaves (3% of all U.S. Adult Males in America)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx0iLwZYMog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yx0iLwZYMog)  **21.)** 1994 (Bill Clinton-D) - "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act" - Time to make the kids slaves too. Biden and the Clintons said let’s make the kids look like super predators too. With the help of the media, they convinced America that kids needed mandatory minimum sentencing. What the fuck right? Three strikes and you’re a slave for life. This enabled the banksters slave labor force to go from under 200,000 in 1971 to over 5 million in 1995.  Bondaged slave labor population:  1971 - 197,245 total slaves  1995 - 1,585,401 incarcerated slaves  1995 - 3,671,771 citizens under state controlled indentured servitude  1995 - 5,357,800 total slaves (5% of all U.S. Adult Males in America)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rUTbdicays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3rUTbdicays)  **22.)** 2001 (George Bush-R) – The Patriot Act – The day before our towers were attacked, Donald Rumsfeld said that he couldn’t find $2.3 Trillion from the Pentagon Budget. Kathy Fitts said it was $4 Trillion, not 2.3 Donny boy. Dude even called the Pentagon “an adversary that poses a serious threat to the security of the United States…” The next day, the World Trade Center, the Pentagon’s financial offices, and all of both of their financial documents were blown the fuck up. This not only killed thousands of Americans, but also granted the banksters even more control over all of our lives. The 4th Amendment? What the fuck is that? Afterall, “if you’re not with us, you’re with the terrorists.” Right Bush?  Bondaged slave labor population:  1971 - 197,245 total slaves  2005 - 2,109,056 incarcerated slaves  2005 - 4,946,944 citizens under state controlled indentured servitude  2005 - 7,056,000 total slaves (7% of all U.S. Adult Males in America)  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6E6zZy0B5M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6E6zZy0B5M)  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  To Be Continued...	1642788185.0	s9gsy8	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9gsy8/a_little_history/	A Little History
33oec45b	These mechanisms work because there is a system or an equation that is constantly active. It's not the witch or tarot card reader making these predictions or readings of your past, present, or future, they are simply tapping into an already existing system.   A perfect example of this is sacred geometry. In every single lifeform on this planet there are patterns. Patterns that can be placed into a mathematical equation. This applies to each human and their consciousness. There's a mathematical equation for each person.   So when people who are sensitive to this "energy" or math see someone and "feel" the information about their future, they are able to feel the math at work showing what is happening to the person. I would even chop it up to being karmatic but in this case, karma deals in arithmetic.   I have met people who literally have touched me and saw my past. Stuff that you can't make up unless you lived it with me. So what I'm trying to say is that we walk around with this information at all times, it's not as secretive as we think.	1642788377.0	s9gvnn	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9gvnn/tarot_cards_and_all_other_spiritual_reading/	Tarot Cards and All Other Spiritual Reading Mechanisms Work...But Not Why You Think They Do.

v7yv4	As many of you are aware, procuring ammunition (9mm, 22lr, .45, .223 etc) has been a challenge and in some cases almost impossible without forking over a pretty penny. If you could find available stock it was usually limited to 2 boxes per caliber per person. At one point I called every store in the Willamette valley (Oregon) looking for availability, and 99/100 I’d come up empty. My wife and I would try to hit one of our local Bi-Marts right when the opened at 9am a few times a week and usually there were 10-20 waiting outside, all in search of the same thing.

slbr8so	Fact: The WHO and CDC has pushed vaccination being key across the globe since the pandemic started.    Fact:  they can legally say “the vaccines do not alter an individual’s DNA” and not be lying  Here’s where fact and what used to be fiction converge into a nefarious agenda:    “binding and cleavage protein Cas9 and a guide RNA (gRNA)” Cas9. TrueCut Cas9 Proteins are designed to deliver consistently high editing efficiency across a range of gene targets and cell types  Look at how vaccines are designed; know that CRISPR has made serious advancements which include transplanting a pig heart into a man ten or so days ago.  CRISPR was used to alter his DNA to remove the bodies foreign body rejection response that transplant recipients have had to control via medicine since transplants became a thing.    While the vaccine might not technically alter our DNA, it including various proteins that can via a software interface like CRISPR, has global implications.  I don’t even have to use my imagination.

55ygefmt	So back in April/May my boyfriend’s mother, a very healthy woman, had begun her 2 dose vaccination series. She died in October. Her cause of death was an obscure bacteria that, when in the blood stream, kills within 24 hours. They were told that it was likely from animal waste getting into a wound. People have died from it before, freak deaths occur all the time, it’s just how it is.   Here’s the problem: they never performed an autopsy even though the cause of death was uncertain and my boyfriend had explicitly asked that an autopsy be performed.   I was, unfortunately, scheduled to work on the day my boyfriend and his family went to speak with the mortician and I couldn’t get anyone to cover my shift. They were told that because of the bacteria, she was too decayed to have an autopsy performed so they had already pumped her full of formaldehyde without any sort of consent or even attempts at contact.   What?  I have spent my entire life with the understanding that if there’s a body, then an autopsy can be performed. Not to mention the fact that my boyfriend had discovered her body and, while she had been tense and cold (they estimated she had been gone for 7-8 hours), didn’t see any signs of decay. She was simply pallid, her extremities weren’t beginning to shift in color whatsoever. I find it hard to believe that she had begun to rapidly decay when they had her in a climate controlled morgue for a few days.   Immediately after the revelation that they could not and would not perform an autopsy, they mentioned that they were going to be covering the entire service; my boyfriend and his younger siblings would not have to pay a dime for the service or her cremation. Their father had passed away almost 3 years ago and the same morticians had made funeral arrangements for him, in case this is relevant. Perhaps I’m simply nihilistic, but knowing the morticians and their reputations (we live in a small town), I find it very hard to believe they would do something like this out of the goodness of their hearts since there was some profit to be made.   My boyfriend and his family were incredibly distraught and I believe that the morticians took advantage of their grief. No one had thought to question anything until they had already signed the cremations papers and left. There were a number of other factors including familial conflicts that made the situation at the funeral home more stressful than it needed to be, so I’m not angry with him for not asking questions and being outraged about the autopsy. I’m simply angry that they were taken advantage of and that we’ll never have answers.   How could they know for sure it was the bacteria that killed her if they didn’t conduct an autopsy? Isn’t it wrong to not conduct an autopsy in the event of an unexpected death with no clear cause of death? What if it was caused by environmental factors in the household that could be harming her children?  What if it’s the vaccination? Something is very wrong about the situation and I don’t even know what to think half the time. I just can’t shake the idea that they’re hiding something.	1642792905.0	s9ikyd	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9ikyd/i_genuinely_feel_that_the_vaccine_killed_my/	I genuinely feel that the vaccine killed my boyfriend’s mother

In the painting, God is depicted sitting within a brain passing life / knowledge onto Man. This we know. Now, take a look at his fingers on the child’s shoulder. To me, they are in the shape of the “Eye of Horace” which represents the pineal gland.   The child looks fearful. What is produced by fear? **Andrenicrome**  Synopsis: Throughout history, people have used the pure andrenicrome of children to feed their pineal glands to expand their mental capabilities.

He said in a slightly sarcastic tone "You should send this to the government" (probably assuming that I had pulled these out of my ass) I replied, "These ARE the government statistics" and provided him the link. His response was " The important thing about the vaccine is not how many people are contracting but rather how many people are ended up in the hospitals or dying". Knowing that I was dealing with a brainwashed shill I mentioned my concerns about 'antigenic imprinting' and simply left it at that and didn't argue, no point.

2mps5zcf	If you had at least 3 computers, quantum computers, or whatever the strongest PC to ever exists is and…  You set computer #1 to “the true beginning” time and  exact location coordinates…  You set computer #2 to Present Quantum  Synchronized Time. It must be aligned perfectly to its location in time and have the official exact present time.   You set computer #3 to exact location and time of ending of our whole solar system and/or also whole universal system (happen at different times and locations..cause/effect…)  Computer #4- random variable. Allows for travel into any time or location created by the energetic beginning/present/end quantum computers timeline(s). More can also be added in different times and locations as “bases” for easier travel.   Time works differently within computers, especially ones using powerful light speed forces. Sending a powerful like explosion signal from the very end/beginning point allows it to travel before it gets destroyed by void. It’s just quick enough to outrun itself and catches back up with itself and in a sense destroys or eats itself aka splitting itself apart to create matter and movement that allows new and more moving light matter life to exist.  In front of the “Energy” is the building future, which is getting actively rendered into existence to allow the present to exist.   Behind the “Energy” is nothingness where the  present begins to fall apart into the void no time, no space.   The Energy itself is present time and creates a sort of “magnetic energy force field” or what we perceive as the whole universe around itself as protection or “walls” that separate while also simultaneously defining past/present/future from each other.  It allows “energy” to move in something bigger than the universe itself…   It must move fast enough to catch its tail… The beginning is the end, the end is the beginning, which allows present to be exist. To be in two places at once, one has to fuze themselves where the fission is still occurring. Space Time Photos Particles full of Matter.   The Solar and/or universal “end” are each their own specific variables— which includes separate points, locations, and in times…   Some events trigger other major events so there are certain locations in specific times that are synchronized within a certain system that itself also synchronizes with other bigger surrounding systems…(like the creatures on Earth synchronize themselves with the sun/moon cycle and also their own “created time,” then earth is synchronized with the moon and sun within the solar system that the sun falls like a magnetic dip falls into allowing a “stable connection” and the whole solar system within the Milky Way and the Mikey way within the universe) where one can glitch, skip, alter, major events into a certain direction.  One could call it specific synchronized time/location “stepping stones” or a background/backbone structure that makes the present what it is…currently… is that what allows the universe to live forever, living creations desperately outrunning their demise by altering systems to fit their survival needs, which in turn allows the universe to be eternal…LIFE?	1642797327.0	s9k8x7	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9k8x7/time_traveling_computers_thoughts/	Time TravelIng Computers, Thoughts?

g2um074	Russia pushing to ban crypto mining and trading:  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/russia-s-fsb-tells-nabiullina-to-ban-crypto-to-defund-opposition](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/russia-s-fsb-tells-nabiullina-to-ban-crypto-to-defund-opposition)  Chinas existing ban on crypto mining and trading:  [https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history/](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/china-crypto-bans-a-complete-history/)  Both "enemy" nations of the US are working to destroy the US through similar means. Not only through crypto, but through our economy, stock market, and trust in institutions as well.  Through the metaverse or what they refer to as "space", they are affecting the price of cryptocurrencies through bans, restrictions, FUD, etc. Price manipulation and volatility has always been a worry for cryptos - now even moreso seeing these large nations outright banning the use of crypto.  Russia and China are also tanking our economies. Think Covid. Think lockdowns and inflation. Job loss and poverty. Transfer of wealth and division of people. They're orchestrating all of this through the media. Our biggest enemy. Prices will continue to rise, inflation will continue to impact us. It won't end until the dollar based fiat system is destroyed.  &#x200B;  So wtf. Russia and China have us by the balls. They've infiltrated our nation from within, compromised countless individuals (Epstein et al.), planted spies and bugs to get into our institutions and government. Our country has literally been sold out to the highest bidder over the past few decades, and we just let it happen. Kind of pathetic if you ask me...the US has no leverage anywhere.  One BIG thing that I think is standing in the way is the current SEC vs Ripple lawsuit. For anyone who doesn't know much about it, here is a little basic summary: [https://rockitcoin.com/ripple-vs-sec](https://rockitcoin.com/ripple-vs-sec)  I highly recommend anyone interested to look into iso20022. Look into what it is, what companies, banks, and institutions that are involved; and what digital networks or platforms they'll use. I bet something related to Ripple comes up. DYOR. (This is not financial advice. I'm not that smart)  The lawsuit was brought forth on the last day of the outgoing SEC Chairman Jay Clayton's tenure. Quite a bizarre move. Anyone following the lawsuit will tell you that it is leaning heavily in favor of Ripple. This extended lawsuit that many predicted to have been over last fall, but this farcical lawsuit has been drawn out. They're holding the "result" back for a reason. Maybe the SEC is just buying time.  This lawsuit is the trump (sorry for those suffering from Trump derangement syndrome, but this has nothing to do with orange man) card. When Russia and China assist the US government in crashing the economy, and destroying cryptos, the SEC and Ripple lawsuit will settle...or better yet, Ripple will win. At this point Ripple, and particular cryptocurrencies related to it, would have complete clarity from the SEC. Investors will see that they cannot trust most cryptos as they are being manipulated into the ground, and smart investors already see the writing on the wall for the US economy and the value of the USD $.  &#x200B;  In short, Ripple wins the lawsuit. The new system (iso20022) with associated cryptocurrencies gets clarity to operate in the US. The current fiat monetary system will continue to collapse until there is nothing left. The new system will be activated. Millions, billions, and in time, trillions will flow through the Ripple ecosystem as outlined in iso20022. The future is happening right now. All you have to do is connect the dots.  Again, this is not financial advice, just a little conspiracy theory on what the future of finance will look like and how we can take advantage of it. Enjoy the show.	1642800805.0	s9lkfn	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9lkfn/russia_and_china_are_working_to_destroy_crypto/	Russia and China are working to destroy crypto, along with the US economy.

They have likely plugged every available tool into sculpting the world to their goals. BUT, they ARE still sculpting. Full control requires no push or plot. You just do it. And the people who carry out the "plan" are still livestock in the same holding pen. There are undoubtedly plots above them that outreach the parameters of human. We should be careful not to volunteer our unbreakable abilities to the plans of the few. If they truly understood the game of chess, they would know it begins and ends infinitely.

2kxyrx9f	To start, I am “not up to date on my Covid vaccines” 🤡🤡🤡 and have been back to normal for the most part since about April of last year. I hadn’t really caught any bugs during the pandemic and regularly test myself when I travel or have to attend an event, all negative. A lot of my doomer friends are astounded at how I haven’t gotten Covid with my lack of any Covid protocol/PPE use and I’ve concluded I’ve had some sort of immunity to it for some time now. I am in my mid thirties and am not in the best of shape. Nevertheless I don’t consider myself part of a risk tier high enough for Covid to get vaccinated.   Anyways, on to how I got here. My wife’s parents visited us from up north this past week and things had gone fine. We ate out regularly and basically had a normal vacation you’d have with family before Covid. This past Tuesday while they were still here, I started getting a wet cough and some serious sinus congestion. Thinking I probably caught something in my escapades I took the day off from work and quarantined. The day after that I hit a fever of 103 which could not be lowered without Tylenol and had bad chills on and off. On Thursday, I was a lot better but very muscle sore and lethargic, and today I started the day with a low grade fever with some mental fatigue and I still have a wet cough and sore throat. I wrote all that to say that these are the EXACT SAME SYMPTOMS I had the last time I had the flu, which was in 2018. My blood O2 never dropped below 96 and I still retain my sense of smell and taste.   Thinking it was the flu, and pretty damn confident that it was, I thought I could ride it out but todays fever resurgence set me on a path to find a same day doctor. I found that doctor, but they said they require a negative Covid test to do an person appointment. I went ahead and found a cvs that has tests in stock and took the test in the car anticipating a negative test and going to the doctor after to confirm my flu self diagnosis. Nope. Positive. Immediately.   That threw me in a bit of a loop because I seriously don’t think I have Covid but because my at home test came out positive so I couldn’t go to the doctor anymore to test for the flu (they require the physical proof). Currently I have to wait until Monday to test both Covid and flu but given I have all flu symptoms I’m treating it as the flu instead of Covid and concluding the tests can’t differentiate between flu and Covid. My wife and her parents don’t have any symptoms and we joked that they brought down a northern flu again to attack me like it did in 2018.   I don’t know, the test says one thing but all other evidence points to another. I’ve always been skeptical about the handling of Covid and this is sort of confirming it for me again.  What do you all think?  I’ll post an update here once I get my PCR/flu test on Monday.   Tl;dr my latest illness this week mirrored the symptoms I had when I had the flu in 2018 but then I tested positive for Covid today, without any of Covid’s signature symptoms. Covid = flu?	1642804452.0	s9myav	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9myav/i_tested_positive_for_covid_i_only_have_flu/	I tested positive for Covid. I only have flu symptoms

caq5aau	Most US Dollars didn't exist before 2020. Because of the pandemic, banks and financial institutions got big bailouts.   According to to Infowars, Peter Daszak admitted to be funding gain of function on behalf of the CIA in front of a colleague.  Moreover, DARPA, a highly advanced weapons project, apparently knew about potential bio-weapon and eugenics in Wuhan. They apparently knew about upcoming pandemic created by NIH and Eco Health Alliance funding of that lab. They also knew about prevention techniques like monoclonal antibodies.   Or at least that's what Project Veritas is claiming. Journalists are saying 'I am not suicidal, if I die it's CIA or big tech'.  &#x200B;  ====  So it is possible that Federal Reserve wants to create false flags to destroy data regarding petrodollar. They might even create false flag attacks by Russia where 'the gold in vault' gets 'destroyed'. (it was never in the 'vault').  They will also try to delete data regarding NIH funding of gain of function.   Remember after 9/11, FBI deleted all data regarding Able Danger so they can cover up that FBI was funding Osama Bin Laden. SEC also deleted data about stock market rigging in September.  And those data were officially deleted, not the one which were destroyed by the attack. Information about 2.3T dollars were probably destroyed by the 9/11 attack.  If they got away with data deletion of 9/11, what about now? They can get away now. They just have to blame Russian hackers. If things are bad they might even blame Israeli companies making Pegasus.	1642805154.0	s9n7kk	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9n7kk/if_cia_got_away_with_911_what_are_they_planning/	If CIA got away with 9/11, what are they planning now?

tg2eaar	I think we all want the world to survive and become a better place in the future, but the only thing that stands in the way are thoughts of fear relating to the vaccine and what it could do to the population. Noone in my immediate family has gotten injured by the vaccine and I have no reason to believe within my circle that it is doing something absurdly malicious. It asks the question "Is there true justice in this world?" I spend time looking on sites such as Rumble and Bitchute and find videos that spread as much fear and propaganda as the mainstream media without the most reliable of backing. Some of the things that I'd expect from a population that is awake and is observing the phenomena of the vaccine if it was doing damage is to become a whistleblower. Having the strength to know something is wrong and make a video about it. On these sites I've seen a limited number of whistleblowers and the same names pop up over and over again talking about harmful vaccine effects. I'd like to ask you... has someone you know been injured from the vaccine and if so please state the details. An unfair world where so called elites are going to slowly kill people over time with a "depopulation agenda" doesn't seem like a justified human experience. If this platform is the same thing as those sites like Rumble and Bitchute and promotes negative energy I'd expect half efforted responses, but if you have something to say here I'm all ears. This would be one of the spots where individuals who notice something is wrong within their immediate circle would go.	1642806345.0	s9nnr8	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9nnr8/debunking_vaccine_injuries_discussion/	Debunking Vaccine Injuries Discussion

awbv6gqx	My first experience getting covid odd, a mild fever that lasted quite literally 30 minutes and then a long 2 week constant state of coughing.  Worst cough I had in my life, wasn't painful or uncomfortable it was just all the time. Sometimes talking or coughing brought on a coughing fit, was quite funny at times.  But ever since then despite the pandemic getting much worse, much more cases and still taking little to no precautions being around folks who are take little precautions or themselves had covid.  I just think it's strange how I haven't gotten it again. Got 2 vaccines not the booster for travel reasons and it all felt a bit in vain honestly since I never got the virus again.  Either it's mad coincidence, the vaccine is more effective than I realise or is it possible for people to be entirely immune from covid?

78iyqun	So long before COVID I’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. I went to therapy, and had it become no longer an issue for me, I barely had any anxiety attacks. After the vaccine, I’ve had more anxiety attacks than usual. Luckily it’s not an everyday thing for me as much as it was before, Im just noticing that it’s happening more after the vaccine.   In September I had a major panic attack. It was my first panic attack. For those who may be confused, an anxiety attack often has a trigger, where as a panic attack doesn’t usually have one, but sometimes it can. However, the symptoms are worse. I was shaking, my heart was racing. Earlier that day I had taken Advil. I didn’t take it with enough water and it scratched my throat leaving me with a sensation that something was in my throat.  I felt this puffy sensation in my face and neck, I got super worried thus leading me to the panic attack. After this, panic attacks became more common for me. I haven’t had one in a few months but I wouldn’t be shocked if it happened again.   I’ve been double vaxxed with Pfizer, and I haven’t gotten the booster. Anyone else with the same issue?	1642816605.0	s9r7bx	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9r7bx/ive_gotten_more_anxiety_attacks_after_the_vaccine/	I’ve gotten more anxiety attacks after the vaccine
6kim4c34	If you watch some videos on youtube about measuring 5G Electro magnetic field, you will see how hardcore a new iphone with 5G is gonna radiate.  I have LTE, the previous version and whenever I had longer conversation on the phone, I would feel really dizzy. Since I noticed that, I rather call via wifi and keep my phone most of the time in flightmode.  If I go outside I keep phonecalls really short.  My head feels like being fried. And seeing these new phones exposing even more radiation, I decided to stick to my old one until it breaks.  Why does nobody care about that?   Also I read the book from Artur Firstenberg , Invisible Rainbow where it is mentioned that new estabilished phone frequencies and radiation cause you to lose smell and get flulike symptoms, it also irritates the heart. Causes also ringing in the ears. So actually really unhealthy. Yet nobody cares. Maybe because it fills the pockets from big pharma when we get sick.   The book is recommended to read.	1642816756.0	s9r8xz	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9r8xz/5g_might_expose_a_lot_of_radiation/	5G might expose a lot of radiation

If I look the phone number up, it seems to be an actual NHS phone number: [https://www.google.com/search?q=01243831500&oq=01243831500&aqs=chrome..69i57.5508j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8](https://www.google.com/search?q=01243831500&oq=01243831500&aqs=chrome..69i57.5508j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)  If you call the number (I didn't actually try) then apparently you can't get through since it only makes outgoing calls, which does make sense.  Is this video a hoax? I can't see any red flags except that it "could be a hoax". They could have hired a very convincing actress to play the doctor and they could have saved a random NHS number as the name of a contact.

2nvuwcos	This is a very long article, which is extremely well written and explains the Great Reset in detail. Anyone who is remotely serious about understanding current events should take the time to read this. Im glad i stumbled across it.  "On the ephemeral side, the vision of the “resetters” is related to the futuristic ideas that were popular in the early 20th century, to the dream of a global corporate monopoly that propped up the bolshevik revolution of 1917, and to the overall crave of controlling the world with technology, something that was attempted and failed in the Soviet Union in the 60s—using the language very similar to today’s. On the concrete side, the Great Reset (which by the way is very well coordinated, to the extent that both Biden and Johnson are using the same coded words put forward by the WEF) grows out of the post-WWII efforts to maintain a “correct” power balance in the world, with “correct” financial interests reaping the benefits."  https://tessa.substack.com/p/great-reset-dummies	1642822440.0	s9t21n	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9t21n/the_great_reset_primer_for_dummiesa_very_long/	The Great Reset Primer for Dummies-A Very Long Read but Worth It.

89uflkme	Does anybody know the name of the institute or organization which oversees/directs care for patients?    Context:  A man I personally know has been in the hospital for over a month (had trouble breathing due to Covid. Admitted himself)..  They put him on a ventilator. They prevented him from leaving (he tried to leave on his own terms) and they heavily sedated him, inducing a coma. They ended up poking a hole in his throat, while he was sedated, to use for the ventilator tube. He ended up getting sepsis, due to the IV not being [properly] changed. He started making progress, even tested negative for Covid. Remained sedated, on ventilator. They even gave him fentanyl!? Today he was declared brain dead.  The hospital was in a hurry to pull the plug (family was finally allowed to visit him today, after more than a month of separation, and the staff were annoyed they were taking too long to say their goodbyes; they were literally waiting outside the door with their arms crossed, tapping their feet!).  My wife has been in communication with the family throughout the entire process. She has even been in contact with the hospital.  Two things: 1) In her contact with hospital staff, she learned that the in-hospital staff have no control of the care provided to the patient in this situation; an institute/organization sends their staff to administer “care.” They said they don’t even have access to the information. 2) He was progressing, but yesterday he was administered an unknown medication, swelled up, had organ failure, was pronounced brain dead early today.  In general, everybody close to him agreed that he was not being properly taken care of, with his life as a priority. Many of us agree it seems they were almost *trying* to kill him. He was given way too many medications. It’s been said they were “experimenting.”  My wife can’t remember the name of the institute/organization which was told to her by the nurse she was in contact with. I called the hospital but the person who answered was either clueless or misdirecting.  The hospital is Kern Medical Center, in Bakersfield California, near Union Avenue.  Any information/insight would be helpful. I’m just trying to get to the bottom of what’s going on.

2nvuwcos	"Speaking of energy and finance, let’s talk about “human capital.” In the new world, “human capital” is not just a metaphor for HR or labor. Microsoft, for example, has a patent for a method of transforming human behavior into cryptocurency, which is done through an unspecified device coupled with a server that registers body activity and “mines” crypto. Since under the New Normal, digital and crypto are supposed to become mainstream, this looks suspiciously like a tool that can be used both to tightly control the behavior of the poor who may depend on this for income—and to literally mine the bodies of otherwise “useless” welfare dependents / UBI recipients for energy (which, by the way, is an actual thing, believe it or not)."   Is it any wonder crypto "suddenly" became a "popular and good idea"? These people have trillions to spend on advertising by way of "news articles". You're being controlled.

There’s a scene from the movie where Alice is unable to fit through a keyhole which will allow her to enter the other world. So, to fit through the keyhole and enter the other world she drinks a potion beautifully labelled “Drink Me”. The way the words are written are really fancy, as shown in the image above. Notice in the image the capital D and M. With a little imagination, the words can be played around with to get DMT. Coincidental or not, I thought this was interesting, as DMT is often associated with otherworldly experiences.   https://preview.redd.it/m8qdvxol46d81.png?width=995&format=png&auto=webp&s=d93d50820e39fccb6561d4666bd3449de4790048	1642826363.0	s9u8nf	/r/conspiracy/comments/s9u8nf/theory_the_original_movie_alice_in_wonderland_was/	Theory: The original movie Alice in Wonderland was about the spirit molecule, DMT

Boom. Trump somehow pulls it off and people lose their SHIT. Dems call it a stolen election and Reps say it’s a fair win.  *fast forward through 4 years of drama, MSM lying on both sides of the fence, and pony shows like Russiagate and Ukraine. All leading up to Covid. Everything orchestrated to make people choose a side. Facts are essentially eradicated. Everyone wants to think they are right, morally just, etc. Masses paint themselves with either a blue or red brush.   2020 election rolls around. The entire Biden vs Trump show was brilliant.

Trump looks like the clear winner on election night. Everyone goes to bed and BOOM. Biden is President by morning. Once again, people lose their SHIT. Reps call it a stolen election and dems  say it’s a fair win.   *fast forward though Jan. 6 fiasco, voting machine and voter ID controversy, Trump challenging election, etc. Each and every episode of BS manipulates people’s emotions and further wedges the public.

Some of the very first articles I had read about sars-covid19 had video links showing Chinese citizens, presumably from wuhan, fall to the floor en mass while twisting and Jenking like they were introduced to a nerve agent, not a virus. I just find it strange no matter how deep I let my rabbit hole go -across various platforms and databases- I can't find one video or reference to these poor pseudo epileptic souls. Makes me wonder if the covid19 virus was released to cover up the spill of a nerve agent  from the wuhan virology lab.   If you have any videos, please share. I just find it odd that insane dozens, if not hundreds of videos of Chinese citizens both single and in large groups falling to the ground with zero extremity control.

30t8vxaq	First, no hate.  I just have a simple question so I can try to understand your thinking.  Also, I'm definitely not an anti-vaxxer.  I am vaccinated for everything else as are my kids and the rest of my family.  I'm very pro science and I'm not religious at all to give some background on myself  Have you taken the time to truly listen to anyone at all that is issuing warnings about the shots?    An example would be Dr. Mike Yeadon, who is the former Chief Scientist for Pfizer.    I don't want to even get into what his claims are or their legitimacy.  I'm just curious, since he's one of the most qualified people in the world to have an opinion on this, if you've taken the time to hear him out at all.  I'd link to some of his videos but evidently Reddit now blocks most video sites that aren't named YouTube.  I ask this because I've exposed myself to much of both sides of the argument to come to my conclusion that I won't take the shots.  I only wonder if the average person does this.  If not, then who is it that you're placing your trust in?  I was on the fence about the shots until pretty recently.  It just happens that some of the people I've listened to now on the vaxx-cautious side are 10 times more qualified than anyone I could even find on the pro-vaxx side.  So I guess that's my only question.  Have you considered both sides?  If not, then why?

Freeman had 2 free podcasts available where during one there was mention of earlier conversations with Chuck Orchelli. These were called Orchelli and The Greek.   I won’t go into the predictions. He seemed to have an incredible knowledge on medicine and technology but also history. He tied many esoteric, hidden history and modern conspiracies together with an almost endless depth of truth.

Back to the reason for the post: It seems like the idea of an "NPC", or a functioning being with no identity/soul/etc is becoming engrained into our mind.

There is no Tl;DR, this post is weird af.	1642856429.0	sa20my	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa20my/something_subliminal_i_am_noticing_with_society/	Something subliminal I am noticing with society.

Is it because they're findings go against the official narrative that everything is just fine? Or is it because they're not in the pockets of these pharmaceutical companies?

6l39q3z	This is hilarious. Faced with calls for his resignation over breaking lockdown rules UK PM throws  all that Covid business under the bus to save his own skin.  Hats off.    There are a few lessons to be learned here  1- Covid was never the big scary monster they made it out to be ,  and Omicron less so.    2- Covid was used by governments, main stream media, big pharma, big business and  special interest groups to extend their power and control in ways we will feel into the next decade.   3- Covid was financially used to print money and bail out big business once more.   4- Covid was the first real exercise for a  world wide coordinated response.   5- Covid proved that most of us have “non estential “jobs so we’d better behave.   6- Covid was used to slow down travel and immigration.   7- covid was the first real test of Universal basic income .   8- covid made sure we all know that we are connected on this beautiful planet floating through  space.   I am not really against a world government and a better distribution of incomes and opportunities. Its obvious we need to organize ourselves in a better way than nation states and capitalism , just to have a sustainable planet to live on. look at this post , it has a potential to reach across all borders globally. This was impossible 20 years ago unless I was backed by a global media machine and even then. So yes what I do in my little corner of the world effects those far away in new ways I  can not imagine. After all wasn’t the official covid story about some random dude  eating a bat in china.   I think the whole point now is not to allow special interest groups  to dictate the  new emerging global political/financial  system so as  to maintain their status quo.   Inequality should not be a corner stone for the new system.  It is vital we have a say in  who controls the system  and who the system is designed to favor. For myself   I just do not  want to be a citizen of  a global police state or a techno feudalist state ,  if these are my options.  Alternatively, I just may be full of shit and it is just the natural end of the virus and  there is no need to read anything into the last three years except to what lengths politicians will go to in order to save their own skin.	1642857218.0	sa2992	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa2992/uk_pm_throws_covid_business_under_bus_to_save_his/	UK PM throws covid business under bus to save his career.

8r5o8sr7	Yesterday I woke up not feeling well so I made my way to the doc to get tested. While sitting in my jeep in front of the office waiting for my turn, I received a strange phone call from an unknown number.   The area code was the same as mine, thinking it was the doc's office calling me inside (add to wait till they call you to come in) I answered.   The voice on the other end immediately began talking as soon as I said hello. The voice was that of a female and it sounded like that of a computer (automated).   What was being said made no sense, it was a string of random words, numbers, directions and partial phrases. After about 10 seconds I ended the call. Short while later the doc called me inside (tested positive for covid 1st time by the way). Yay me.

The old version said: "the vaccines have been proven effective and safe, so get yours so we can get back to this and this" sound effects for bars and sporting events.  The new version says everything the same except: "proven effective and needed"   This is in Iowa, not sure if it's a nation wide ad or not.

agxrjdnf	The New World The world is going to shit. Climate change is in full action. Price of food and other essential commodities are going up, clean drinking water is becoming more and more scares, coastal areas are being flooded, forests are on fire, world wide disasters are becoming a common occurrence, To make matters worse home ownership is declining and rent is sky rocketing. The world as we know it is becoming much more inhospitable place. It is changing the perception of the younger generation and people are getting more violent, depressed and focused on survival rather than living. Due to all of this less people are getting married ( high divorce rates, unequal marital laws and hookup culture also are high contributing factors). The average birth rate in most developed countries is declining at a very fast rate. This is mainly due to higher female education, women choosing work over family, rising child care/support, health care, rent, housing prices, underpaid jobs, unemployment decreased sperm and ovum production, infertility and frankly the world going to shit.  There are 2 ways in which the decline of human population will be handled  Option 1 : The governments around the world will start giving better living conditions for raising children, this includes low cost of living, better and cheaper health care, better paternal work environment, giving true and equal rights for both sexes in marriage. Changing the populations mindset about having and raising children....yada yada yada...All kumbaya... But even if all of these have been done it is not guaranteed to achieve the desired outcome.  Option 2 : Artificial wombs : the next population can be grown. Just think about it, the rich and powerful people of the world literally have full control of the entire human species. • Modern women would love this shit, they can opt out of motherhood and child birth. • The new born babies will be chipped, marked and groomed for a specific role in society. • Married couples will seize to exist. • Old people will be taken out by the government as they don't have any purpose. • If artificial wombs do come into existence and if they manage to mainstream the idea of child birth without all the problems that comes with it, people are going to opt for it, as it may be cheaper and may give the baby a higher chance of survival. Companies governments will acquire entire populations genetic information and with the introduction of AI designer babies will be produced and it will be moulded without parents into a being equivalent to a slave that is bound by its shackles of life.........

5yhznu7x	There were recent rumblings that the especially toxic batch lots were sent to Red States for obvious Cult reasons, and we may surmise that less lethal and even saline only batches were distributed in leftist cities (hence the disproportionate “case” numbers).  We may speculate and theorize, but the websites [How Bad is My Batch](https://www.howbadismybatch.com/) and [How Bad](https://howbad.info/) are actually compiling the data, and the extrapolations are revealing that this Crimes Against Humanity PSYOP-19 Program is using injectable Biowarfare “vaccines” to target certain demographics, thus possessing the ability to stagger out the slow kill effects over time. BigPharma (i.e. the CIA) can then review the data and fine tune their Death Injection payloads over geographical political zones, etc.  But the data is not that clearcut actually, which raises even more interesting points. On the [Size Matters](https://www.howbadismybatch.com/sizematters.html) page, we see that the more Death Injections administered, the greater the deaths. (This data is sourced from VAERS so we must take into account the Underreporting Factor \[URF\] at a very conservative 41, though I believe it is at very least twice that estimate.) That makes sense if the “vaccine” lots are all dangerous, irrespective of the level of toxicity. The disabilities post “vax” also increased, which too should not come as a surprise. But then something interesting emerges: the Red States tend to express higher numbers of deaths within these datasets.  https://preview.redd.it/z7uelu3iz8d81.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c9c87c6c295b397d470579bbc87f8a0311c2c81  Then we proceed to the State by State comparisons found on the [**Variation Across States** ](https://www.howbadismybatch.com/states.html)**page.**  https://preview.redd.it/2izv0ivjz8d81.png?width=1363&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f5ceeb3e49016eda8e3fc66784e39eb5db4c5d1  From that page, the following is reported:  * The average number of deaths for red states is 5.44 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated * The average number of deaths for blue states is 3.46 deaths per 100,000 vaccinated  “So the ratio of red:blue is 5:3.”  **“This means that for every 5 old people vaccinated in a red state, there will be 3 old people vaccinated in a blue state.”**  What will be absolutely fascinating to confirm is over the next 5 years how the slow kill component of these Death Injections will favor certain States versus others a la the old and sickly being wiped out first. The reason this is such a nefariously devious scheme is that depopulation plays out over long enough timelines where CogDis can be further leveraged against those on the brink of breaking their Death Cult spells as what the programmed are actually witnessing and irrefutable data pours in, thus making it that much harder for any kind of Mass Deprogramming of Mass Formation to occur.  &#x200B;  Comply and YOU Die.

139wpo	How does anybody know they have covid? The diagnosis is based on symptoms, and a pcr test which doesn't actually test for the virus. Even Kary Mulis, the inventor of the test said that it can't accurately diagnose illness or infection. Thats why the pcr test can have a false positive.  No virologist has actually isolated and purified the virus, and the only image we have of it is computer generated.  People who think they've had the virus say they lost their sense of taste and smell, but lots of things can cause that. Even the common cold can cause a loss of taste and smell. Coincidentally, the cold basically disappeared last year, and it just so happens to have the same symptoms as covid.  When you really look at all the facts and evidence, you realise that there is no virus. It would be easy to prove there is, if it did. Alot of doctors and scientists have suggested different ideas on how to see prove its real, but these tests and experiments will never be done because the outcome could completely destroy the COVID narrative.  Covid literally only exists in a computer program.	1642861622.0	sa3mps	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa3mps/nobody_can_actually_prove_that_the_virus_exists/	Nobody can actually prove that the virus exists.

1528ek53	We are in an age of mind control and consciencious paralysis. This means that the consciousness of individuals are subdued to one perspective that cannot be shifted, enlightened or changed in anyway. They must acknowledge what is occurring in front of them and act in a way that appeases the elitists doing this to them. They are trapped within the labyrinth of their mind.  Modern/ Standardised ways to subdue: - Phones ( Distractions) -Social media   - Creates false perceptions of whats important and what is not, redirects energy into meaningless things. - Porn  - Providing pleasure is the easiest way to control people; Easiest way to wrap them around your finger. Turn it into an addiction.   Currently promoted ways of subduing: - Fear. - Making people fear is the easiest way to get them to act how you want them to.  - Increased degree of necessity for unnecessary vaccines and lockdown measures by persisting that these are the only ways.   Coronavirus was engineered to change social dynamics and behaviour, to make people more submissive majorily whilst simultaneously allowing people to rebel - A new schism has been created (Vax vs Anti vax for example) to further ensure Dividing and Conquering. If society fights over a meaningless and standard cold, as well as a vaccine promoted without testing, itll allow for them to be manipulated via there being reasons to rise up and attack the government, whom are simply pawns in a greater scheme.   2022 will be the year in which the NWO will begin establishing its one world government. They will initially present themselves as all-loving, persistently saying that they will improve standards of living. They will make christians believe that the kingdom of god has finally taken the reigns - True to the bible, the false prophet/kingdom will fool the masses as they mimic the true God.   May I also mention that there will be a global food & water shortage after China's fusion reactor, otherwise known as an 'Artificial Sun', overloads and fries their national electrical grid and the grids of surrounding nations. This will incite an uprising against the government, making people believe that they are winning and no longer being conquered, when in fact this is what the NWO want to occur - They will move in and bring an end to the famine, making it seem as if they've saved the day when in fact they are only building trust before fucking us over.	1642864181.0	sa4h2r	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa4h2r/my_2_cents/	My 2 cents

Post here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/s8m9yp/i\_am\_an\_adult\_film\_maker\_and\_i\_have\_been\_fighting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/s8m9yp/i_am_an_adult_film_maker_and_i_have_been_fighting/)  Now here we are this morning and Zer0hedge is running the story.  [https://archive.is/Ai143](https://archive.is/Ai143)    Now, I don't doubt that old media is also watching us too as they're working hard to run hit pieces and lies to counter what's rally going on.    So don't give up.  We're winning this nonsense.  The evil forces have to convince people who have already gotten two or three shots that they need to keep getting more if they want to move freely.  They're not winning.  In the U.S. less than half of people who got two shots have gotten a third and the number may actually be far lower.	1642865063.0	sa4s37	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa4s37/new_media_is_watching_us_here_we_can_change_the/	New media is watching us here, we can change the course of history.
ckk3ilis	We know from studies with slugs where if you cut them in half, the part without the brain will grow back and still have the memories of the original slug.  It may know where food was kept in a specific place or how to traverse a simple maze, to give some examples.  This is because memories are also stored in the DNA and this is observable in phenomenon regarding "muscle memory".  &#x200B;  Transplanting organs also transplants the memories of the other person and I believe that people have yet to wake up to this. But this is dangerous as getting a transplant from the wrong person can entirely change your humanity.     You can pick up any mental illness or psychopathic traits, for example.  &#x200B;  There are quite a few cases of people taking on traits from their donor, like if the donor was an artist, the transplant recipient may have a sudden urge to take up drawing, painting, etc. Now what would happen if the donor was a psychopath?  &#x200B;  It's a dangerous experiment that is yet to be understood and medical professionals are hardly taking these things into acocunt.     You may say that it's worth it to keep someone, such as a family member, alive and I won't argue with you on that but I still feel like it's imperative to make sure the person donating their organs is of sound mind and spirit, instead of just using any old organ that still works properly.	1642865323.0	sa4v8f	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa4v8f/memories_are_stored_in_the_dna_and_transplanting/	Memories are stored in the DNA and transplanting organs from certain people is a dangeorus practice

cmvd6skz	www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33118636/nfl-halts-daily-covid-19-testing-unvaccinated-players-memo-says%3fplatform=amp  In case you haven't heard, a new virus called COVID has been making it's way through society for the last 2 years. It got so bad that certain companies and countries wanted to be able to identify who was potentially sick and a carrier compared to the other part of the population who was potentially sick and a carrier.  The NFL did something similar by testing the unvaccinated super spreaders daily while vaccinated super spreaders were only tested bi-weekly.  As round 2 of the playoffs begin..the NFL has decided to stop the daily testing of players as the NFL doesn't want to risk it's unvaccinated population missing playoff games and costing them revenue. It is now okay for players and staff in the NFL to spread COVID to others within the organization.  Maybe we will get another chance to witness a Jordan flu-esque performance.	1642866081.0	sa54n9	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa54n9/nfl_prefers_profit_over_player_safety_as_playoffs/	NFL prefers profit over player safety as playoffs continue

7n69e8cl	I have a friend who approached me yesterday to tell me that she was pressured by her work into getting the vaccine, so she got the J&J to have a one and done scenario, but immediately she had menstrual issues. So far she's had her period 3 times this month and it's still going. She's really scared, and said I'm the only one she felt comfortable telling because of how open I am with what I've learned about these vaccines, and I'm completely open and honest about my concerns. She won't tell her work, or make that info public because she's too afraid of being considered crazy, or getting ostracized.   I told her straight up, "No, tell people, don't be scared, say something."

21sj9zis	I recently heard an acquaintance of mine mention a conspiracy theory about a supposed jewish sect that raped children, worshipped satan and was founded before the time of Christ. He referred to this sect as just "zionism".  I suspect that the conspiracy came from the Qanon or pizzagate community since this person believes strongly in these conspiracies. He also strongly believes in "9/11 was an inside job" theories, apparently like those found in the "loose change" documentary.

2i5z6l	How many writers & artists are a part of this sub?   I’m not suggesting we start making propaganda as a group but I’m wondering how many of the artistically inclined folks in this sub try to use their medium of choice to combat the *actual* propaganda in our every day lives. I write music myself & every now & then I’ll devote a whole track or section of a track to conspiracy related lyrics or lyrics that are more aptly described as social commentary.   This sub has a few musicians that have linked their stuff over time but I feel as though I rarely see instances of individuals coming forward with non-musical content. I’m talking poems, videos (we get videos but rarely any good crash course ones to ease in the folks we want to wake up imo), straight up paintings or drawings etc.   Think tanks, clandestine groups & corporations put so much effort into quirky two liners & fancy evocative images that convey a strong, clear message & I believe we all could to. Maybe not to their level but effort is the deciding factor in things usually.   I’m quite stoned at the moment just working on music & this long thought just randomly popped in my head, so I figured I’d reach out. If anyone resonates with this in any way, pm me if you want.

e9ce0e2h	Dude held a gun to a woman's head asking her to strip naked, get under the bedsheets, and call him to join her, or else. She did and Dude being the gentleman obliged, after all a gentleman never refuses an offer from a lady.  As she was the one who called Dude to join her under the sheets, we can all agree that Dude what ensued between them wasn't rape. We are enfranchised members of contemporary Western civil society and we have an understanding of what rape is and what it's not.  If it is a human right to decline treatment or prophylaxis for a disease, never mind one that is easily recovered from by the vast majority, or one that the person has not yet contracted or may even be immune from, how then is it possible for people to be fined and imprisoned for exercising that right?  Since when has exercising a core right made a person subject to fines, detention and incarceration?  Has Western civil society gone crazy, or has it never been truly sane to begin with?  Are we dealing with a deeper psychic and spiritual malaise of the Western pysche, an ugliness within it perhaps?	1642869214.0	sa681a	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa681a/debunk_this_mandatory_vaccines_enforced_by_fines/	Debunk this: Mandatory vaccines, enforced by fines, imprisonment, social disenfranchisement with attendant loss of income, property, home and family is equivalent to blood rape with needles.

In the UK at least, no one actually really cared about the lockdown. We liked it.   We don’t really care about vaccine side effects. We had a choice. The anti- vaxx movement was an opportunity, instated by an anonymous group for unknown reasons. Maybe it was to destabilise end of, because it was an opportunity for people to take a stand. People are clearly, seriously angry with the government. What for ? Releasing a biological weapon ?   Or is it something to do with the working class. The discarding of human rights concerns stated by the UN to continue to weaken a generation of children, and the sick by malnutrition and withdrawal of universal medical services ?

They’re not even trying to hide the fact that they’re taking your freedoms away from you with no plan to give them back. They want you to forget what this country ever stood for, they will tell you that you imagined “Land of the Free” ever followed “Home of the Brave.” Soon they may even change it to “land of the safe” and call you crazy for ever thinking it wasn’t.

In his dizzying narcissism, he probably thinks gratitude - for reinstating rights and freedoms he had never had the authority to remove in the first place - will overwhelm righteous fury and indignation, and the desire for justice. It won’t. At least not for me. I’m fuming. People at work talk knowingly now about the failure of masks and vaccines, where a fortnight ago they were still looking at me like I were mad. The programming is still in operation. Most want to “keep calm and carry on” now, simply because that’s now the official line. Not because it makes sense, always made sense, but because that’s the latest instruction.   Listening to online conspiracy analysts talking about this being the end of the narrative. I don’t get it. The fight had hardly begun, we had scarcely started, have sacrificed little and then we are granted a sudden reprieve. As close to an admission of fault - if not guilt - that were ever likely to get. No, this is a hollow, temporary win. Enjoy it for a moment if you like, but do not relax for too long.But this is not over. Never will be. I stopped predicting anything since 2022 began (three weeks that feels like three months), and I have no definite idea of what is coming next (new China virus, war, food shortages, the usual climate change bollocks), but be sure to remember that they will stop at NOTHING to meet their goals. We know the destination, which has helped us make sense of so much that mystifies normies, however many surprises there may be on the way.  So is that bye-bye to Agenda 2030 and The Great Reset then? Have the WEF packed up their tent and slunk on back to Davos? Will the next pandemic wipe our collective memories, rendering us susceptible to the same trick and manipulation once again ? Have they simply injected sufficient numbers already to reduce the population via death and infertility from one generation to the next? Is this the calm between storms, the reinstatement of sanity for a brief period, like allowing a water board victim a few breaths of air before resumption of the torture.	1642872039.0	sa791r	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa791r/this_is_as_close_to_an_admission_and_a/	This is as close to an admission and a vindication as we’re going to get from these motherfuckers.

vg776	Sorry if this has been said before, but I need to get opinions on this.  Obligatory disclaimer: I am a supporter of black suffrage, black rights, and I support Black, Latin and Asian's rights to freedom and equality in all manners.  When I first heard about California's "Equitable Mathematics" bumfuckery, I thought to myself "this cannot be true." Unfortunately, [it has become true.](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ma/cf/index.asp) California is now actively integrating a petticoat book – *A Pathway to Equitable Math Instruction: Dismantling Racism in Math Instruction*, a book which purports to make maths accessible and fair for all races. The main problem I have with this is that it's not making Math fair and accessible; it's making Math divergent and based upon some kind of wishy washy interpretation of social justice rather than objective fact.  Apparently, some people think this is good. But, if it does what I think it's doing, it's probably closer to another class buffer as can exist. See, the link above leads to California's Education Board's current curriculum, which, I do not believe, applies to private schools (who, where I live, write their own curriculums). That is to say, only Public schools (which is where the majority of BIPOC and low-income white families are) will have the new curriculum enforced.  I'm sure some people can already see where I'm going here.  With the poors and colored folks (but not the ones who can pay to go to private school, colored or no) all being fed a, frankly, entirely incorrect interpretation of Math, Math teaching, Math grading, and Math theory, they will naturally emerge from elementary and high school *under-developed and under-educated.* why is this useful?  Simple. Undereducated people work for less, work longer hours, and work worse jobs.  Now, here comes the real conspiracy. I need to preface this with saying that I have done zero research and have zero evidence to support this, and that I'm probably totally wrong anyways. But, *what if this new curriculum isn't just some SJW bullshit?*   Hear me out. Sure, the far-left is just as stupid as the far-right, just tugging in a different direction, but I have my suspicions that this particular addition to the curriculum is no mistake.   It's no secret that employers and corporate leaders have been trying to maximize profits for years now, sometimes very aggressively. And, of course, it's no mistake that a lot of companies hire and underway, overwork and sometimes not even pay at all, illegal immigrants and undereducated folks who don't know their or don't have protection rights.   Now, of course, illegal immigrants are an issue red states aren't willing to let go, and an issue most moderates have a right-leaning stance on anyways. On top of that, for those with companies, illegal immigrants can't sign contracts, don't have an inflated sense of loyalty from American commercial indoctrination, and cannot work some positions.  How do you fix this? Create your own undereducated population! An undereducated American has all those things an illegal immigrant lacks, with the added benefit of being unable to pursue higher education and thus being income locked at a lower socio-economic bracket.  Now, how and who is doing this? Namely, people with more 0s in their bank accounts than molecules in the ocean, and they're weaponizing the highly militant Cadre of white, savior-complex college-level SJWs. By utilizing social media (which that Cadre of people dominate), those groups can push an undue amount of social pressure in society and effect changes rapidly.  If I were a cruel multi-billionaire, God knows I'd take advantage of that propensity towards social weight and push my own dangerous but potentially very profitable agenda.  You may be asking what the precedent for this is. Remember 2008? Well, that was the rich gambling with dangerous policies. What's so different about mass de-education  and wage slavery...?  Anyways, weak ending. I always lose stamina towards the end... hope this at least gave someone a good read. It's social basically fanfiction at this point, but w/e.

Why are they keeping their mouth shut while the west attempts to take over the world with this Great Reset shit.    He cut a deal. Crimea was the down payment.   The plan was put on hold while trump was around but restarted again last year.   Yalta style. You keep your mouth shut and we'll give you Ukraine. I don't think he'd pass that opportunity up. But I also don't think he's gonna let them win and start this stakeholder capitalism trash either.   My guess is that he'll take Ukraine and then forget to keep his mouth shut on all that's going on.  Only thing holding me back is the European gas situation but maybe that's not the real story either. Maybe the west actually wants Europe to pay huge energy costs for now.

4aokq	The following article was published in the 'Science' section of the LA Times  https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2022-01-19/how-the-bodys-immune-system-tries-to-fight-off-covid-19  Here is a breakdown of the article.  "Vaccines have shown themselves to be the best defense against a serious case of COVID-19: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, unvaccinated adults were about 13 times more likely to be hospitalized with the disease than vaccinated adults as of late November."  The thesis makes an unsubstantiated blanket statement to establish the tone. This oft-cited CDC statistic, in this cased used without any reference, comparing hospitalizations between vaccinated and unvaccinated includes data from before the vaccines were ever available.  The latest data, such as this report from the UK NHS, refutes this statistic.  https://imgur.com/a/ZuocRQb  "It’s conceivable that if you’re freshly vaccinated or boosted, you could have so many antibodies ready to attack that you won’t become infected, said Trudy U. Rey, a virologist and science communicator. This is called “sterilizing immunity,” although in the case of COVID-19, it would be merely temporary. But that’s not the goal of a COVID-19 vaccination. (More on that later.)"  As we know, the stated goal of the vaccinations by Health officials, the FDA, and other politicians was to prevent infections.  https://dossier.substack.com/p/memory-hole-virtually-every-major https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/comirnaty  "Vaccination, Weiskopf said, “is nothing but training the immune system without getting sick.” COVID-19 vaccines create antibodies that recognize the spike protein and other characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, along with memory T cells that can recognize cells that have been infected with the virus."  The covid19 mRNA injection ONLY produces the spike protein and nothing else. It is logically impossible for the antibodies and T-cells to recognize any other part of the virus.  "But Omicron’s mutations haven’t tempered the response of memory T cells, Weiskopf, Rey and Wherry said. That’s because the mutations haven’t had much effect on the parts of the virus that T cells recognize."  Once again, how can T-cells recognize any other part of the virus when only the spike protein from the Alpha variant was produced by the mRNA vaccine?  This article is yet another example of the lying that passes for science journalism in this age of unfettered propaganda.	1642875608.0	sa8k22	/r/conspiracy/comments/sa8k22/anatomy_of_a_lie_propaganda_in_the_la_times/	Anatomy of a lie: Propaganda in the LA Times

1s1shfba	Like my daughter, her friends are all athletes.  Like me, none of my friends are athletes (or at least they are way past their athletic prime.)  Granted, she likes people and making new friends, and I don't, so her peer group is much bigger than mine. If she has 100 friends and peers (team mates / class mates, etc.), at best I have 20 friends and/or people I am forced to associate with on a regular basis.  *    **One girl is a college freshman who plays lacrosse.**  *    **One is a HS senior who plays varsity soccer.**  *    **The third is a junior on the HS swim team with my daughter.**  If you are thinking that teenaged female athletes would normally have the highest life expectancy of almost any demographic, you would be right. (More than teenaged males, mostly because teenage males do a lot of stupid things that gets them killed.)  * **The risk of death for all 17 year old females in one year is 0.07%.** * **The risk of death for all 51 year old males in one year is 0.55%.**   (In other words, I am 7.9x more likely to die in the next year than my daughter is.)  **The point here is that a 17 year old girl, like my daughter, should not have more peers with heart conditions than her 51 year old father.**   # Peer Group Size Adjustment  If the "Friend/Peer" population is adjusted for the size of her larger friend/peer circle (relative to mine), she still has more peers/friends with heart conditions than I do.  That is, assuming her friend group is 5 times larger than mine, the risk of death for my peer group is still 1.6x greater than the risk of death for hers. (0.07 x 5 = .35) < 0.55  \[Example: She has 500 friends and I have 100 friends. Because she has 5 times more friends than me, the probability of knowing a peer with a heart condition is increased by 5 times.\]  # The Athletes  The girl who plays college lacrosse goes to a decent sized Catholic university in the northeast. The school required students to be vaxxed and boosted when they came back to school from Christmas break. She was boosted over the break and immediately started having heart arrhythmia. She is also now having difficulty concentrating and is experiencing "brain fog." She has not gone back to school.  The girl who plays varsity soccer is a senior in high school. She got her second shot in November. The next day she collapsed on the field during warmups and was complaining of back pain. She originally thought the back pain was a flare up of previous rib bruising from regular play.  She ended up in the ICU and almost died from blood clots in her lungs.  The girl who is on my daughter's swim team got her booster over Christmas break. She has had hear palpations since the booster and her doctor will not let her swim.

Bernays invented the public relations profession in the 1920s and was the first person to take Freud's ideas to manipulate the masses. He showed American corporations how they could make people want things they didn't need by systematically linking mass-produced goods to their unconscious desires.  > Bernays was one of the main architects of the modern techniques of mass-consumer persuasion, using every trick in the book, from celebrity endorsement and outrageous PR stunts, to eroticising the motorcar.  > His most notorious coup was breaking the taboo on women smoking by persuading them that cigarettes were a symbol of independence and freedom. But Bernays was convinced that this was more than just a way of selling consumer goods. It was a new political idea of how to control the masses. By satisfying the inner irrational desires that his uncle had identified, people could be made happy and thus docile.  > It was the start of the all-consuming self which has come to dominate today's world.  ---   > “The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.” - Edward Bernays, *Propaganda* - (*granduncle of the founder of Netfix*)  > “If you’re anxious for to shine in the high aesthetic line as a man of culture rare, You must get up all the germs of the transcendental terms, and plant them everywhere. You must lie upon the daisies and discourse in novel phrases of your complicated state of mind, The meaning doesn’t matter if it’s only idle chatter of a transcendental kind.

1ix35azg	It is only explainable if a person understands their values, right and wrong, and has standards.    I mean literal standards that are universal.  For instance, people who are afraid of the “pandemic” have no quantifiable threshold as how to recognize what a threat is as an individual.  They may often feel a threat that is true, but can’t put it into words to communicate it.  For example, the oppression of the ruling class gets misinterpreted by the ruling class into the “selfishness of the unvaccinated”.  Thus, those feelings and frustrations become weaponized.  The real way, in my opinion as a peasant, to be free from this cognitive dissonance, is to understand this situation to death.  We are dealing with a massive frame.  We’re being framed.  And our reality is being framed for us by people who hate us.  Understand the frame.  Understand what would cause a person to want to frame.  Understand good and evil as an individual.    Realize the difference between understanding science and statistics and believing science and statistics.  Understand as much as you can about self and other.    Especially if you don’t have permission to.  We can only break out of these chains if we can see where the chains are attached in our conception of the world.  Understand the concept of freedom rather than being told what it is.  Or else a bad force might one day try to liberate you from the slavery of being an individual.  Imagine if everybody who was unhappy literally took a pen and wrote down exactly what was on their mind.  In order to rule the rulers we’ve got to rule ourselves.  In order to profess to the professors we’ve got to profess to ourselves what is right and what is wrong.  What is real, what is fake.  We’ve got to understand covid to death as individuals.  Understand what it looks like irl as individuals, how it effects us.  Write it down.  Write down what an actual pandemic looks like and try to distinguish if there’s a difference.  Understand covid to death in order to come to life again in a world in which we’ve been massively taken advantage of.  Also means trying to understand why it’s wrong in the first place and why having autonomy matters if autonomy is what we really want.	1642883751.0	sabhel	/r/conspiracy/comments/sabhel/the_most_frustrating_thing_is_watching_society/	The most frustrating thing is watching society being pummeled by a complex lie and then not being able to put into words for people to understand the sleight of hand.

5ct80	We're in the middle of a devastating pandemic. It's a pandemic of smug fools with fake titles who go viral in the media. They flaunt their Dr, ScD, MD, PhD, demanding you trust them unconditionally on the basis of those few letters. The scary thing is how many people do and *demand* everyone else does the same.  March 2020 made these title flaunters come out of the woodwork to smugly proclaim themselves the final authority on all virus-related matters. The mainstream media shone a spotlight on them to drive the Covid19 narrative. This isn’t a coincidence. The two draw power from one another.  This text will show you how to research experts/academics and also how to shut them down by asking simple, powerful questions. I will give you a new perspective on titles, close to how an academic sees them. Consider this a vaccine against academic fraud.  By the time you've read through this post, you will know how to:  * spot and shut down a title flaunter * spot a fake study * spot an agenda-driven news article  Scroll all the way down to "Key takeaways" for a TL;DR. This post is [available in PDF form here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o4m22bqttru4i76/How%20to%20shut%20down%20a%20title%20flaunter%20using%20three%20simple%20questions.pdf?dl=0).  # How CNN does it  Let's take [this CNN article](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/07/30/opinions/unvaccinated-americans-self-inflicted-wound-busko/index.html) from July 30, 2021. It quotes Alex Busko, credited as "ER physician and critical care fellow. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, New England Journal of Medicine, Emergency Physicians Monthly and Neurosurgery."  "Has appeared in"? Sounds like rock-solid credentials.  CNN labeled that article as "opinion"; you’ll see why later on. To me, the fact it overwhelmingly links to other CNN articles as sources of information shows it was written by a CNN staff member; Alex Busko might have given a quote or two for it. Who is this guy and why is he on CNN?  # Alex Busko  Let's examine Alex's academic credentials.  [This Doximity web page](https://www.doximity.com/pub/alexander-busko-md) lists him as an author in three published studies, one of which has 6 citations. That 1-page study is [available for free on NCBI here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6439855/). In it, Alex and his co-authors examined 301 cases of death among Florida inmates. They concluded Florida inmates need access to better surgical healthcare. The titles of other studies indicate they are about World War I injuries and motorbike helmet laws.  Alex graduated in 2017. He does grunt work in the ER. His academic track record is piddling. His work experience is minimal. He is in no position to lecture anyone on anything. Why is he on CNN talking about a viral pandemic?  His opinion on viruses, virology, vaccines, and pandemics is worth just as much as mine — it's worthless but I at least know it and try to use logic. Alex is a random nobody, yet he got the CNN spotlight on him to ramble on about the unvaccinated gumming up his precious ER.  Why did he get the spotlight on him? If work in the ER doesn't qualify a person to talk about viruses or a pandemic, what does?  I'll answer the latter question first. To understand qualifications, you need to see the world through the eyes of an academic.  # How academics view one another  There is a definite pecking order among academics based on the quality of work they do. The golden standard of academic work is:  * research funded without conflicts of interest * a peer-reviewed published study based on that research, which should be replicable * the study was cited by other researchers  When academics introduce themselves to one another, their conversation revolves around those three key points. That's how they size each other up and how they know if they're dealing with an authority. Now you know too.  If someone flaunts their titles in an attempt to shut you up, such as Richard does in [this Twitter exchange](https://i.ibb.co/wRtDb5B/Appeal-to-authority-and-circular-argument-a-AGx-KE0-700b.jpg), respond with:  1. When was your last published work? 2. Was it peer reviewed? 3. Does it have any citations?  Silence, changing the topic, or strong emotions are all admission of defeat by the title flaunter. *You* become the academic who pokes holes in a carefully created story. That’s what academics do.  Go back and re-read Richard's replies. He smugly claims to have:  * a degree in medicine * a Fellowship of the RCoA, for which he was examined  Richard doesn't even have an honorary PhD; he was merely *examined* for a Fellowship. He doesn't claim to have passed the exam, which he would had he done so, which means — he failed it. Do you see the kind of smug ignorance we're dealing with?  Richard is a typical title flaunter, just like Alex. When they get the media spotlight, they serve as a pawn in some sort of a maneuver. They both want to be an authority on fighting a pandemic, yet can't even get prestige in their medical fields.  If the flaunter did publish academic work, then it should be examined on its merits. I give an example of it further below.  # The value of PhD  PhDs are worthless in terms of expertise.  At best, all academic titles open the doors for doing serious research *and people in the academia know this*. They don't bother coming out to say it because they'll be exposing themselves to media attacks from profit-making universities interested in churning out indebted, clueless graduates. At worst, they are useless, give a false impression of knowledge, and put the person in debt.  In the US, a student loan debt is backed by the government and can't be discharged through bankruptcy. If the economy were to crash, such as in a pandemic, students holding such debt would become indentured servants to the government, which could rile them up and sic them at someone, say, middle class.  This tactic would be especially effective if the students received a left-leaning or outright communist brainwashing in college. Saying the wrong word to such students would "trigger" them. Oops, did I say the quiet part out loud? Anyway, academics interested in their field have actual work to do, such as research and writing studies. They don’t have time to give interviews or patrol social media posts.  Anyone can get a PhD for any reason. [This article](http://worldhrfederation.com/honorary-doctorate-phd-degrees/) lists some honorary PhD recipients, including Oprah and Denzel Washington. [Kanye West got a PhD](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kanye-west-honorary-doctorate_n_7259938) after mentioning the issuing college in a speech. There are scholarships for all kinds of meaningless titles, such as "[PhD of philosophy in biology](https://i.ibb.co/CndxLRh/fake-Ph-Ds-to-pump-up-that-student-loan-debt-bubble.png)".  In the 1939 movie *The Wizard of Oz*, Scarecrow is a literal strawman buffoon who [gets an honorary PhD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxrlcLktcxU), which shows diplomas were doled out like candy a century ago. When you meet someone who flaunts a PhD, think of Scarecrow — a naive, vain, and brainless person.  # Crab Daddy  PhD holders most often turn to teaching, which brings to mind the saying "[those who can't do, teach](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/Those+who+can%2c+do%3b+those+who+can%27t%2c+teach)". They are the haggard, droning professors who put in minimal effort in their presentation during lectures. They repeat the exact same thing for years on end and get vexed when a student asks a question. If they have some zest in them, they can become media personalities, write books, hold lectures, etc.  Remember Crab Daddy aka. Jordan Peterson? He came out of nowhere in October 2016, when Trump became a serious contender for the White House. Crab Daddy's plan was to present himself as the authority figure and de-radicalize Trump supporters. He got media coverage everywhere, including some hostile interviews (the Cathy Newman one comes to mind).  The media hostility was carefully laid out to endear him to more Trump supporters. He wore a Pepe hoodie and otherwise pandered to his audience. Youtube promoted him, a definite sign that he is a part of the mainstream agenda.  Crab Daddy plastered Soviet propaganda all over his apartment walls, he named his daughter after Mikhail Gorbachev, and hosted unabashed leftists on his podcast. The dude is as hardcore leftist as it gets, giving himself completely to the cause. He gave nonsensical advice, such as "clean your room", simply to distract people and waste their time.  Where is he now? Spent and recovering from his drug addiction. He did his job well, got paid handsomely for it, and now he’s benched. Some other hero will take his place as needed, presumably if another politician tries challenging the narrative.  Do you see how powerful the media are? They can create heroes and monsters out of nothing, they can promote the right person at the right time to make or break politicians. That's the old man pulling levers behind the curtain. The public space is replete with these pawns, who are sacrificed whenever the need arises. If they are in a media spotlight, it's because they are a part of an agenda.  # CNN's self-reference  I hope you'll now read articles with a fresh set of eyes. Everything said in Alex Busko's CNN article is there for a reason. You can find a lot of gems there if you take your time to dig them out. For example, the article has 15 links, 11 of which are back to CNN.  This is called [circular reasoning](https://fallacyinlogic.com/circular-reasoning/). It gives CNN control over the narrative; if you mostly or exclusively refer to yourself, there's no limit to what you can conclude.  There's one worthwhile link in the article, that to a [study of Covid19 impact on pregnant women](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2779182). It studied 2,130 pregnant women in 18 countries, finding that Covid19 significantly increased illness and death risk for both the mom and the baby.  My first question was — why spread the study across 18 countries? I presume there are at least 2,000 pregnant women in the UK, Spain or the US.  My second question was — why such a small sample size? Again, I presume this pandemic would affect at least 200,000 pregnant women with Covid19 worldwide.  The answer to both is in this part of the study:  "Models for \[illness and death\] were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity."  In plain English:  "We spread the study across countries to muddy the data and then massaged it to fit the conclusion, which was that Covid19 is the scariest disease known to man."  The study ran March–October 2020, which points to rushed work made to justify a ready-made conclusion. It was cited 66 times, revealing that the number of citations is irrelevant if the methodology is flawed.  This leads me to the next segment — academic fraud.  # Brainless strawmen with degrees  Academic fraud is pervasive; now it's amplified by the media. The Covid19 ruse distracted us from the real problem, that of academic fraud coupled with the power of the media. Fake scientists with fake degrees come out of the woodwork to convince us that night is day and up is down, to tell us fanciful stories, or waste our time. The perfect example of it is [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson).  He received 14 medals, published books on astrophysics, featured in *Sharknado* movies, *Family Guy*, and *Futurama*. He has *twenty* honorary PhDs, which sounds like he's an accomplished academic, yet scroll down in his Wikipedia article and you'll see his last three published studies were in 2007 and 2008. Before that, he published 10 studies between 1985–1998.  He has 14.5 million followers on Twitter, where he posts brain fart tweets, such as that [flying reindeer are scientifically impossible](https://i.ibb.co/vmCS5kz/Ndg-T-fact-checking-Santa.png) in a futile attempt to fact-check Santa. Customs associated with other religions are curiously spared of his derision. [In a tweet from 2015](https://i.ibb.co/DpqYL57/Ndg-T-violets-tweet-2015.png), NdgT said violets are violet, not blue, [which he repeated in 2017](https://i.ibb.co/xM8KBTy/Ndg-T-violets-tweet-2017.png) for his drooling followers who missed it.  The guy is of average or below-average intelligence, but thanks to the media spotlight, he has an aura of a genius. He's the perfect media personality to baffle you with nonsense until you zone out, at which point you get drip-fed the propaganda. Listen to a few minutes of [NdgT's appearance on Joe Rogan](https://youtu.be/vGc4mg5pul4?t=830) to hear it in action.  He and people like him are given undue attention to occupy the public space and taint the public exchange of ideas. NdgT becomes the trend-setter, bringing everything down to his level. If someone does oppose the narrative, the mainstream media can pull up NdgT and 50 people like him to debunk, fact-check, or simply ridicule the person without losing any credibility.  Yet, NdgT and his ilk are just tools, nothing else. If he steps out of line, he will be Arya Stark’d by a few conveniently edited (i.e. completely fake) audio recordings, e-mails or chat messages.  As for minnows like Alex Busko, CNN features them to bolster its credibility while grooming theirs. The article with Alex is labeled as "opinion", so if anything in it gets debunked, he will suffer. No big deal for the suits, he's disposable. If not, he gets maneuvered to better serve the narrative.  When the mainstream media need a familiar face to drive the narrative 5, 10, or 20 years down the line, they feature NdgT, Alex, Fauci, or someone like them because they are established figures and nobody dares question their credentials. This is actually the perfect litmus test for nonsense — when you see someone like NdgT, Alex, or Fauci featured in the media, you know it's a scam.  # Conclusion  The entire world was locked down based on [a single study by Neil Ferguson](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf), published March 16, 2020. That same day, the study appeared in the media and the entire world went bananas. All the lockdown measures he proposed in the study were immediately adopted by governments. The code he used to simulate the outcome? [Eviscerated](https://dailysceptic.org/code-review-of-fergusons-model/) in a code review, seeing how it is a single file with 15,000 lines of code that uses GOTO commands.  It's a travesty what he did but it wouldn't have an impact without the media to publicize it. This is what fake academics can do. [Neil Ferguson was on the team](https://theoligarchkings.wordpress.com/2020/04/25/media-models-and-masters-who-is-to-blame/) that spurred the Mad Cow Disease scare in 1996, driving a cattle-killing frenzy. [Fauci is similarly linked to the AIDS scare](https://www.aier.org/article/fauci-was-duplicitous-on-the-aids-epidemic-too/) in 1983.  Can you see it? Do you see it? Fake scientists set the world agenda if nobody challenges them. They will keep doing it their entire lives. The media will help them whenever they make a deal nobody can back out of, just like we have right now. The third part of the unholy trifecta are the corrupt, inept politicians, but I think they don’t have the power we imagine.  Everyone can criticize science. Everyone *should* criticize science, especially people outside of it, because people on the inside don't want to rock the boat. Anecdotes from former lab workers all tell the same thing, "I had a cushy job but I couldn't stand massaging the data and churning out fake results like all of my colleagues could".  People who understand science have neglected their duty to criticize it. There's only us, the people on the outside, and a small number of disillusioned lab workers. That's all right, because we can take up that duty, asking simple questions to shut down the title flaunters.  Thank you for reading my post. It took me over 25 hours of writing to compile and refine my thoughts but it's still only my opinion. I'm aware there are bots, shills, agents, and plain trolls who will skim through it in 5 seconds, posting inflammatory replies to stir up trouble and derail the discussion. As a bonus feature of this post, I propose a way to weed them out — in your comments, include the phrase "in my opinion" to indicate you've read all the way through my post. So, you can write "IMO", "my opinion is", "as far as opinions go, here's mine", or a variation of that phrase. Ignore comments without that phrase.  # Key takeaways  * Academic titles, such as PhD, don't provide expertise * Anyone flaunting a title is a naive fool (think Scarecrow from *The Wizard of Oz*) * Content featuring a title flaunter is a scam * Academics value published, peer-reviewed studies * A study that's difficult to replicate, uses weird parameters, and reaches broad conclusions is 100% fake * Shut down title flaunters by asking about their published studies * If Google recommends someone, it's a hardcore lefty * Talk with people worth your time	1642885115.0	sabyoe	/r/conspiracy/comments/sabyoe/how_to_deal_with_title_flaunters_using_three/	How to deal with title flaunters using three simple questions

nbxw0	I'm only 16:00 minutes into it, and I can tell this guy knows nothing. His body language, and his ADHD like brain jumping around because he doesn't want to get into details. He hides behind them as if there's no way Joe or Jamie would know anything about computers, programming, etc. It's pretty obvious that this dude has a very basic understanding of what's going on and doesn't understand the complexity of what's going on with google, Microsoft, apple . ..  He literally laughs when asked to go into detail and goes straight to fear mongering, "If you knew HALF of what I know" blah blah.

75rksrbe	If you haven't heard already, one medical provider sued another to prevent their medical staff from taking new jobs with better pay and better benefits, insisting they stay at the hospital they work now.  This has been on reddit for a couple days now, at first there was just the case filed, but then the judge actually granted the order preventing these new employees from going to work at Ascension.  So first off, it's definitely a real case, you can look it up on the WI court website:  [https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetail.html?caseNo=2022CV000068&countyNo=44&index=0](https://wcca.wicourts.gov/caseDetail.html?caseNo=2022CV000068&countyNo=44&index=0)  Everybody was pretty shocked in the first post I read, just detailing that ThedaCare had filed this lawsuit in the first place.  This is obviously pretty bad press; if you google 'ThedaCare WI Outagamie,' all the results are news articles for this now.  The optics are obviously terrible, and assume any CEO involved would be smart enough to understand the optics when something like almost certainly went viral.  I only really saw one way this could actually happen: ThedaCare CEO is a Free Mason, and was confident he could get a friendly FM judge and a quick order in his favor. I posted as much in the first post I saw about it.  Vio la, a day later, they got the restraining order...  We are constantly talking about our crooked local and state leaders and bureaucrats here on the internet, and constantly focused on Democrats or Republicans, but really, for any of you that know your states well, these guys are embedded up and down in state and local governments and major local institutions like our hospitals, courts, sheriff's orgs, etc.  I can't even imagine how anything else could make this make sense.  Who would chase this restraining order unless they were ridiculously overconfident it would be granted? It's pretty savage to prevent these people from working anywhere because they quit.  If you think this is nonsense, what is your theory?  I'll admit I don't know WI so well, but I did got to college in our capital here in Florida, and I assure you, the Free Masons run everything here.  We didn't have a single sheriff in all of Tallahassee that wasn't a Free Mason.  No-one else will even bother with this angle, even though there is definitely potential merit to it, so I posted.  If you wanted to see how crooked these guys really are and how fast something like this evaporates when people look in the right direction, I would ask you guys to write the local players in this, like the judge, the hospital CEO (who is in Ohio apparently) the three lawyers who took the case.  Write the WI Free Masons and simply just ask them if they are involved in this trading of people like Livestock.  You have no idea how simple these guys have it, hire one of your boys, write a proposed order, judge says 'sure sounds good' doesn't even have to figure out how to settle it, they just accept the proposed order.  So, end rant, but if you want answers to how magnificent garbage like this actually happens, ask more questions.	1642888794.0	sad9y8	/r/conspiracy/comments/sad9y8/thedacare_vs_ascension_a_pretty_crazy_lawsuit/	ThedaCare Vs Ascension - A Pretty Crazy Lawsuit

But that still doesn't explain why there is such a big change in narrative. There is a difference between reducing restrictions and just outright removing the vax mandates they worked so hard to push on people with their propaganda.   I'm beginning to wonder if the elites decided "okay, enough people have gotten the vax for the depopulation agenda and unrest is starting to grow, could as well end this now."   In any case, it seems odd they would just do such a 180 on the mandatory vax thing.	1642889403.0	sadi68	/r/conspiracy/comments/sadi68/why_are_the_elites_suddenly_dropping_vax_mandates/	Why are the elites suddenly dropping vax mandates?

koil22s	Just having a conversation over a beer with a good friend of mine. Neither of us are vaccinated and neither of us could come up with a credible reason for masks or for any of the lockdowns. Nothing made sense, until another friend mentioned about smart cities in China and the social scoring systems they use.  Looking at what's happened over the last 18months, CCTV systems and passive crowd monitoring systems have been installed as standard in just about all major retail and hospitality establishments. We have 5G upgraded networks to cope with the extra data and a system that requires a huge sample size for training algorithms and to extract useful and actionable information from all the data.  Now coupled with the fact that we have had a period of time with masks on, then masks off and now masks on again, it's safe to assume that sample that size would allow most biometric systems to utilise data points on a very small cross section of the face.  I don't think the vaccines are safe and they have created opportunity for big pharma to make a huge amount of cas. However, I think the big play is the reduction of civil liberties and freedoms that we have given up to be able to go on holiday.  For me this is an extremely smart approach to mass surveillance on a scale noone ever thought possible, much bigger than seen before and global.

34ui3j7b	Excerpt from free ebook:  One interesting question which I asked to Mary at around the same time as when I was picking her brain about the afterlife was if she was a Buddha or not.  She moved the planchette to both “yes” and “no.”  And that puzzled me.  But I didn’t feel confident enough in myself yet regarding our dialogues together to ask her as to how she determined the antithesis fluctuated answer of “yes” and “no.”  So I moved on with my questions.  I asked her if she was an angel.  Again she moved the planchette to both “yes” and “no.”  So then I grew some balls, the self-confident kind, and I asked her why she said both “yes” and “no.”  She answered, “I am [an angel] but I don’t go by that label.”  What I really wanted to know, was whether she was a Buddha or not.  So without delay, I nonchalantly, as to not seem too enthusiastic, probed further as to if it was the same deal with respect to the label of Buddha.  And she answered, “Yes.”  So I concluded that she very well might be a Buddha, perhaps a pratyekabuddha.  A pratyekabuddha is a Buddha who becomes a Buddha by figuring out enlightenment more or less on their own rather than using spiritual teachers.

era5ccwe	The other day I was watching superstore and noticed that 2 of the main characters, Dina and Garret were FAT. This isn't typical from NBC. Whenever a character is fat in NBC their personalities usually reflect that. Like Jack in 30rock, who was a top level executive, or Stanley Hudson in the Office, who was always very lazy. But these 2 characters Garret and Dina have nothing in their personalities that reflect their fatness. This got me thinking, why are these 2 seemingly normal characters fat? It's almost as if NBC is trying to normalize being fat. But wait, they are.

So if canadians are complaining about the food shortage just know that this is the most effective way to protest it . The truckers protesting and holding out will do more then walking around at freedom rallys ever will. Times like these we need to completely not comply and sometimes do things that may damage or interfere in everyday life but will benefit us in the future . Just thought id shsre some good news since all we hear about in Canada is straight up tyranny and segregation.

jddmo	 There's two such sects in the European historic record.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbateans  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankism  They both believed moral depravity was the path to salvation. The more depraved, the better. Incest, pedophilia, murder, all holy acts.   The current variant of the same idea is The Left Hand path of occultism, in which you deep dive into the world of sensation, seeking pleasure wherever you please with no regard for free will: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_path_and_right-hand_path  We also have non jewish sects following the same basic idea, such as The Order of The Nine Angles: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Nine_Angles  The Marc Dutrox case in Belgium exposed another, Abrasax: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Dutroux  Magnee also asserted that the prosecutors did not follow up on evidence pointing to a cult called "Abrasax", which allegedly performed human sacrifices.[49] In a wooden house owned by Bernard Weinstein, a letter was found from the occult sect "Abrasax", in which a gift for Dominique Kindermans, the high priestress,[50] was mentioned, consisting of 17 girls between the age of 2 and 20 for anal, oral and vaginal sex. It was signed by priest "Anubis".[citation needed] This priest was later identified as Francis De Smedt.[citation needed] Later investigations showed that four policemen in Charleroi were also members of the sect; one was even the treasurer.[51] The headquarters of Institut Abrasax in Rue Emile Vandervelde 223 Forchies La Marche was raided in 1996 by 150 officers. Video of the raid showed police taking away bags of papers, video cassettes and a refrigerator. They also took away black magic ritual implements and human skulls.[50]  Enjoy the rabbit hole, it probably ends very close to prominent individuals such as Epstein and Weinstein, John of God, Marc Brunel, Jimmy Saville, Marina Abramović and a bunch of current powerplayers we don't know yet.	1642899316.0	sah1hc	/r/conspiracy/comments/sah1hc/those_who_believe_evil_is_good/	Those who believe evil is good.

7wlaje0t	This one is kinda weird, so I suggest if you're not a fan of spiritual stuff you skip to the part where I talk about the website. So it all began when I(16 male) was meditating and I was searching for a purpose. It wasn't that out of the ordinary, but all of a sudden I heard words that said "alume zagnata dogma cu bu". At first, I was laughing at what gibberish it could be, but then I got a hunch to search up the meaning. Searching this up sent me to a completely random site called Dexonline. ro. The website wasn't so sketchy but as I skimmed through I notices many spiritual quotes and other stuff. It wasn't that out of the ordinary until I visited its social pages. It's filled with pictures and videos which I think give off a sinister meaning. I'm not quite sure how to send pictures on here due to my inexperience on Reddit, but I think it has a deeper meaning and it should be looked into.	1642900238.0	sahcp0	/r/conspiracy/comments/sahcp0/what_is_dexonlinero/	What is Dexonline.ro?

1guci2fy	So, I'm sure you've all noticed by now, but reddit very recently added "real time" features like "X people are here" and "X people are typing."  I hate this. I hate everything about it. I'm using mobile reddit for Android btw, in case anyone is curious.   Let me explain why I came here to this sub about it, as it's the same reason I hate it. Real time chat/activity monitors like this are 100% geared towards "improving engagement in the community." It even says so in the [official statements from reddit](https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/01/reddit-introduces-new-real-time-features-including-typing-and-comment-indicators/) about these changes.   But this doesn't mean what we think it means (or at least, that isn't the *only* thing it means), and some of the implications and drive behind these changes are incredibly harmful to us.   What people think this means: "I'll have a better, more interactive experience now!"   What this really means for reddit: "Everyone will spend WAY more time here now!"   Why this is bad: Real-time engagement messages are one of the leading causes of [social media addiction.](https://www.addictioncenter.com/drugs/social-media-addiction/)  The psychological manipulation that results from telling people how many users are interacting with or responding to their posts and comments in real-time is one the contributing factors of my biggest issues with social media platforms on the whole. The ethical issues surrounding data mining of user information and the intended dependency of platform users that goes along with it is *exactly* why reddit is literally the only social media I still use, and was already on the fence about using even this one. I chose to keep reddit when I deleted literally every other social media account I ever had, because at least here I could choosewhat I interacted with and turn off some of the most harmful features, like push notifications. I'm now rethinking that decision, especially since there is not, as of yet, a way to even disable these new features.   When humans see other humans interacting with their content like this, it triggers a dopamine response that very quickly becomes addictive, and so many people don't even realize how addicted we all are to it. We're social creatures, and we crave social interaction. Things like adding "like" and "upvote" buttons started this trend. As software developers began to see drastic increases in the amount of time people were spending using their software after the advent of the Facebook "like" button, they found ways to increase this effect - with the intention of increasing overall use ofthe platform to contribute to their mining data for capital gain through ad clicks and database sales.   In layman's terms, the longer you spend on a platform, the more you interact with it.  The more you interact with it, the more time they have to A - gather data about your interests, personality, patterns of emotional response, keywords you type often, topics that interest you etc. And B - the more time they have to use that information about you to send personalized ads straight to your screen, upping the chances you'll click those ads. But the ad revenue is just a by-product. What they're making money off of is how much of *your attention span and personal info* they can get. And they're raking it in, hand over fist.   Features like these were created as a way to get people more and more and even more addicted to the dopamine rush caused by that feeling of "people see me, people hear me, people *like* me!" caused by things like karma, upvotes, and now real-time indicators.   And I hate it. I think it's time to just get rid of reddit, too.	1642900758.0	sahipa	/r/conspiracy/comments/sahipa/i_really_hate_the_new_realtime_indicators_reddit/	I really hate the new real-time indicators reddit added.
3m0wj5cu	It’s easy to get lost in the sauce. When consuming so much information as us truth seekers do, which often *must* be propaganda and disinformation, for research purposes, we can get caught up in false ideas. It can be difficult to remain dispassionate about conspiracy theories because they are so exciting in how, if true, could be reality changing. When you change your map of reality, your belief system, your whole world changes. I could go on and on but I just wanted to share a quick though because I don’t make posts on here often and I love the genuine truth seekers in our community.	1642901010.0	sahlm4	/r/conspiracy/comments/sahlm4/dont_forget_to_see_the_bigger_picture_and_trust/	Don’t forget to see the bigger picture and trust in your intuition.

ese9r4ml	Ok I’ll admit that I myself love conspiracy theories whether plausible or not. It’s fun to go down those rabbit holes. But, I believe this is not a conspiracy, our system is failing and about to crumble. No matter who’s at fault, who’s in control blah blah, it doesn’t matter cuz the result is the same. My question is… wtf do we do? In my head we are facing the collapse of our current state of society. Realistically, in my head, I think soon our infrastructure is going to collapse and not over time like in a single moment. Randomly (or not randomly depending on who you think is in control again tho results are the same) everything will end. All of the sudden power goes out which includes everything. Phones internet tv running water, everything a general normal person relies on. And I personally believe and I may be wrong, who knows, but if this were to happen, what do we do?	1642902338.0	sai1di	/r/conspiracy/comments/sai1di/what_do_we_do_if/	What do we do if?

49zu17v7	Okay so I know this is a common conspiracy but I wanted to post my experience here because it is weird.  Apparently, I had COVID twice.  The entirety of 2020 I did not get COVID. In 2021, a week before my uni classes started,  I was taking care of a family member for a week. It was just me and her at the house and I only left the house ONCE to Walmart to buy something and I had my mask on the entire time. The next day after the Walmart trip I ran outside in the rain to rescue my dog from getting wet. I went back inside the cold house and stupidly enough didn't cover myself or warm myself up. I stayed cold and wet.   About 2 days after that, my throat started hurting (like it normally does when I get sick). I went to CVS the next morning after that to get the take-home test. It came out positive. I didn't believe it so my bf and I (I had kissed him the day I felt my throat hurt) went to get tested at some place. The results were supposed to be given 1-2 days later but it was given to us 2 weeks later (they were positive for me and negative for him).  However, since that place was taking long to give us the results, I had gone back to uni and got a test taken at the uni's health center. I ended up being positive. I accepted my fate and was sick for like a week or two with a horrible fever, cough, body chills, and the whole work. I still had my sense of taste and smell but it just felt like a really bad flu.  Fast forward to January 2022. A week before classes started back up again I was back home staying at my bf's place and with our usual group of friends. Everything was good and well, none of us felt bad. Except for one day we went outside and it was freezing and I was not wearing the warmest of clothes. The next day after that, I took a shower and stupidly went outside in the cold to throw away the trash and do some other stuff.  About 2 days later, my throat started hurting again. Classes had started already and my throat was hurting the second day of classes. The third day, i skipped out because my nose was stuffy and I was beginning to cough a little bit. I went to CVS to get tested and the results came back positive, but 2-3 days later after feeling initial symptoms (which I thought was the common cold) I am already feeling better.  I feel like this time around is a false positive because I put that I'm feeling basic cold symptoms. I am gonna go back to the health center to get tested and see if it comes out positive. I honestly don't feel bad and I have NOT had a fever like last. My bf and the people I was hanging out around with are fine and they're not sick. I assumed it was a common cold for going outside in freezing weather right after a shower.  Some days I feel crazy but other days I don't. I didn't know where else to write it but here. I also have no idea where I would have gotten it because I was always with my bf or someone and no one is sick.   TLDR; Got sick with COVID twice. Both times happened two days after getting wet and going into a cold environment. I originally thought it was common cold but apparently not.	1642905226.0	saiz3l	/r/conspiracy/comments/saiz3l/false_positive/	False Positive?

m2qc1	They came for Twitter, and I declined to comment. They came for YouTube, and I just watched, albeit grudgingly. And now they are going after podcasting, one of the last media frontiers. And I'm finally pissed off.  I don't agree with Joe Rogan's covid stance. I don't agree with Malone, or other similar guests he's spotlighted. I don't even listen to Rogan's podcast except when it is discussed as being controversial for some reason.  But look at the fucking language in this [NPR piece](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/21/1074442185/joe-rogan-doctor-covid-podcast-spotify-misinformation), and then tell me TPTB aren't absolutely intent clamping, tamping, muzzling, and controlling the totality of the public  narrative, up to, and including all of it's backwaters and outposts.  Podcasts are a bit like the Old West. They can be a little wild. They are in largely unmoderated territory. And the vast majority of them are innocuous. They don't need policing to this extent.   Rogan smoking out and having stupid conversations with guests of dubious distinction and questionable credentials? Harmless. If the public is that vulnerable to persuasion the problem is way bigger than Rogan's podcast...  This is another coordinated fucking effort to stop people talking about shit they don't want them to talk about. Regardless of what it is. That's the real conspiracy here.  It's true, I don't care about covid conspiracies, but I don't want every fucking thing I hear to get filtered by the Supreme Intelligence first, thanks.  We need a public channel that is free of control. They are cutting them all off. The Podcast police force is being mobilized, in the name of public safety, and it's all bullshit. I can't be the only one who has been sitting on the sidelines, keeping quiet this whole time who will start speaking out as more free discussion spaces disappear.	1642907243.0	sajlso	/r/conspiracy/comments/sajlso/the_podcaster_is_in_your_ear_she_said_its_a/	"The podcaster is in your ear," she said.

This is a cycle which repeats, I believe this to be the last “great reset” before finally Jesus defeats evil forever. The Bible says “there is nothing new under the sun” which to me says that any “new” inventions have already been invented before.  Everything we see today like space shuttles,  computers, etc have all been “invented” before. This is why we see remnants of technology in times past, it’s not that “aliens” have visited us, it’s that humanity has reached these heights before.

bsn8gv5a	It seems obvious to me that there would be controlled opposition, so the question is: who? I think Robert Malone is one of them. Here's my reasoning:  &#x200B;  Nothing he has said has been particularly significant; he hasn't proved anything or revealed anything bad about the vaccines or anything like that. I very much agree with him in terms of his opposition to lockdowns, masks, the vax, etc, but that's basically it.  &#x200B;  Not only that, on some issues, he goes along with the covid narrative. For instance, he [stated that he had had long-covid](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/), but long covid is already acknowledged to be a hoax [\[1\]](https://mobile.twitter.com/benryanwriter/status/1457743480864878599) [\[2\]](https://mobile.twitter.com/TracyBethHoeg/status/1472670567228600320) in the medical literature. He also pretends that covid is a serious issue; for instance, he stated that he had [had it twice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8q4lqKpdQk), which is weird to me.  &#x200B;  Lastly, the media is willing to report about him openly. AP had an [article](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-health-joe-rogan-ap-fact-check-a87b1044c6256968dcc33886a36c949f) that had a picture of him, and Forbes used his name in the title of an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2022/01/02/what-is-mass-formation-psychosis-robert-malone-makes-covid-19-vaccine-claims-on-joe-rogan-show/?sh=4693f6901d4c). If they were threatened by him, they would not be willing to report openly on him. Compare him to guys like Mike Yeadon who the media is entirely unwilling to report on.  &#x200B;  TLDR: Robert Malone is not our guy.

950s3wbj	Some of the truth community has bought into the keto/carnivore hole. We crave sugar for a reason. The fact the we can taste even sweetness and have a deep joy for it is completely biological. We have similar ancestors to frugivorous species. Our teeth are the same, we share 95% of our DNA with them, our biological Order is Primate, etc. Even our eyesight, the fact that we can see the entire rainbow, is an adaptation for finding fruits. Human breast milk even contains more carbohydrates and less fat than other animals.   "The position that humans occupy in the animal kingdom is that of the Primate order, which means that, from the point of view of anthropology, our closest animal relatives are the anthropoid apes (anthropoid means “resembling man” or “man-like”). This species includes gorillas, monkeys and chimps all of whom are classified as frugivores. From the perspective of physiology, our human biology and digestion most closely resemble our closest cousin in the animal kingdom, the orangutan. Even our DNA genetic material is well over 95% identical."  "Here are the facts for further dispute: Comparing the anatomy of carnivores with our own clearly illustrates that we were not designed to eat meat. Starting at the beginning of the digestive tract, our teeth, nails, and jaw structure indicate that nature intended for humans to eat a plant-based diet. We have short, thin fingernails and pathetically small “canine” teeth. In contrast, carnivores all have sharp claws and large canine teeth capable of tearing flesh.  The jaws of carnivores move only up and down, requiring them to tear chunks of flesh from their prey and swallow it whole. Humans and other herbivores can move our jaws up and down and from side to side, a movement that allows us to grind up fruit and vegetables with our back teeth. Those molars are flat and allow the grinding of fibrous plant foods. Carnivores lack these flat molars.  Carnivores swallow their food whole, relying on their extremely acidic stomach juices to do most of the digestive work and to kill the pathogens that would otherwise sicken or kill them. Humans and other herbivores have digestive enzymes in our saliva—unlike carnivores—so our stomach acids are much weaker.  Carnivores have short intestinal tracts and colons that allow meat to pass through it relatively quickly, before it has a chance to rot and cause illness. Humans, like other herbivores, have intestinal tracts that are much longer than comparably-sized carnivores, allowing the body more time to break down fiber and absorb the nutrients from a plant-based diet."   "Carolus Linnaeus: “To say that humans have the anatomical structure of an omnivore is an egregiously inaccurate statement." The great taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus, (1707-1778), a Swedish naturalist and botanist who established the modern scientific method of classifying plants and animals, classified humans not as carnivores, not as omnivores, nor even as herbivores, but as frugivores. Linnaeus writes: Man’s structure, internal and external compared with that of the other animals, shows that fruit and succulent vegetables are his natural food. A few anthropologists have risen above their biases; one such is Jared Diamond, a professor of anthropology at UCLA. Diamond has written that the notion of man the hunter is a romantic myth: big-game hunting added little to our food intake until after we had evolved fully modern anatomy and behavior. Instead, our earliest ancestors lived on the wild fruit, nuts, seeds and tubers that they gathered. Mr. Diamond puts it succinctly: I doubt the usual view that hunting was the driving force behind our uniquely human brain and societies. For most of our history, we were not mighty hunters but rather sophisticated baboons. And what food makes up the bulk of baboon diet? Fruit, of course; so for most of their history, humans were fruitarians.”—–Rynn Berry www.whale.to/a/frugivore_h.html Herbert M. Shelton: I do not intend to enter into any lengthy discussion of comparative anatomy and physiology at this place, but will content myself with saying that every anatomical, physiological and embryo-logical feature of man definitely places him in the class frugivore. The number and structure of his teeth, the length and structure of his digestive tract, the position of his eyes, the character of his nails, the functions of his skin, the character of his saliva, the relative size of his liver, the number and position of the milk glands, the position and structure of the sexual organs, the character of the human placenta and many other factors all bear witness to the fact that man is constitutionally a frugivore. As there are no pure frugivores, all frugivores eating freely of green leaves and other parts of plants, man may, also, without violating his constitutional nature, partake of green plants. These parts of plants possess certain advantages, as has been previously pointed out, in which fruits are deficient. Actual tests have shown that the addition of green vegetables to the fruit and nut diet improves the diet."  These are just a small portion of the info from this website here: https://michaeljloomis.com/humans-ancestors-were-frugivores/  It is a good read and has lots of information.	1642909945.0	sakfll	/r/conspiracy/comments/sakfll/low_carbhigh_fatcarnivore_diets_have_been_pushed/	Low Carb/high fat/carnivore diets have been pushed on the Truth community to shorten your lifespans

There was also another post where someone was talking about eating 3 times a day. And that very morning before they posted I was also thinking about that.   This question has been rattling in my brain for quite some time cos my son has asked for specific songs and as soon as I turn the radio on the next song will be exactly the one he was asking for.

3wyovwou	Okay, so hear me out. What if the government (or whoever) put the coronavirus in the at home tests kits?   Here’s my theory:  COVID-19 was released into the general population, the government needed to monitor infection rate, symptoms, mutations, ect… So, the first round of tests were the control to accurately monitor those factors.   Now they have identified different variants and how the virus is moving among the population. The Omicron variant has not been as deadly as the other variants. Now is the perfect opportunity to distribute FREE at home test kits that could possibly contain a stronger strain of the coronavirus. Not all at home tests will be contaminated but the majority will be.   So much money has been made from COVID-19 so why would the government want to stop that now? Mask mandates are almost nonexistent and the quarantine time is continuously being reduced.   Just some food for thought.	1642913955.0	salnfs	/r/conspiracy/comments/salnfs/covid19_at_home_tests/	COVID-19 At Home Tests

caq5aau	CIA has concentration camps inside USA. One is Homan Square in Chicago but there are multiples. A few in Chicago and Portland. They mostly target black teenagers for eugenics. This is not really a conspiracy theory, it's almost a conspiracy fact now.  &#x200B;  Take the following news with grain of salt because infowars is a conspiracy theory website which posted this- Peter Daszak was a CIA informant and CIA wanted Eco Health Alliance to fund gain of function research. What Dr Fauci and Daszak wanted to do was so risky even DARPA partially rejected the plan. So CIA had to fund labs in Wuhan, they wanted to spray bats in caves with bat-only coronavirus in a way so that the virus in the bats will mutate and will be able to infect humans.  &#x200B;  Now this makes sense in retrospect. Bill Gates and Prince Andrew were hanging with Epstein after he was convicted. That's not a theory, it's a fact.  But why? Eugenics.  Most eugenics program target black people but Epstein targeted white teenagers. He probably wanted a white supremacist breeding technique or something.  This ties in the whole story. CIA ran eugenics on black teenagers in Chicago, Epstein and Mossad ran eugenics on white teenagers, and CIA funded research on bats and Chinese citizens whose organ are being harvested. It all makes sense in retrospect.  And that is why Ghislaine Maxwell lawyers may even succeed getting mistrial. Maybe she has data about eugenics which the CIA wants.	1642914349.0	sals3l	/r/conspiracy/comments/sals3l/let_me_get_this_straight_usa_wants_to_fight/	Let me get this straight.

gr3apobx	Shi Zhengli – The Wuhan Institute of Virology director known as “Bat Woman” – coauthored a paper that was published in Nature on February 3rd, 2020. ([link](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7))  The paper identified a bat coronavirus known as RaTG13 as the closest known match to SARS-CoV-2 (96.2% identical). The only background information that the paper gave on RaTG13 is that it was discovered in horseshoe bats from China’s Yunnan province.  Two days later a different paper is published by different authors and uses limited sequencing data to identify what they believe to be a 98.7% match to SARS-CoV-2. ([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7033720/))  The virus they identified is known as BtCov/4991 – a coronavirus which also circulates in horseshoe bats.   A paper from 2016 is later discovered to reveal that Shi Zhengli (the same virologist who identified RaTG13) is also the one who originally discovered BtCov/4991. ([link](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12250-016-3713-9))  This paper states that BtCov/4991 was found in an abandoned mineshaft in Yunnan – the same Chinese province where RaTG13 was discovered. The paper also revealed further sequencing data for BtCov/4991 which showed that its genome was identical to RaTG13.  It has since been confirmed by Shi Zhengli that RaTG13 and BtCov/4911 are the same virus. ([link](https://www.science.org/content/article/trump-owes-us-apology-chinese-scientist-center-covid-19-origin-theories-speaks-out))   Shi Zhengli claims that the name of the virus was changed prior to publishing the February 2020 article in Nature in order to reflect the time and location that the original sample was collected. However, it is still unclear why Shi Zhengli didn’t initially acknowledge that RaTG13 was first discovered in 2016.   Furthermore, none of the papers used to make these discoveries include any explanation about why scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology were collecting samples from this particular mineshaft in the first place.  Then a small excerpt from a Scientific American article is found to reveal that Shi Zhengli was called to investigate a mineshaft in Mojiang in 2012 after an outbreak of “pneumonialike disease” among miners that were working in the cave. ([link](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-chinas-bat-woman-hunted-down-viruses-from-sars-to-the-new-coronavirus1/))  Mojiang is located in Yunnan – the same Chinese province where BtCov/4911 was first discovered in an abandoned mineshaft.  Further details regarding this pneumonia-like disease were discovered in a medical thesis that was extracted from a Chinese database using usernames and passwords discovered online by internet investigators looking into the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic. ([link](https://twitter.com/TheSeeker268/status/1270359698898923529))  The thesis reveals that blood samples taken from the miners tested positive for SARS antibodies and that their pneumonia was caused by a coronavirus infection.  *What could this mean?*  We know that the miners experienced symptoms that were nearly identical to SARS-CoV2 and that they were infected by a pneumonia-causing coronavirus. We also know that the closest known match to SARS-CoV-2 was later discovered in horseshoe bats from the same exact cave.   However, a key difference is that none of the miners in 2012 passed their infections on to other people.   We also know that SARS-CoV-2 is the only known betacoronaviruses in its lineage to contain a furin cleavage site at S1/S2 on its spike protein. However, furin cleavage sites are found in a number of other coronaviruses that exist in nature.   It is believed that the furin cleavage site is the key mechanism of human infection for SARS-CoV-2.   We also know that a grant proposal from the EcoHealth Alliance – an American organization which funds research at the Wuhan Insititue of Virology – was leaked online in 2021. The proposal was found to have been smuggled into an area for classified federal documents despite being an unclassified document and having no record of how it ended up there.   The leaked proposal from 2018 revealed that EcoHealth Alliance had plans to take furin cleavage sites from coronaviruses found in nature and insert them into novel SARS-like coronaviruses being studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Shi Zhengli directs the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.	1642914392.0	salsiz	/r/conspiracy/comments/salsiz/six_chinese_miners_experienced_viral_pneumonia/	Six Chinese miners experienced viral pneumonia after working in an abandoned mineshaft in 2012.

2zdmthu1	>Researchers use CRISPR to create a biosynthetic dual-core computer within human cells  The CRISPR gene editing system has been one of the most controversial technologies to appear in recent years. From bringing an end to genetic diseases to helping us create tastier, more resilient crops, CRISPR has however already found a wide variety of applications in many different fields. And now, we can also add synthetic biology to this list, thanks to a team of researchers from ETH Zurich, who used CRISPR to build functional dual-core biocomputers within human cells.  To achieve this, the researchers first had to create a modified version of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Rather than making cuts in the genome, this modified version uses a special variant of the Cas9 protein that acts as a processor to read input delivered by guide RNA sequences, regulate the expression of a particular gene, and make a particular protein as an output. Furthermore, by using CRISPR-Cas9 components from two different bacteria, the researchers were able to integrate two processor cores into a single cell, creating the world’s first biological dual-core processor."  https://blog.richardvanhooijdonk.com/en/how-close-are-we-to-organic-computers/	1642915710.0	sam5p1	/r/conspiracy/comments/sam5p1/so_whats_the_possibility_of_the_vaccines_being/	So what's the possibility of the "vaccines'' being used as a front to create organic computers in the hopes of creating a future network out of the human race aka the metaverse? quite high IMHO.

To provide support for his beliefs, the  Member prepared for his students a self-titled “Zionism slideshow”, used  over multiple days of classes."  "Given the amount of time the Member dedicated to his own  instructional content, the class had fallen far behind the required  units of material to be covered in the course."  ..."the School administration organized a school trip to \[XXX\] where  students would be visiting World War II sites, including a concentration  camp. In the weeks leading up to the planned trip, the Member openly  disparaged the upcoming trip as “propaganda” by the “powers that be.”"  ..."also took a particular, personal interest in 9/11 conspiracy  theories and spent a significant amount of class time sharing these  theories with his students."  ..."taught his students that the Israeli military orchestrated the  9/11 attacks, with assistance from elements within the U.S. government,  and had used controlled detonations to collapse the World Trade towers."  ..."remarked to one of his colleagues at the school that “…if some  people actually understood who was pulling the strings, and the truth  came out – antisemitism will return with a ferocity seldom seen  throughout history.”"  ..."passionate in his desire to convince others of the “truth” behind  9/11 and spent a significant amount of time in his \[XXX\] class  discussing this topic..."  "The Member led a rock band in which he wrote song lyrics and performed accompanying music videos...."  ..."songs by the Member’s band which include titles such as “911 IS A  LIE” and “The Counter-Narrative”, the lyrics for which, contain  numerous violent and graphic methods for murdering the members of the  9/11 Commission. The lyrics also scoff at the notion that 6 million Jews  died in the Holocaust. In the music videos, the Member is seen  brandishing several semi-automatic weapons and drinking what appears to  be alcohol..."

hodhabv	Remove if not allowed, but this is just a quick rant. This has been bugging me for years but has gotten increasingly worse as the sub has grown.  If you post a 2 hour video and your submission statement (SS) is something like “What do you guys think about this?”...I’m probably not watching it. And it’s probably the same for the majority of other people on this sub.  It doesn’t have to be a novel, but it should at least give an overview of why you’re posting.  “SS: I came across this video about conspiracy X and it shows a lot of well sourced info about person Y who was involved and their links to company Z.”  In one to two sentences (usually) you can easily explain why your post matters.  If it’s something important enough for you to share and something you think could benefit this community, you’re doing everyone including yourself a disservice with low effort submission statements.

16thou	I started developing a rash from deodorant a few years ago, so I tried a bunch of different ones to see if that would help. Aluminum free, organic, scent free, you name it, I tried it. Rash would not disappear.  So I just stopped using it all together.  I do like to exercise and I sweat quite a bit, and for the first 3-4 months or so, I smelled disgusting... and I mean disgusting.  But fast forward 5-6 months later, and I no longer had a gross body odor smell when I would sweat or at any other time.  I didn't really have any odor at all.

5xjhxuh	First of all I do enjoy this sub, have been browsing it for 6 years or so. Most post were like a fun fiction that made me look at things a different way, and explore the supernatural. Last year I was ready for the world to end. Whether it was by takeover, aliens or even the virus. This summer I got the chance to spend my time with a truly wonderful person. Gave me hope, and made me realize I had goals in life. The more we drifted apart though, the more I came back to reddit in general.  Now that I'm separated from the one I love, the worse I've become. Even though I try to be critical of every post on here, and cycle through the bullshit. Conspiracy seems like the last bastion of discussion on reddit, but it can also be bad for mental health. Get out and enjoy the life around you. Forgive, but never forget. Love is everywhere, and it's stronger than any other emotion.

gu0w9l6j	Okay I just thought of this and I want to hear Reddit’s opinions on it. When people go to sleep and they enter the dream state normally they would not have any memory of their irl life, the sleeping person gets so involved in this dream it starts to feel real. It gets to a point where you forget your dreaming and you start to think its all real. Now if you were to die in your sleep during this dream, would you continue that dream on with more random occurrences until you end up with a life you are familiar with now. This would explain why normal people cannot remember before the age of 2-4 years old as you were dropped into this dream at that age.   While writing this and taking a S$@t this also reminds me of the theory’s related to multiple dimension’s. If what I said was in effect theoretically wouldn’t you be entering a different dimension or universe every time you die in your dream state?	1642920843.0	sanka3	/r/conspiracy/comments/sanka3/immortality_dream_loop/	Immortality Dream Loop
4qjjnb5e	I just watched a video, Amazon has cashless stores in place where you can your phone,  go in, pick up an item, leave and it's charged to your account on your phone. I'm noticing more cashless places too, it's slow but it's happening. I mean hell, you go to Walmart and use a card, it's saves your information. Best hope that card isn't tied to an account or was never used online on their site. Now here's the interesting bit, I think covid will be used to speed the process up as it's already the excuse on why people aren't applying.  The fact people aren't applying to these low tier jobs isn't due to no one wanting them, it's designed in a way that if you don't fill out the application properly, the place will never see it. Now add in an algorithm that it selects a few people, if any, for the position. Oh look, no one applied to be a cashier at wendys, put a machine where customers can punch orders in and problem solved. You can say what you want, people are lazy, give families insensitive to not look for other jobs with stimulus checks, which also makes those low tier jobs look worse due to inflation so no one wants to work them anyway. Basically less people who deal with money that work for you, the more you save.

17enm3	Moderna was in serious serious trouble before Covid. In fact, it is famously known that the CEO was telling the company that it was going to take a real Hail Mary to see them survive much longer.   Wouldn’t you know it, the opportunity of a lifetime comes along and the company that has never successfully brought a product to market suddenly finds itself being handed exactly what it needs, on a silver platter - emergency use approval - which would allow them to bring their half baked vaccine that couldn’t pass full approval to market and cash in.   What if full approval was never a genuine goal for Moderna? Do you think there might be a chance that Moderna intentionally went to market with a vaccine that they had no intention of developing further in order to get full approval - because they knew the stock would pump, they would play the “we’re working on getting that full FDA approval and other great products” then right at the last minute they start their sell offs and out comes the news that their product is fucked and they are walking away from it all?	1642921976.0	sanv1n	/r/conspiracy/comments/sanv1n/didis_moderna_pulling_an_exit_scam_was_one_last/	Did/Is Moderna pull/ing an exit scam?

I have just a couple questions, Kevin Spacey was involved with that criminal ring, he has had 3 of his accusers die, which is already strange. What are the chances of 3 accusers actually dieing randomly? My next question is now that 2 of the rings leaders in Maxwell and Epstein are disposed of who is running that business, its not like they just stopped doing what they do. Is Kevin Spacey somehow more involved with the child ring and trafficking? Someone took over that business and my guess is that its probably even easier for them now that the justice system found their scapegoat.

awbv6gqx	Felt like I had to make this after a post was made about Radium and how the context of the post was used to attack Science as a whole despite the fact the lady who discovered Radium did a lot of good for humanity to only unfortunately die from her discovery.   (Marie Curie who discovered Radium didn't kill people, the corporations who used Radium and who later knew of its deadly effects but despite this continued to use it for profit sakes. Those are the ones who killed people. Corporations, not scientists. Is a whole lawsuit and documentary, Radium girls for any of those interested. Nasty story.)   Then in another post some dumbass was suggesting the use of lead paint to protect child around the harmful effects of technology and 5G despite the fact lead paint is super god damn dangerous to be around, especially for children.   I want to be clear about one thing, "Science" during times of covid is being used as a shield to deflect from criticism and questioning, this however goes entirely against the true principle of science which is to question or cast doubt.  The very nature of Science is to question, doubt, discuss. It's about being open minded which is a positive trait this sub has. However, I believe some folks of this sub are taking it too far.   Due to the fact covid lunatics are using the brand of "science" to deflect from questioning and criticism folks here have brought it upon themselves to have a crusade against anything science related.  To keep the true nature of science we have to question and to cast doubt but to not go as far as to outright discredit science as a whole otherwise we'll just end up just as ignorant as the people out right believing covid propaganda.  Science is about discover, all the shit we know today in many different fields of science whether it be medical, biology, astronomy or whatever else. We know so much because of the exploration of the sciences.   Take medical science for example. Used to be a time in which a deep cut was a death sentence, a nasty leg fracture resulted in amputation and we didn't even learn about the concept of germs and disease as a whole, we used to use leech to draw out "bad" blood in the body. It was a bad crazy time but because of that learning, because we tried new things it's how we know so much in modern times.   Science is fundamentally a great thing for humanity and has done many things to improve our lives for better and sometimes for worse, it's not perfect, still many issues happen today. I think it's important for us not to conflate the brilliance and beauty science brings to us as a species with corporate or governmental powers using the false guise of "science" as a tool to fulfil their agendas.    We have to fight the corporations and governments at every level, this is a war we face but we must be the ones to defend the pillar of science, we are the ones who cast doubt, we are the ones who question, we are the core of what it means to have science in this world. We shouldn't throw away that power.   We should not reject science, we should be the ones defending it against those who would seek to misuse the concept.   Without realising it you folks have been defending the concept of science ever since this pandemic started. How many times have we questioned something or created theories only to be blasted as conspiracy theorists or those who spread misinformation only to be proven absolutely right.   This post has been a bit of a rant but it's an important discussion that needs to be said. I personally absolutely love science, the knowledge of this world and what's beyond is something that will always fascinate me and it's why I defend it, not only against dumbasses who recommend using lead paint near children but also against the establishment who aim to use the shield of science as a means to fulfil their agendas.	1642923560.0	sao98d	/r/conspiracy/comments/sao98d/starting_to_grow_tiresome_of_this_full_on_assault/	Starting to grow tiresome of this full on assault on the entire premise of Science itself.

My goals I used to have all seem pointless now. There's really nothing to look forward to. Everytime I go out I just feel like I'm in a bad dream, people everywhere wearing n95s in their fucking cars. Begging for more testing and lockdowns. It's so bad here I don't think it will ever go back. It just feels like a dark hole that's getting deeper by the day.  What does one do? I'm seriously considering an escape at this point, life just isn't worth it here. I'm literally going fucking crazy.  I thought because the narrative was shifting and some countries dropped restrictions maybe it would shift here too, but I feel like Canada, NZ, Aus, France, Italy, Austria are all gone. We will have to fight our way out of it, no other way. I have means of surviving for now, but it's grim. Anyone else in a globalist state?

7e0m1fr7	The US government came up with the vaccine to continue with the status quo. Contrary to popular belief, it is not to do some sort of population control but the opposite. The US and millionaires benefit from the cheap labor of immigrants and unskilled labor. If all the unskilled workers and immigrants died due to this virus, there wouldn't be anyone who would pick up these underpaid jobs or labor. The jab is meant to continue the cog in this capitalist machine - where we are all just cogs and churning to the point where we are making millionaires into billionaires and our “democracy” into a full-blown oligarchy.	1642926703.0	sap2ak	/r/conspiracy/comments/sap2ak/here_is_my_conspiracy/	Here is my conspiracy
4de78d1z	 What if I told you that one of the companies in Washington that started this law firm is a medical coding research company? What if I told you that Obama Care was created for one reason and one reason only, and that’s to do child trafficking. That’s the only reason Obama Care was founded. What if I told you that they invested so much money to build three supercomputers in the University in Austin Texas that a mother who goes to her gynecologist to find out that she is pregnant. And at the same moment that he enters the code, the child traffickers are tracking that mother’s pregnancy. They know if she has an abortion, if she has a live birth. They track the child through the first few years. They know if it has blond hair, blue eyes or red hair, green eyes or whatever. They have all the medical data: Blood type, DNA. The Obama Care coding system eliminated medical confidentiality from the U.S. and around the world. It a five-digit coding system with over 80,000 codes. We call it medical abduction in this country. Parents, for example, who went to Phoenix Children’s Hospital and talked to a doctor there: their doctor took his notes and gave them to the medical coding expert in his office. She feeds those notes into the computer. CPS (Child Protective Services) and the Superior Court of Arizona rent space in the basement of the hospital. Once a red flag goes up on the CPS worker’s computer, he has the complete medical record, home address, parents’ names. Everything. They can copy and paste it all into some document so they can then run next door to the judge, have him sign it, get on the elevator, and thus within 5 minutes take the child. That’s how they do it. In every hospital.	1642926924.0	sap49u	/r/conspiracy/comments/sap49u/obama_care_was_only_established_for_one_reason/	Obama Care was only established for one reason: Child Trafficking...

i7fb4ww	 **THIS IS NOT A SHITPOST**  That is right folks. It is so obvious to anyone who even *looks* that Trump is a communist. He helps the poor and the workers. His business empire (Trump Enterprises, etc.) is just a precursor to state-run industry because Trump knows the best about economics. He is clearly waiting for the right time to turn Trump Enterprises into the government.  He is also "bankrupt" and whatever the media says because he gives all his money to the workers, who help him build his hotels and whatnot. His hotels are a mere glimpse into what the Marxist-Trump utopia will look like.  If you think this is a joke, **it is not**. Look close enough and you will see that Trump is the Marxist saviour. Trump will achieve what Lenin and Stalin could not. Once we elect Trump in 2024, the plan will be in motion.  (PS: Btw did you notice that the MAGA logo is ***RED***? This is the last piece of clear evidence that Trump is a communist. I absolutely love this and proudly display a maga hat on my wall of communist memorabilia.)	1642926977.0	sap4pl	/r/conspiracy/comments/sap4pl/trump_is_a_communist_and_this_is_what_i_love/	Trump is a communist, and this is what I love about him

They may not be publicly acceptable They may get me cancelled But its my goddamn American right to speak 'em And if you got a problem with that Suck my dick  [Verse 1] In a world made for the weak, the meek, the beta males, and the sheep Too soft for the bait If they don't agree then they just block and try to censor whatever you speak Only like-minds on the timeline that they see They anti-this and anti-that So close-minded really, thеy just anti-facts And you can show 'em the proof But if it doesn't all align with thеir views that they've been programmed with from the news Then they don't want to hear it Or even fuckin' be near it See the truth is too much for they spirit That's why they fear it (pussy) They try to tell me no, but fuck it, I'ma say it anyway I've been waiting for the government to kill me any day What the fuck? I'm not important enough? **Must I talk about the vax, how they poisonin' us?** Or the Vatican and all the little boys that they touch? I'm not scared, shit it's not like I'm avoidin' this stuff Yeah, the first amendment still lives on through me And certain other motherfuckers who ain't on TV We the last dinosaurs alive in AD When we're gone, then you'll really know that freedom ain't free But if everybody got to showin' some balls These agendas they've pushing would be slowed to a crawl But y'all so fucking soft, obeyin' and goin' along Sitting there triggered over a song I know the type Got a black lives matter sign on the front porch Never had a black person in the house Yeah it's time to call 'em out Virtue signal motherfuckers ain't about shit They just runnin' at the mouth With these preprogrammed points of view And these ludicrous facts, Asian hate Stop acting like you knew about that If you need a safe space, there's some room in the back With fresh vaginal wipes you can use while I rap Pussy Yeah, it helps 'em all sleep at night Knowing they signed a petition for equal rights For transgenders, talking like it's their fight When in reality they never met one in their life They don't donate, or actually do nothin' about it They just sit there, sippin' Mountain Dew on they couches While they clappin' for each other and circle-jerking themselves Applaud the loss of freedom and cancel those who rebel And I'm the bad guy 'cause I'm white and not gay Which means that I'm a bigot and discredits what I say But uh I'd rather have some toxic masculinity Than have an inner bitch in me bitch So suck a dick or three See, the algorithm's keeping you lost and now you're caught In an echo chamber of your own thoughts Let me talk while I can and speak to all my supporters Before there's lawyers, threats, and gag orders Cause nowadays that's the American way With this false administration that has led us astray They want the country to heal, but they don't spell with an A What they mean is to obey and do whatever they say But we tired of that So when I'm here to rap I got a duty to the people to bring light to the facts Never see a day I'm taking it back If I gave a shit then I'd use a mask, for wiping my ass And when it comes to the shot, I don't care if you got it Why you care if I didn't? I'm not understanding the logic Shit, it's such a hot topic, you can get 'em in malls "I just got my eighth booster", fuckin' round of applause People scared to say it so they just say nothing instead So let me make myself clear so they don't twist what I said Hell yeah I'll get the shot, with a gun to my head After they pull the trigger and they vaccinate me dead [Chorus] Raw thoughts (And I ain't no Democrat I ain't no fuckin' Republican either) These motherfuckin' raw thoughts (I'm a free-thinking citizen of the United States of America, goddamn it) Raw thoughts (And I've been seeing where this world's going Where this country's goin' and it makes me sick) These motherfuckin' raw thoughts (Fuck the new world order Take that vaccine and shove it up your ass) Raw thou...

7y35u2zd	So something weird has been happening, I don't have a big Instagram account but it is public, I regularly share silly/funny stuff but also memes that question the covid narrative. When I share a joke meme I notice my viewership is around 40 people(usually friends, local companies ect.) But when I share a covid/political meme it only seems to be viewed by those I have had discussions about covid with(through messenger)   I'm one of those that will look through other people's story and often answer questions they post(yes, I'm that annoying guy) and had a story reply from an old friend agreeing with this political meme and saying it was weird she hadn't seen it more and also that whenever she posts about vaccines, it never gets any traction.   Another friend also noticed that my username when searched only comes up after inputting my full username and my name which is linked to the account doesn't bring it up.   I've also noticed in recent months my pictures, despite using lots of hashtags will only reach the people who I have semi regular contact with.   I should also point out I'm in no way bothered by my lack of likes, ect. But it has led me to question whether I am being censored in some way  due to the sudden change and whether anyone else is  experiencing similar things   Thanks for reading! :)	1642929408.0	sappv6	/r/conspiracy/comments/sappv6/instagram_story_censorship_theory/	Instagram story censorship theory

To think the last time anybody claims to have landed on the moon was 1972 what technology do you know from the 60s and 70s that’s went back the way as of today? Convenient as well that the only country ever in the history of earth to have supposedly landed on the moon was the U.S.A nobody else just them. Then to say the reasons being the technology was lost or it’s just not really worth it to go yet spend billions per year on weapons of war? I find it so far fetched that no country ever apart from America has ever wanted to venture out and land on the moon themselves it just makes zero sense and doesn’t add up.

d7fkzp6i	I noticed something when I watched  Spiderman: No Way Home.  Let’s start off with Spiderman: Far From Home. That was one of the last big movies before Covid began. It came out summer 2019. The movie was about deception. Coincidentally, we are in the midst of the biggest deception scheme in the history of humanity.  Fast forward to December 2021  Spiderman:NWH releases. The movies starts off where the last one ended. Everyone now knows that Peter is Spiderman, and he wants to make everyone forget that he is. The movie is about MAKING PEOPLE FORGET. People forget things when they have... Alzheimer’s.  With everything we now know about the injections and the spike protein’s ability to cause neurodegenerative diseases, Are we about to see a ‘pandemic’ of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases in the population of those who got the shot?

I had been banned from 5 subs just because I'm a follower of lockdown skepticism. That's it. No comment, no misinformation, nothing. Just simply by following a sub that shares different views. I have the screenshots but it doesn't let me post gallery pictures. Will post a link afterwards.   To be honest, I was kind of surprised when they didn't include this one on the list. Anyways...  They're loosing the grip and trying to control the narrative even harder.

In the Quran (Islamic Book of Faith), it is stated not to eat the flesh of pigs. Well, we all know pork in general carries many bacteria and requires proper heating/cooking in order to be removed/or some type of preservative mix lol.    Now, I have been looking into various viruses/diseases. I have been researching about Ebola viruses, did you know there are 5 different strains of Ebola Virus?   Now, atm, I am currently reading up on Reston virus, a hemorrhagic fever that doesn't usually infect humans/not pathogenic to humans, but it is to pigs.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5444788/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5196033/  This paper is important: Risks Posed by Reston, the Forgotten Ebolavirus  >Out of the five members of the Ebolavirus family, four cause life-threatening disease, whereas the fifth, Reston virus (RESTV), is nonpathogenic in humans. The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear. In this review, we analyze the currently available information to provide a state-of-the-art summary of the factors that determine the human pathogenicity of Ebolaviruses. RESTV causes sporadic infections in cynomolgus monkeys and is found in domestic pigs throughout the Philippines and China.  >In conclusion, the factors that determine the pathogenicity of Ebolaviruses in humans remain insufficiently understood  So, that's weird. We already know its the Niemann Pick Channel...   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867415017080  >Filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg, cause fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and primates. Understanding how these viruses enter host cells could help to develop effective therapeutics. An endosomal protein, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), has been identified as a necessary entry receptor for this process, and priming of the viral glycoprotein (GP) to a fusion-competent state is a prerequisite for NPC1 binding. Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the primed GP (GPcl) of Ebola virus bound to domain C of NPC1 (NPC1-C) at a resolution of 2.3 Å. NPC1-C utilizes two protruding loops to engage a hydrophobic cavity on head of GPcl. Upon enzymatic cleavage and NPC1-C binding, conformational change in the GPcl further affects the state of the internal fusion loop, triggering membrane fusion. Our data therefore provide structural insights into filovirus entry in the late endosome and the molecular basis for design of therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.  https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0056265  >Ebola virus (EBOV) is an enveloped RNA virus that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and non-human primates. Infection requires internalization from the cell surface and trafficking to a late endocytic compartment, where viral fusion occurs, providing a conduit for the viral genome to enter the cytoplasm and initiate replication. In a concurrent study, we identified clomiphene as a potent inhibitor of EBOV entry. Here, we screened eleven inhibitors that target the same biosynthetic pathway as clomiphene. From this screen we identified six compounds, including U18666A, that block EBOV infection (IC50 1.6 to 8.0 µM) at a late stage of entry. Intriguingly, all six are cationic amphiphiles that share additional chemical features. U18666A induces phenotypes, including cholesterol accumulation in endosomes, associated with defects in Niemann–Pick C1 protein (NPC1), a late endosomal and lysosomal protein required for EBOV entry. We tested and found that all six EBOV entry inhibitors from our screen induced cholesterol accumulation. We further showed that higher concentrations of cationic amphiphiles are required to inhibit EBOV entry into cells that overexpress NPC1 than parental cells, supporting the contention that they inhibit EBOV entry in an NPC1-dependent manner. A previously reported inhibitor, compound 3.47, inhibits EBOV entry by blocking binding of the EBOV glycoprotein to NPC1. None of the cationic amphiphiles tested had this effect. Hence, multiple cationic amphiphiles (including several FDA approved agents) inhibit EBOV entry in an NPC1-dependent fashion, but by a mechanism distinct from that of compound 3.47. Our findings suggest that there are minimally two ways of perturbing NPC1-dependent pathways that can block EBOV entry, increasing the attractiveness of NPC1 as an anti-filoviral therapeutic target.   Now this is where shit gets odd, they say its infected no humans, but:  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00811/#:~:text=Abstract%20Ebola%20viruses%20%28EBOV%29%20cause%20often%20fatal%20hemorrhagic,detected%20in%20swine%20with%20indicated%20transmission%20to%20humans.  >Ebola viruses (EBOV) cause often fatal hemorrhagic fever in several species of simian primates including human. While fruit bats are considered natural reservoir, involvement of other species in EBOV transmission is unclear. In 2009, Reston-EBOV was the first EBOV detected in swine with indicated transmission to humans. In-contact transmission of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) between pigs was demonstrated experimentally. Here we show ZEBOV transmission from pigs to cynomolgus macaques without direct contact.   MMkay, so this is saying there was a human transmission case due to pigs (bats are the natural reservoir but pigs seem to be the genetic.    Now, for those who are all into the "Viral exosome" theory:  > Interestingly, transmission between macaques in similar housing conditions was never observed.  What this indicates: Viral exosomes with genetic material of the Reston Virus that was causing an immune system reaction in the pig were absorbed/came into contact with the macaques, the macaques were not shedding viral exosomes though, they were simply end points, they weren't asymptotic/reservoirs, basically the virus wasn't able to replicate itself efficiently in them, but it was able to efficiently kill them. TL;DR: It lost virulence DAMN quickly through genetic transfer, in the end, it will kill itself out.   Ebola viruses aren't the scare due to their ability to kill themselves.   So, in virology lingo, Coronaviruses are the real biological weapon to study. This is due to their naturally high transmissibility, but they didn't seem to have a high rate of infection, they modified this.    There is 4 TL;DR's:   1 Tl;dr: Pigs are nature's viral vectors. They are probably on par to eating a turkey vulture in terms of the microbiome similarities.   2 Tl;dr: Ebola itself will never be used as an efficient bioweapon. Smallpox is iffy too, it would have to be a monkey/camel pox or some shit. Ebola is too virulent, smallpox is actually trash simply due to the fact that we can build immunity to it, and immunity from vaccination has been proven to persist for DECADES.   3 Tl;dr: Coronaviruses are the bread and butter of viral/biological warfare, beyond just using basic immune system destroying chemicals/compounds.   The reason for coronaviruses being the most likely candidate for an "ELE virus" is due to its already persistence and existence in nature, its the largest class of RNA viruses, there are a shit ton of them. **IF THE HIV GP120 AND OTHER HIV INSERTS ON THE COVID GLYCOPROTEIN TURN OUT TO BE TRUE**, then its possible we have already TESTED a true viral ELE, and it failed.   4 Tl;dr: I think someone wanted to actually kill a chunk of population, they released their bioweapon they claimed was a lab-made vaccine (then why the push for gene therapy? huh), and it turned out to be bunk. I am speculating that the entire failure of this event is caused by the poorly misunderstood mainstream virology. I am basically pretty certain viruses aren't just "dead components", they would wither and die in atmospheric conditions/oxygen, and other various weathering conditions, they have to have a structure/safety, and this is exosomal virology.   **Last statement: The last virus, the virus that truly wipes out humanity, will likely begin in pigs, due to them being genetically similar to humans and being abundantly farmed, and their prevalence towards being known to be filled/covered with parasites.**	1642935919.0	sarbq4	/r/conspiracy/comments/sarbq4/i_have_actually_gone_to_the_conclusion_live_pigs/	I have actually gone to the conclusion live pigs are actually probably going to be the cause of the next REAL pandemic.

Violence and war and genocide are nothing new. Major climate disasters are nothing new. Economic crashes are nothing new. Famine and pandemics have happened in the past. The only thing I can think would be an alien invasion Independence Day style. Which to my mind just goes back to war, violence, tyranny… just with a different species. Unless they are like Jesus aliens who show us the error of our ways and provide utopian tech. Or are just boring aliens looking to join in our economy and become middle class citizens.

caq5aau	Fact- Henry Cuellar is a democrat and critic of Biden Harris and then he got raided by the FBI.   The DOJ has not gone after Pelosi, Schumer etc for insider trading. DOJ did not prosecute Dr Fauci after senator Rand Paul proved that he lied under oath.  DOJ tried to secretly coordinate with left leaning school boards then put out statements that may scare the parents about FBI.  Joe Biden sniffs kids too much even on camera.  Porject Veritas exposed corruption in big tech and new york times and in FBI. They were raided.  Veritas said they had the diary of Ashley Biden but it was stolen so they just returned it, then FBI decided to raid them without reason.  Now project veritas is saying they might get suicide by deep state.  Now conspiracy theory- Joe Biden is being blackmailed by the FBI for being with underage. They are all in a cabal, so if somebody exposes Joe Biden that might expose CIA Manchurian blackmail program or something.  If they are not conspiring then why is FBI raiding for Ashley Biden.  Is it possible that Joe Biden and Ghislaine Maxwell were running eugenics program involving kids in Chicago black sites?   Remember no domestic news media will talk about Homan square concentration camp. Specially NYT will never talk about it. The same NYT that apparently has an insider in FBI to tell them what they found in project veritas.  Why did DOJ say FBI will get involved in school board? Technically that's because parents threatened critical race theorists and not COVID vaccine mandates. But what if it was related to vaccine mandates. Is it possible that FBI wants to protect eugenics program?  Why did FBI raid Henry Cuellar? Is it possible that they thought Henry knew things about eugenics program at the border facilities?

6kim4c34	So the FED is in the process of providing a FED Coin, a Digital Currency. They will use this to backup the future digital dollar. Which gives them the power to control everything and have insight of data what people use the digital dollar for to buy.   Now lets list the good things:  * \- You can be traced. Why is this good? It is good to combat criminals and corruption. It is a first step into the right direction to combat that which will make it more difficult for them.   \- Convenient payment, no more need for producing paper money and waste metals on coins that just make your wallet heavier.   \- More convenient transaction of money, could be transfering money to someone in matter of seconds.   \- Economy can accelerate and grow fast with digital contracts and faster money exchange.   \- Money cannot get lost. Cirqulating supply should be always the same.   Now to the bad things:  * Control of spending and data. Collection of data ála facebook style, could make things worse. Certain production of goods can be enhanced in production in favour of the mass and pushed onto them to consume more. The government will have direct insight of all the data, rather than corporations. This is probably the keypoint why a global government will be formed which is fused with corporations. If you see all day everywhere coca cola commercials, it is because they see that people are likely and easy to consume it and therefor push them to buy even more. Or atleast stimulate them to do so. * They can push their own ideology onto the people. They can freeze your accounts that easily if you didnt comply to certain things the government wanted you to do so.    "Mr. X, we can see you didnt have your booster shot the last 3 months, you are a possible threat to our society. We will have to freeze your account. You will receive the basic universal income which can only be used to pay your monthly expenses. You will not be able to spend your earned money in social activities until you had your booster shot and remained in isolation for 2 weeks." * If the banks decide you to not be able to buy Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, or anything else they dont like you to have, they will simply block the transactions. The indirect approach would be going to someone who sells you these things, but labels it as bananas. Yeah, you bought Bananas worth 10K. So if you decided to sell you will have to do something like this backwards.   I think the possibility to enslave humanity and treat them like animals is much greater than having the free choice of spending. The evil possibility greatly outweighs the good.

ajyx8lhm	I've always thought this, but haven't seen it discussed much. When you would go get your MMR vaccine or flu shot, didn't they just give it to you? I had a coworker say he was getting the booster after work and came in the next day saying that he was hesitant because his first two shots were Moderna but he might want to get the Pfizer booster so he'll have "Better coverage".   And fuck the #teampfizer or whatever. I don't have social media (other than Reddit if you would count that) so I don't know if that's really a thing.  It's almost as if they aren't only separating the vaccinated and unvaccinated, but are separating the vaccinated.   Second question not warranting a post: Where I work ~95% of my coworkers are vaccinated and/or boosted. I'm one of six supervisors. Guess who was the only one to not get COVID (and be ill) in the past two weeks... Why is this? It's like when my parents would get the flu shot and still (every year) get the flu weeks after getting vaccinated. ** I'm not a healthy person either. I smoke, drink, eat like shit, although I do exercise and stay hydrated all the time.	1642948775.0	sav1i5	/r/conspiracy/comments/sav1i5/isnt_it_strange_that_you_can_pick_which_company/	Isn't it strange that you can pick which company you receive your vaccine from?

40rnb8nu	I'm a young person and a very healthy person. I often do workout and never drink sugar drinks and I eat fast food extremely rarely. I've been all happy until my father started pushing the vaccine onto me, and I had no choice. He believes strictly everything the biased media says. I am not willing to take a vaccine and it should be completely my choice, I am taking the consequences but still, he is forcing me to take a jab for a virus that has one in a million chance of dying from, yet you're more likely to get myocarditis from the vaxx. The vaccine has unknown side effects in the future. I am double vaxxed now and I didn't have any side effects, I was perfectly fine. But I feel like I've been getting sick way more since getting jabbed. Back before then, I would get a cold every 4-6 months, maybe even longer, but now, I'm sick every 1.5 months on average and I didn't even change my diet or anything. I am just paranoid of taking the vaccine and I feel like I should have my own choice to choose whether to get it or not, but my father forces it into me nonetheless.  When media said that the covid vaccine protects you from getting infected, he believed that. But as soon as they said that we need boosters, he's forcing me into getting it. I'm pretty sure even if media would tell him a booster would be needed every week, he would force me into getting it every wekk. I just wanna have my own choice and I just wanna take the risk on my own. I just regret taking the vaxx and I refuse to get the booster, purely my own choice.  Why should I get a vaccine when I've heard vaccinated people or even boosted people have strong symptoms from covid? I just don't wanna have negative side effects in 10 years and I'm paranoid. When I told him I did not wanna take the vaccine, I run out of arguments because I was afraid that I would look like an idiot and he would emberass me infront of the family. How do I stop him to force the vaxx onto me? I should have my own choice, but he's just doing the decisions for me.	1642948982.0	sav47f	/r/conspiracy/comments/sav47f/im_a_young_person_and_i_dont_wanna_be_vaxxed_but/	I'm a young person and I don't wanna be vaxxed, but I am being forced to do so.

8t9nu4ga	I believe this is sooo more planned out than we can imagine. I believe those higher of power now realise the whole ineffectiveness of vaccines is their best course of action to distract the masses while the rest of Ghislaine Maxwell's trial is finished. I mean it's is why majority of this covid shit blew up as much as it did, to prolong Maxwell's trial, sweep shit under the rug buy them a few years not that they themselves need it but so enough time has passed that its not on the front of everyone's mind. I mean I'm all kinds of cuckoo, constantly thinking of some of the world's most beautifully batshit theories, and even I don't really focus as much as I should on the jizzie girl trials, would much rather find Agartha tbh. But yep as we all know by now this has been planned out from the beginning and by beginning I honestly could not tell you because at this point I feel like we've done this many civilisations over, only to repeat same mistakes again and again and again I mean bruh how the fuck the fuck is our skin so white OOo I mean while I'm here might as well say my other theory,   there was definitely a civilisation before us. When down the exact same path we went down, flew too close to the sun led to a mass extinction causing humanity to burrow underground, possible radiation, possible world wide flood who knows but anyway, the civilation that ruled before us was a darker toned one and when they were forced underground their skin started to pigment due to a lack of sunlight, and those few families that survived passed down stories and those stories would changed through time and leaderships and be altered at some point to fit a certain narrative, that the ones that caused the world to end were the ones of darker skin, or perhaps the mark of Cain. When the surface was habitable again they would start to rebuild civilisation, start from scratch, they would start spreading their narrative to other potential survivors watch out for those with the mark of Cain, the darker more evil ones and badabing badaboom racism was born the end I wanna more but my grammar and punctuation is already boy enough if you're willing to read till this here, thank you I love, respect and appreciate you, know that you are seen and you are heard and you live YOU'RE best life no one else's.

9fpdpbar	Don’t get me wrong, I’ve allocated about 20% of my portfolio into different bigger name cryptos, such as Eth, Btc, CRO, and Polkadot, because as far as the crypto space goes, these seem like projects that do have a large community, lots of support, and current and evolving real life functions (more on the tech side obviously).  However, what keeps creeping into my brain is… who’s real plan was this? Is the crypto space said to be decentralized, but when it’s all said and done and these coins have reached market cap, who’s to say they won’t be subject to regulation? Who’s to say the original mystery btc guy, Satoshi, isn’t just a government insider?  Wouldn’t it just be genius to get all the decentralized tech nerds, distracted and roped into a market that promotes decentralization, but also promotes all countries running on the same coin, with smaller tokens that run the platforms in which btc is traded on, or act as change, or specific tokens to do specific things…( maybe that turns into food tokens, clothes, gaming, advertising, taxes, ect).

There were big psyops before too that there still widely accepted to this day. I believe that lot of us felt c19 as some sort of a call to arms. Yeah like lot of people are gonna be on a permanent health care and lot of people are gonna die prematurely. Friends and family and alike. That is a bummer. Some kids are gonna be infertile and die prematurely bad but nothing new. Have a beer. Play something on your Netflix. Not a doomsday. As long as you are alive it´´ s fine and if agenda 2030 come to pass well they can´ t get all of us and if we are running on borrowed time. Why should we worry?

8621tgdb	So something I've noticed is it seems like everyone who hasn't been sick the past 2 years suddenly got sick around Christmas/early January.  I've watched videos of magnetic residue (possibly graphene) being left on cars after the rain from all over the world.  Today, for the first time in my life I went outside and the the air was literally sparkly. It was not dirt or dust particles. It looked like millions of fine glitter in the air. I asked the person I live with if they could see it too and they could. It was impossible to miss.  I think it was on this sub that a user mentioned cadmium poisoning causing flu like symptoms. And with what's known about graphene and metals in general, it of course would be awful to breathe it in.  My theory is this is how rrt/rwd qthey're targeting all the anti vaccine/mandate people. The people who aren't wearing masks are going out and breathing in whatever metallic cocktail they're spraying. Most people don't detox heavy metals or parasites. Glutathione in particular is needed to detox graphene from the body.  I noticed a lot of people getting pneumonia as well and it's really something to keep in mind.  Seeing the air today I'm getting a good air purifier and wearing a cloth mask outside (because the surgical masks are apparently full of weird particles)  There is a video on Bitchute, I think it was done by Tim Truth, but he calls different hospitals and inquires about getting tested for specific covid variants. All of the doctors and nurses he talk to says there is no specific test for a variant. To which he responds, well then how are they diagnosing people with Delta or Omnicron? And they just kinda evade a direct answer.  I believe there is no variant because they're just finding other ways to poison people. From the air, to the constant food recalls, to even things like the air freshener that was sold at Walmart that was contaminated with a harmful bacteria.   All we can do is try to get away from the cities if you can, and start growing your own food protected from the outside air. Stay safe out there everyone.	1642956082.0	saxogr	/r/conspiracy/comments/saxogr/spraying_the_air_to_make_us_sick/	Spraying the air to make us sick.

6hsh4oko	Italian here. In 2017 (the same year Fauci predicted a pandemic during the Trump presidency) my country abrogated a law that prevented the use of PCR swabs to test a specific virus. A new law was approved which also would make these tests unsuitable as Covid tests, but hear this: the new law will be enforced from June 2022. In other words, they created a 5 years void in the legislation which conveniently allowed the use of PCR swab tests as Covid tests. Prior to 2017 or after June 2022 PCR tests for Covid were, and are gonna be, simply ILLEGAL. And now, looking at the slowly changing of the narrative in the MSM, I start to suspect that the plandemic was scheduled to end in 2022. Which would make sense, considering it could be a dressed rehearsal before the real deal. After all Bill Gates already announced there will soon be a new pandemic, much bigger than Covid, with tens of millions of deaths (picture his usual half suppressed snickering while announcing it).

I saw a really good [YouTube documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biNxl7tiVSY) detailing how China is working towards bio-weaponry and are even able to create diseases that attack certain demographics. For example, if China wanted, they could create an illness that specifically targets black African males.  When you consider this possibility in conjunction with the mass testing which has been happening since the very start of the COVID-19 'pandemic', I do not think it is totally unrealistic to assume that China could have released a mild virus in order to ascertain and map the global population's DNA.

Hence, when we are able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must appear inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.”  “When the enemy is relaxed, make them toil. When full, starve them. When settled, make them move.”	1642964481.0	sb0zw3	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb0zw3/to_all_the_people_stating_they_people_acting_as/	To all the people stating: “They [people acting as government, the powers that be] are scared; we are winning… look they are pulling back on the mandates and covid narrative”.

So they encouraged the rest to get “tested” (I didn’t get tested cause I didn’t believe in that shit from the get-go). Other people’s test came back and they were “negative” ... the “positive” people were furious with their results saying “THATS IMPOSSIBLE ! THATS A FAKE NEGATIVE ! You’re suppose to be sick like us !

caq5aau	Without going into too much details- there is a theory called electric universe 9700BC apocalypse theory. They say many sites are aligned in an orbit- Giza->Nazca->easter island->Angkor Wat etc. They call this 'the old orbit' of the earth.  Now, let's say this was the 'old orbit'. Then old north pole was southeast Alaska(southwest of Canada), 300km away from HAARP research facility and old south pole was at the coast of Antarctica, thousands of miles south of South Africa.  Now, connect pyramids and ancient sites from this 'old north pole' to 'south pole'. You may find more alignment. Also remember the number range 1860-2000km.   Go to google earth and connect Yonaguni island's mysterious 'man-made' underwater pyramids to 'censored' Gunung Padang pyramid(which is definitely man-made.) You will find that these 2 are approximately 2000km away from 'old' equator. These 2 sites are aligned, if you draw a longitude from southeast Alaska to Gunung Padang it will go over Yonaguni and go to 'old' south pole.   Now when you are looking for 'pyramids' on google earth, don't just look at pyramids. Look also for water damage, which may happened in 9700BC. Probably because pyramids were used to fight an energy war and the war was lost and God sank the earth.   You may find many things related to 1900km away from the 'old' orbit. For example, center of Australia has suspicious water erosion marks, 1950km away from 'old orbit'. There are mysterious places in Khazakstan and China which also aligns.  Southwest Canada is waking up and there have been many earthquakes there in recent times. Of course electric universe theory is a big club and some people like 'Suspicious Observer' claimed the sun caused earthquakes. I don't actually thing the sun causes earthquake and global warming, rather it's more probably earth's site alignment that causes some of the earthquakes.  sources- jimmy corsetti, graham hancock, micheal tellinger	1642964956.0	sb16l2	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb16l2/prediction_upcoming_earthquakes_in_west_coast_of/	Prediction- Upcoming earthquakes in west coast of Canada/Alaska.

kh7oca5	During 2020 I was a TV producer and on-air presenter for a lesser-known TV news network.   (I left in early 2021 after Covid bullshit and exhaustion with, well, everything outlined here.)  A lot of people wonder, is the media purposely corrupt? Are they purposely spreading false information or government talking points?  Much of the media makes more sense once you realize it's a \*\*path of least resistance.\*\* Let me explain:  Most TV stations in the U.S. aren't literally getting marching orders from the government. It ends up \*looking\* this way because of corporate mentality to take the path a least resistance, to avoid rocking the boat.  A TV newsroom doesn't have vast resources. You have corporate decision makers and managers, then a handful of mid-level producers, and finally the "tradespeople" who get their hands dirty running cameras, sound boards, editing, etc.  The corporate level worries constantly about viewer numbers, revenue, and legal problems.  The producer level are often fairly fresh out of college, many in their 20s and 30s, and is mostly worried about their image and future career.  The trade level are worried about doing their job day to day, not getting yelled at, and what they're going to do on their day off.  Notice that nowhere in this hierarchy is \*\*JOURNALISM.\*\* In fact, there's shockingly little interest in doing any real hard-hitting investigative journalism or asking tough questions. Why?  Well, for one, it's time and personele intensive. It might take hours and more likely days or weeks to actually dig into a topic with any real depth, and even then there's a solid chance it goes nowhere. Real investigative journalism is a long, boring process. Even if you had people at the TV stations interested in doing it, management would nix it as a poor use of resources.  \*\*Few people in TV actually want to do hard journalism.\*\* Again, many are in their mid 20s and fresh out of liberal colleges. They want to \*be on TV,\* they want to do slick things, they want to build their demo reel so they can go to the next bigger station in a year.  The result is, at best, fluff interviews with "experts" where the personality goes through the motions of "asking tough questions," but the whole thing is wrapped up in hours and they move on to the next thing.  \*\*Then there's the corporate fear of Rocking the Boat.\*\* If a hundred TV stations are saying generally the same things, there is a real fear of being the one station saying something different.   What if they're seen as far right, or far left, or kooks, or God forbid have a story flagged on Facebook? The path of least resistance is to be safe, repeat the major narratives, smile and nod and roll commercials.  \*\*Repeating the major narratives\*\* is incredibly easy, too, because most TV stations \*\*outsource their news content.\*\*  There are several major "providers" of news content. The big ones are Newsource (a division of CNN), the AP, and Reuters.  Those providers offer subscription-based turnkey packages of written stories, which are often read verbatim during a newscast, and video footage. Again, medium and small TV stations just don't have the manpower to personally cover stories, which are all over the state, country, and world.   \*\*They end up being news REPEATERS, story relayers,\*\* mostly for practical and budget reasons. Path of least resistance.  The problem, of course, is that any spin, bias, or narrative built-in to the outsourced stories are also repeated.  If the AP declares "experts say X," a thousand news stations will report that. It isn't a conscious conspiracy, they're just going off of what the news wire says.  If CNN shows a particular edit of footage and describes an event a certain way, there's a very good chance the same footage will be shown the same way on the thousand "independent" stations which all subscribe to their Newsource service.   (And yes, I've personally caught CNN mixing blatant misinformation and bias into the stories which are distributed to affiliates. Any story can be spun with editing.......)   Again, it's \*\*don't rock the boat.\*\* If a TV station questions, pushes back, or reports differently than say the AP, they stick their necks out. They don't want to be that "kook station questioning the experts. Who doesn't trust the Associated Press?!"  It's a feedback loop, and echo chamber.   This is amplified even more if two major wire services report the same thing. AP and Reuters could say aliens have landed on Uranus and you'd better bet it would get reported. "We're citing TWO major news agencies! Run it." Corporate can point to where the reporting came from and wash their hands of responsibility, because the chain of liability is off their shoulders.  All of this has existed for decades, it just reached a tipping point with COVID. Everything was turned up to 11, and nobody wanted to upset the status quo.  What to do about this? For one, turn off the damn TV.   Be skeptical of all reporting, triple check from multiple angles when you can, and understand that just because an establishment gatekeeper says something, it doesn't make it magically, infallibly true. 	1642965771.0	sb1i5i	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb1i5i/i_worked_in_tv_news_during_2020_to_understand_why/	I worked in TV News during 2020.

5yhznu7x	“**Official Government and Public Health data available from around the world strongly suggests that the triple/double Covid-19 vaccinated population are suffering from antibody dependent enhancement.**  In some cases, antibodies can enhance virus entry and replication in cells. This phenomenon is called[ antibody-dependent infection enhancement](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438590/) (ADE). ADE not only promotes the virus to be recognized by the target cell and enters the target cell, but also affects the signal transmission in the target cell.  In other words, ADE occurs when the antibodies generated during an immune response recognise and bind to a pathogen, but they are unable to prevent infection. Instead, these antibodies act as a “Trojan horse,” allowing the pathogen to get into cells and exacerbate the immune response.  The result is often more severe illness than if the person had been unvaccinated, and this is precisely what we are now seeing around the world.  * Data from England shows that the [Covid-19 injections have a real-world effectiveness as low as -151%](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/21/triple-vaccinated-are-developing-aids-gov-data/), and that figure is decreasing by the week. This in effect means that that triple vaccinated adults immune system performance is being decimated, and fact supported by data showing that [7 in every 10 Covid-19 hospitalisations, and 8 in every 10 Covid-19 deaths were among the fully vaccinated between 20th Dec 21 and 16th Jan 22.](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/22/triple-vaccinated-account-for-most-covid-hospitalisations/) * Data from Scotland shows that the Covid-19 injections have an average real-world effectiveness among all age groups as low as -132%, again meaning their immune system performance is being decimated. This fact is supported by data that now shows the [hospitalisation-rate and death-rate per 100k population by vaccination status is highest among the double vaccinated.](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/20/public-health-data-confirms-vaccinated-more-likely-to-die-of-covid/) * Data from Australia shows that a pandemic that never really got going, is just beginning, and it’s very much [a pandemic of the fully vaccinated](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/19/australia-vaccinated-account-for-4-in-5-covid-deaths/). The country has seen some of the most Draconian restriction in the world including requiring permits to leave home, go to work, and leave an area via checked points manned by armed forces.   Australians were told they would not be “rewarded” with more freedoms until a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated. But now they are [recording a record number of cases, hospitalisations, and deaths](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/19/australia-vaccinated-account-for-4-in-5-covid-deaths/), and the vast majority are among the fully vaccinated. * Extensive research has also revealed that deaths of professional football/soccer players due to cardiovascular issues are doubling every three months, with the number of deaths occurring in December 2021 equalling the annual average over the previous 12 years.   In all, deaths among professional football/soccer players in 2021 were 4 times the average rate recorded between 2009 and 2020. Suggesting not only are the vaccines causing antibody dependent enhancement, they are also having a disastrous effect on the cardiovascular system, a fact supported by the record number of cases of myocarditis seen in the USA.  All of the above is not indicative of a safe and effective vaccine. It is indicative of a failed vaccine that is causing severe injury and death, alongside weakening the immune systems of recipients leading to either Covid-19 vaccine induced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or antibody dependent enhancement.  The following research elaborates on the above in much more detail –”  Read more [here](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/23/world-government-data-shows-covid-vaccinated-suffering-ade/).  For well over a year we were warning that the Death Injection slow kill “side effects” would be ADE. There are innumerable research studies on mRNA and similar “vaccines” on ferrets and mice that established these dangers, and one of the many reasons why these experimental gene therapies could never make it past animal trials. My substack citing some of said [research](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/the-greatest-fear-among-vaccinologists).  Between the myocarditis, ADE, historically unprecedented SAE’s and AE’s, cancer cases up over 20x already, prion-based diseases, and many other ailments directly caused from these Death Injections, be prepared for slow yet rapidly escalating rises in global death rates far in excess of 0.76% for year of “pandemic” 2020 which was the same & for 2019, and 2018.

a52h3twt	There is a theory that states that at the beginning of the cold war it was determined by American military intelligence that Russia and China would need to be destroyed.  It was cited that they were large nations that could grow to rival America in terms of military power and if they were to ever face a shortage of resources, they could use their military power to start a war with America in the hopes of defeating it and taking it over to save their own nations.  Military intelligence discovered that Russia and China had the exact same sentiments about America, citing that it would also take over their respective countries if it ever faced any kind of economic hardship.  Military intelligence determined that both countries had too many heads of state that would be able to steal elections and remain in power, which made them immune to installing a long-term puppet government for America.  The conclusion of all of this became that America would eventually have to nuke Russia and China to avoid a future war with them where they were at a serious disadvantage.  Cut to 2020.  A virus is released on a large scale.  It shuts down or at the very least slows down the world economy.  But more importantly, it allows for printing of trillions of U.S. dollars.  When a country wants to go war, it needs to money to do so.  The old method was to sell war bonds.  The new method is to print dollars and to funnel the money into the military by proxy.  But the thing is if a country starts printing trillions of dollars out of nowhere and starts funneling a lot of it into defense, their rivals will get suspicious and prepare for war.  The trillions printed for covid were a mask, to funnel money into defense.  The reason the vaccine is being pushed so hard is because the DoD and its contractor companies are heavily invested in them by proxy i.e. Moderna makes billions, the military makes billions.  According to the theory, America would go all out into generating war money, including pushing certain crypto currency, pumping it to entice them into investing in it as a replacement to the dollar and then dumping it in a controlled manner as a way to get Russia and China to fund their own demise.   So in other words, the military has long planned to nuke Russia and China.  They released covid so they could slow down their rivals' income and use the crisis to secretly print close to a trillion for themselves under the guise of domestic aid.  Ukraine and Taiwan are key pieces to this strategy.  They are close to key strike points of Russia and China.  If America installs a hostile government and said government moves nukes into the nation and points them at America's rivals, America wins WW3 before it even starts due to how easily it would be for America to decimate its enemies and allocating more of its missile stock for defense.  The final card played would be a false flag to start the war, which according to the theory would be something along the lines of an assassination, emp or stuxnet-like attack on a major part of the grid, or an attack on the military.  This theory also talked about how the great reset would be rolled into this and that both sides of the coin are in on it.  After a war, they would focus more on internal control.  Biden and Trump were said to be on the same side, both were put into place to appease each side while the military operation commenced.  Trump was put into office to appease the conservative base and was taken out as the economy tanked so to appease the liberal base i.e. the president was being used as a tool to keep each side from actually developing a serious counter movement and to keep thinking they could vote their way into power.	1642967503.0	sb2649	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb2649/does_anyone_know_more_about_this_theory/	Does anyone know more about this theory?

In order to enforce totalitarian rules on people they need the good ones who stand for what is right gone. As time goes on they will gather more pawns to do their bidding. It will be like those in the gestapo and SS. The German police battalions were given a choice to either execute civilians or they were free to go.

9obtbocb	So if you're like me you have given a lot of thought about how hard they're pushing this agenda and it's definitely seems like it's on The Horizon. And everything involved in the Davos wet dream of a technocratic future is sickening to me the social credit score the surveillance the top down control.  For a while it was just really depressing and that why I want to make this post. Because after researching I realize there are more viable options for resisting the great reset then I would have thought at first. Now not all of them are ideal but this is kind of just to get the ball rolling maybe some of you have better ideas or can expand on this  1 thing I've come across that surprised me is that there are places in the US that still offer free land if you agree to live there for five years and a lot of the people are the type that are there to get away from big government and live a simpler life raising animals and growing food that kind of thing. For instance in Plainville Kansas you could get a plot of land basically for free I think it's just a $500 deposit that you get back once your house is built on the land  And also I've been reading a little bit about homesteading and intentional communities that people have been setting up where like-minded people form their own little Community / economy sometimes not even using cash just exchanging work for goods etc  I know it kind of doesn't work for everyone because these types of situations are semi off grid or off-grid so they require a little bit of a lifestyle change. But to me I would take life more in tune with nature any day even if it means sacrificing song of the conveniences that modern society has to offer if I'm able to avoid the coming technocratic hellscape LOL  Just some food for thought	1642968155.0	sb2f7m	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb2f7m/alternative_options_to_explore_instead_of/	Alternative options to explore instead of impotently assimilating to the Great Reset, BBB, NWO agenda.

ol94jvy	With Billy Gates talking of another pandemic and the seeming halt of mandates it makes me wonder.  What if Covid was just phase 1 where every one has now picked a side I.e. vax or non vax  This would mean when pandemic 2 comes out those  who are all for the us vs them narrative will know who the "enemy is" I.e. my vax friend knows im against the vax.   The next pandemic will happen and it will be worse (Either a new virus or maybe just the side effects of the vaccine) people will die rapidly and it will be blamed on the unvaxed of course.  This time the ones under TPTB's spell will be more easily coerced into atrocities due to the impatience of the perceived stubbornness of the unvaxed and the higher death rate.	1642968216.0	sb2g1i	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb2g1i/conspiracy_hypothesis_covid_is_just_the_choose/	Conspiracy hypothesis: Covid is just the "Choose sides" phase.

odcic	The proliferation of peanut allergies through environmental contamination was/is an intentional act to destabilize the United States. By promoting this vulnerability, & instituting mandates/bans on peanuts & peanut butters, nefarious actors have succeeded in removing access to a cheap, healthy, & widely available protein food source for future American children.  Removing access to peanuts as a healthy source of protein & calories created a vacuum in the diet of this already malnourished population of children, our future representation. The removal exacerbated the upcoming generation's dependence further towards commercialized "food alternatives", while depriving them of the necessary nutrition in maintaining functionally conditioned bodies. We now see widespread obesity, diabetes, cardio issues, lethargy, breathing difficulties, etc.  We used to teach the historical importance of peanuts. We used to identify the peanut butter & jelly sandwich as a staple of American childhood lunches. The societal push to strip us of this culturally important & survival dependent food source has been an act of war intended to weaken our people within a generation, & soften our resolve to prepare us for an easier defeat yet to come.	1642968803.0	sb2nzo	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb2nzo/proliferation_of_peanut_allergies_was_an/	Proliferation of Peanut Allergies was an unacknowledged act of aggression

Later as a joke I remembered that I got the new iPhone 12 pro max in September and it has 5G and the next month in October I caught Covid lol. I told her the 5G gave me Covid, only explanation. I know it’s more of a joke, but maybe it did. We will never know for sure.   Here’s another Covid joke that I used on my stepdad, the family loved it. My stepdad went and got his vaccinations for Covid, turned out pretty good for him.

a8t87	If you haven't been following it at all there is a massive convoy of truckers travelling across Canada to the capital in protest of the vaccine mandates for truckers crossing the American border. They plan to jam Ottawa up until the mandates are lifted.      Well this has created the largest propaganda push I have seen since perhaps the start of the vaccination campaign. It's incredible. Mainstream media is running a smear campaign, the shilling on Canadian subreddits has gone through the roof. If the push if this huge, that means this has the government very worried and they should be. It took a little while here, but finally the people are starting to become more organized in their opposition. It's just the start.      Since you can't follow through the Media, I recommend using Twitter for now, our perhaps GETTR (though I'm not a fan of this site) using the hashtag #TruckersForFreedom. But the best show of support is go meet the on the highway and cheer them on! It's been incredibly inspiring seeing the videos of citizens showing support and waving flags.	1642969251.0	sb2u2x	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb2u2x/truckersforfreedom_has_the_canadian_government/	#TruckersForFreedom has the Canadian government very worried

4rxsrjwk	During my previous post I had several kind folks enlighten me on the energy of life. As a Christian, supposedly it is acceptable to dabble in such.  Now, I am curious about this life energy, and how we can use it to move objects, sort of like telekinesis.  I know that there is a dark side to it of course. Apparently you are able to learn to drain life energy. I am not here for that. I would only like to learn how to move objects and perform what is considered supernatural.   However, I’m still a little skeptical of it. It could be seen as imitating God, but I’m getting sort of a mixed message on here. I need a definite answer whether Christian’s are allowed to mess with life energy (reiki, chi etc. many names).	1642970108.0	sb35us	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb35us/another_post_about_the_force/	Another post about “The Force”.

7py750gf	It’s Agenda 2030 - we’re only 2 years in of a 10 year plan. And they *will* do everything in their power, and whatever is necessary, to get the job done they way they want it done. To them, the means (and I mean *any* means) are justified by their end goals.  Their goal: global governance, every last human tracked, monitored and controlled, zero privacy, and conditional, limited and revocable freedoms. Also a smaller (therefore more easy to control) population.  We may have won a battle or two, but this is a long, drawn out war. And I think it’s better to prepare yourself mentally for that than let your guard down too early and suffer further disillusionment.   Early in 2020, I knew a lot of this shit was going to go down, and people in our own community of skeptics thought I was being too negative when I warned of what is now actually occurring.   I just think it’s better to know what’s coming so you don’t get your hopes up when we’re not even a quarter of the way into their plans.   They’ve been preparing and war-gaming every possible scenario for decades. There is very little that we can do that they haven’t already anticipated. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t stop trying to locate the weak spot in their house of cards. I still have the hope we can topple it because there has to be *something* they didn’t plan for.   It’s best to see everything that’s happening as a Pavlovian experiment. They are training us to salivate any time they ring a bell. What’s the bell? Future viruses/variants, climate change, terrorism… anything they can come up with. They ring the bell and we hide out in our homes, shut down our businesses without question, isolate from others, masked, afraid and awaiting instructions.   Phase one was just training day. And we’re all trained up and unquestioningly loyal to our masters now (many of us at least).  So it's not that the restrictions are being revoked, just tabled for the time being. The fact that we even know there's a potential for them to exist to begin with is enough for this phase to be considered a success.    I fully realized this when I was on the bus and it dawned on me that the hardest people to win over - the hard-working, poor, local public transit users - were complying with every bit security theater they were asked to… despite being exhausted from a hard day’s work and eager to get home.   Imagine working grueling hours at an amazon factory on your feet all day and *not* sitting in an open seat next to someone because a sticker is telling you to social distance.   Imagine, in the dead of winter and after waiting for the bus in the freezing winter air, a window is cracked open on that bus meaning you’ll be cold on the way home too.   And despite being forced to wear a mask all day at work, you must continue this futile charade on your commute home as well.  If they’ve already succeeded in training the people who usually wouldn’t give a fuck about arbitrary, made-up rules - unless they thought their life and the lives of others depended on it - we are well trained up already.  So when the Wuhan/whatever gain-of-function lab releases the next virus with an even higher fatality rate, people will be in line with their sleeves rolled up unquestioningly - as they’ve been trained to. Regardless of what’s being injected into them and how new, untested and experimental it is.  Depopulating the planet in one go would be foolish and they know this. People would eventually wise up if everyone died at once. But space it out over the years and blame it on anything but the new mystery science juice you just willingly injected into your bodies, and you have plausible deniability. Maybe you only kill a few percent with each booster.   This is especially true if you eliminate the control group - as there won't be anything to compare yourself to.  And we all know anyone questioning things is now regarded as an even bigger threat than the virus itself and something to be dealt with immediately and in any way necessary - with full support of the herd. Our very existence is hard evidence against the perpetrators. They can't let that stand.  So don’t let your guard down just yet. Each phase until the end goal is met will only get harder and harder. Brace yourselves.	1642970587.0	sb3ci2	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb3ci2/i_have_some_concerns_over_people_getting_excited/	I have some concerns over people getting excited about restrictions being eased in some places.

2c3rco90	I want to preface this as a neutral standpoint. If you HAVE the vaccine, I don't care. If you have the vaccine BUT berate me on how "I'm going to die" or "Im selfish", that's where I have to draw the line.   I have a friend who is NOT vaccinated but plans to get vaccinated. They preach about how Im doing my fiance and my family a disservice by not wanting to take the jab. They comment on all my pictures about "when (not if) you get COVID, they aren't coming to visit" or "they don't see the point in not getting it". The thing is though, if I am required to get it, I would be more comfortable with the JJ. However, to them, if its not pfizer, its wrong. I try to explain to them why I don't get the vaccine using the reasons below.  The vaccine is EUA, not fully tested.  The ads we see do not show the side effects.  Moderna specifically, is tied to Bill Gates who experimented with malaria vaccines in 3rd world countries, which caused millions of deaths.  Pfizer had to pay 2.3 billion dollars in fraud and bribery in 2009.  But, aside from all that, the FDA is currently seizing packages that have hydroxychloroquine as well as ivermectin to "protect the public".  Masks work, then dont work, then work again.  COVID numbers are inflated due to the vaccine deaths, not because COVID is starting up again.  But my main issue is that this vaccine isn't a vaccine, it's an assistor. I dont feel as though I should have to take the jab just to slightly enhance my survival rate on a disease that shares the same name with the common cold. Preventing the spread of the virus is as easy as being clean and hygienic. Thats all.	1642970762.0	sb3esl	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb3esl/my_experience_with_the_vaccinated_and_why_im/	My experience with the vaccinated and why I'm weary of taking it.

3eips2un	There's nobody in control, not even the president. If anyone ever really had "control" they lost it long ago. Nobody is capable of creating real change in our government no matter how hard they try. We've created a system that resists change so much that it will never occur. The senators are helpless, the president is helpless, even the corporations and CEOs are helpless. Nobody who wants to create change can ever win an election, and winning is contingent on amassing a coalition of corporate donors who each direct one or two aspects of your action, but not all.

2kla20j	Have you heard of Democrat politicians talk trash about FL's lax mask restrictions and then go to Florida?  They don't care. They just want to one up for their side. Their side doesn't care if AOC went to FL. The only logic they believe is as long as they get more power and control, who cares.   It's time to stop going "but they did the same thing they spoke against." BECAUSE THEY ALREADY KNOW.   LGBT don't want Christian conversion therapy allowed, but want kids to take hormone pills if they think they're the opposite sex. THEY DONT CARE.

gg6jqkhr	By Michael Nevradakis  Global Research, January 12, 2022  &#x200B;  *High-level international banking officials and organizations gathered last month for a global “war game” exercise simulating the collapse of the global financial system. The tabletop exercise was reminiscent of “Event 201,” the pandemic simulation exercise that took place just before COVID-19 entered the global scene.*  High-level international banking officials and organizations last month gathered in Israel for a global “war game” exercise simulating the collapse of the global financial system.  The tabletop exercise was reminiscent of “Event 201” — the pandemic simulation exercise that took place in October 2019, shortly before COVID-19 entered the global scene.  The “Collective Strength” initiative was held for 10 days, beginning Dec. 9, 2021, at the Israeli Finance Ministry in Jerusalem. It was relocated to Jerusalem from the Dubai World Expo over concerns about the Omicron variant.  Israel led a 10-country contingent that also included treasury officials from the U.S., Austria, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Thailand and the United Arab Emirates.  Representatives from supranational organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Bank of International Settlements (BIS), also participated.  Described as a simulated “war game,” the exercise sought to model the response to various hypothetical large-scale cyberattacks on the global financial system, including the leaking of sensitive financial data on the “Dark Web,” hacks targeting the global foreign exchange system, and subsequent bank runs and market chaos fueled by “fake news.”  However, the main theme of “Collective Strength” appears not so much the simulation of such cyberattacks but, as the name of the initiative implies, the strengthening of global cooperation in cybersecurity and the financial sector.  As reported by Reuters, participants in the simulation discussed multilateral responses to a hypothetical global financial crisis.  Proposed policy solutions included debt repayment grace periods, SWAP/REPO agreements, coordinated bank holidays and coordinated delinking from major currencies.  The idea of simulated delinking from major currencies raised some eyebrows because of its timing — on the same day participants gathered to launch “Collective Strength,” reports circulated that the Biden administration was considering removing Russia from the global electronic-payment-messaging system known as SWIFT, short for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication.  This measure would be part of a package of economic sanctions the U.S. would levy against Russia should it attack Ukraine.  However, what may raise even more eyebrows is the list of participants in the “Collective Strength” simulation, which includes: the IMF and World Bank, and indirectly, the World Economic Forum (WEF).  It was the WEF, along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which ran the simulated “Event 201” in October 2019.  As previously reported by The Defender, the WEF also supported the development of financial instruments, such as credit and debit cards, that would track “personal carbon allowances” on an individualized basis.  An executive summary issued in November 2020 by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, in collaboration with the WEF, provided a rundown of just the type of scenario that was simulated as part of “Collective Strength.”  The report’s authors, Tim Maurer and Arthur Nelson, described a world whose financial system is undergoing “an unprecedented digital transformation … accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic.”  In such a world, the authors argued, “cybersecurity is more important than ever.”  Describing protection of the global financial system as an “organizational challenge,” the report pointed out there is no clear global actor in charge of protecting the global financial system or its digital infrastructure.  The executive summary went so far as to describe a “disconnect between the finance, the national security and the diplomatic communities.”  The solutions identified by Maurer and Nelson included:  * The need for “greater clarity” regarding roles and responsibilities * Bolstering international cooperation * Reducing fragmentation and increasing “internationalization” among “siloed” financial institutions * Developing a model that can then be used in unspecified “other” sectors.  But which “other” sectors?  This set of recommendations was classified by the authors in their report under “Digital Transformation: Safeguard Financial Inclusion.”  One such recommendation reads as follows:  “The G20 should highlight that cybersecurity must be designed into technologies used to advance financial inclusion from the start rather than included as an afterthought.”  Technology that is “used to advance financial inclusion from the start” would appear to include digital “health passports” and accompanying “digital wallets.”  It also seems to be aligned with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals — in particular, Goal 16.9, which calls for the provision of a digital legal identity for all, including newborns, by 2030.  Goal 16.9 also brings to mind the European Union’s insistence that its vaccine passport, the so-called “Green Pass,” which is used in numerous European countries to bar the unvaccinated and those with natural immunity from all sorts of public and private spaces, protects individuals’ privacy.  In a further connection between two distinct issues — security of the global financial system and public health — the GAVI Vaccine Alliance called for “innovations that leverage new technologies to modernize the process of identifying and registering the children who are most in need of life-saving vaccines.”  However, the use of these technologies would not stop with registering childhood vaccinations. GAVI described potential uses of these “new technologies” as encompassing “access to other services,” including the broadly defined “financial services.”  The authors of the Carnegie Endowment executive summary mirrored their proposals in a spring 2021 article that appears on the IMF’s website, although issues of “financial inclusion” are left out.  While the two authors of the Carnegie report, and the participants in the “Collective Strength” initiative, emphasize the need for the financial system and its digital data to be better protected, it remains unclear how a continued transformation toward a fully digital, cloud-based environment can indeed be considered “secure.”  Consider, for instance, the following remark by Micha Weis, financial cyber manager at the Israeli finance ministry, in reference to “Collective Strength”: “\[a\]ttackers are 10 steps ahead of the defender.”  Such words don’t offer much comfort to those who are already wary of “FinTech,” or the increasing proximity between “Big Tech” and “Big Finance.”  Similarly, yet another “simulation” of a large-scale and destructive global catastrophe will, for some, bring back recollections of “Event 201” and what followed thereafter — infamously described on March 20, 2020, by then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as a “live exercise.”  \*  ***Michael Nevradakis****, Ph.D., is an independent journalist and researcher based in Athens, Greece.*     Note: All hyperlinks removed from this article due to Reddit Censorship.

7hf07m3b	Alright I'm back at it again with this off putting picture but before I go deep into analysis it must be known that I had not intended any of this, I'm very unbiased and am only relaying what I noticed in the picture. I just ran into this picture the other day and it was immediately weird to me. I thought it was fake, staged and photoshopped before I even knew who it was.... then I found out its bill mf gates. so obviously I started examining the picture a little harder and here are some things I noticed.  1.) for one, I couldn't even recognize that this is bill gates even after I learned who it was my brain just refuses to put it together. yes, I understand that he is wearing a mask but it doesn't matter, I can recognize everyone in my life with a mask on but my brain refuses to put it together here. try it for yourself, go look at pictures of gates for like 5 min and then return to that picture.  2.) the guy never has his glasses off. again, I'm not some bill enthusiast here so I could be wrong but even when I tried finding a picture of him without glasses, nothing. no point to be made here other than its weird.  3.) ok check out the position of his left arm. Unnatural. at first I thought it was just weird but if you think about it maybe he's trying to keep something in the photo? THE RING. yanno? just incase there was any crazies like me who wanted to try saying its not bill haha how could it not be bill? the ring is right there to prove it HAHAHA.  4.) for someone who knows there will be a plethora of people questioning his vaccine status, its not just a little weird that the actual injection isn't in the shot? YES IT IS WEIRD. not only is the injection not visible but notice how the doctor is standing. AWKWARD. elbow all up in bills face instead of taking a step to their right?   5.) the hair. I mean come on the hair doesn't look a little bit off? nothing about that hair says natural. its all over the place and has no memory. if he combed it in the same direction everyday like most people do, then it would have almost a memory of where to lay. whoever, in this picture it looks intentionally messy like someone messed it up for the photo. weird.  6.) the ear. alright everything before this i noticed right off the bat but the ear thing i looked for. if you look at bills ears he has a slight curve at the top of the ear. however in this picture there is no curve at the top. actually a curve midway down, which bill does not have. again we have to factor in the mask. the mask would only push the ear out though, not change the shape and indents on your ear.   anyways, I'm not even inclined to say that this isn't bill. my whole point of this post is just to see if anyone else gets a weird vibe from this photo.   I'm also curious if anyone can find a photo of bills arms maybe we can verify those sun spots or birth marks. idk, also those marks can appear as you age but I don't believe they disappear so if we find a recent picture of bills arms then that can basically confirm  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/dzvhm31mbid81.png?width=568&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4e3725a1406eb1f006402c2ddf563783a76b3ca	1642975596.0	sb5b8r	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb5b8r/gill_bates/	Gill Bates
ul5th	So I've noticed that many users on here who argue for vaccination and/or mandate compliance etc. often have similarities in their user history. They'll frequently have accounts that are many years old and haven't had any activity for many months, often years until just a few days earlier where all of a sudden they are posting multiple times a day. Are these dormant accounts shills or click farmers or what? I've also noticed the upvote vs downvote ratios change in many posts, often hours or days after the discussions got old, ceased to have activity and disappear into the 10th to 20th page.  Is this a case of some people living a sad enough existence which gives them enough time to influence/manipulate discussion results or is it a larger, more concerted effort from coordinated groups to brigade this sub?	1642975888.0	sb5fln	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb5fln/noticed_a_pattern_with_many_accounts_that_come/	Noticed a pattern with many 'accounts' that come here and quarrel with conspiracy narratives (for lack of better phrasing)

As a big sports fan, I know that it’s only fair to judge an athlete based on what they do on the field/court.

I was smiling from ear to ear for a whole day thinking about all the places I can go into now as an unvaccinated person.  But I really thought about it, and realised that I can't bring myself to give any cash to the businesses that assisted this coercion that resulted in many family members of mines getting the vaccine. I noticed a local business who was extra keen on pushing the vaccine is now going out of business due to a lack of customers.  I must admit, the only places I want to go to are the ones that never asked me for a QR code. I thought i'd be overjoyed still with the freedoms I re-obtained but I just feel... angry.

eb6006wc	About a year ago I went to see a cardiologist about feeling breathless while doing my job which is quite physical. A couple breathing tests and inhalers later he decided to refer me for a HRCT (high resolution CT). I didn’t think much of it and went along to the scan appointment. On the day I was told the scan is the equivalent of about 3 or 4 chest X-rays and I have nothing to be concerned about. However, later that day I decided to take a look online to see how much radiation really was in a CT. A chest CT can contain a radiation dose of up to 7.5mSv. A normal chest X-ray is only 0.02mSv making some CT scans the equivalent of having 375 regular chest X-rays.Who in there right mind would agree to have that many X-rays in one sitting? I’m assuming 99% of the people going in for these scans haven’t been told any of this nor would they look it up. These type of scans could be causing millions of future cancer cases around the world but I guess that’s the plan.I’m pissed that I was lied to about the amount of radiation I received that day, if I had looked into it prior to the scan I would not have gone through with it.	1642982699.0	sb7yhz	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb7yhz/hospital_xray_radiation_doses/	Hospital X-ray radiation doses

g8r7shsr	According to statistics from Our World in Data, 0.6 percent of the population was testing positive per day. But Prof. Eran Segal, a leading health expert and adviser to the Israeli government, notes that the dubious distinction of being first in the rate of infections might also be due to the high volume of tests performed each day.  Eran went on to say that Israel is almost at the peak of the current wave, the country’s fifth, and that numbers are expected to decline in a week or so.  “During the coming week we will start to see a decrease in the number of infections. We have already seen a decrease in infections in people over 60. This week we will reach 50,000 or 40,000 cases a day,” Segal told Channel 12 news.  Beginning Thursday, the country will scrap quarantine for children exposed to coronavirus carriers. Those who test positive will still be required to isolate for a minimum of five days.  The number of seriously ill patients rose to 732 over the weekend. 68 Israelis died from coronavirus in the past week, bringing the death toll to 8,393.  https://ourworldindata.org/	1642983802.0	sb8cnw	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb8cnw/quadruplevaxed_israel_breaks_world_record_in/	Quadruple-Vaxed Israel Breaks World Record in Coronavirus Cases

This latter element requires that before the acceptance of an affirmative decision by the experimental subject there should be made known to him the nature, duration, and purpose of the experiment; the method and means by which it is to be conducted; all inconveniences and hazards reasonably to be expected; and the effects upon his health or person which may possibly come from his participation in the experiment. The duty and responsibility for ascertaining the quality of the consent rests upon each individual who initiates, directs or engages in the experiment. It is a personal duty and responsibility which may not be delegated to another with impunity.  **2. The experiment should be such as to yield fruitful results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods or means of study, and not random and unnecessary in nature**.  **3. The experiment should be so designed and based on the results of animal experimentation and a knowledge of the natural history of the disease or other problem under study that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment.**  **4. The experiment should be so conducted as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury.**  **5. No experiment should be conducted where there is an a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur; except, perhaps, in those experiments where the experimental physicians also serve as subjects.**  **6. The degree of risk to be taken should never exceed that determined by the humanitarian importance of the problem to be solved by the experiment.**  **7. Proper preparations should be made and adequate facilities provided to protect the experimental subject against even remote possibilities of injury, disability, or death.**  **8. The experiment should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons. The highest degree of skill and care should be required through all stages of the experiment of those who conduct or engage in the experiment.**  **9. During the course of the experiment the human subject should be at liberty to bring the experiment to an end if he has reached the physical or mental state where continuation of the experiment seems to him to be impossible.**  **10. During the course of the experiment the scientist in charge must be prepared to terminate the experiment at any stage, if he has probable cause to believe, in the exercise of the good faith, superior skill, and careful judgment required of him, that a continuation of the experiment is likely to result in injury, disability, or death to the experimental subject.**  The Nuremberg Code is the most important document in the history of the ethics of medical research.1-6 The Code was formulated 50 years ago, in August 1947, in Nuremberg, Germany, by American judges sitting in judgment of Nazi doctors accused of conducting murderous and torturous human experiments in the concentration camps (the so-called Doctors' Trial).7   It served as a blueprint for today's principles that ensure the rights of subjects in medical research. Because of its link with the horrors of World War II and the use of prisoners in Nazi concentration camps for medical experimentation, debate continues today about the authority of the Code, its applicability to modern medical research, and even its authorship.1,2,4,5,8 The chief prosecutor at the Doctors' Trial, General Telford Taylor, believed that one of the three U.S. judges, Harold Sebring, was the author of the Code.2   Two American physicians who helped prosecute the Nazi doctors at Nuremberg, Leo Alexander and Andrew Ivy, have each been identified as the Code's author.5,8-11 A careful reading of the transcript of the Doctors' Trial, background documents, and the final judgment reveals that authorship was shared and that the famous 10 principles of the Code grew out of the trial itself. In this article I will explain the important role that physicians had in the prosecution of the Nazi doctors and in the formulation of the Nuremberg Code and summarize how medical researchers have used the Code as a guide over the past five decades.  **The Doctors' Trial**  The main trial at Nuremberg after World War II was conducted by the International Military Tribunal. The tribunal was made up of judges from the four allied powers (the United States, Britain, France, and the former Soviet Union) and was charged with trying Germany's major war criminals. After this first-of-its-kind international trial, the United States conducted 12 additional trials of representative Nazis from various sectors of the Third Reich, including law, finance, ministry, and manufacturing, before American Military Tribunals, also at Nuremberg. The first of these trials, the Doctors' Trial, involved 23 defendants, all but 3 of whom were physicians accused of murder and torture in the conduct of medical experiments on concentration-camp inmates.7 The indictment of the defendants was filed on October 25, 1946, 25 days after the conclusion of the first Nuremberg trial by the International Military Tribunal. The Doctors' Trial began on December 9, 1946, and ended on July 19, 1947. The case was heard by three judges and one alternate. Thirty-two prosecution witnesses and 53 defense witnesses, including the 23 defendants, testified. A total of 1471 documents were introduced into the record. Sixteen of the 23 defendants were found guilty; 7 of them were sentenced to death by hanging, 5 to life imprisonment, 2 to imprisonment for 25 years, 1 to imprisonment for 15 years, and 1 to imprisonment for 10 years. Seven were acquitted. The sentences were confirmed by the military governor, and, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, the executions were carried out at the Landsberg prison. For the United States and its chief prosecutor, Telford Taylor, the trial was a murder trial (and murder had been identified by the International Military Tribunal as a crime against humanity). Nonetheless, as Taylor pointed out in his opening statement, this was “no mere murder trial,” because the defendants were physicians who had sworn to “do no harm” and to abide by the Hippocratic Oath.12 He told the judges that the people of the world needed to know “with conspicuous clarity” the ideas and motives that moved these doctors “to treat their fellow human beings as less than beasts,” and that “brought about such savageries” so that they could be “cut out and exposed before they become a spreading cancer in the breast of humanity.”12 One recurring theme was the relevance of Hippocratic ethics to human experimentation and whether Hippocratic moral ideals could be an exclusive guide to the ethics of research without risk to the human rights of subjects. In the trial's exploration of ideas that shaped medical-research ethics, three physicians had central roles: Leo Alexander, an American neuropsychiatrist, Werner Leibbrand, a German psychiatrist and medical historian, and Andrew Ivy, a renowned American physiologist.  LEO ALEXANDER  Leo Alexander, a Viennese-born American physician, had joined the U.S. Army Medical Corps in 1942, before being stationed in England at the American Eighth Air Force base. At the end of the war, Alexander was sent on a special mission under the Combined Intelligence Objectives Sub-Committee, an intelligence organization with members from several nations, and charged by orders from Supreme Headquarters of Allied Expeditionary Forces to gather evidence for the Nuremberg trials. Two days before the opening of the Doctors' Trial, Alexander gave Taylor a memorandum entitled “Ethical and Non-Ethical Experimentation on Human Beings,” in which he identified three ethical, legal, and scientific requirements for the conduct of human experimentation.9 The first requirement established the right of the competent experimental subject to consent or refuse to participate in these terms: “the subject should be willing to undergo the experiment of his own free will. . . .” The second focused on the duty of physicians as expressed in the Hippocratic Oath, which Alexander restated in research terms: “the medical Hippocratic attitude prohibits an experiment if the foregone conclusion, probability or a priori reason to believe exists that death or disabling injury of the experimental subject will occur.” The third characterized good research practices. On April 15, 1947, Alexander gave Taylor a second memorandum.9,11 In it he set forth in greater detail six specific conditions for ethically and legally permissible experiments on human beings. The first stated that  the legally valid voluntary consent of the experimental subject is essential. This requires specifically the absence of duress, sufficient disclosure on the part of the experimenter and sufficient understanding on the part of the experimental subject of the exact nature and consequences of the experiment for which he volunteers, to permit an enlightened consent.  The five other conditions established the humanitarian nature and purpose of the experiment and the scientific integrity and obligations of the investigator to the welfare of the subject.  WERNER LEIBBRAND  On January 27, 1947, Werner Leibbrand, a German psychiatrist and medical historian at Erlangen University, opened the debate on medical ethics at Nuremberg.12 He explained to the court that German physicians at the beginning of the 20th century had adopted a “biologic thinking” according to which a patient was a series of biologic events, and nothing more than “a mere object, like a mail package.”12 Leibbrand insisted that such a view precluded any human relation between physicians and their patients and that it represented a perversion of Hippocratic ethics and “a lack of morality and reverence for human life.”12 He strongly condemned physicians who conducted experiments on subjects without their consent, and testified that this was also the result of biologic thinking. During cross-examination, defense lawyers asserted that “civilized” nations such as France, the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States had performed dangerous medical experiments on prisoners, often without their consent. They cited American malaria experiments12-14 to argue that Nazi physicians had followed common research practices. Leibbrand replied that this American research also was wrong because “prisoners were in a forced situation and could not be volunteers.”12 Leibbrand insisted that “the morality of a physician is to hold back his natural research urge which may result in doing harm, in order to maintain his basic medical attitude that is laid down in the Oath of Hippocrates.”12 This strong accusation of American research by the prosecution's first medical-ethics witness created major unanticipated problems for the prosecution. It therefore became necessary to broaden the scope of the trial by defining the conditions under which risky human experimentation is ethically permissible. Defense lawyers explained that Nazi doctors were ordered by the state to conduct such experiments as the high-altitude, hypothermia, and seawater experiments on inmates at the Dachau concentration camp to determine how best to protect and treat German fliers and soldiers. They contended that these experiments were necessary and that the “good of the state” takes precedence over that of the individual.12 Leibbrand replied that “the state could order deadly experiments on human subjects, but the physicians remained responsible for \[not\] carrying them out.”12 Once these physiologic experiments became the centerpiece of the trial, reliance on psychiatrists alone was not possible. The prosecution needed a prestigious medical scientist who was an authority on research physiology and whose wartime scientific interests corresponded to those of the Nazi doctor defendants. This expert was Andrew Ivy.  ANDREW IVY  Andrew Ivy was an internationally known physiologist and a noted scientist. He also had first-hand knowledge of the Stateville Penitentiary experiments on malaria12,13 in his home state of Illinois, which the Nazi defendants attempted to liken to those performed on concentration-camp inmates. When the secretary of war, through the surgeon general of the army, asked the board of trustees of the American Medical Association to nominate a medical advisor to the Nuremberg prosecution, Ivy emerged as the natural nominee. On June 12, 1947, Ivy came to Nuremberg for the third time, this time to testify in rebuttal for the prosecution. His testimony, the longest of the trial, lasted four days.12 In direct examination, Ivy presented to the judges three research principles that he had formulated at the request of the American Medical Association and which, he said, reflected common research practices.12 His document entitled “Principles of Ethics Concerning Experimentation with Human Beings,” adopted by the American Medical Association House of Delegates in December 1946, read in part:  1. Consent of the human subject must be obtained. All subjects have been volunteers in the absence of coercion in any form. Before volunteering, subjects have been informed of the hazards, if any. Small rewards in various forms have been provided as a rule. 2. The experiment to be performed must be based on the results of animal experimentation and on a knowledge of the natural history of the disease under study, and must be so designed that the anticipated results will justify the performance of the experiment. The experiment must be such as to yield results for the good of society, unprocurable by other methods of study, and must not be random and unnecessary in nature. 3. The experiment must be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and so as to avoid all unnecessary physical and mental suffering and injury and only after the results of adequate animal experimentation have eliminated any a priori reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur. . . .15  Ivy explained that these common-sense principles mirrored the understanding shared by everyone in practice in the medical community.12 The first principle was that a physician would never do anything to a patient or subject before obtaining his or her consent. Ivy also asserted that, unlike Leibbrand, he did not consider prisoners to be in an inherently coercive situation and thus unable to give consent, because in democratic countries where the rights of individuals are respected, prisoners can always say yes or no without fear of being punished.12 He testified:  The American malaria experiments with 800 or more prisoners were absolutely justified, scientifically, legally and ethically even if they bring with them danger to human life. To treat malaria was an important scientific problem, and so long as the subjects volunteer and are explained the hazards of the experiments, there is no ethical reason against it. . . . If prisoners condemned to death are volunteers, then it was ethical to do just that.12  During cross-examination, Ivy acknowledged that there were no written principles of research in the United States or elsewhere before December 1946 and that the principles adopted by the American Medical Association were expressly formulated for the Doctors' Trial.12 Ivy also recognized that the right of the research subject to withdraw from an experiment may not always exist, as in the malaria experiments in which the subjects had already been infected, or in dangerous experiments in which the subjects could be severely injured or fatally harmed. Ivy agreed with Leibbrand that researchers must refuse to conduct experiments on human beings when ordered by the state in order “to save lives,” because in such cases subjects would not be volunteers. He declared that “\[t\]here is no justification in killing five people in order to save the lives of five hundred” and that “no state or politician under the sun could force \[him\] to perform a medical experiment which \[he\] thought was morally unjustified.”12 Ivy also stressed that the state may not assume the moral responsibility of physicians to their patients or research subjects, arguing that “\[E\]very physician should be acquainted with the Hippocratic Oath \[which\] represents the Golden Rule of the medical profession in the United States, and, to \[his\] knowledge, throughout the world.”12 When, finally, defense counsel asked Ivy to reconcile the Hippocratic moral maxim that forbids physicians to “administer a poison to anyone even when asked to do so” with conducting potentially lethal experimental interventions on volunteer subjects, Ivy replied, “I believe this Hippocratic commandment refers to the function of the physician as a therapist, not as an experimentalist, and what refers to the Hippocratic Oath is that he must have respect for life and the human rights of his experimental patient.”12  **See more info** Medical Ethics and Human Rights	1642984343.0	sb8jl7	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb8jl7/the_nuremberg_code_the_doctors_trials/	The Nuremberg Code, The Doctors Trials

zu93y	For those of us older than 50 years old, do you remember any of your pets or childhood friends with food allergies?  No, neither do I.  Yet now, some of our pets have severe allergies to some foods, and need special diets.  I myself have spent thousands of dollars on a dog for special food because they had severe itchy skin and couldn't stop biting and scratching themselves.  Kids dying from peanuts?  That's only a recent thing in the past 50 years.  What's in common?  Vaccines.  Now, dogs have to have what, 8 -10 different vaccines and kids have to have 20 or more?  The oils that are in the vaccine to carry the stuff they want the body to attack use peanut oil, corn oils, etc.  And sometimes, when the body creates the hoped for immune response, dogs and kids, it makes a mistake and targets the extra stuff that was in the vaccine.  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why dogs and kids are at higher risk for allergies now that 50 years ago.	1642985293.0	sb8v6f	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb8v6f/sick_dogs_and_sick_kids_whats_the_commonality/	Sick dogs and sick kids...

b59n8	I am polishing this point in an article and I'm trying to conclude if there are any laws protecting consumers and the public from suppressing information about their product.  for example, I couldn't have a bus full of vegans come to my restaurant and people in my company actively try to obfuscate the fact that my food is made from animals so the vegans don't notice and object to the purchase.    yes, under nuremberg code these coerced mandates require informed consent, which those definitions are laid out clearly what informed consent is, its not what the experiment subject finds acceptable but essentially what a responsible party who fully understands the experiment knows the subject needs to know to make an informed decision.    and frankly, the use of blended up baby parts in vaccines- veritas woke alot of people up to it, but still I bet 99 out of 100 people questioned would not know aborted fetuses are used in vaccines.  so they are uninformed on matters they would statistically object to in the majority if they were fully informed and were cognizant of the process (see the 9 hour deposition with stanley plotkin did getting interrogated by aaron siri on record.)  so basically in principle, I know the spirit of american law and principle is not fond of forcing one's beliefs/ethics onto another.  so there is a line somewhere there to be drawn.  but specifically if I could find a precedent illustrating this concept it would help the argument I'm making, but I'm still looking for my angle that is backed up by legal precedents.  it doesn't have to be about food or drugs either, but I need to provide examples of how our laws limit these sort of deceptive impulses corporations have.  Good manufacturing practices is a whole other thing.  I'm looking for precedents where suppression of ethical/moral facts to divert ethical/moral objection  &#x200B;  anybody?  btw i'm about to break the mirror in the sky with this article.  I'm really trying to include the fetal trafficking industry but if I can't find legal precedents where courts have recognized corporations cannot suppress facts they know will be objected.  this is common decency but is it in the justice system?  &#x200B;  any help i appreciate it	1642986455.0	sb9a87	/r/conspiracy/comments/sb9a87/veritas_exposure_of_emails_showing_pfizer/	veritas exposure of emails showing pfizer suppressing facts that aborted fetuses are used in their vaccine, I'm wondering what laws might be violated in hiding facts to circumvent ethical objection.

But how can they prove it you might ask? Well these people who control this system create the problems and show up as the solution. Everytime!!  I won’t be surprised that they willl be able to cure deadly diseases causing even those with the strongest of faith no matter their religion to step away and believe in SCIENCE.

438nthsb	Sunscreen is a 8.5 billion dollar industry world wide and expected to grow 3.5% this year. But is  sunscreen doing more harm than good? Yes, yes it is.   I think sunscreen actually makes you more susceptible to a sun burn. While using sunscreen it may give you temporary protection but in fact it’s actually weakening your skins ability to protect against UV rays.   Your skin should build a natural immunity against UV rays over time in my opinion. You use sunscreen and it destroys your skins ability to protect against UV rays, you become reliant on sunscreen while outside because without it you burn.   We’re just told to use it from a young age so we do and we destroy our skins ability to protect it self and we make it reliant on an expensive remedy. Sunscreen wasn’t invented until 1932, was everyone just walking around burnt all the time? This theory can apply to lots of other products as well.  I came up with this really cause I haven’t used sun screen in a long time and I haven’t had a sunburn in years.	1642990252.0	sbakgk	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbakgk/dont_trust_big_sunscreen/	Don’t trust big sunscreen

5alhx056	I need to rant a little. I'm sick of everything. I'm sick of everyone being completely blind and taking experimental vaccines that give people heart attacks, just because the Media told them too. I'm sick of the media not covering all the countless deaths from vaccines that happen. I'm sick of the Media not covering the HUGE anti-vaccine protests all over the world. I'm sick of people basically being FORCED to take this vaccine, or face unemployment. I'm in the Military, and was told to take the vaccine or I would be discharged. I feel like that isn't freedom. I feel like it's tyranny.   I'm sick of the Government hiding all the BS they have done. 9/11, cia, using their own citizens as lab rats. Aliens. Don't we, as citizens have the right to know? We ARE this country. Our founding fathers have it in writing, if We, the People, think our leaders are leading toward tyranny, we can make a Revolution, march up to the White House and take over. I feel like 95% of the this country is full of people completely blind and numb to everything. To the deep state. To the government. To everything.   I am almost sure that the vaccine has a much much deeper, darker purpose. I'm convinced that the vaccine doesn't protect you from Covid at all. I'm convinced that it has to do with population control. It has to do with seeing how submissive the world is. It has to do with crippling economies all over the world, so they have a reason to make the one world government , and finally have complete control and tyranny over all people. I know what they're doing, and I'm sick of it.

3yr5jdex	During the covid craziness my husband has been majorly responsible for opening my eyes. Not to just believe his opinions, but rather to question everything the mainstream media wants us to see/believe/etc.  Once I clearly saw the utter ridiculousness the government and media push out to convince us all to vaccinate I started to take to Reddit and before finding this sub I was severely discouraged and felt like a minority and not empowered.  This is the only place I’ve seen on the internet (not that I’m a big internet prowler) where “anti vaccine” or “vaccine hesitancy” posts aren’t taken down and blocked immediately.   Not to mention this real footage of recent protesting events that are shared and it gives me HOPE!  I am unvaccinated and insanely proud I hadn’t caved in - absolutely no shame to those who have, I came very close multiple times, but it feels great.  So just wanted to say thanks for being here and for any and all that you do to stand up for what you believe in!  Please be kind- I’m typically much more of a lurker on Reddit, just feeling inspired to share my gratitude	1642991674.0	sbb1j1	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbb1j1/i_just_wanna_say_thank_you/	I just wanna say thank you…

9nrqbqcb	Now before you say anything, I promise I'm not crazy or something. I am very confident that this is a very plausible theory, but without further due let me get into it.  For a little backstory, me and my friend were hanging out and talking about something but I forgot, he mentioned that he had found a 2 year old cheese stick in his bag. He didn't recall putting it there and I was confused how he didn't find it until now, but anyhow we checked out the expiration date on the back and it said 2019 clear as day. I was so confused on how it hadn't rotted or even molded in the slightest, despite my confusion he had an idea. An idea to place the cheese stick inside somewhere where no-one can find it, I was confused but then he proposed the theory...  The theory was that when the impeding nuclear doomsday hit where the U.S, Russia, North Korea, etc go into war, everything everywhere would be annihilated. Except that one cheese stick, due to the impeccable packaging on it, the cheese stick would survive only with lots of damage. Then, from a mixture of toxic chemicals and gasses. The structuring of the cheese stick would be broken down and re structured so that it could live, breath, walk, etc it would basically be a human cheese stick. there would be more because obviously there would be more cheese sticks that would have re productive systems, they would evolve...  They would have history, they would surpass us in terms of well, everything. no more hunger problems because they could just eat themselves and grow back, they can't die or feel pain. No more problems with overpopulation because without need of water, they could just terraform land with cheese. They will build amazing complicated structures, build cars that float, they will go to space and colonize other planets. There will be wars, pop culture, politics, but without doubt they will be the most advanced civilization ever. with intergalactic trade they will explore everything, there will be religions and the will have people like the pope aka chope. even racism with different types of cheese sticks being discriminated against, there are so many possibilities for the and its just a matter of time before it happens. There will be such a rich history within the different religions, races and stuff, I've barely scratched the surface of what will inevitably happen after we are gone. And maybe, just maybe. They'll make the same mistake as us...	1642991720.0	sbb20y	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbb20y/the_cheesestick_theory/	The Cheesestick Theory

arvrx0r1	Honeypot wardens removed my last post on social conditioning for being too spicy, so I'll link it externally [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/Retrofire-Pink/comments/saz103/my_argument_for_why_advocating_against_the/).   This opening paragraph should touch on my general philosophy.   >It goes by many names. Some regard it as "The Creature of Jekyll Island", others "the central bankers", others yet "the oligarchs", or "the elites", some spunky ones say "the jews", or the "globalists", my personal preference is "the machine". But we describe the same, exact, thing. A cartel of powerful financial interests dictating world affairs.  >>There is a growing fusion of the public-private sectors globally; which is slowly morphing into a hegemonic totalitarian order.   After pondering much of this over the years, and in light of recent events, it got me thinking.   I wrote a little poem/allegory too, yesterday.  >When the despotic king decides to remove the heaviest shackles from the slaves, you might give yourself pause; and brace yourself.  >When the despotic king's couriers begin with populist messages, advocating for the slaves, you might give yourself pause; and question "why?"  >**When the despotic king seems undeterred by the collapse of his empire, you might ask whose banner he truly serves.**  >When the despotic king begins to speak of imminent war, just after his newfound honor, you should prepare for dark times.  >When the despotic king(s) begin to fool not just the slaves, but you see the stir of rebellion begin to mysteriously disappear too, peer through the looking-glass.  ---------------------------  This post will touch on the subject of banners, and who serves whom. Operating on my own research, I believe much of this is needlessly complicated. The implications of the central idea are grand and expansive. But if you understand (or think you understand) the underlying workings of the machine, it becomes easier to predict future events and interpret stuff.  First of all, I think the conventional understanding of banners is kind of antiquated. Our conception of geopolitics is that of nation-states, a conflict of nations. However, our system has slowly evolved into an archipelago of stakeholders who govern from afar. A wealthy Chinese businessman has incredible influence over a foreign republic, like America. Politicians become nothing more than conduits for illicit bribery. Man naturally pursues increased status, and therefore man encourages the fusion of the public-private sectors to obtain it. Therefore, a nation is nothing. The United States of America (speaking as a patriotic American) ceases to exist as a sovereign force. The natural product of this system is a global totalitarian government denoted by monoculture.   All else being controlled, even *without* the establishment of this machine, the free-market naturally evolves *into* the machine (a lot of people are gonna hate me for this). The machine; in my opinion, is the natural consequence of the free-market. The free-market rewards consolidation, consolidation begets a lack of competition, a lack of competition generously rewards anti-competitive behavior and the capture of governance. Why play the game, when you can change the rules? For each dollar a stakeholder puts into a congressional puppet, they could prospectively get an output exponentially greater.  Population control is a lucrative industry, potentially the largest industry on Earth. And like any other free-market industry, it rewards consolidation. Diverse as they might be, the oligarchs are unified on the principle of self-enrichment. They have no banner, ideology, or creed. Only the desire for MORE control. Capitalism's main virtue is its tendency to reward efficency. The most *efficient* industry of this kind is totalitarianism. A system with no banners whatsoever. Only a centralized world government would satiate man's endless desire for power.  It has been conservatively estimated that some $40 trillion lies dormant in offshore bank accounts. How easily could *you* be bribed? What if someone approached you, suggested you might receive a lucrative book-deal in 5 years amounting to millions, if only you pass the torch. It requires less effort, and it also rewards you handsomely!  A good way to explain this: Charlie has a bowl of snickers bars in his lap he took from the teacher’s desk. Charlie really wants money, since his mom refused him allowance this week for being a screw-up. Your objective is to prevent Charlie from accepting $0.50 from his classmates for a single snickers bar. Everyone in Charlie’s class really WANTS a snickers bar. Some of his classmates have a lot of money which they stole from their parents, and want to buy LOTS of snickers bars. This is the plight of the modern politician.  Your objective is to stop Charlie from accepting $0.50 from his classmates in exchange for a candy from a bowl of snicker bars he possesses. This is impossible. As Charlie just wants money so he can buy the new mature rated Call of Duty. That costs like... $70 now? Charlie is *going* to sell that candy, even under supervision he might slip a snickers to Sydney.   Our system has no supervision. During the 1960's, some reverent sycophants decided making votes transparent was an EXCEPTIONAL IDEA. This opened the floodgates for illicit bribery. After the dawn of the information age, with a $5 Raspberry Pi a random cartel owner in sub-Saharan Africa could decide they want Americans to stop regulating Bananas so much in trade. So, they contact a politician, they affirm in the visible vote tally that congressmen jackoff voted *yes* to the USDA bill, and the rest is history. Now bananas can be coated with an experimental chemical to prevent them from ripening so quickly.  Now imagine that kind of bribery, but with the full might of trillions of dollars floating around, significant institutional connections, and encrypted (protected) comms. It's not hard to imagine how a nation's capital would quickly become an auction house. Naturally, the most wealthy stakeholders would exert more influence over the less wealthy. This might be why the Petroleum Age ended so abruptly. Oligarchs invested some [$150 trillion](https://ecologyfinance.com/index.php/2021/11/01/banks-and-investors-race-to-fund-150-trillion-net-zero-push-amid-fears-politics-could-fall-short/) into kickstarting the ordained "green energy revolution".  But when it really becomes exciting is when the stakeholders start to actually dominate the political system. Former heads of state like [Jimmy Carter](https://youtu.be/hDsPWmioSHg) have spoken candidly; describing the now global phenomena — as “a complete subversion of our political system”.  This could theoretically manifest itself top-down as the complete subversion of independent politicians, businesses, scientists, media, NGOs, journalists, etc. An explicit acknowledgment of those aims need not exist. It would naturally manifest itself in cities and large corporations, where wealth is concentrated without accountability.   ***THE WILL** to destabilize a system of governance they operate under (corporate capture)    ***THE MIGHT*** to assert their will through either legal or illegal means (unquantifiable influence)    ***THE "FREEDOM"*** to therefore enslave the population, to compel the population to become their subjugated production (oligarchy)  An implicit arrangent could exist, or a "pact"; which rewards conforminty to a central ideology. For example, maybe the banking cartel distinguishes the refusal to acknowledge the central banking system as a prerequisite for other favors. You might find it interesting how after the [1910 Pujo Committee](https://files.catbox.moe/qw2aqs.pdf) which spoke of "the concernation of control", reaching the conclusion that a handful of monolithic industrial and banking interests were seizing power, the mention of both has practically vaporized in Washington D.C  A pitvotal idea is that politicans do not represent the people, full-stop. In [2014](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B), sociologists observed that the American population exerts ZERO influence over public policy, while the most affluent dictated ALL policy, making the United States an oligarchy, by definition.  What happens is sovereign financial interests (such as China) begin to exert enough stakeholder power to essentially overrule the other stakeholders. With the collective autocratic might of $18 trillion in GDP and the economic powerhouse of a rapidly developing mega-economy, their espionage operations can penetrate deep into Washington D.C.   And the only means of preventing that espionage, would be for the ruling class to acquiesce their own game. It might not come as a surprise to anyone reading this, that the people who rule us don't care about anyone except themselves. No amount of patriotic duty is going to compel them to relinquish their hold on power. The entire system is *designed* to preserve their order. That is why fiat hyper-inflation disproportionately taxes the poor, why the [middle-class](https://files.catbox.moe/cavjyt.jpg) is slowly being engorged by the wealthy, might explain why small businesses have been the object of government affection recently, why offshore bank accounts are defended by the global military industrial complex, why "regulation" on large enterprise is strictly relegated to petty fines of no consequence, etc. "The rich get richer and the poor get poorer"  Therefore, power is transient. Nations are nothing more than meaningless vessels, with some emotion attached. So, I think they might actually have incentive to assist in the dismantling of the western world. An autocratic system is more... profitable? You could control the population more easily. A type of generational serfdom could be implemented without being burdened by lingering culture, and you guarantee the permanent preservation of your genetic lineage. China's PLA wrote a book titled ["Unrestricted Warfare"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_Warfare) in 1999 outlining the exercise of economic power to obtain political dominance over America.  My conclusion on the subject has been that economics and politics are currently the same. Those stakeholders with the most concernated wealth have a larger share of "the machine". And every other smaller oligarch and sycophant has *every incentive* to tow the line.   You begin seeing astroturfed political movements that arise overnight in media like "Stop Asian Hate", attempts to feminize the male population, propoganda everywhere, brutal repression of the ruling opposition, and there is unfortunately no one with any power to stop it. My moniker has always been that government is *supposed* to be a tool of the people, not the other way around. We find ourselves in a fabricated reality, an indoctrinated culture, where nations are in servitude to megalomaniacs, and freedom is slavery.    Like watering a flower, it is absorbed by the roots, and finds itself a pathway to every part of the plant. To speak candidly; I believe we just witnessed the establishment of the first global totalitarian government. And we now all live under its shadow.   It probably would not come as a surprise to anyone reading this to learn that I'm an ardent  American patriot, and my view is admittedly Americentric. So I won't extrapolate these conclusions to other countries. This is just my own theory: the demolition of America is not the consequence of negligence or incompetence, it's the careful decision making of our new rulers. I recently saw an article suggesting that the largest banks in America are dumping the U.S dollar as their reserve currency, probably for whatever new international [CBDC](https://cbdctracker.org/). The writing is on the wall, this country is about to go the way of Rome.	1642993089.0	sbbhen	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbbhen/theory_the_destruction_of_the_western_world_is/	{Theory} The destruction of the western world is planned.

4622g225	After watching all the games this weekend, I can’t seem to think anything other than the fact that the NFL is rigged for entertainment and ratings, like the WWE is.

The Chiefs just beat the Bills and came back to force OT, only seconds after the Bills had just taken the lead, the Tampa Bay game had similar circumstances, and the Bengals-Titans game also came down to a last second field goal, and as a Packers fan, I don’t even want to talk about what happened there.

From the beauty community drama, tik tok stars drama (Jack-Sienna whatever), they use topics they know are sensitive to the public so people have a strong reaction to stuff and will take it seriously.  They would sell their grandma for some fame and money, the more I see how much importance people give to celebrities, influencers and media they more I realized we are stupid as shit as a species.  Some people have talent in the industry but they praise them for pointless shit, like I saw a reel about Ariana Grande performing with her period and the caption was like "omg she performed this with her period the power she holds" and many people commented it ain't it, everyone gets things done with periods, problems and bullshit, women have to deal with periods every fucking month and go on with their lives.

f4nl6vpn	Looking at some key chapters in Revelation and related passages in the rest of the bible to try to figure out what exactly is going on with the mark of the beast. Forgive the formatting, I'll edit it once it's posted.  For reference, I will use some terms you might not be familiar with:  YHWH= where most translations of the bible say "The LORD",  Elohiym="God" or more accurately "Mighty One" The Messiah= The Son of God, often called Jesus Christ but more accurately Yeshua or Yahusha Ha'Mashiach.   I've seen a lot of posts lately about the microchip or the vaccine being the mark of the beast. These posts ignore the plain writing in the text (name of the beast, number of its name, hand and forehead) and are an honest persons best guess based off of current world events. I understand "but we wont be able to buy or sell without it". Yes I will, off of you with my labour, or with the cucumbers from my garden. It is an insufficent examination of scripture that brings us to this understanding and we must dig DEEP to really mine what is being said. This is my attempt at doing so.  I'm not saying do the microchip or the vaccine thing, all I am saying is that based off of what I see in scripture, they cannot be the mark of the beast.  Revelation 13:14 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.  15 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.  From what I can see, this portion of the book of Revelation is all about deception vs Truth and counterfeit vs Real. When I read it these days, I see some interesting patterns that I want to try to articulate.  First of all, notice that the beast is able to deceive "the whole world" through the miracles and wonders he performs. This should cause us to reflect on another passage (Deuteronomy 13) where we are warned that: "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,2 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them; 3 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams: for YHWH your Elohiym proveth you, to know whether ye love YHWH your Elohiym with all your heart and with all your soul. 4 Ye shall walk after YHWH your Elohiym, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him, and cleave unto him."  The parallel is clear and intentional for us, if we know the scriptures. If a prophet, dreamer, or beast, comes with prophesy, predictions, dreams, and wonders, we are not to be led away from the worshipping the Creator. In this portion of Revelation, the world has chosen to disregard the instructions in Deutreonomy and has worshipped the beast as a result of the miracles he performs.   The image of the beast is a clear counterfeit. In scripture we see that Elohiym created man in his image. We are also told that the Messiah  was the image of the invisible Elohiym. It seems to me that the beast, as one desiring worship, is the counterfit of the creator   It's curious that the beast instructs the inhabitants of the earth to create the image. There is some type of blasphemy there for sure. I haven't heard this spoken about much when the subject comes up. The inhabitants of the earth make the image of the beast, and the beast gives it the ability to speak and kill all who do not take the mark of the beast. Here is the beast giving power and authority to its image and the image bringing death. In Genesis 1-2 we see Elohiym giving dominion to man over the earth and instructing man to be fruitful and multply. Polar opposites?  Moving along, lets get to the mark itself.  First, I want you to know that I do not trust a single translation of the bible to be entirely accurate. Translators have opinions and bias and it has made it's way into every single translation of the scripture. I think there are some things that cannot be properly communicated when going from Hebrew or Greek to Enlglish. Some concepts and cultural references that we wouldn't understand or appreciate fully today. And, maybe most importantly- people all around the world, even many who don't care about "Jesus" or the bible or faith or being faithful are claiming "mark of the beast" over the vaccine or the chips. Of course, many faithful believers are saying the same thing. But my point here is that you can't just walk in off the street, pick up the bible, and think you understand it just because you read it.  In other words READING DOES NOT EQUAL COMPREHENSION or UNDERSTANDING THE WORDS DOES NOT MEAN YOU UNDERSTAND THE MESSAGE.  Especially so with a deeply prophetic, symbolic and deep book such as the Bible in particular, but the book of Revelation specifically. In fact, I know lifelong "every day bible reading christians" who don't understand basic concepts from scripture. This is the danger with man made doctrine, traditions, or our own personal blinders. I've done some heavy work blowing past that in the last year, which is a different story.  So, all of that to preface my thoughts on the mark of the beast. Please read the passage in full:  11 Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon. 12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence,[c] and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed. 13 It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people, 14 and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of[d] the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.   15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain. 16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave,[e] to be marked on the right hand or the forehead, 17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name. 18 This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.  A few points:  Most translations have a footnote after the number 666 that states "some translations read 616". Taking the mark of the beast results in being thrown in the lake of fire later on in Revelation. Should we accept this confusing offering by the translators, two different numbers? No, of course we shouldn't. So what do we do?  If you look at the greek letters here you will end up down a rabbit hole. I will give you coles notes. There is reason to believe that the 3 symbols that were originally written in the greek (chi-xi-stigma or χξϚ ) can be pronounced in a way that sounds like "Jesus". This is incredibly controversial and will give you more questions then answers, I'm afraid. But stay with me.  Most christians believe in one that is called "Jesus". But, if you ask someone relatively well educated on the subject, they will admit that his name wasn't really Jesus. Instead, since the Hebrew language does not have a J (in fact, the English language didn't have a J until...1600s? I might be off there, but the original KJV bible didnt have the name Jesus, it said Ieousus), his name really started with a Y and was, in fact, the same name as the man who led Israel into the promised land after the death of Moses. Either Yeshua, Yehoshua, or Yahusha (arguments abound surrounding the actual name, the fact being it was certainly not Jesus that his parents named him, I call him Yahusha and will do so for the reminder of this post for clarity). I think this actually gives us some insight into the mark of the beast.  Remember my premise at the beginning. This portion of the book of Revelation is centred around deception and counterfeits. So it is with the mark of the beast. It is a counterfeit of the mark of YHWH:  14 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.   3 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth. 4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.  2 Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea, 3 saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads.”  You get two options here, you can bear the seal of Elohiym, the name of the Lamb and his Father, on your forehead or you can bear the mark of the beast. But remember, the mark of the beast is on the right hand or on the forehead.  So, to, is the mark of the Father:  It shall be as a mark on your hand or frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt..  I have to be honest, as I've been going writing this out I've found it very strange that the number of the passages in scripture are nearly identical.   The one talking about "deceived the whole world through the miracles he performed" is in Revelation 13, while the warning against it is in Deuteronomy 13.   The mark of the beast being on the right hand or the forehead is in Revelation 13:16, while the mark of the LORD being on the hand or frontlets between the eyes is in Deuteronomy 13:16.   Come on...what is that about?  So, what does YHWH command to be on our hands and inbetween our eyes?  4“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one.b 5You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. 6And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. 7You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. 8You shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. 9You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.  The same thing called the first and greatest commandment by the Messiah:  36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?” 37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment.   The commandments are what is to be a mark on our hands and on our foreheads. Hands meaning our actions, our deeds, how we live our life. Forehead meaning our thoughts and beliefs. These two work together beautifully in that they show who we truly are.   This comes full circle, and really to my point, as we closely examine the identity of what many call "the antichrist". The first issue is, that I can't find the word antichrist in the book of Revelation. It isn't there. There is a false prophet, a beast, another beast, and the image of the beast. But I don't see an anti-christ. Not in the book of Revelation.  I do see, in the other writings of John (author of Revelation) there are many antichrists:  Little children, it is the last hour; and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.  Who is a liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist who denies the Father and the Son.   and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.  For many deceivers have gone out into the world who do not confess Jesus Christ as coming in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.  I believe who many call the "anti-christ" is the image of the beast, or what Paul calls the "man of lawlessness" or "man of sin" in some translations:  Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers,[a] 2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.   3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness[b] is revealed, the son of destruction,[c] 4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. 5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?   6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. 7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. 8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming. 9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders, 10 and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.   11 Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, 12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  Here is the pattern that I see:  The mark of the Father is to keep his commandments. His faithful will be sealed with his name and the name of the Lamb on their foreheads. The spirit of the antichrist has been at work for thousands of years. Anyone that denies that Yahusha came in the flesh is embodying the antichrist spirit. (Watch for them in this thread).   The "man of lawlessness" is set to be revealed. As the mark of the Father is keeping his commandments, it only makes sense that the antithesis of this is lawlessness (which is sin, 1 John 3:4-7). The problem is, we have texbooks, universities, pastors and churches around the world declaring that we are "free from the law" and do not need to "keep the mosaic commandments" because "Jesus" died to free us from the law. If you are a student of the bible, you will no doubt want to quote Paul to defend this belief, however I want to urge you to pump your breaks. I have studied Paul exhaustively and can go back and forth with you on every single verse that you think approves this belief. They are false. From Acts 15 up and through Galatians. Just ask and I will show you. We have a lot of preconceived ideas based off of manmade doctrines (dispensationism, replacement theology, etc.). Surely, we have inherited nothing but lies from our fathers.  This is the GRAND DELUSION that the Father has given the world up to. The deception used by the beast over the years to cause people to worship him.  11 Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false, 12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.  The image of the beast? A false King, a lawless Jesus who encourages and enables you to break the Law of his Father. His mark? "Jesus", a name that comes from Babylonian sun worship, in a false religious system covered in pagan idolatry. Saturnalia (Christmas) Ishatar (Easter) "Sun"day worship instead of the true Sabbath, Lawless living instead of humble obedience to the commandments.   Am I saying not to follow "Jesus" or say that name? No...sort of. I am saying we should do our best to come away from anything that is a lie.  Was his name Jesus? No. Then find the closest one to the Truth that you can. Was he born on Dec 25th? Of course not. Did he die so you can live free from the Law? "God forbid".   He died so that Israel could be redeemed and re-gathered from the nations, and that all the world could be saved. He died that we might have forgiveness of sins, and that he might publically shame the powers of the wicked one. He died that WE might have power over sin and death and that we would walk in newness of life, transformed into HIS image until he returns to rule over the nations in righteousness.  What does this mean for you? That repentance MUST include following the footsteps of the Messiah and the faithful examples in scripture. Like King David, the man after God's own heart. Read the passage below and tell me, does this sound like the Law is a burden like we've been told? Like the commandments are impossible to keep and we have to saved from them?   Psalm 119  https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20119&version=KJV   TLDR:  Read it.

They say that you have have “spotting” but it will not resemble a period or come in cycles.  Yet there are hundreds of anecdotal reports of women who had bleeding resembled a period—identical in some cases—while they were pregnant.  Some even had this happen for many months into the pregnancy.  There have also been women who have negative pregnancy tests despite being pregnant.  You can even research documented “cryptic” pregnancies where women experienced minimal, to none—signs of pregnancy.  Even women who remained thin, no visible bump and flat stomach.  These are documented pregnancies where women delivered healthy babies that they did not know about.

8ajcj7q0	First off - I can see as we all can that at least to some degree the U.S. is on decline. But allow me to explain my question.  Biden and military leadership claimed that they handled the Afghan exit as well as possible. That they were not able to go and extract the Americans who could not reach the airport. This was a blatant lie - and volunteer groups of U.S. vets did go and extract Americans with no Gov. support. It could have been done.  Now, they are telling Americans to evacuate Ukraine and that if they don’t, and hostilities commence, they will not be able to help. Another bold faced lie. America may be deeply flawed and on a degree of decline - but as of now we are more than capable of extracting our people from hot zones at the very very least.   So, why this weak charade?

138nyz	I'm sure you're aware of the situation with Ukraine and Russia which let's say worst case scenario Russia invades, it'll start off with US sending money and eventually troops if it doesn't work out. [Japan](https://mobile.twitter.com/EndGameWW3/status/1485383222506803202?t=UXQX67B9p0eIOzGyDA-47A&s=19) is promising involvement and [Venezuela](https://www.google.com/amp/s/tass.com/politics/1391927/amp) has a chance to get involved. The UK will get involved if I'm not mistaken. I could be wrong on this, but I think Russia does have some support in Eastern Europe from other countries aswell. I'm sure everyone is aware that China has been causing issues in the South China sea and is looking for a reunification with Taiwan. Relations with North Korea and the United States are sinking, and while I haven't heard much, but obviously there's a chance Iran could attack Israel. Germany is also trying to block the UK from delivering shipments to Ukraine. We've seen tensions rise before and things that seem "scary", but so much shit is building up in such a short time.

esrhisre	Im thinking it has to do with radiogenetics which I made a post on and got immediately shadow banned by reddit because they must know im onto something and its spooking them. See the vaccines contain metal oxides which other smart people figured out and radiogenetics is a technique from 2014 to manipulate instructions in cells to make them produce proteins to basically do anything. They could just be making people extra violent and nasty to create disorder and it so just so happens the famous motto of the freemasons is order out of chaos and they follow duality. event 201 = turning two into one = chaos from many sides turned into a single order a new world order. All this may be obvious to some but many people are too asleep to see the symbolism everywhere. The end goal seems to be using the plandemic as a pretext for control and the best way to do that is to manufacture disorder which they proven they can do by making rats aggressive when testing the radiogenetics stuff just look into rockefeller universities work on it. The conspiracies basically been cracked wide open by others but im simply building on the true purpose of the vaccines. Remember the freemasons and secret societys work off a duality principle so its a trojan horse vaccine the vaccine is biologically active and creates antibodies as proven with blood serum tests but it also has a backdoor which are the metal oxides allowing them to stimulate emotions and mood. The cias done things like this before using micro waves but radiogenetics seems like an easier way for the government to accomplish emotional manipulation of its subjects. They don’t want to kill you as the main goal its a red herring and thats simply collateral damage the real thing they want to do is manipulate your emotions and how you process rational thinking. Thats where 5G combined with the vaccines come in. The ground work has been layed down just remember back when covid was infiltrating wuhan they turned on all 5G arrays around the same time and then a bit after that started rolling out vaccines all intended and by design.	1642999997.0	sbdq9u	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbdq9u/anyone_notice_vaccinated_people_are_more_violent/	Anyone notice vaccinated people are more violent then normal?

13imqe	This is all happening to ease the transition of humanity into a new economic system and supposedly limit the possibility of a full economic collapse.  The COVID pandemic is a tool. The end goal is as I already stated. It’s a new economic system built around surveillance capitalism. This is all public knowledge. Read up on the 4th industrial revolution, build back better and visit the World Economic Forums website and read about the Great Reset.   Remember in 2008 when the housing market collapsed? Well since 2008 we have only added to the same problem that got us their which is that we are blowing an enormous bubble and creating a society wide Ponzi scheme.   AI and technology are displacing workers and jobs as a means to feed ourselves are disappearing. Right now is the beat job you can get is as a cashier or bagger at a grocery store, what happens when Amazons fully automated stores open? Retail, fast food, call center, healthcare, trucking, all set to be automated will create mass unemployment and covid is conditioning the public to believe a virus is the true cause of workforce disruption.   That is exactly what Andrew Yang based his campaign on for president. All the stuff he warned people about pre-pandemic is now happening. The power structure blocked him from exposing what he and they knew was true. The difference was he was being transparent. They had other plans.  The problems he was exposing were very real and are now EXACTLY what are being blamed on covid. Covid is a scapegoat.   Let’s start with the repo market crisis of Sept 2019 + Executive Order 13887 which paved the way for the vaccines we are all excited about today and obscured a global financial collapse to pass unprecedented stimulus without controversy.   Here's a weird coincidence for you to look at.  In **September of 2019**, Federal Reserve began **intervention in the repo markets.** "Repo" in this context refers to repurchase agreements between banks. Mainstream news said intervention is normal, that it's like putting oil in your car. Really? Do you recall 2008? It was the financial panic that stemmed from a run on the repurchase or "repo" market— the primary source of funds for the securitized banking system.  There was nothing normal about what happened in September of 2019. It started as a one time operation. Then, the next day. Then it was 3 days. Then a week. Then two weeks. Then three weeks. Then a month. Then two months. Then three months. Then through the end of the year. Then well into 2020 --- the Fed's intervention wasn't stabilizing the market effectively.  What happened in September of 2019 was a REALLY BIG DEAL. Covid-19 was a perfect opportunity for a power grab that would prove useful against Occupy-like protests, and the fear of a dangerous virus would allow the systemic bailouts to go through without controversy.  Covid-19 was the most potent distraction of our entire lives and continues to be.   You may remember the outrage when 700 billion went to bail out the too-big-to-fails in the 2008 era? 700 billion is a drop in the bucket compared to the combined Covid-19 stimulus packages.  Did you ever do the math and notice that the checks to individuals adds up to be a small fraction of the total stimulus packages?  Here's an explanation of the specifics on how a global financial crisis sparked the beginning of what we know as the response to Covid-19:  [**https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/22/the-old-lady-who-swallowed-a-fly**](https://off-guardian.org/2021/01/22/the-old-lady-who-swallowed-a-fly)  So now that you understand how trouble in the repo market is a sure signal of a bigger problem, let's go back to this quote:  “You may recall that from 17 September 2019, the United States Federal Reserve injected massive amounts of liquidity into banks due to a quite abnormal situation on the repo market.”   The date: **September 17, 2019.**  And here's where we get to another interesting coincidence:  **Donald Trumps "Modernizing Influenza Vaccines in the United States to Promote National Security and Public Health" -- Executive Order 13887**  I’ve been trying to tell this story to people I know since Feb of 2020 but am always met with blank silence.   The esoteric world of global finance is too boring to most people so they just sort of glaze over, even my doctor friends who are supposedly smarter than most.    I’ve given up and will just concentrate on protecting my own resources. In some ways I can’t blame TPTB for using something this extreme to refinance the financial system.   Could you imagine the public’s response if they just came out and said “oh yah we have to create 7 trillion dollars and give it to banks, hedge funds and corporations or the interest rate of the world reserve currency  is going to hit 10% tomorrow.”   Just about everyone I know would be bankrupt if their mortgages reset at anything near that. Every asset in the world would be repriced to reflect the new borrowing rate. It would be catastrophic. There is a convergence of agendas at work obviously other than the purely monetary, which can be found on the World Economic Forums website under The Great Reset but the repo rate spike was central and perhaps set the schedule earlier than intended. It may be the reason everything seems a bit rushed and uncoordinated.    In 2019 the repo markets collapsed the average person has no clue what’s this means. The FED needed another bailout for the economy. They printed 10 trillion dollars and called it stimulus.   That was when they went on tv and told people that because of COVID we need to cut people $1000 checks, print trillions to save the airlines and cruise ships, bail out the stock market, all the while creating more division through typical political theatre pretending like Democrats and Republicans couldn’t agree on signing the bill. No.           The reality is the money was needed to prevent a collapse and had nothing to do with COVID. This problem was inevitable. Covid is just so people can blame inflation, loss of jobs, supply chain issues, etc. on covid instead of on the fact that the system was already failing.   That is why crypto, nfts, digital assets and meta verse are happening now because they are conditioning people for the new economic system which will be based on that new technology.  The vaccines lead to the vaccine passports which lead to a digital identity on the new web3 platform which will store your health, financial and social credit score which will be used to track, monitor and control every aspect of our lives and make us dependent on the government once they implement UBI a universal income since they destroyed all the jobs and financial freedom by design.	1643000506.0	sbdw7o	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbdw7o/tell_me_im_wrong_i_know_all/	Tell me I’m wrong.

7tw5j7e1	I have a very strong feeling that gun confiscation will happen soon and I feel the need to warn my fellow Christians not to be a hero. This is only in the event where owning firearms is already outlawed and the police/military are going around confiscating them, when that happens please turn in your guns and do not try to fight back. Doing so will only hurt you in the long run, don't do something you're going to regret on the day of Judgement.  You will not be taking your guns to heaven so dying for them is not wise. If you try to fight back to defend your guns you will die, you will not win against a group of armed police or military. If you die by pointing a gun at the police coming to take them you are essentially committing suicide by cop, you are trying to fight a battle you have zero chance of winning. Assuming you purchased your guns legally, they'll know all the guns you own. Hiding them won't do you any good since they can train dogs to sniff for gunpowder, plus assuming you purchased your guns legally they'll have that list and demand every single one.  If on the day you answer the door and the police are there demanding your weapons and you answer it empty-handed then you already lost. The police are not going to just stand there and wait for you to go to your room and take a gun to bring back and point at them, at this point the Constitution doesn't matter and they will most likely follow you inside no warrant needed.  So rather than die from suicide by cop, turn in your guns and follow the law of the land. Do not worry, God will repay, there's no need to take vengeance into your own hands. Your home is the Kingdom of God not the United States of America, stay alive because God can't use you if you're dead.	1643001318.0	sbe58m	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbe58m/a_message_to_all_christians_who_own_a_firearm/	A message to all Christians who own a firearm

177l2ln0	I say a human understanding because that's as much as I am hoping to accomplish right now. Even though I'm a firm believer in the paranormal I know all the ghosts, goblins, and demons in this matter are just distractions. All that matters is what is the POINT of all of this. Because we have to know what these evil beings are trying to accomplish before we can throw a monkey wrench in their plans, and save what's left of the human race.  And after reading some books on the subject, some scholarly articles and just thinking about my own experiences with satanic ritual abuse and MK Ultra, I realize what these folks have been saying all along is true.   One of the first books I read on the subject claimed that MK Ultra and the perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse were trying to bring the "Satan to earth."  HOW? I believe in the paranormal but I need a bit of help conceptualizing something like that. How is molesting children and killing innocent people all over the world going to bring satan here?   But I realize if you are looking at this from a spiritual/paranormal point of view the picture is too hard to see. From a psycho-social point of view, a picture starts to form.  Then I read this article the other day and it solidified the idea for me:  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/88qmtnc6mkd81.jpg?width=1992&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ac974da56201baaca8106fb1625046e9a14bb8  ### [Ritual Abuse, Multiplicity, and Mind-Control](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/doc/8mrrsW5gU9)  [Gould, Catherine](https://www.deepdyve.com/search?author=Gould%2C+Catherine); [Cozolino, Louis](https://www.deepdyve.com/search?author=Cozolino%2C+Louis)**1992** Journal of Psychology and Theology    &#x200B;  This reminded me of another scholarly paper I read on the subject where the author said that the goal of satanic ritual abuse was to make the victim start to adopt a *"satanic world view."*  They are trying to get everyone in a place of hopelessness, lovelessness, victimization, anger, hate, and any other deep, negative emotion:  &#x200B;  [screen copy](https://preview.redd.it/4jrdowdlmkd81.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d7211601a45d81fa2a80160521854c6557bd154)   [Ritual Abuse - SRA FROM A MIND MAP PERSPECTIVE (psychologicalhealingcenter.com)](https://psychologicalhealingcenter.com/satanic-ritual-abuse/)   &#x200B;  In America, we have a concept called "The Sunken Place" made popular by the horror movie "Get Out."   Though this horror movie's main focus was a cheeky jab at racial discord in America it told NO lie. Many of the victims of Satanic Ritual abuse/MK Ultra are people of African, Native American, and darker Asiatic descent.   But the sunken place is a real place psychological any anyone of any race can end up there:  https://preview.redd.it/l0wefuz3nkd81.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=71fe7dfa02394446e7bdf69cc4e4b1d44e66831d  Many Victims of SRA are in danger of ending up in "The Sunken Place" and that is a terrifying place to be.   Satan has great power there.  God showed me this in a dream I had the other day. I was conscious that I was in a dream world and I had maximum power in this dream world. I could make anything happen as I wanted it to.   But Satan was there toying with me. He kidnapped my pet and in my anger, I felt like I was losing control.   The angrier I got the more of my power I was giving to Satan.  Because these beings, Satan and his minions, do in fact feed on our negative emotions. I know, controlling negative emotions is easier said than done. And this is a tall order to ask of people who have been ritually gang-raped as children, nearly executed in snuff films, been forced to watch and endure some of the most horrible things imaginable.  It's a tall order indeed, but seeing the big picture helps. And the big picture is that they want everyone in the sunken place because the sunken place is a trap that will lead to hell.   And if you look around the world you can see that the Satanic Ritual abuse has gone public. Everyone is being encouraged to hate everyone for all kinds of ridiculous reasons.  Parents versus Children, men versus women, gay versus straight, religious versus atheist.   We are even taught to hate each other over whether we eat meat or not or whether we took a vaccine.  So yeah, my point is to try to keep love in your heart, to forgive as much as possible. Keep Christ in your heart and submit to God like a child to their father.  Avoid reading and watching things that put negative emotions like fear in you. I had to learn this too as reading up on MK Ultra and SRA I had to read some very, very horrible descriptions to the point I sometimes suspect some of these books are themselves being used to ritually abuse people. Just by reading some of this stuff, you can be traumatized and the world looks so much darker and Bleeker to you.   Don't lose hope. If you find yourself falling into the sunken place, "Get Out." Think positive thoughts. Switch whatever negative is going on in your mind to something positive.  I had to train myself to walk away from this stuff and I still fall for it from time to time. Satan still eggs me on in my dreams... but I'm learning. Every encounter I learn, terrifying though they may be, I learn.   Last but not least I'd like to talk to you about something I learned about ancient Chinese Exorcism techniques.  The Chinese used martial arts actors, poets, musicians, courtesans, and comedians as both demon summoners and exorcists. All these trades can inspire positive emotions or negative emotions in people.  Just like how they use these same trades to push satanic philosophies in their music, movies, pornography, and even in their comedies, the reverse can also work. Actors can be used to present beautiful stories about love, forgiveness, and overcoming hatred. Women (not necessarily courtesans) can inspire positive feelings of protectiveness and adoration in men.  And comedians, arguably some of the best demon hunters, can make people laugh and chase the blues away! Laughter truly is the best medicine and satan has little control over a happy heart.  Just saying. Spread good vibes. Use positive alchemy and turn the darkness into light to the best of your ability. And ask God to give you the strength and knowledge to go beyond your ability to spread light to bring in the kingdom of heaven instead of satans kingdom of hell, which is what the satanic ritual abuse was aiming to do!	1643002236.0	sbef66	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbef66/a_human_understanding_of_mk_ultra_and_satanic/	A (Human) understanding of MK Ultra and Satanic Ritual Abuse and its objectives...

The worse case scenario is that we can at least say we tried and empower others to do the same.   To think when I first shared the go fund me link, it was at 500000, and now it's almost at 3000000. If this goes according to plan, it will live the spirits of the people.   Now, the only thing I'm concerned about  is that we might be playing right into their hands. The supply chains will, definitely, take a hit, but they were going to take a hit if the truckers protested or not, and I get concerned that if we get too big for our bridges, they will release something that will all scare us back into submission.	1643003047.0	sbenx8	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbenx8/everyone_should_be_spamming_joe_rogan_and_any/	Everyone should be spamming Joe Rogan and any other influencer they can think of so that we can get the message out loud and clear about this trucker protest that's gaining momentum..

7q0y6bw5	No? Well I have. From multiple friends.  So near the end of November 2021 one of my friends came to me preaching that I should withdraw all my money from my account and stack up on long lasting food supplies and water...oh, and toilet paper. Because in January 2022 there would be a world wide power outage for at least 2 weeks! (queue dramatic music)  Some other friends "confirmed" that this was going to happen, because they read it somewhere online. Although they couldn't point me to the source at that moment. And I've spent a good 30 minutes together with them looking through various media sources online to find any articles about this outage.  Did I mention these friends are also anti-vax? I didn't? Well, now I do.  I kept my money in the bank, didn't stack up on any supplies and went on my marry way.  It's now January 24th, and with 7 days left this month I have not seen any signs of a 2 week power outage. So if this thing is going to happen it better be happening today.  Anyway, there's been some discord amongst my friends about this thing.  Have you read about this thing? Found any reliable sources going in depth on this matter? And should I confront my friends telling them how wrong they were once we are halfway through February and there has still been no outage?

He told me that he truly does hope that the unvaccinated can die so we can get past this pandemic. It opened my eyes quite a bit. And honestly makes me scared of how divided this country has been.

7u2ssch8	What if the mandala effect wasn’t like people have theorized, where different dimensions are colliding or that we are slowly being distorted by a black hole or that the CERN project caused an abnormality? Instead it was the effect of our collective consciousness growing and raising our ability to to comprehend more complex things. We have to “empty our trash” like a pc to clear up space, to be more productive. So the information wasn’t actually gone, it was just compressed and split up like it would be on a hard drive. Over time the older files just seem more and more distant and unauthentic because we don’t have backups, so if a file corrupts there’s no way to fix it. Assuming that this isn’t simulated then there wouldn’t be a direct ratio of corruption to progression so it could be faster or slower at any time. The extremes would be either reaching some dystopian level of existence and unity where time is no longer linear and we can experience everything at once, or crashing and corrupting whatever main components drive us.  Essentially losing our memories and becoming a void, a misnomer in our own manifestation. The components of our consciousness aren’t proven but a common belief is a trinity exists between the mind, body, and spirit. We know that we have a mind because we hear it when we generate thought and we are obviously conscious. We know we have a body that is tangible because we feel and touch. But people have fought over the course of our existence to prove what our soul is. For example, we could be higher dimensional beings experiencing the three dimensional realm or we could be ignited as a species by means of an extraterrestrial. Some popular views on the ladder would be that there is a god that created us or that there were aliens that intervened with the natural evolution on Earth. Whatever happened caused a definite spark and a machine was created but not a programmed simulation. We would be a part of a bigger machine that would need a sustainable power source, an exhaust, and connections. We established that our initial spark happened regardless of how it happened, it made us different. The sun is our battery and sustains power, the exhaust seems most probable to be a black hole. Our memories are files and our consciousness is the hard drive, while our willpower as a whole acts as ram. As we upgrade parts of the machine, like our consciousness, we need to upgrade the other parts or else we will have failures in the system and further corrupted files. By destroying our housing (Earth) we are inevitably going to cause stress that will wreak havoc on our system. We see these effects all the time. A scientific breakthrough of understanding our universe wouldn’t be a game changer and niether would a new planet. A simple but effective analogy is the consideration of how many people get injured by taking short cuts with complex equipment. However, this equipment is incomprehensibly complex and so is the risk. Both of those paths are essentially an update to the driver of one component or a new component, while the rest is ignored. Once again the effects of our imbalance have already begun to show. Our housing is damaged, our battery sparks, our connections aren’t grounded, and our ram is being taken up by pop ups (media/conflict) that are distracting so what can we control? -Our battery? Maybe, but we aren’t hurting on power yet and solar flares have been recorded for a long time. -Our housing? Absolutely, but the current goal seems to be that we should look for an older model that we can refurbish instead of repairing what we have. -Our exhaust? Hasn’t seemed to be a problem yet or it isn’t within our understanding but if we increase power it’s likely that we must increase exhaust. After all matter cannot be destroyed. -Our connections and ram (willpower)? I like to think we are increasing that everyday but obviously there is a divide. Which is good, if we took on a firmware update that was too advanced it would brick our system so thank someone you deem a sheep because of your superiority complex.  Using this perspective as a basis would prioritize fixing the parts we currently have a grasp on, so we can continue to grow and ultimately tackle the parts that we don’t understand as our consciousness increases.   I could be way off but optimization is the running theme in anything that moves -pun intended-  But I’m just some dude with adhd and a headache that was spacing off on my couch listening to my son play fortnight in the background. So don’t consider this perspective for me, do it for the Berenstein Bears.	1643006758.0	sbfqvk	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbfqvk/mandala_effect/	Mandala effect

fs7jml7k	So my dad told me the otherday over the phone this little story  For reference everyone on my dads side of the family (excluding my dad) had their shots. They all got sick soon after and were sick for awhile.  Dad got sick for like 1 or 2 days and was over it.  One of my uncles had a heart problem and went to the hospital. He was released a couple weeks later.   Now the story my dad told me was he noticed that it was quiet around the area and saw one of his nephews dressed up nicely.  Asked him what was up, nephew seemed nervous and said something about an appointment or something. Did didnt think much if it and said see ya, later finds out all the family had a party for uncle who was back from hospital, and dad was not invited or told.   Sickens me to see this happening, what this insanity is bringing. So dad is now figuring out who made it the thing not to invite him and he is gonna cut that oerson out if their life.   The sad thing is they think my dad is the one who is dangerous for not being V and yet they dont put two and two together that they get the shots and get violently sick afterwards and that is the problem.   Im already essentially dead to them because i am very different to them and i dont care.

aebajdhz	I don’t drink soda. Ever. But I used to be an avid coca cola drinker. I can very easily tell the difference between coke and pepsi, between coke and diet coke etc.   I got delivery from a restaurant, included with the delivery was a soda and I chose coke because I had friends over and they wanted more soda to mix.   I cracked open the can and poured a tiny bit in a glass for everyone and we all drank a shot and used our coke as a chaser. We all immediately looked at each other and started laughing because the flavour was clearly off from a normal coke.   I looked at the can in the kitchen (because my friends were certain it was diet) and when I grabbed it I noticed it wasn’t a normal can — it says “Coca Cola Original Taste” on it and below says “Delicious and Refreshing”  Now we all know that back in the day coke used the coca cola original as a marketing gimmick but I can’t figure this one out. They are selling something as “Original Taste” that is CLEARLY not the original coke recipe.   PS: friend ran out to his car where he had an unopened plastic bottle of coke from a gas station and we taste tested it and it tasted VASTLY different than what our “Original Taste” coke tasted like.	1643008394.0	sbg6yz	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbg6yz/this_is_a_weird_conspiracy_but_there_is_cocacola/	This is a weird conspiracy, but — there is “Coca-Cola Original Taste” being sold in Canada (only country I know thus far) and it doesn’t taste like a normal can of coke

These 2 business men gave the locksmiths client a warning about something massive happening on May 12 2025, this was passed on to the locksmith and then my dad, the warning is that everyone who wants to live should get at least 400 kilometers away from any major city on that date, all I know is that this event will be apocalyptic, please heed this warning	1643010781.0	sbgti5	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbgti5/may_12_2025/	May 12 2025

Whether or not we are correct in our decision making. i fear people are unrelenting in their need of these institutions.. and how willing people can be to sellout others for their own benefit. and its just a bad recipe all around. i dont think im just getting a little squirrely...i really dont see a "winner" in this ... am i alone in this type of thinking or what?	1643012145.0	sbh6di	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbh6di/feeling_outnumbered/	feeling outnumbered.

8wwg9	I've heard so many times that the humanity needs a common enemy in order to unite, forget about the individual differences and fight back.  The virus is the perfect example of a common enemy, but what we are seeing right now is the opposite of unification. The society seems to be as fragmented as ever.  I bet if aliens from outer space decided to attack us one day there still would be arguing between people and splitting into groups.   If I was a member of the elites trying to protect my power the first thing I would to is to sow hatred and division using social media, because if you see your neighbor as your enemy I have nothing to worry about.   So, my theory is that everything you see right now is a part of a plan to pit neighbors against each other. The elites don't have any complicated plans to control us. They are too disagreeable and neurotic to act like effectively together. They are like us, but with lots of money from their parents.	1643012734.0	sbhbpw	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbhbpw/we_need_a_common_enemy_is_bs/	"We need a common enemy" is BS
5g69h6kd	When I hear some of y'all talk, I am filled with so much hope, so much pride, only for you to immediately crush it at the last moment.   "The government is corrupt." Yes. "There are secret sectors of it that we don't know about." Yes! "They commit assassinations and other horrible acts to mislead and control the people." Holy shit yes! Red hot, right on the money! "Because they're secretly a cult of pedophile satanists!!!"  :(  This isn't meant to be some mean-spirited callout or anything, because this sub has some genuine substance to it. It just confuses me seeing people doing the RIGHT things (protesting against the government, disrupting the peace, etc) for such bonkers reasons. It feels like a lot of conspiracy theorists never grew out of McCarthyanism or the Satanic Panic. Even worse, a lot of them sound like they're throwing their lives away because their theory excites them, like they're taking part in some glorious adventure. Qanon believers and people like them act like they're heroes for cracking this huge case and fighting the evil demon worshipping new world order.   I've seen posts in this very subreddit where people talk about losing their entire families and all their friends, where they go "They just couldn't see the truth no matter how hard I tried to show them, but that's okay because now I only talk to likeminded people!" Do they not see how unhealthy and odd that is? Again, I'm not trying to call everyone here some tinfoil hat wearing nutjob, because I know our government is corrupt, anybody with half a brain can see that. I also know that we SHOULD be rioting and demolishing the tainted systems that control us. But I don't think it's healthy for people to do that because they find it "fun" or want to be some righteous warrior against evil. I don't know man, those are just my thoughts on this community. Not trying to call anyone out or whatever, but it's sad seeing such genuine stuff get muddled by crazy cartoon villain shit.	1643012760.0	sbhby3	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbhby3/conspiracy_theorists_including_many_in_this_sub/	Conspiracy Theorists (Including many in this sub) absolutely baffle me.

I just left Uganda but I noticed when I was entering through the border from Kenya into Uganda that the Uganda police were saying "Here is man who can give you change for your currency into USD".  And the man had a big roll of fake $100 bils".  They were realistic looking too.  But myself and my guide noticed the bell on the new $100 real bills looked different than the bell on the professionally counterfeit currency the Uganda police and the man were giving to people via currency exchange service.  The new $100 Billls from America had a Bell chip thing introduced into it so it can't be counterfeited and this was because North Korean government had a factory for manufacturing real identical clones of the $100 bills and taking vacations to Europe and other countries with the North Korean manufactured money.	1643015134.0	sbhx2u	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbhx2u/uganda_has_become_north_korea_and_is/	Uganda has become North Korea and is manufacturing $100 Bill clones

Is our decsion more based on that fact that we are not agreeable people? And we can mentally withstand rejection and ostracism? How many times in past that we experienced going the opposite direction where most people are going?   Im not saying that pro vaxxed are sheeps, npcs etc. but this society is designed to be advantageous to agreeable people just like extroversion. The world is much easier, predictable and rewarding for them than for us. Just like job interviews.   I noticed this with Jordan Peterson. We know him as very deep, intelligent and inquisitive but he took the jab without any fuzz . Now he "regrets" it because he thought that the govt will leave him alone after that. He also admits in that past that hes an aggreable person.   I starting to wonder that this mandates are some sort of a test of who we really are.

6wpeb	Hi guys Hope you are well. Before I tell my story. I want to say - I ran a sporting business for the last 8 years and actively participated in competitive soccer for the last 20 years. I’ve never had ANY issues with my heart or respiratory system prior to the vaccine mandate in Queensland Australia 🇦🇺   On the 10th of January I received my 2nd shot of Moderna. I originally felt no side effects and was able to enjoy my life as usual until 5 days later.  The heart palpations began along with the constant stinging sensation from the left side of chest. I persisted on working and enjoying my social life whilst looking more into possible side effects. I knew I fell into the category of Pericarditis due to being a young fit male, so I began to take my own anti inflammatories whilst desperately trying to book into a GP (all were booked out on the coast due to covid staff shortages)  It was on the 19th of January I managed to finally secure a booking with a GP it was between the 15th & 19th my symptoms worsened. I began having a tingling sensation in my legs similar to RLS. I was reduced to constant diarrhoea along with hot cold sweats,  felt like my throat was closing over. And began having breathing issues (constant shortness of breath, along with stinging sensations in my ribs)  After having an ECG at the GP nothing was found and I was asked about stress in my life and this heart pain was probably attributed to anxiety and other factors.  I was told to book an echo gram to be safe and to take ibuprofen to help reduce any possible inflammation. I was fobbed off.  Fast forward to today the 24th. My symptoms have worsened. I haven’t slept properly in a week over fear I won’t wake up. My breathing has become so bad I can barely walk up a flight of stairs before clutching at my chest. I don’t sleep more than 4-5 hours a night currently and stopped socialising and partaking in any physical activity out of fear.   I administered myself into hospital this morning.  After my ECG today they FOUND pericarditis immediately and I was sent for extra x rays and ultrasounds. I am now booked in again for regular heart scans that over the next week will determine the severity of the damage.  The financial strain this has put me under is immense, as I am self employed and have been told I am not eligible for any of the vaccine adverse reaction schemes.  This is my story so far Overall the hospital staff were great. But the general practice whom also administered my vax seemed not concerned at all with my symptoms and or complaints.  I never wanted to get vaccinated simply because I never felt I was in that risk category. Now after being pushed to by my head office I feel very alienated. After contacting them with my issues today I was met with “we are all struggling” It’s been quite an upsetting experience	1643026704.0	sbkxzq	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbkxzq/my_experience_with_moderna/	My experience with Moderna.

I can’t help but think the blame for this lies on the shoulders of each party’s leadership.  Of course, considering the leadership is the rich I don’t see a scenario in which they change gears and stop trying to divide us.    We’re living in a failed state because of greed.	1643027002.0	sbl192	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbl192/the_left_thinks_democracy_is_dying_because_of_the/	The left thinks democracy is dying because of the attempted insurrection, the right thinks democracy is under threat because of mandates and government overreach into our lives.

14dg2k	The past 2 weeks have not been the best, but weren't terrible either. My wife and 3 kids all got Corona, and half of them tested positive for the Flu.  I did not get sick despite sleeping next to my sick wife and caring for everyone.  A few things of note. My kids tested positive for the flu first, and then a few days later for Corona. When they tested positive for the Flu and negative for Corona, we were told they had COVID and they were treating everyone who had tested positive for flu as Corona patients.  My kids were all sick for exactly... 1 day. 1 day of vomiting each, then a day of being slightly tired, then a week of trying to get them to hold still as they felt better and didn't understand why I wouldn't let them go outside and play with their friends. They are back at school now... if they had the flu I wouldn't want them spreading it anyways.  My wife and kids are all vaxxed.  I'm vaxed and boosted (required to keep my job... long story but I work supporting the government).  I work out and take vitamins (including the vitamin D people here recommend) and did not get sick at all. I still eat like garbage though.  With that said... I don't know that anyone in my house having any vaccine did anything for anyone.   I will also say that no one should be forced to take a vaccine or have pressure put on them to take one to keep their job.  Just some more random internet anecdotal evidence from an internet stranger.	1643028527.0	sblhe3	/r/conspiracy/comments/sblhe3/im_the_only_one_in_my_family_that_didnt_get/	I'm the only one in my family that didn't get Corona, or the Flu, or Flurona.

5ota85vc	 There is a venue I’ve gone to in the past before Covid who has a policy that anyone unvaccinated has to provide proof of a negative Covid test before entry within 48 hours. It would be great if this actually worked but I caught them setting a few extra rules that make it impossible for the unvaccinated to enter.   Here is what their policy basically says  1. All test results have to have time and date stamped when test was taken   2. Must be within 48 hours   Here is the conspiracy   In Vermont where I am located the test results don’t list a time of test taken at all. I reached out to Vermont department of health who sends the results and was told the times are never stamped on them   All tests in Vermont can’t be taken after 6pm and the concerts at the venue are either at 7 or 8 so even if I had a time stamp I would be past 48 hours.

jayzu	As my n=1, I lost more than 40 pounds in a matter of months and I am still sane. No exhausting cardio, no crash dieting, eating enough food to sleep well at night and not feel hunger.  **Disclaimer : Not a doctor, nor do I have ambiguous research papers to back my points, nor public figures to point you too that ensures that what I will write next is not bullshit. All my knowledge is from reading about human body, understanding how stuff works and trial and error. The amount of food that ive eaten is not up for debate, because everyone is different, I did not count calories, I did not count macros, I did not starved myself, I did no feel hunger, nor nothing close to hunger, I ate and moved on with my day.**   It took me around 30 years of life to figure out that loosing weight was made impossible by our current food industry and getting healthy was not about motivation, nor discipline, nor about eating less ( ofc you can eat at a deficit and lose weight, but you will destroy your sanity in the long run and fail miserably and get back at your weight so read on ) or moving more.  **If you jump right in with diet and exercise you will FAIL or make your life hell at losing weight without getting prerequisite next points in check first :**  1. Your good gut flora is destroyed from all the processed food so start eating **single ingredient foods ONLY ( this is actually the real food you were supposed to eat all along, but we were tricked to buy and eat all that stuff with expiration date longer than my granny's age )**, no processed food and **TAKE probiotics** ( find a brand with at least 8-10 strains ) for **at least 2 months**. Your cravings are in fact driven by the bad gut bacteria that demands unhealthy and ungodly amount of food from you. 2. Hormons , you are a walking mess right now because nothing in you is stable due to years long on and offing with dieting or eating shit food or selfdistructive way of life ( not sleeping enough, drinking coca cola instead of water, alcohol abuse, cigarettes' etc ). Fix : Fasting - from 3 meals a day to 2, from 2 meals a day to 1 till you are 100% certain that your relationship with food is purely from a surviving point of view, get back to 2 meals a day when you feel ready. **At least 1 months** for all markers to stabilize. 3. FIBER, fiber and more fiber! Fiber slows the absorption and will keep point 2. in check. I found that sprinkling psyllium husk on everything that I eat its by far the easiest way to get my fiber up without eating pounds of fruits and greens. And it feeds the good bacteria as well! Win-win! 4. After you passed 1. and 2. : Steady state cardio DAILY : at least 5000-10000 steps a day, this is for your mind, moving is the best thing you can do for your brain, not for weight loss !!! Keep away from stress , SLEEP at least 8 hours, drink water and I promise you everything will just feel like your new way of life and will not come close to feel like a diet.  If anyone wants to debate what Ive written above or feels like its bullshit, I am ready for a debate and if you ask where is the conspiracy? **The conspiracy is : There is no money to be made from healthy people, nor dead people. Our current so called food on the shelfs makes us unhealthy and sick. Its by design.**	1643033855.0	sbn7hq	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbn7hq/after_failing_miserably_over_and_over_to_lose/	After failing miserably over and over to lose weight, I researched how the human body works and found out why you are set to fail from the beginning if you want to get control over your life again and everywhere you look you get bombarded with : you are not motivated enough, eat less, move more BS

a07gv8d6	   The last thing the FED would want to do historically, would be to implode the markets. The difference now is the emergence of the retail investors and newer market participants using Wall Street as a casino.  If they keep inflating, earnings reports will suffer because people will no longer be able to spend. Consumer debt is already at it's highest point EVER. Maybe they just want us to continue burying ourselves in personal debt because it inevitably gives them more power and control.  Cash is about to disappear. The dollar could lose it reserve currency status very soon. Retail banking locations are closing at a historical pace, almost 3000 locations in 2021. They are going to pull the plug.

A lot of these people that are in the hospital with Covid got it while they were or came in with unrelated issues and tested positive. Now those facilities are stuck with these patients they generally would’ve transferred out to other facilities or nursing homes and have to sit on them. The hospitals are usually pretty full during cold and flu season and these mandates just add to it. Nurses and doctors are worn out because the hospital system has been deteriorating for years before Covid, the hospital systems just want to push blame on Covid when in reality they’re at fault for not adequately promoting growth within their facilities.	1643034999.0	sbnlx6	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbnlx6/the_reason_hospitals_are_full_are_because_of/	The reason hospitals are full are because of mandates

elxnmlmx	So the guy across the street from you is a supposed "anti-vaxxer" GASP and that's suppose to leave our mouths wide open in some kind of shocking ominous tone. Since when the actual fuck did anybody even care if I got my vaccines or if I didn't until the scaredemic came up? Since when was being a dreaded "omg anti-vaxxer!" something anyone cared about?, and who cares if somebody hasn't put a drug into THEIR own body that doesn't affect YOU.   You might as well call somebody who doesn't eat spicy food an anti-spice eater because it's THAT trivial when somebody you don't even know doesn't get the next big "vaccine" chugged out by Pfizer. I mean talk about drinking the Kool-Aid, but I'm old enough to remember when literal death cults would force their members to literally drink red poisoned Kool-Aid to "take one for the team" and all those people died.  And anyway, isn't our differences what unites us? Muslims don't eat pork but we don't call them anti-porkers we just fucking respect that and move on. It's called having boundaries and a right to consume whatever the FUCK you want into your own body, alcohol and cigarettes' are legal no matter what the "Scientists" say because people have a right to consume or NOT consume them. I can't wrap my mind around how the same fucking people pedaling "it's my body my fucking choice" are now echoing "what you put in your body affects us as a larger society so you have to be mindful of that and conform".   Well, if you backward leftist C\*ts want it that way make sure you keep that same energy with abortion because it's against the religious beliefs the Western World was founded on and those women should think twice before they "have a negative affect on our society".  Keep the same energy you two faced little sniveling leftist rats.	1643036379.0	sbo32k	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbo32k/rant_who_cares_if_somebody_is_an_antivaxxer/	RANT: Who cares if somebody is an "anti-vaxxer" anyways?

1qnq84	Aside from businsees mandating vaccines and masks do people really care if someone is masked or vaccinated? I've been going out in the state of MA and even though there is mandate signs everywhere a lot of places don't enforce it. The only time I did see it was when I went to Five Guys someone that worked there scolded these folks who walked in without a mask. I don't know if I'm just lucky or fortunate, but I've yet to encounter a stranger that got upset at me for not having a mask. I also haven't had anyone ask about my vaccination status. The only people that give two shots about that are my family and friends ironically enough. I think it's because if someone knows you for a while they are comfortable asking those questions.	1643036608.0	sbo6j7	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbo6j7/is_there_really_that_much_division_over_masks_and/	Is there really that much division over masks and vaccines?

f6slenao	Few months ago me and my friends was having a conversation and i had this crazy idea, hear me out.  Elon Musk is creating Neuralink because he's highly afraid of what the AI could do to us and for him the only solution to be on par with AI is to augment ourselves with a chip to be capable to compete with AI.  Elon Musk is extremely well liked by almost everyone , he is charismatic, and everything he does seems to be for good but what if an AI take over everything and Elon appear with his chip as solution and peace to the world and we need to accept voluntarily to have one, once this happens peace will set in and he will be convincingly the best guy this world ever knew and then all of a sudden he reveals himself as the AntiChrist.  I don't know i got this uneasy vibe when i see his videos and i doubt too much on his good cause, the thing is that he have a great way to convince ppl so there ya go my theory.	1643036878.0	sbo9um	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbo9um/elon_musk_antichrist/	Elon Musk Antichrist

1e8eqw3m	 Something not quite right in this whole invasion scenario. Purely speculation, but think about the following.   Biden sets this up situation by not resisting the Russian pipeline giving Putin a huge advantage and incentive to move into Ukraine, which is rich in oil. As you remember, Joe was the point man for the Ukraine with his son on the board of a Ukrainian Oil Company. The pipelines in the Ukraine are constructed to supply Europe if taken over and would be a huge boon to the Russian Oil industry and Europe would be sucking the tit of Russian oil for the next 50 years. It could also export oil to the US, since Biden plug the Canadian Pipe line making the US dependent of oil imports.   Anybody remember this ? Joe took money from a Russian Lobbyist that deals with Russian Oil.   https://nypost.com/2021/05/29/biden-got-cash-from-russia-lobbyist-before-nord-stream-2-giveaway/   Are Joe and Hunter working with the Russians for a payday?	1643037617.0	sboj3e	/r/conspiracy/comments/sboj3e/putin_russian_oil_and_hunter_biden_russian/	Putin, Russian Oil and Hunter Biden : Russian Invasion Planned to Take Over Ukrainian Oil ?

9tjnf	After some brief “investigating” into a commenter - I’d like to draw attention to the HellsCube sub and to “galactic dragon lord” and “quickly thought of a name”  These are “usernames” but I do not want to tag them.   Quickly Thought commented on a WTC 7 video which made me click. The comment did not seem to match the rest of the profile, which made me read more.   I feel like I have encountered some people using the custom design “art” scene and encoded language to communicate through the HellsCube sub. HellsCube is a digital card game using a deck of cards. And fans sometimes make their own cards.   The use of numbers, and symbols is ubiquitous. Finding a code will be the challenge.   I noticed 1/1 and -1/-1 in a number of places. (The game is a battle game, so everything has the innuendo of war and or weapons/assets)   The cards Whiny First Grader and Whiny Second Grader both stuck out to me.   Also - there seem to be code words sprinkled throughout the posts. Some seem to be honestly about the game, and others not so much. Some of the users of the sub seem to be posting online all day.   Who knows if there is anything illegal going on - which would indicate a conspiracy. Because conspiracy is when multiple people are doing something illegal.   Anyone want to dig in?

5yhznu7x	Just like the UK data has shown, the Death Jabbed are driving hospitalizations and death. A previous substack described how the [UK Government admitted that the vaccines damage the natural immune systems of the double jabbed](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/p/breaking-news-uk-government-admit), and this is being corroborated yet again by Scotland. Not that anyone needs much more proof, and the all cause mortality data, YoY, and global death rates will confirm this Trust the Science Horror Show.  The [report](https://publichealthscotland.scot/media/11223/22-01-19-covid19-winter_publication_report.pdf) from Scotland further establishes that PSYOP-19 “case” rates are highest amongst the double Death Injected. Hospitalizations and deaths are also highest in this mass suicide group. Over the past 4 weeks it was precisely the un”vaccinated” that tested at a rate of 412.77 per 100,000 vs the “vaccinated” at 865.79 per 100,000.  But even with their dirty methodology of not counting the Death Injected as fully “vaccinated” until after 21 days, thus skewing the “cases” to the un”vaccinated”, they still can’t cover up their crimes. And we haven’t even seen full-blown ADE, especially of the “boostered” which as per Israeli data fare even worse than the double jabbed.  This is going to get uglier with each subsequent report.

Data suggests 450,000 reactions and 700 deaths. Make of that what you will though the introductory paragraph is curious;  *"A report of a suspected ADR to the Yellow Card scheme does not* ***necessarily*** *mean that it was caused by the vaccine, only that the reporter has a* ***suspicion*** *if may have."* (emphasis by me). By that logic, there must be reports that have NOT been uploaded to the system as the reporter did not have suspicion...?

2svjonn4	With a lot of recent talk about aliens I was thinking about this. It is very easy to identify large scale corruption in our society (WHO, CDC, Soros, Gates, FBI, Media, the list goes). I’m not a psychologist but at a fundamental level this stems from greed, being power hungry, truly believing they are better than others, the desire to control people, financial power, etc. When these people and organizations have all of this power and money they do whatever they can to keep it.   Who is to say that alien societies wouldn’t have these “bad actors”. Granted it’s literally impossible to understand the mindset of a non-human because we just don’t think the same. Maybe they’re tied in to a higher dimension, a parallel universe or their thought processes are just completely wired differently.   But assuming these societies have their own bad actors, how do we think this would go for us (Earth) if there was a first contact? Looking at our own species, there are way too many examples of pure genocide (the destruction of Native Americans by the first settlers, Armenian genocide, the Holocaust, possibly the vaccines, etc.) and you could argue this was to stay in power. They saw someone different and thought, either they’re a threat to my power, or they’re so different from us and I truly believe I’m superior so they need to be eliminated.   Wouldn’t it go the same way if advanced aliens came to Earth? I know if we found a less advanced alien species we’d likely kill them all, potentially put them into slavery. Would aliens make us slaves for harvesting and labor, or simply eliminate us all. Or would they find the “beauty” in life and strive to do-exist?	1643044325.0	sbr1y6	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbr1y6/who_is_to_say_that_aliens_extraterrestrials/	Who is to say that aliens /extraterrestrials wouldn’t be subject to the same corruption as humans?

gr3apobx	There is no definitive answer as to what algorithm is behind Google Maps. While many have speculated that it must be one of the major navigational algorithms that we know of, anecdotal evidence from across various internet forums brings doubt to the theory of a “shortest path” algorithm. For example:  \- Google Maps does not always show alternate routes and nobody knows why. Some users will diverge from Google’s recommended route to well-known alternate routes that they know are available (despite not being recommended) and will get to their destination much quicker.  \- Some people will make a secondary search in Google Maps after changing their preferences to  “Avoid Tolls” and will be recommended faster routes that don’t require toll fees but were not initially shown to them.  \- Groups of individuals who are together in one location have simultaneously used Google Maps to search for directions and have been recommended different routes to the same destination.  Many people would say that this is simply errors in the algorithm due to the complexity of the information that it relies on.  Another theory is that Google Maps is sending its users on specific routes in order to gather further data. It may be gathering data to improve its navigational algorithm or it may be tracking stops you make along the way in order to gather data about your preferences and thus offer more targeted advertisements in the future.   We also know that Google attempts to control people in subtle ways through principles of behavioral economics. There is a division of Google’s HR department known as “People Analytics” whose end goal is to influence and analyze the behavior of its employees in order to make them more “innovative” (AKA earn more money for Google). For example:  \- They began stocking their fridges with bottled water at eye level and moved sodas to the bottom shelves. They then tracked an increase of 47% in water intake and a decrease of 7% in calories from drinks among their employees.  \- They have implemented a colored tag system in their cafeterias to psychologically signal to their employees which food they should be eating. “Healthy foods” are labeled with green tags and “unhealthy foods” are labeled with red tags.  In 2021 the VP of Product for Google Maps published an article titled “Redefining what a map can be with new information and AI.” This article revealed that in the near future Google Maps would no longer default to the fastest route but would instead default to the “greenest” route. They plan to use data from the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy in order to send users on the routes with the lowest carbon footprint rather than the fastest route to their destination.   This makes you wonder what else they may be implementing in their algorithms in order to influence our decisions and what they are trying to achieve by controlling our behavior.	1643046626.0	sbry1n	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbry1n/nobody_knows_how_the_google_maps_algorithm_really/	Nobody knows how the Google Maps algorithm REALLY works

291p2yta	Last night here I posted the viral thread about how the unvaxxed don't want to see the vaccinated die and I noticed a lot of biting back from people who thought it had to be a joke, because they've personally witnessed the unvaxxed wishing death on the vaccinated.     While I rarely see that kind of post here, it DOES happen, and I want to just say that **we have to be better than that. I understand the desire to be vindicated, but that can never be our priority.** Human lives are at stake here, and while I understand that having hunches that bad things will happen leads to discussing these issues, we have to really try to keep our ego in check so we don't come across as *looking forward* to the potential consequences the vaccine might bring to others. This is NOT going to be fun, and we have to keep our hearts open even when we have the resounding desire to tell others, "I told you so." I'm guilty of this my self at time, so I'm not saying I'm any better than anyone else, but I just think this is really important. We have to stay in a place of love, even when we're frustrated and exhausted. If you need to take a break or just feel like dropping out of the conversation entirely, that's fine. But please, deep down we all know that trash talking anyone who got vaccinated is not helpful for them OR us.     **#So, let me say loud and clear, and I like to think I speak for the majority of the community here, that** **we do not wish any deaths or injuries among vaccinated populace. We in fact speak out about them in an attempt to prevent others from playing Russian Roulette. We sometimes get exhausted and come across too strong in arguments, but we want our fellow man to live and to thrive. We're willing to have open conversations about this, and ultimately we just want to be left to live our lives the way we choose. We offer you the same privilege.**      I will add at the end here to be absolutely transparent that a lot of us certainly do want to see some men and women tried for crimes against humanity, but in these cases, like Dr. Fauci, we have quite a bit of evidence to make a compelling case, so it's a completely different idea than wishing ill will on the unvaccinated, and the two should not be compared. Men who knowingly take action that results in the death of others are murderers and should be tried, **by the law**, accordingly.     Anyway, that's all I have to say.

ilwd8ds	This could be said for a lot of other communities but it seems that the indigenous communities get much less attention for missing cases than others with police often putting the least amount of resources into finding them, could this be because they know they're being taken for something else so they try not to look too hard?  It was also on my mind that is it possible that children are taken from the foster/care system for human experiments by governments or other systems because they know people wouldn't care to look for them?

In the UK you are seeing NHS staff protesting on the news, the actual mention of the office of national statistics reporting only 17371 deaths purely down to covid vs the  157816 we have been shown numerous times over and over again etc etc, just a complete shift compared to the usual bull we are fed.   What does everyone think is happening?   Personally I think we are entering phase 2 of whatever the f is going on (NWO, Great reset vibes) - especially with the whole Russia Ukraine situation at the  moment.	1643049678.0	sbt4qu	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbt4qu/narrative_shift/	Narrative shift?

lhigwby	**Hypothesis/SS**  The Golden State Killer was an at least partially manufactured entity used to expand the government's investigative powers.  **Background**  The [Golden State Killer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_James_DeAngelo) (GSK) was an allegedly prolific serial burglar, rapist, and murderer.  He allegedly committed over 100 burglaries, over 50 rapes, and 13 murders (that we know of).  He committed all of these crimes while evading law enforcement between 1976 and 1986.  He was only caught very recently (within the last few years) when a rape kit was uploaded to a genealogy website.  This was used to construct his family tree and dramatically narrow down the suspect pool.  These suspects were then trailed and their DNA collected.  The DNA was then matched against rape kit.  He then confessed to the crimes.  GSK started with burglaries.  He then escalated to raping single women.  Then, raping women while a man was in the home, leaving them both alive.  In the last stage, he would kill them both.  This is a general overview with a lot of detail omitted.  **The Attacks on Couples Don't Make Sense**  The seeds of my doubt are sewn here.  We are to believe that the killer's MO for attacking couples was per the following procedure:  1. Surveil the target house and its occupants 2. Repeatedly call the victims to learn their schedules (this seems like a shitty way to learn someone's schedule, especially when people had less access to phones), sometimes for months in advance 3. Break into the home while the occupants are gone to learn the layout of the home (wouldn't you notice that your window had been pried open?), remove ammunition from weapons, and plant ligatures for later use 4. At the opportune time (usually in the middle of the night), pry open a sliding glass door or a window 5. Creep into the couple's bedroom and wake them up by shining a flashlight in their face 6. At gunpoint, throw a shoelace or other kind of ligature to the woman.  Instruct her to tie up the man. 7. Ensure the man is firmly tied (with your third and fourth arms, while your other two arms are holding the flashlight and gun...).  Instruct the woman to go get a stack of plates.  Place the plates on the man's back.  GSK advises he will kill them both if he hears the plates move. 8. Take the woman into another room in the home and rape her. 9. Trounce around the house, repeatedly raping the woman, drinking beer in the fridge, stealing personal items, etc. 10. Disappear (usually without announcing it, leaving the abused couple to lie there, tied up, until the wee hours of the morning)  He apparently did this [32 times](http://www.goldenstatekiller.com/).  This sounds totally awful, right?  How scary--it could happen to anyone!  No.  It's bullshit.  This *may* have happened a much smaller number of times.  But, let's think about this procedure and how it could be foiled while in progress, or outright prevented.  **Stipulations and Disclaimers**  None of the victims are at fault for their attacks.  There were things they could have done to prevent them.  Failing to take preventative measures does NOT equate to fault.  Noting those failures does NOT equate to assigning blame.  Nobody deserved to have any of this happen to them.  A handful of couples did fight back.  That is, there exist a small number of outliers to the generalizations I make here.  GSK was allegedly overwhelmingly successful, however.  Most importantly: ***most*** **victims had reason to expect that they would be attacked.**  Victims would be alerted through his recon tactics (prowling outside, calling them repeatedly).  By the time he started attacking couples in early 1977, the threat of this attacker [was pretty widely known](https://archive.ph/20171031230448/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/11968401/206_ear_the_times_standard_eureka_ca/).  So, everybody was on a baseline level of alert, and his targets were even more alert than that baseline.  If you read the accounts (dispersed among the various links in this post), many, many targets were alerted to suspicious activity sometimes for months leading up to their attacks.  **Preventative Measures**  Let's say you know you're being targeted--you're getting tons of empty phone calls and there has been suspicious activity outside/near your home.  Or, maybe you know you're at risk because you're a young middle class couple in GSK's target area.  The killer's MO is well-established and you are aware of how he operates.  What would/could you do?  (Actually, you wouldn't even have to know the MO that well--just that someone is breaking in and raping...)  The big part of this that is so unbelievable is how easy it is to prevent.  Of course, we don't know about all the rapes that *didn't* occur because the homes were not targetable.  But, to me, the fact that there were *any* homes that did not take *any* of the below preventative measures is impossible to fathom--especially with all the warning signs that victims were privy to.  What preventative measures?  Remember: **a serial rapist is on the loose in your area and you are an eligible target.**  First, board up your bedroom windows from the inside.  Board on top of the curtains if you are self-conscious about neighbors seeing it, such that from the outside, all that can be seen is the back of the curtains.  Or, you can push furniture (dresser, bed with large headboard, etc.) in front of windows.  Second, install a lock and deadbolt on your bedroom door.  I'm incompetent at handiwork and I figured out how to do this over the course of an afternoon.  Or, hire someone to do it.  Just as you lock your exterior doors at night, also close and lock your bedroom door behind you when you go to bed.  You could instead/additionally prop a chair up against the handle of the door.    You could also leave a breakable object on top of the door handle such that, if it were turned or disturbed, the object would fall, break, and make a loud noise.  There are countless ways to cause an intruder to unintentionally make a sleep-interrupting amount of noise.  Especially when you have reason to expect that there might be an intruder.  GSK *may* still be able to enter your room--but not without waking you up well in advance.  Similar strategies can be used for couples with children, although they were not typically targets in the scheme.  **ALL** of these measures are easy to come up with, easy to implement, and cheap.  Isn't it absolutely absurd that so many couples did not take these basic preventative measures?  I wouldn't even have to think of them--I would be coerced by fear into taking these measures.  I don't know how I would fall asleep at night with my bedroom door open.  **Strategies After the Attack Begins**  I again point out the level of foreknowledge each victim would have had about the attacks.  I'm not saying that anybody would think of any of these strategies in the moment.  But, if it were me, after the 5th or so victim I would sit down with my wife and rehearse what we would do if it happened to us.  Again, there is a serial rapist on the loose.  This would be stupid to do if there were not a serial rapist on the loose.  However, **there is a fucking serial rapist on the loose!**  First, a major weakness in the GSK MO is the initial reluctance to use the gun ([these accounts of the attacks](https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/04/26/chilling-tales-from-the-golden-state-killers-rampage/) corroborate that).  Canvasing a victim takes effort.  With the couple now in his grasp, he won't want to immediately shoot them both the very first second that something goes wrong.  In other words, GSK will have a certain level of tolerance to the couple being noncompliant.  This is exploitable.  The woman can tie a really shitty "knot," or pretend to feint in the middle of the procedure.  There are countless ways to look like you're trying to comply when you really aren't.  GSK will have two and only two options here: shoot the couple and leave (not likely), or approach the male victim to secure the knot in order to proceed with the plan.  The couple could strike at that moment, the male victim incapacitating GSK's gun-wielding hand while the female kicks balls, gouges eyes, etc.  Second, the ligatures used by GSK were weak (shoelaces, in most cases).  A nail file or pair of children's safety scissors could be stashed in the bed or in the back pocket/waistband of the male's pajamas/underwear, which could be used to quickly unbind the ligatures while GSK was out of the room (he would frequently leave the male unattended for long periods of time... plenty of time to cut a damn shoe lace!)  Speaking of stashing things in bed, how insanely unrealistic is it that not a single one of those 32 victims had a handgun under their pillow (gun buying became quite popular as the victim count escalated)?  This is ordinarily not something you want to do for safety reasons, but ***there is a fucking rapist on the loose and you're an eligible target.***  A gun could be withdrawn from underneath the pillow while pretending to be dazed from the commotion and fired from underneath the blanket without GSK even seeing it.  This could easily be rehearsed, with minimal time and effort, for maximum effectiveness.  If you wanted to get really creative, you could rig some fish line that you can pull to drop a glass or ceramic object onto the ground on the other side of the room, creating a momentary diversion for both the man and woman to withdraw their weapons and fire.  This is all normally outlandish shit to do, but after the 5th, 10th, 15th, 20th family has been destroyed, when does simply investing a weekend into some creative engineering become worth it?  Personally, all else failing, I'd rather just refuse to comply.  Not because I'm a tough guy--the opposite, in fact: my fragile ego couldn't take it.  I'd rather be shot and killed than just lay there and listen to my wife be repeatedly raped for hours, the trauma wrenching my family apart, and then be haunted by the humiliation/shame of that for the rest of my life.  Each of the later male victims knew that was exactly what was in store for them while their wives tied their hands.  And... they allowed it to happen?  **The Absurdity**  Again, the outlandishness of this doesn't come from one victim failing to implement all of these--it comes from *so many* victims failing to implement *any* of them--especially with all the knowledge they had, and ultimately how easy these strategies (especially the preventative ones) would have been to implement.  Perhaps there were many people who did implement some or all of these.  And perhaps GSK's intelligence gathering efforts filtered those people out.  But, to think that there were even 20 or 30 couples that did not take basic efforts to prevent this from happening is beyond the limit of what I can entertain as reasonable.  Let's give the first few couples a pass.  We are then left to believe that 27 couples who knew a serial rapist was on the loose in their area went to bed each night with no weapons in bed, no plan in place, and with their bedroom doors wide open.  How is that even remotely believable?  Oh, and, GSK had a wife and kids the whole time.  They "didn't know" anything about any of this.  **Motive**  >The case was a factor in the establishment of California's [DNA database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_DNA_Index_System), which collects DNA from all accused and convicted felons in California[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_James_DeAngelo#cite_note-10) and has been called second only to [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia)'s in effectiveness in solving [cold cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_case).   I see three main possibilities, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive:  1. It was a plot from the very start (not likely) 2. It was a plot that developed after the initial crimes were committed (more likely) 3. The entire thing was retconned to usher in the DNA database (more likely)  This seems like a weak motive.  There must be something else going on.  *Something* is not right with this.	1643050074.0	sbta3q	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbta3q/the_golden_state_killer_was_manufactured/	The Golden State Killer was manufactured

33lauy3t	So there was this guy named David Icke. He was highly criticized for his theories, and eventually fell under distributing misinformation, and banned from YouTube because people don't understand what it means to theorize.   So he got cancelled you can't find his work, and all you can find is people criticizing his exploration of 5G being related to this global conspiracy, which the vaccine is complicit and global.   He did a lot of work and named a lot of other people in his work, but I can't find much trace of it.  He wrote a book I think, maybe you can find that. You can also read his Wikipedia, if you find some of his original videos hosted somewhere share them or report them to misinformation or do whatever it is you do, I don't know...   Around that time, there was theorizing about what really happened in Wuhan, and why they were experimenting transmissibility with the virus in a high rank biolab in Wuhan.  There was also a huge inexplicable number of cellular accounts in China in the weeks of outbreak, that were "lost" or something. So there was further conspiracy into what happened with that.  But I mean to further back up what David Icke was trying to say.  We have this pandemic and the public has been at each other's throats over everything, even before the pandemic. Because the truth of the matter, our nature is to repeat what we have heard or seen, and offenses were being propagated in the media everywhere. Obviously sidestepping any populist movement.  David Icke thought this was intentional, and the public division has only become more intense. He knew that people would lose their jobs because, he read the dogma very early on.  So in this running global conspiracy, we have one article so far. Social engineering in our population, and we have an x. The reason, x, might be overtaking politics, or it might be money, it could be depopulation. I think depopulation could be very complicated, it could require a lot of steps to get the desired end result.  It is said that in 40-50 years known oil reserves will be depleted. I have heard less than that. Something sustainable would be attainable, but that doomsday clock is itself closing in fast regardless.	1643053498.0	sbum90	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbum90/david_icke_censorship_general_global_conspiracy/	David Icke; censorship general.

forcynob	&#x200B;  My last post was liked pretty heavily, yet the comment section was bombarded by...shills? believers? supporters of the mandates?  I'm not sure what happened to the comment section but it was remarkable.  &#x200B;  Some of the folks claimed this was because snow was coming... I posted it on Sunday. I mentioned a Saturday visit to other stores which had major issues with supply.  Snow is not expected until Tuesday.  Snow forecast total 2-4 inches.  This is a snow state with a heavy ski tourism industry, 2-4 inches is nothing and hardly affects folks.  To see supermarkets get wiped out we need 6+ inch forecasts.  Many who have lived here for a while now understand that snowstorms are over-hyped here for maximum ski tourism, so we all take even a 6 in forecast with a grain of salt...("that's what she said")  &#x200B;  Some folks claimed this is because "its winter"...  Umm...sorry, been in the USA in snow states for a few decades now, never seen an issue in winter with supply chains.  Maybe the day before, day of, day after a major snowstorm of 8-12+ inches there are some issues with bread and milk, but not meat, not produce.   &#x200B;  Some folks claimed this was related to King Soopers Union striking.  Funny, I did not see any posts about Distribution Centers packed to the brim with product, and, as shown in these images, stores who are not striking were having issues as well.  &#x200B;  So here is the rundown...  &#x200B;  Sprouts - meat department filled with holes.  Produce stock looked pretty good.  Sams Club - was filled with holes on Saturday, was fully stocked today.  Actually might have been the fullest I've seen the meat shelves at Sams since the Plandemic began.  &#x200B;  Wal Mart - filled with holes and empty bins.  Produce stock seemed good.  Walmart is known to fill shelves or remove shelves to provide the image of full shelves because they know how it affects customer sentiment and psychology.  To see this many holes and empty bins at a store with such a heavy analytics department is interesting to say the least.  &#x200B;  King Soopers - Visited a second KS location today, it was stocked to the brim.  Makes sense if they hadn't stocked shelves in a few days and were backlogged with product and had low sales.  Guessing the company realizes how important it will be to have full shelves when customers/workers return so I was happy to see their store was well stocked, perhaps the best I've seen since the beginning of the Plandemic.  &#x200B;  Natural Grocers - they have a very small meat dept because so few organic producers, and still many holes.  &#x200B;  Target - meat department had entire shelves running empty, lots of holes.  Produce dept was well stocked.  &#x200B;  Weather forecast for Denver...2-4inches for the storm total.  This is not a scary snowstorm that people prep for, this is pretty typical winter weather.  Milk and bread normally hit, usually no issue with meat.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  They are normalizing empty shelves.  Even down to the commenters bombarding the posts about it.  They want you to think this is normal.  It is not.  I've been looking at store shelves for decades, even worked in retail for a little while, this is not normal.  Corporate retailers do analytics on shelf space, even analyzing top vs bottom, endcap vs mid shelf.  The goal is completely full shelves, and items in the right place on the shelf.  &#x200B;  This is by design.  They took away 50% of cross border truckers.  They forced a lot of folks to leave the industry because they weren't scared of 99.99% survival rates.  They being the pharma industry who controls the folks in govt.  &#x200B;  I know I know...some people just dont see it, and have accepted this is normal.  It's not normal. Maybe the New Normal, like New World Order normal.  &#x200B;  Thanks for playing.   &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/nh1oubimuod81.png?width=1205&format=png&auto=webp&s=be64b6364c56c477fa660fc66832e76fe03bf5ca  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/c1tbxkqpuod81.png?width=1201&format=png&auto=webp&s=46b54d16bc2272097eaedea0b2b953990c05c232  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/ieb9aw9suod81.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c0dafbb9b2f4b0da6da9f8e3e0d0093522d86d1  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/igzes2guuod81.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6cefa6b8889798b98d4b476c77bbbf74d6cc6d6  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/4l32yjrwuod81.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=58cd11aa616d385cad1466492aff6041edc0cedf  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/brhplkbzuod81.png?width=1212&format=png&auto=webp&s=16539d1f87821a1eb30d897f104029eb0246867e  &#x200B;  &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/gtwtl9u7vod81.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd3eb658bc138abaaac2ad9e779d0bd6a0393ca	1643054207.0	sbuw9z	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbuw9z/update_regarding_meat_department_shortages/	Update regarding meat department shortages

In future there will be another warfare, another smoke and mirror show more well suited for us. For those that can see through the cracks. From my experience I have to say that at first I hated what was going on but slowly and surely I am finding a certain level of admiration for what have been prepared for us. It is like a Westworld narrative. Ever changing, ever evolving to caught up to our needs our desire, yet this one wasn´t organic enough. It didn´t feel real enough therefore a lot of people resisted.

From the ashes a new world will emerge.. it will be sold to even the most skeptical of us as a new golden age of humanity... And indeed many will believe it, but of course, under the veil, it will be a technocratic surveillance state the kinds of which Orwell/Huxley couldn't even have dreamt of.

2wxgehdu	 I AP'd into Various places including Area51 and in Area 51 I was met by a demon or some powerful CIA psychic soldier that sent me back into my body and I woke up with a headache.  Area51 even had metaphysical/demons guards.  In another AP I found myself in a distant planet, I travelled through a fast astral wormhole.  The planet had modern buildings and I arrived early in the morning when all the intelligent being were in their homes.  Their downtown skyline was pretty empty.   They could communicate through telepathy and informed me they know about my planet Earth and they have visited it before and will visit again in the future.  They also told me that all the current humans on Earth are actually aliens to Earth and that the previous humans were cleansed off the Earth (Noah's flood I assume) and a chunk of the original humans were taken off the Earth during the cleansing off the Earth from most humans.  And sometime around 20k years ago the humans that were taken to space and into another alien planet had descendants that were brought back to Earth, so we humans are actually Aliens born in another planet but descended from the original handful of humans taken away to another planet.  I also gained knowledge that those aliens used gravity generator ships to attain high speeds and walk around and live inside their ship without any G-forces harming them.  Also, in another case of me astral projecting, I fly out into above the Earth to see what space near Earth is about and I saw a cloaked alien Ship in high orbit above Earth.  The Ship appears to be using some unknown alien metal build and some other rare elements found on another planet and magnetic fields to hide itself.  When I looked back at Earth, the Earth had a pinkish hugh colour to it so the blue color we see is probably just our human mammal eyes and the real colour is pinkish hue.  ----  Fyi CIA does remote viewing and Astral Projection training for soldiers to learn to spy on remote targets.  https://www.google.com/search?q=cia+remote+viewing+site%3Agov&oq=cia+remote+viewing+site%3Agov&aqs=chrome..69i57.11112j0j7&client=ms-android-xiaomi-rvo3&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8	1643055681.0	sbvh4w	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbvh4w/a_few_ap_episodes_i_had/	A few AP episodes I had.

4nb0lvia	George H. W. Bush had a long history in the intelligence community, and was a *very* influential and important person in how the last sixty-some odd years unfolded.  He was a staple and a pillar of the Republican party for many years. Most of it from behind the scenes as an un-elected bureaucrat. Some of the 'most important' events in US history went down with his fingerprints all over them. Kennedy, Vietnam, the drug wars and crack epidemic in the 80's, funding bin Laden and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the first and second gulf wars, September 11th, invading Afghanistan and the opiate epidemic, ... and so on..   As a life long part of the intelligence community, including being the director of the CIA in the 70's, you can safely assume he had some major dirt on pretty much *everyone*. *Including* Epstein (who was probably also under Bush's thumb).   He was also a well known advocate of the NWO.  Bush Sr. died November 30, 2018, which is pretty much right when things started going really weird in the world.

caq5aau	Wikileaks exposed that CIA had plans to kill Assange. Assange's lawyers are trying to claim in the court that the extradition will kill Assange because of CIA assassination plots and Epstein's mysterious suicide etc.  &#x200B;  =====  Glenn Greenwald and Spencer Ackerman wrote about a few black sites including Chicago Homan Square.  Conspiracy theories, or almost facts now- there are many concentration camps inside USA where they lock up mostly black teenagers, and sometimes black lawyers/investigators who attempt to investigate connection between CIA and drugs. Most of the black sites are in Chicago and Portland. They are run by state police, private military and occasionally FBI.  Now the conspiracy theory is- Ghislaine Maxwell and Mossad was doing eugenics with the help of American police and private military. It's still a theory/hypothesis, but day by day Maxwell and Epstein's links with the military, UN, WHO, DARPA, big tech, Bill Gates and other eugenicists are being exposed. So it's not a 'bigfoot' level theory anymore, it's 'plausible'.  &#x200B;  ====  So, does CIA want to bring Assange in a concentration camp like Homan Square and then do human sacrifice ritual on him?  It sounds far fetched, let's stick with more plausible conspiracy theory, Assange is gonna be put in a prison, where he will 'commit suicide' while cameras go disabled.  Note that Epstein-Deutsche bank judge was attacked by fake fedex delivery man. The assassin killed her husband and child but she didn't get hurt.  That's the issue with Assange's lawyers. They are not into conspiracy theory. They mention Epstein's mysterious suicide but they don't mention that British judges maybe secretly threatened by Epstein and CIA.   Sometimes what's happening in the media isn't what's really happening. No domestic news network will touch Homan Square and other black sites. They know they can go viral if they show 'The president we don't like has concentration camps in Chicago to lock up us', but even then they are not going to touch it(because CIA forbid them).  Same for Epstein-Deutsche bank judge assassin. Most domestic news network are reluctant to talk about it. Because digging deep into that may expose CIA and Blackrock corporation.  Basically, Assange's lawyers have to wake up. If media doesn't talk about a topic, that means they have to focus on that topic.  What if British judges were blackmailed? Or more correctly, their social network advertisements show them ads regarding Epstein-Deutsche Bank judge and try to scare them?  &#x200B;  =====  Slightly off topic but current administration is actually increasing budget of police because crime has increased. However, the left hated the police and claimed police became evil. Police did shoot journalist's eyes in 2020.   There are conspiracy theories that police are being trained by Mossad and Blackwater. That's why president wants to fund more police, to funnel the money to deep state, and to create another political riot in 2022 midterm.  &#x200B;  =====  Now, what if all the politicians are controlled oppositions? Congresswoman Ilhan Omar often criticizes CIA for funding cartels in South America etc. However she is not keen on criticizing Homan Square and other concentration camps inside the USA for some reason.   I admit that I read lots of libertarian leaning conspiracy theories that claim that anybody who doesn't audit the federal reserve or doesn't nationalize oil reserve are controlled opposition and fooling the people. It seemed far fetched but, now I think, maybe, libertarians were right about CIA and petrodollar. Maybe politicians are controlled oppositions. They do virtue signaling with words so people will think they are doing something to drain the swamp but actually nothing changes? Maybe they say they want better school funding, better healthcare funding but they create more income inequality and big pharma?  &#x200B;  =====  McAfee conspiracy theory is not connected, probably needs separate thread but, in short McAfee  warned that he had information about IRS spying and he will expose it if something happens. However that dead man's switch apparently didn't expose any data, yet.  McAfee also claimed that he is not going to kill himself before he killed 'himself'.  Now, there are news that IRS is going after people in the poorest area in Mississippi. Even though mid-USA is having serious inflation and they can't afford fuel or food anymore.

ese9r4ml	So I was asked what is real as a broad question but a valid question. And after not being able to sleep on it after and hours of actually thinking about it I’ve come to the conclusion that the only thing without a doubt 100% absolute fact that is real is the existence of my own consciousness, everything else from any angle is debatable. And the kicker is, I can only without a doubt 100% only prove that my consciousness is the only thing that’s not debatable it is real to myself, I can’t prove that to you. I can’t PROVE you are real, I can accept you are real but I cannot prove you are. So what is real? My answer is my existence of consciousness but only to me.	1643059258.0	sbwtsr	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbwtsr/what_is_real/	What is real?

609ggv2	   Cryptocurrency conspiracy theory  \[1\] Back in the day when the interwebs were young there was a program by SETI where one could loan your computing processing power to SETI when you are not using your computer.  SETI would use that computing processing power to do stuff with.    \[2\] Cryptocurrency uses A WHOLE LOT of computing processing power to create.  It is highly unlikely (I would assume) that this processing power is not being used to do something useful and/or profitable aside from doing math for math's sake (what seems to be the official claim).  \[3\] I think that <someone> is using Cryptocurrency to actively use that computing processing power for <something>.  \[4\] When you use your computing processing power to create Cryptocurrency, I think that the <someone> is paying you for your computing processing power indirectly though buying that Cryptocurrency.  \[5\] This also would be a REALLY good honeypot to lure criminals to, and track illicit activity.    \[6\] I think the US government (like the NSA) created Cryptocurrency in order to (1) borrow processing power, and (2) crack cryptography \[such as encrypted Chinese communications, or encrypted criminal money transfers made by crime organizations, or Russian oligarchs\], (3) Track this easy for criminals to use currency to see where it is, and (4) eventually take the cryptocurrency from these bad actors.  This could be quite a huge amount of money to take from bad actors!  \[7\] Seriously this is really cleaver if true, and I think that it is true.	1643060204.0	sbx8cj	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbx8cj/cryptocurrency_conspiracy_theory/	Cryptocurrency conspiracy theory

Although it is known as a gossip site, CDAN was literally discussing Epstein in their blind items a decade before he was ever caught.   I was recently reading an old blind item reveal which discusses the Replica app as a continuation of Project MK Ultra.

But I was just watching some older YouTube videos that had movie posters in the background and it was very clearly visible that the movie title is “Zootopia”. I was super confused and was looking up more information about it. In the United States, the movie is titled “Zootopia” in the UK, it’s titled “Zootropolis”.

2mps5zcf	Hi CatEyes420 here, I have a serious question and i hope someone can help me or direct me into the right direction.  Between the Years 2009-2010, I owned this old Windows XP desktop computer.  I was between the ages of 15-16 between the years 2009-2010, so I was clearly on my Desktop often.   This desktop with “The Simpsons Background” can be seen alongside myself on some of my videos on my old YouTube channel “LiveUrLifeChick” it’s hard to find, but has a heavily edited purple profile pic of myself. Videos from 12 years ago aka the years 2009/2010…  Well I can’t login to this account and I need to, but it refuses. It keeps just connecting me to the “google login” and I don’t remember. I not only need to login to the “LiveUrLifeChick” YouTube profile but also with something else I’m not sure about…  This same desktop computer was thrown away by my parents when we moved in the year 2011 ;(  My question is, at the time Bitcoin mining was first getting big, while I didn’t understand it, I looked into it a little and followed this old YouTube video (made around that time that I cannot seem to find either) that showed you step by step how to download the then more original program for what would now be an old Windows XP Desktop computer.   Once the mining program was downloaded and you pressed start and it began mining, this “Oil Pumpjack” symbol popped up and would go up and down as it mined. Underneath the little symbol it showed how much coin was minted. It took forever to barley get it to go up, but I know I’d randomly do it and then one day just stopped, due to not being sure what it was and also again bc my computer was thrown away by my parents.   What is the name of this program? I would love to know…  I did sign up for a wallet, but I don’t remember, bc at the time I wasn’t even sure what it was.  But umm,,yeah…what exactly happened to this Bitcoin that I mined?? I could really use it and I bet by now it would be worth a lot more, since it was done somewhere around the years 2009-2010…  I’m sure it can be back-traced to the original IP of the computer at the time and any email/social media accounts associated to this IP.   I would love to know if someone can help me find it or access it by hacking or finding my old accounts lost somewhere. Or at least telling me what happened with these coins from that time? Where are they now?   It’s just really really bothering me…It seems I forgot my emails and passwords for certain accounts even if they were the same for those accounts that I would have used when I was younger at the time?  Am I one of these “unknown” people they mention?	1643062146.0	sbxzq4	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbxzq4/bitcoin_mining_somewhere_between_years_20092010/	Bitcoin mining somewhere between years 2009/2010 question

d9mnj3d1	I think we are already doomed... I think that whatever the covid vaccination program desired to achieve, it's expectations were met- if not exceeded.  I don't think they ever intended a 100% successful vaccination rate. If their goal is genetic alteration of the public, all they need is to vaccinate a certain percentage. The altered genetic info of the vaxx will be passed to their children, who will mate with others still- effectively spreading the genetic alteration without people even being aware of it.  There will be short term effects in the vaxxed, and long term effects in the vaxxed, but the real study will be the long-long term effects, or the mutli-generational fallout of vaccines and just how much have human beings changed at a genetic level- changes that might not be intuitive for the first one or two generations.  That's why I believe we already lost. All the government crackdowns and new policies and laws and such are just all sorts of hands squeezing it for every last drop they can before they move on to the next big scheme. But whatever they were aiming for, I think they've succeeded.	1643063904.0	sbynzd	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbynzd/i_think_weve_already_lost_with_covid/	I think we've already lost with covid.

I am trying to send my very left-brained best friend as much reputable data (no articles, please) about the vaccines as possible. She is planning on getting her first vaccines soon but is on the fence.   She has spent the entire pandemic being terrified of catching the virus, but finally got it over the holidays. It sucked for them as their family has spent the last 4 years isolating dude to their little girl being diagnosed with Leukemia.   The issue is, she is immediately turned off by anyone who speaks too passionately about this as her brain instantly labels them as "conspiracy theorists" - she is slowly being worn down, however, as bit by bit all of the things I was telling her have been coming true.

84g6plfp	Hi, it's my first post here. I feel like I need to share this here and you'll understand after why. Alright, so I have a more than 13 years friendship with my dude and been thru a lot of things together including me saving his life in HS. Since the pandemic started this dude started acting weird, but I didn't belive it to be such a tragic thing since almost everybody lost it's mind.   All good and nice until last week when I got the virus. I didn't really understand how I got it and and I've done a little investigation and maybe I could discover if I infevted other people. Since I work from home and I have a girlfriend I have very few contacts and my steps were easly reproduceble. After calling some people and they agreed to make a test a show me, my only remaining contact was my bestfriend who I've seen shortly before getting sick.  I know that he's done his vaccine in december because of a job opportunity. I asked him to do a test since I'm almost sure I've got the virus from him and my dude snapped like I asked him to kill a man for me ! His argument was that is vaccinated and vaccine prevents the virus and THEN told me that he's done his civil duty (by getting the shots). He never said this shit before ...   Now, looking back, since he's done the vaccine he started acting strange and one thing he never liked was Facebook, but he talked about tge vaccine and shamed me like he was reading it straight from a post.  *A little bit of context: I was always testing myself weekly. I was very carefull not to give this virus to my friends because we have pretty old parents.  This motherf**** refused to spend 5 min for "his brother"(me) that he ate from the same plate with and shame me that I don't care about other people because I didn't went to get the shots. Instead of receiving a "how ya feeling man ? " I got a fb post. F with the pandemic. This hurt more than the 72 hours of headaches from the virus. Facts!   What in name of LGBT Jesus is happening ?

14lmvt	So basically I'm thinking about this conflict in Russia and trying not to worry about it but the theories are drifting in and out... allow me to share. For background purposes, I will say that firstly I am an indigenous Canadian, but I do not have my status, thus making me just another minority. Secondly, I am on disability assistance for life, I have been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder although I am able to cope with it most time, when I can't I can be deadly. Which brings me to my third point, I am highly studied in various martial arts, not to the point a black belt would be but fairly competent in a good amount of disciplines. Finally to top it all off, I am unvaccinated, a part of the population definitely being mildly looked down upon. With the mental illness being a factor but also knowing that a man like myself has had nothing but time to study for nearly 10 yrs, if you're the army, do you take the risk? Furthermore I know the Canadian Army probably won't take the risk, but the Americans will, so does Canada sell off welfare contracts to the states and suddenly the CIA is at my door? I'm just concerned that a few sudden factors could lead to me being suited of in Taipei or Kiev...am I crazy?	1643066274.0	sbzjoy	/r/conspiracy/comments/sbzjoy/forced_military_service_and_wwiii/	forced military service and wwiii

Once you're behind far enough, they won't really be like, here, under our accelerated good citizen jab program, you can get one per week until you're free again.

3gbp2g0b	So this morning I go to the supermarket, wear a fake mask (one of those optically illusive mesh things that still looks like a mask) because I wasn't in the mood to take shit from the mask police. I checked out on the register, am putting my groceries into my bag, and notice that there's a woman literally 10 meters away, fucking double masked, waiting for me to literally leave the area until she can proceed to the register.   Another one gave me the evil eye in a local bus because she noticed I was only loosely wearing my scarf as a "mask". Fucking lunatics. I honestly have no pity for them at this point because it's due to their mental problems that we're allowing this clown circus to continue. Absolutely zero science, but 100% blind zealous religious-like fear.  Why'd she venture out to this pathogen-infested plague-verse of the outside world in the first place? Stay the fuck home if you need 10 fucking meters between your face-diapered self and another healthy-looking human being.  Why is this in conspiracy? This thing is a fucking psy-op for the 30% of the population (or more?) with severe mental disorders who expect the rest of us to coddle their severe hypochondriac insecurities and social anxiety.   Until we start to recognize this insanity for what it is - mental illness - I don't think we can truly get rid of all the BS mandates and regulations. The NPCs will always cry that we need to be considerate of their "feelings" and help make them feel comfortable. Fucking get a therapist, or better yet, learn meditation, but don't expect all of society to re-order just to conform to your fucking phobias based on made-up CNN stories. Amen and a-fucking-woman.  P.S. I am a female and normally don't curse this much. ;)  EDIT: Is it just me or comment sections here are 50% shills?

h3uxo	Some context:   I live in Germany. Our country has a nationwide 3G rule, essentially meaning for pretty much all aspects of life (excluding grocery stores and gas stations for some reason), you either need to show that you have a negative test, been vaccinated or have proof of recovery. Most venues now have a 2G rule, meaning you have to be vaccinated or have proof of recovery, no unvaccinated allowed. Others are even going so far as to do a 2G+ rule, meaning you have to be vaccinated or have proof of recovery WITH a negative test, usually no older than 24 hours.   Two weeks ago I caught Covid. I’m double vaccinated, and felt sick for a few days, but got better after a while. In a week I am eligible to get a paper that shows my proof of recovery. However, that paper is only good for 3 months!!!   I don’t want to get the booster, and I didn’t have any intention of getting the booster even before I got Covid. From what I’ve read, being exposed to covid gives you much better antibody resistance than from a vaccine, and by that logic I should be good and shouldn’t have to get a vaccine.   However, thanks to germanys incompetent government, I’ll be forced to get the booster before too long. Soon enough I will no longer count as vaccinated since I’m only double vaccinated. It’s honestly insane, and no one is really putting up a fight against these mandates or the issues surrounding how they’re handling Covid.

993zm1s6	It has to do with the amino substitutions made at multiple sites by the s1 and s2 subunits of the spike protein which __if the narrative is correct and this was chimeric material leaked from a lab everybody better be privy of but nobody will claim responsibilty__... Why be privy? Because the chimerism will spread from tissue to tissue if that facet is disregarded in the vaccine attentuation/type.  Precisely what's been happening. "Injection site reaction" MY ASS. It's chimeric and serving a double ligand/receptor role and is allowed to spread tissue to tissue.   *Someone at McDonalds is spewing this chimeric spike onto the burgers and blowing people's assholes out right now and it's all being scrubbed as IBS disorders/complications in local hospitals.*  Fort Detrick unleashed a mutagenic virus that triggered the 2018-19 "vaping epidemic" where kids died and it was all swept under the rug as cart ingredient adulterant issues, or vape cart metal issues. Which are also all real issues. But the kids died and they're parents were told that it's because they vapes when there was a chimeric mutagen released from Fort Detrick upon the American population from an NiH lab that expressed itself much like pneumonia/flu and was severe.  Let's not forget that china gave that information out, and multiple NiH papers line up with the narrative but ALSO let's not forget... China runs the NiH.

4mcs7	It seemed out of nowhere that countries and states are happening to remove mandates and restrictions out of nowhere. Though many are saying that because of mid terms politicians are doing it so they can get reelected, but the my main concern is following up on this [story](https://mol.im/a/10438357).  What better way to spread a potential disease even more. With the country waking up against boosters. Also with the US stockpiling small pox vaccines. The FDA fast tracking authorization of ticovirimat a post infection therapy. Of course we all know about bill gates talking about a small pox bio terror weapon.  With vaccinated having their immune system eroded. Many if not all health care workers. Could this be the real push towards mass human death? Hospitals over ran. Huge supply shock because of people sick and worried about a bioterror attack.  I don't know what's to come. Everything seems so unrealistic like we're ina dystopian movie that's accelerating. We're not even in the climax of the movie.   All I can say is stock up on food, water, guns,ammo, med supplies. Get with your religion and practice even more. Meditate and keep your mind and spirit clear, upbeat and positive.   I hope everything I'm thinking is wrong and just being a little paranoid and make erroneous calculations. If so I can laugh at how silly I am, but the real fear is if I'm right and everything that I'm thinking is true and the possibility of it getting worse.

The Convoy For Freedom 2022 broke the world record for largest convoy in history before it even left BC, and it continued to grow as more and more trucks, and other vehicles joined in along the route.Tens of thousands of trucks are confirmed to be registered for the rally, and estimates are up to 150,000 trucks could be taking part as they roll into Ottawa. American truckers are now also joining, as are hundreds of thousands of regular citizens, both vaxxed and unvaxxed! You don't have to be a trucker to join in, everyone is welcome. Search for Convoy to Ottawa 2022 on Facebook and join the group for full information and progress reports.  This convoy is NOT an anti-vax rally! It is a rally for rights and freedoms of EVERYONE!! It is about removing ALL restrictions and mandates for ALL! People praise the military for fighting for our rights and freedoms, so why are these truckers any different?? This is a peaceful rally, with a strict code of conduct. People will be on the lookout for agitators, and anyone not adhering to the peaceful nature of this rally will be stopped and reported to authorities. Organizers are working very closely with the police, and other authorities, to ensure this remains peaceful.  History is being made right now folks! Everyone involved is committed to sticking this out until everyone has their rights and freedoms restored!

caq5aau	Qanon supporters were spreading conspiracy theories about President Biden. So he asked 'Do Republicans really believe we Democrats are eating children alive as rituals?'  President Biden also called a Fox news reporter 'Inflation, what an asset. What a s\*n of a b\*\*\*h.'  Bill Gates, when asked about Epstein said 'Well he is dead now, so you always have to be careful'  President Trump suddenly started incoherent rant about one of his uncle being a great scientist.  President Trump also claimed former President Obama is hacking his microwave oven to spy on him.  President Trump was talking with a guy in a bus and claimed that he doesn't even wait for a woman's signal, he just start groping them.  Now, let's assume these people, who are billionaire elites, spoke their minds. They wanted to say things subtlely in order to distract people or to motivate supporters. This actually goes to a different conspiracy theory- aristocrats often want to put subtle hints in public to crowd control, or maybe to attract investors or something? Conspiracy theorists often focus on numbers and symbolism, but I think that's distraction, rather they should focus on speeches of the elites, which are half truths, and of course, actions of the elites.  &#x200B;  ====  Qanon may blame other party for cannibalism, but maybe it's a distraction? Maybe both parties eat black teenagers in concentration camps like Chicago Homan Square. If they don't, why don't any domestic news network talk about black sites in Chicago? Mainstream media is divided into red vs blue. If only one party was eating babies other party's news media would mention concentration camps in Chicago or Portland. But they mostly don't.   That means both parties are probably in on it.  &#x200B;  ====  Maybe President Biden wanted to call journalist bad thing to distract people. Inflation is destroying midwest. And there are news that IRS is going after poor people in midwest like the most poor towns in Mississippi. So maybe Biden thinks inflation is an asset for him to torture political opponents?   Or maybe he was angry at Fox News and claiming Fox News uses inflation as a news tool? I think the former is more probable.  &#x200B;  ====  Maybe Bill Gates said 'Oh he is dead now so you always have to be careful' because he was relieved? Or maybe, it was an indirect threat to other people. He probably meant 'You will be dead if you are not careful'.  Either way it's a creepy thing to say.   &#x200B;  ====  President Trump claimed President Obama is hacking his microwave oven. Maybe he was subtlely hinting other things.   Note that Havana Syndrome, where  Russian or Chinese intelligence were allegedly using microwave against senators, happened during Trump presidency. So is it possible that President Trump threatened China or his political opponent that USA has advanced directed energy weapon?  Or maybe he was just terrified of NSA?  &#x200B;  ===  President Trump was talking about nuclear power but started ranting about his uncle John G Trump. John Trump was an elite level radiation scientist.  This rant was bit incoherent but Trump said '*nuclear is so powerful; my uncle explained that to me many, many years ago, the power and that was 35 years ago; he would explain the power of what’s going to happen and he was right, who would have thought?'*   Now it's possible that Trump only meant his uncle predicted the nuclear powers in twenty first century. Or maybe he meant that John Trump told him a lot about the future energy sources. There are conspiracy theories about John Trump being CIA, and having access to classified Nikola Tesla documents regarding directed energy weapons.  So is it possible that John Trump made a Trump presidency possible by telling a young Trump to follow the CIA or something?  &#x200B;  ====  President Trump bragged about sexual assault. His supporters say it was just bragging, he never actually assaulted/groped any women, he was just making jokes.   But is it possible that he was bragging/confessing, or he was hinting that he is being blackmailed by Epstein or somebody? Because several women sued Trump way before that audio tape was recorded. They said similar things like Trump claimed, the women said Trump groped their genitals. Is it just a coincidence?  &#x200B;  ====  Now, how does this link to Maxwell and Assange? That's a different post but in short- it is possible that Mossad is buying ads or hacking phones of people to persuade them to wear fake Fedex uniform and assassinate American judges. Then they may also scare British judges somehow.  Ghislaine Maxwell and her friends and lawyers often writes cryptic posts, probably to influence CIA.	1643128661.0	schtqe	/r/conspiracy/comments/schtqe/president_biden_asked_do_republicans_really_think/	President Biden asked 'Do Republicans really think Democrats are eating children as rituals?'

Rant on the internet that you've been duped? Protest in front of the White House for a few days before going back home?  People act like there'd be some sort of consequence for the government agencies or big Pharm if they were lied to when in reality they'd proceed as usual. It isn't like you can sue the Pharmaceutical companies if something happens to you - they have legal immunity. They can literally admit to poisoning you and you can't do a thing about it.  If you aren't already familiar with it, look up Dupont "forever chemicals," this company (**purposely**) has basically poisoned the bloodstream of every human and animal on the planet, they paid a fine and lived happily ever after. The citizens didn't rise up, rush the company, and send the CEO to the gulag. Everyone shrugged, and accepted the fact that they got screwed!  My question is, what's everyone gonna do if (or when) they realize they were screwed over?	1643129536.0	sci5pw	/r/conspiracy/comments/sci5pw/they_cant_lie_to_hundreds_of_millions_of_people/	"They can't lie to hundreds of millions of people!"

There was a comment from a former playmate that caught my attention about how Hue set up audio recorders and cameras in every room, and that he could use footage to blackmail others if needed.  The crazy part is that he was revered for his wealth and got away with lots of things.

I don't understand how the nose swab tests, or any tests, say you have covid, but it csnt tell you if delta, omnicron, etc, 2hich are just different strains and code names for specific mutations.  But the common cold is also made of coronaviruses, rinoviruses etc. So then wouldn't it pick up if you have a cold?	1643129973.0	scibh0	/r/conspiracy/comments/scibh0/if_the_tests_cant_distinguish_between_different/	If the tests can't distinguish between different "covid" strains, then how does it differentiate between "coronavirus" and the common cold (which is coronaviruses and rinoviruses)
9u9gcz34	I am from Quebec, Canada. I am unable to leave my country because I am unvaccinated. Hatred for the unvaccinated is growing stronger everyday. As you probably know, bars, gyms, sports, restaurants, theatres, and now even stores are closed off to the unvaccinated here. The government is trying to push a tax on the unvaccinated. Canadians want even more restrictions on the unvaccinated, I fear soon they will come for our jobs.  I am young, healthy, have already caught covid, and I am being forced to chose between my freedom and my principles. I know there is a non-zero chance of myocarditis with the vaccine, I happen to have a history of heart problems in my family, so I'd like to avoid it if I can for that reason as well.  I want to leave. I fear for my safety in the coming years. The US border is closed to the unvaccinated and I am unable to board a plane for the same reason. Even if I can figure out a way to leave, I don't know where I would go.  Does anyone know where the best place is for unvaccinated people to live right now? If I manage to escape my country, where do I turn to?  Thank you all for your commitment to truth and freedom, much love to all of you.  EDIT: Does anyone have any experience hopping the border?

But they never make it out because of the inherent dangers associated with messing with human genomes and DNA. They are three types of batches that have gone out to the public with the covid vax. A high level viral dose, a mid level viral load and a placebo (salt water). They've been studying the effects of these on the population.

9spgguwf	It's come to my attention with increasingly stacked evidence that there are hospitals which are injecting their patients with Remdesivir at minimum, and that is toxic to the human body and damages organs.  So, I took that thought process and took it a step further. Think about it. My thinking is this:  Since hospitals are administering deadly drugs into the organs of patients who then die early from damage, wouldn't it stand to reason that those damaged organs are being purposely given to patients needing transplants to further the depopulation agenda?  Also, the government is in cahoots with the Mafia. This has been documented. I 100% see black market secret operations involving organ harvesting happening as well behind closed doors.  In addition, hospitals are getting paid more for ventilators being filled and for Covid being listed as their cause of death, even if it wasn't actually Covid that sealed their fate. Connect the dots please I believe they're harvesting organs as well.

6l03d3x8	*EDE scanners use advanced technology to rapidly detect potential COVID-19 cases. They do so by measuring alterations in electromagnetic waves, using a smartphone connected to a sensor. Electromagnetic wave patterns change when RNA particles of the COVID-19 virus are present. The results of the scan are therefore near-instantaneous.*  [https://gulfnews.com/uae/abu-dhabi-entry-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-ede-scans-for-covid-19-screening-1.84423663](https://gulfnews.com/uae/abu-dhabi-entry-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-ede-scans-for-covid-19-screening-1.84423663)  Now unless I'm mistaken this sort of remote scanning technology that can distinguish between various types of coronavirus, eg, the common cold or even a rhino virus (the flu) should deserve a Nobel prize. However I haven't heard anything about this remarkable world changing breakthrough in the MSM.  My theory is it can detect an electromagnetic wave pattern, however that is probably only if the scanning subject has a vaccine in them. eg, graphene.  When they claim it detects covid, it's more likely it's NOT detecting the vaccine/graphene oxide, then that person is pulled aside and tested further.  The photos taken with the phone in tandem with the scan link a face to the electromagnetic wave pattern. I imagine it's unique to everyone.  Once again people seem to think the magical phone is detecting this, but it's just taking the pic. The scanner is in the background linking the two together.	1643131416.0	sciv0n	/r/conspiracy/comments/sciv0n/so_apparently_they_can_detect_coronavirus_with/	So apparently they can detect Coronavirus with 'EDE' Scanners.

3fwuziqq	I have been reading quite a bit about obviously 5G-7G, social credit system to compete with China being a possible reality,and also meta verse to come. Even though it seems interesting could be extremely dangerous long-term based on many articles online about policing the metal verse in also the idea of eventually 6G connecting peoples minds to the game once everyone is sold on it. I read it will start as a silly idea/ gaming platform, but then all of your classrooms will use it instead of zoom, there will be more viruses on the rise causing us to stay home which will encourage it more, and also it will be built as a layer over a traditional reality that we have now. You will have an entire life set up in there as if it is reality at some point. Cryptocurrency‘s and NFTs will be in your portfolio because eventually the dollars from many countries will be overproduced and crashed… making way for another encouragement to join and participate. And even if it was just a game let’s say, the new technology will monitor blood pressure, heart rate, moods, and also body language, will know as soon as you log on at all times and from what location, your financial systems will be logged into it as well that you need to be involved, and each user has a handler/ “elf” that helps them through  centralize meta-verse to encourage them to make purchases and can read your emotions and change their patterns of manipulation.  Also this will encourage a social credit system and the acceptance of it through this universe. Again I’m just starting to read more about it since it was just announced. Very curious if people think this will be a positive or negative and also white people feel about 60 and if they have looked into it.	1643132049.0	scj3rj	/r/conspiracy/comments/scj3rj/what_do_you_guys_think_about_societies_agenda_to/	What do you guys think about societies agenda to move to meta verse and eventually 6g?

Our foreign policies are atrocious, unjust and cruel; the national debt is out of control; our currency is being destroyed; society has been deeply divided on several different planes over the past 6 years more so than ever before; the Covid regime is a monstrous nightmare against everything this country was founded on and now we’re talking about sowing the seeds of WW3.

The problem with meritocracy is that it's such an easy system for sociopaths to navigate.  Consider your sex drive and how much that motivates you, now consider, their sociopathy enables compulsions equal to or greater than even that.  Think about how easy it is for such a person to attain rank, always motivated by the promise of the harm he or she will be able to do if only they had the power...  Some of you weren't alive then but back when the U.S.S.R. fell that was a very scary time.  Why?  Because for a short period of time you basically had a decapitated hierachy that was responsible for thousands of nuclear weapons but that was free to do whatever they wanted.  So why didn't anything bad happen?  Because under the Soviet system, being a sociopath held no advantage.  Your station in life was primarily determined by your party affiliation, i.e., luck of the draw.  There may have been a few sociopaths in dangerous positions of power but they had no agency, they were too few in number to pose a threat.  Will the world be so lucky when the U.S. falls?

2xs4tona	In my life, I've always been aware of the fact almost nothing changes for people regardless of who is voted into office.   Everything that happens with politics is always the bare minimum to keep people sane progress is insanely slow at the best of times.  &#x200B;  When you watch Media, or talk shows it becomes more and more obvious these shows are only here to make money, nothing they say or do means anything, changes anything, or helps anyways. It's just talking, it's just views, it's just about money.  &#x200B;  Is this all a grand illusion? To give people a sense they have control over something, to give us this promise that change is always coming?  Meanwhile all of us are simply playing a small part in keeping the machine pushing forward progress that allows those with enormous wealth better access to ever growing technology, medical care and luxuries we could only imagine?  &#x200B;  It's not even like this is hidden at all, we already know the medical care the elite receive is like comparing the modern day to the dark ages, we already can see with their pocket change they could have any material thing they want. That kind of wealth seems, meaningless doesn't it? No matter what country you go to the Government always seems to kneel before the wealthy elites.  &#x200B;  Apologies for the rambling but I just had that realization today that nothing changes, when it does it resets and all this political polarization is ultimately senseless because its like fighting over what apply tastes better the green or the red. We can argue about it all day but an apple is still an apple and that isn't changing.	1643133871.0	scjtb5	/r/conspiracy/comments/scjtb5/something_dawned_on_me_about_politics_and/	Something dawned on me.

At first the CDC said don’t worry we have NOT tested on them yet, they are in fact LAB monkeys. And today they said they only caught 3 out of the 100 monkeys so far. Now the CDC is saying if you come across them, you need to call them and be mointered for ‘cold like symptoms’… this shows me the elites are trying to keep people fearful, since Covid didn’t go as they planned.

af9uu4v	Just background, I have a bachelor's in chemistry, and have always been interested in medicinal plants and the science of the compounds that can aid in human health. Every single time you research something, there's very few studies that have been done. This is intentional, so doctors can say herbal remedies aren't effective, take this pill instead. There are so many great herbs that aid in multiple things.   For example, I started drinking a tea that contains stinging nettle, because my mountain cedar allergies have been terrible. I take antihistamines regularly, syl having symptoms. 3 days of drinking this sinus soothing formula at night (it contains chamomile too) and my allergies are gone, even though mountain cedar is still incredibly high.   I encourage everyone to look into herbal remedies, even if it's just teas. They're simple, cheap, and can be really effective. Just make sure to research your ingredients to ensure you don't have an allergy or have a condition that's contraindicated. At least give it a shot, if it works, you have a cheap, effective treatment, and if it doesn't, you're out 5 bucks.   TDLR: the medical community purposely ignores research for herbal treatments, so many people think herbs aren't effective and never try them. Medical community makes more money off pills, and we pay more instead of possibly being able to treat ourselves without the cost of dr visits and prescription meds.	1643136457.0	sckszm	/r/conspiracy/comments/sckszm/im_really_big_on_herbal_remedies_and_supplements/	I'm really big on herbal remedies and supplements.

They never fucking use logic all they do is act of out emotional response.. and they refuse to see the proof, call you crazy,dumb.. if ppl wanted to they would see something ain't right A LONG TIME AGO.. but they still are easily manipulated by the media.. idk if mfs are just too brainwashed to use critical thinking.. or are just deeply in denial even tho they know something ain't right. I think Both. they just don't want to change their reality. They prefer to stay in the comfort zone.. i am so fucking tired of trying to prove my point to brainless sheeple. Because the government would NEVER deceieve people! The media would NEVER lie to them!they accept their lies as absolute truth.. just use your fucking brain and don't believe anything without valid proof especially shit on the internet including even the woke/"conspiracy l"community.. i believe those ppl just don't want the truth they don't wanna changes they have weak minds.. the truth is out there i didn't need to read any "conspiracy theories" to realize something ain't right.. i never watched the tv or the media. I've always questioned the authority. But these people are being LIED to and MANIPULATED and bombarded with satanic symbols being lied in plain sight but still.. just think about it, the base of the NWO are the people. The NWO wouldn't work without the people!this is a spiritual test! These people choose the blue pill!just think abt it-in the movie the Matrix Neo was one of the few people that choose the red pill and escaped the Matrix. The Matrix is a great metaphor of the modern world. And u know i am sick of the human race.these ungrateful sheeple spend their life on  LEFT VS RIGHT fighting with each other for choosing a different political party listen NONE of these leaders gives a fuck abt u. NONE. The last real leader was JFK. These ppl are incapable of using their own brain.. i am so fucking tired if alk that shit. Uk the American population was less brainwashed back then. I loved the human race unconditionally and i still love it but I'm starting to fucking lose hope and hate it because the Human Race is so selfish, disgusting, greedy. Just look at the news. prolly some of them even would join the illuminati themselces if they could..  the human race is dumber than i thought. But still fascinating.. I think that mfs don't deserve my patientce n my love they would takr advantage of me anyways..  sometimes I just wanna leave this fucking planet before it will be destroyed I wanna go back home.. I've lost half of my family in one year i lost all the real ones all the people I look up to all the real ones the kindest purest sweetest ones in the industry have been murdered.

odcic	One of the primary censorship tools on Reddit is the autoremoval of comments due to "flagged"/"banned" words/phrases.   You can say whatever you want on reddit, & it will appear as it posts, but it will never be seen publicly.  **COMMENTS FLAGGED FOR bannedwords DO NOT POST**   Yes, YOU personally can see them, NO ONE ELSE CAN. It will still show in thread, & in your post history, but no one else can view the comment.  To verify if your post is active you must log out & view as a lurker, or under an alternate account. This has been the reality for years.  I first noticed it in 2016 amongst political subs who were corralling the flock, & culling those who they couldn't.  An example from awhile back is the sub democrat ic social ism banned the word "change".  Can't say "game change" "change your game" "Obama's slogan was Change We Can... blah blah blah". Any comment with that word is instantly removed (looks like it posts), and will never been seen by the public.  Can't say "censorship" in the new$ sub, another great example. This even extends to names of political figures like "Clinton" in the hstoryprn sub.  *"Clinton" was verified banned over a year ago. Mods claim they screen the name, and then approve posts. I am banned from HP for discovering & disclosing this*  Every sub can set a list of vocabulary that autodeletes your comments so no human ever sees what is said.   **It is a different list for every sub**.  To add to this, expansion of automated censorship tools went into effect after Covid on multiple social media sites under the disguise of "no one can go to the office" & therefore automated tools must be employed.  I am posting this today as a reminder, & because I just discovered another "bannedword" in this very sub, where sometimes it appears to be "for the greater good" & backfires; giving weight to the argument that all censorship is misguided & unhelpful.   Ex : "Rockefeller was a Railroad Tycxxx", "Getty is the heiress to an Oil Tycxxx "I love making kimxxx out of fermented cabbage."  This became an issue from a recent submission where I was required by sub rules to have a submission statement. I used the tycxxx word in my submission, it appeared as it posted, & a few minutes later I checked to see it was autoremoved. I had to waste my time deciphering what within my block of text was being flagged, & eventually narrowed it down realizing there is a word within the word that is getting flagged.  My entire post could have been removed without notice while I thought I had a submission statement, no violations occurred, but the automod's wide net was indiscriminate.  My point here being it's worse than your worse impulse, and don't for one second think this platform is exempt, & not actively attempting to control what we say & hear when they can't remove "troublemakers".  **It took me 15 attempts to post this previously** before determining that "r" with a backslash to indicate a subreddit *is flagged to ban any post with it here in this sub.* Autoremoved = never posted.	1643137410.0	scl66e	/r/conspiracy/comments/scl66e/psa_on_banned_words_reddit_censorship_tools/	PSA on BANNED WORDS & reddit censorship tools
elxnmlmx	Unvaccinated people are being turned down for lung, kidney, and heart transplants then erased off the hospital waiting lists and left to die. Kids are being thrown out of children's hospitals because their parents aren't vaccinated.   People can't get groceries if they aren't vaccinated in some parts of Canada right FUCKING now as we speak (I'm looking at you New Brunswick). The Canadian government is about to pass legislation that unvaccinated people can't get inside the LCBO to buy liquor or cannabis without a fucking vaccine passport QR code.  WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK does being vaccinated have to do with any of the above? Organ transplants have nothing to do with vaccines, surgeries have nothing to do with vaccines, children with cancer have nothing to do with vaccines, groceries have nothing to do with vaccines, alcohol and cannabis have nothing to do with vaccines...  This is becoming fucking cruel and sadistic no matter which side of the fence you're on. It's "we'll take your toys away if you don't play with us". It's a way to "punish the unvaccinated"...It's just to take the piss out of the unvaccinated like Macron said "I really want to piss them off" or Trudeau "I'm angry at them and they're racist". It's LITERALLY pitchforks and torches and has NOTHING to do with any of the things they say they do it for (public health yadda yadda).    It's NOT about science, it's not about health, it's not about enlightenment, it's not about protecting people, it's not even about a virus.  I know it's not about MY HEALTH since I ironically can't enter a gym where I live right now. I'm not sure where my health comes in to this?? Can somebody clear that up in the comments for me how putting people homeless in the streets like dogs is fOr oUr hEaLtH?  I'm waiting and I haven't gotten any healthier...still waiting for the caring hands of Justin Trudeau to caress me (for my own good of course).

xdnfi	 They filled us full of experimental chemicals in Iraq. We were never even allowed to ask what was in the shit they injected us with. Their justifications were built upon lies upon lies, in the same way the mandatory covid clot shots are built upon lies.     "Orange Crush" by REM.   The lyric “I’ve got my spine, I’ve got my orange crush” refers to the assurance that soldiers fighting in Vietnam were given that Agent Orange would have no effect on them.    However, on returning home, the soldiers experienced an array of illnesses ranging from several forms of cancer to their wives suffering miscarriages.    Another effect of Agent Orange was Spina Bifida in the children of soldiers exposed to the chemical.    Therefore, in this line, the soldier says “I’ve got my spine”, believing that he is unaffected by the chemical and that his children won’t be affected either.    The following line, “Collar me, don’t collar me” is a further reference to Spina Bifida.  The deformation of their spine caused by their fathers’ exposure to Agent Orange meant that they were often required to wear a special brace, or “collar”.    This line refers to the uncertainty of deformation and the fact that the father of the deformed child was unsure about the negative effects of the chemical.  Following this, “Over me, not over me” finds the soldier on the battlefield intoning that he hopes the pilot of the aircraft above him to drop the Agent Orange further ahead of him as opposed to on top of him.  The next line, “Coming in fast, over me” refers to the aircraft about to deploy the chemical flying quickly above him.  FUCK the U.S. Government. Fuck all governments and their supporters, who at their core support the idea of master/servant classes & slavery.  Fuck the shills who infest this sub with their misinformation, disgusting behavior and kowtowing weaknesses.

From the beginning of the pandemic to now is your hospital always filled up, difference between vaccinated vs unvaccinated patients, are patients who are on ventilators usually with underlying medical conditions, ages of patients with worse condition.

czxiasq	Even death, one of the most pondered things, is less mysterious. A Christian knows where he is headed, but NO ONE in this world (including the elites), know why we sleep.  Why we subject ourselves every single night for 8 hours to this coma-like, vulnerable state. Someone will comment getting 2 downvotes saying "We sleep to repair our bodies, to process emotions, retain memory, yada yada" but that is not what I mean. WHY? Why were we designed not to do all that awake? Or did we devolve into this state of being where we must slumber to do this? Another person will comment getting 12-53 upvotes (depending on how popular this post is) speaking with authority saying we sleep so that we can connect to our astral bodies/higher selves to keep that link while living in this mortal plane. Maybe. Maybe not. NO ONE KNOWS.  Think of how people in indigenous tribes sleep - close to the ground (out of choice, they are resourceful and crafty enough to make beds) using their hand as a pillow so that both ears are uncovered and can alert them of any danger when they are sleeping. THIS is why sleep has been elevated from a "great mystery of the world" to conspiracy. We don't think of it in our cozy, civilized worlds but again sleep leaves us in this very vulnerable state where something can wreck havoc on you (other humans, wildlife, natural disasters, UFO trying to beam you up).   "Strike when your enemies are sleeping" "Don't let them catch you sleeping"  There is also the other element to a conspiracy and that is something being hidden, whether it's in plain sight or not. The populace will not think about it. NONE of us think of sleep in this way. We take the general narrative that sleep is good for us. Don't get me wrong, it absolutely is but only because of what it does for us. If we were somehow able to harness its benefits though without subjecting ourselves to its coma-like state though, that would be ideal. However, we can't and we don't know why. I don't think ever in human history (even past a million years) that we will ever explain the phenomena of sleep.  I'm going to end with the addressing the irony in all of this is the terminology us conspiracy theorists use:  "The sheep are asleep" - blue pilled  "He is awake" - he knows truth  We will never know the truth about sleep.	1643142866.0	scn7yh	/r/conspiracy/comments/scn7yh/the_biggest_conspiracy_of_our_lives_and_quite/	The biggest conspiracy of our lives, and quite possibly human history, is SLEEP

Very useful, helps to face the fear of living under a totalitarian world.  But I'm not religious, I wish I had the same courage but I don't believe I will have another life or god will make justice, I want to make most of what I can on my short life but it feels hopeless knowing some psychopaths are in charge and it is just a matter of time that we lose more freedoms or are eventually criminalized for not taking the jab.  How do I envy religious people on this situation to be honest.

Forced to marry one of these decedents and continue the blood line and the code of silence. They get a number of attempts then they are discarded. The rich and powerful use this as there own personal endless supply of slaves. There going to have me killed one way or the other soon enough. So I thought I would let you know just how screwed we are. If this even reaches anybody God Bless.	1643144442.0	scnt6n	/r/conspiracy/comments/scnt6n/corruption_top_to_bottom/	Corruption top to bottom

To be eligible for the very large grants the university would have to classify natural remedies and medicines passed down through the generations as quackery and call them alternative medicine. In its place they would promote Rockefellers petroleum based medicines.  With the above being said. How can we trust a single thing being taught in colleges, especially the major universities? I'm not saying anything they teach is wrong or right, but with the knowledge that rich people can essentially purchase a curriculum that suits them and their profits alone how can we trust that information?  Trust your doctor they went to school for this, trust this scientist he went to school for this. I agree they did go to school for that profession they learned the knowledge that they paid to learn.

5xka4f1p	My opinion is heavily influenced by this two :  https://www.wanttoknow.info/secret_societies/hidden_hand_081018  Lawofone.info   First of all, I highly suggest reading them both, since it’s very hard to compress all of this information into a single post, and I don’t want to mislead anyone so take it with a grain of salt.  So this theory I came up with, based on the idea all of our existence is one being , one infinite being that contains all of the possibilities of existence, separates itself into finite forms, meaning everything is ״it”  The rocks , the leaves , the water, us. Everything and everyone comes from the same source of consciousness, the first distortion in existence is infinity becomes finite, but in actuality all of reality is one, there can’t be many-infinities.  Existence is sort of like a school, our mission here is probably to understand who we are and where we came from and what should we should be doing here, in the law of one, it states that there are two ways a soul can go through   Service to self: Ego, power over others, serving your needs over others etc  Service to others : Once you realize existence is one, you realize that by helping others you help yourself, because there’s no difference between the two   Both paths are ok, there’s no right or wrong, both play it’s part in our reality and create this show we are in.  (Fun fact, it states that the thumb is responsible for the growth of the path of service to others, since it allowed us to use tools and weapons, and weapons gave power to individuals over other individuals)  Also there’s something Called “densities” of consciousness  There are 7 densities like 7 octaves in music I’ll only elaborate on the first three since I’m still learning about all of this  *First density is atoms, viruses, minerals plants etc  *second density is animals, or in other words, consciousness that is not yet aware of itself.  *third density is consciousness aware of itself (us) and now have to choose between the paths stated above  (Service to self and service to others)  One of the most important lessons in this density is , the moment contains love.  Love/light are the forces of this universe  Love is the creative force of the source if that makes sense   Back to our current situation, I have to say, that I oddly stumbled upon this information just as this whole situation started two years ago, as if reality was like “here’s what you need to know, get ready”, And since then, all I see around me is this inner battle between choosing, and paradoxically, in the “hidden hand interview” I’ve linked above, it states that the powers that be are aware of all of this, and not only aware , but are sent here to invoke spiritual advancement in us through things that seem so inhuman, think about it, why did I found this information? This world we are in, or the “matrix” is designed for our soul to break through, and deeply realize what id right for it. The harder they push their agenda , the harder I want to take a step back from all of this, and relax in nature lol. This place is like an incubator for our soul, a safe environment to realize and learn. The vax situation is a huge test, and I think it has to do more with the reason you took it other than what it actually does, but who knows. In order to be a balanced entity you have to contain love and wisdom, meaning you can’t close your eyes to the obvious tyranny that’s going on, in the name of safety.  I’m not creating a “us with them situation “ But it as if I can know who has taken the vax by their preferences, most of the people that I know who has taken it are deeply in the matrix, in the materialistic world, they live the system itself. And the people who chose not to take it are people who are more open to ideas, to the human spirit, god, culture , freedom  So what is actually going on here ? Is this separation has to do something with our souls?

atny4qwv	This entire dimension is punishment as an eternal hell for one of the creator of the universe or “god” as many call him, children.   Every thing is energy, including you and everything you are. This comes from the idea of everything and nothing, because there is existence, and non existence.   We are a collective consciousness that was created from one of his children named “Aerial”. He used his consciousness to expand the entire dimension, using his mind as his jail cell, cut off from his siblings and creature comforts. He was named because his energy is that of the wind and water as he is the creators first perfect mistake, chaos. Chaos is a combination of anger and uncertainty.   Ever seen marvel eternals? The “variants” that Arishem couldn’t control even though he created is? It’s a metaphor.   Same with the end of the current Loki seasons, Kang the Conqueror is the creator, Loki, the deystroyer and his protector Sylvie. The truth is everywhere, the energy has just been manipulated.  Many of the stories from different religions are true, many people fail to realize many things didn’t happen to teach you something, it’s a metaphor for energy. Because when you’re creating with energy, it has dynamics and structure of how it works in reality.  Just one example of many, Adam was the first human on earth in one story. Very western, but twisted to manipulate and control en mass (not the point) that’s because Adam was chaos. Pure negative energy. It was Aerials first of his punishment. An entire dimension, built just for him, well how do you balance pure negative energy, eve, of course. Pure positive energy.   After the garden story, (eats 7 seeds total from a pomegranate not an apple, Adam ate 4 seeds, eve ate 3, creating the 7 chakras), except the creator knew they would eat the seeds. That’s the point. So he ripped the garden of Eden away as the first part of punishment.   By the way, think of how when a plant needs food water, temperature, sunlight, etc (energy) to grow, if you had all of those conditions perfect, like you coded it to be biologically perfect in a computer program, was how the garden of Eden was created.   Another example was when “jesus” (another incarnation of Aerial) the famous “why have you forsaken me”, was again part of his punishment.  There’s a ton of other examples in other religion as of the same information, it’s just energy, refined to different creations and manifestations made by the creator. This being I’m talking about is known as the deystroyer, because his eternal goal is to kill the creator, which is why he is being punished.  The creator actually uses up and tosses away some creations when he’s done with them. Wether you go to a hell or a heaven, eventually your energy rots away on your singular timeline, as you’re not eternal as you think you are. That’s why several religions point you to non existence. A state of being, as nothing and everything, is your eternal liberation. There’s 963 dimensions, the 963 is the creators spot, or true heaven. The 4th dimension, the one above ours, is where all souls go when they are judged, based off your karma, desire, and energy overall.   There’s a ton more information, and I could go on for hours, but I figured I might as well post the truth online, because no one would believe me anyways.  It’s just a conspiracy theory though.	1643148912.0	scpf91	/r/conspiracy/comments/scpf91/meta_wanna_hear_a_conspiracy_theory/	[Meta] wanna hear a conspiracy theory?

bc4u5	One source of many: https://logosmedia.com/2013/05/manufacturing-the-deadhead-a-product-of-social-engineering-by-joe-atwill-and-jan-irvin/   I've been wearing my tinfoil hat recently exploring the possibility that the famous Ken Kesey acid tests were actually a construct & extension of MK Ultra.  Ken Kesey as well as Robert Hunter (the Grateful Dead lyricist) were both paid participants in MK Ultra experiments at Stanford University in the 1960's.  Somehow, through getting a night shift job at the same hospital, Kesey was able to procure enough LSD to hand out freely & essentially control distribution in the Bay Area.  The band which played at the first acid tests evolved into the Grateful Dead, a band famous for somehow promulgating the distribution of LSD across America for 50+ years without any trouble from the law.  But tell me, what kind of band has independent lyricists?  Not only was Hunter literally exposed to LSD by the CIA, itself, but their other lyricist, John Perry Barlow, was literally the guy who went to Langley to help bring the CIA into the internet age, by his own admission.  Through WikiLeaks it was disclosed that Grateful Dead band members Bob Weir & Mickey Hart are members of Bohemian Grove where they plausibly have socialized with political leaders and intelligence officials (HW for certain) in absolute privacy until Assange outed them in a data dump.  Was Jerry Garcia a social revolutionary or a military intelligence stooge?  Their music was never as political as other groups of the 60s & 70s.  They preached the same "get high & drop out message as Timothy Leary who also has some questionable connections to the CIA in his history.  This new Scorcese-directed Jerry Garcia biopic that was recently announced seems like a blatant attempt to sanitize the band's history & enshrine them as the secular saints of the patriarchy.  These guys were literally dosing & screwing teenage runaways through at least the 1980's.  Feels like the levy is about to burst on this one.  Charles Manson, Jack Ruby, Ted Kaczinsky, Mark David Chapman have all been named in recent media as plausible victims of MK Ultra manipulation.  Why not the Grateful Dead?

When I search on google all that come up are the typical pro-vax shill articles.  I ask because my father recently got his booster, and the next day became very sick, and the day after myself as well. he has since gotten better but I continue to feel very tired and achy, more so than any cold I have had, and having strange sharp pains in my chest and arms that come on briefly.  I was not concerned at first but this is very uncomfortable and the chest pain especially is becoming scary.  I am 22m and an athlete in good health.

13dobi	There are so many things wrong with this notion, what is going on with the shills flooding this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/scg606/boston_patient_removed_from_heart_transplant_list/), all making the same totalitarian 1 sided arguement:      "   Well Duh, this time trust the godsend priests.. ehmm I meant the experts, you shouldn't be smoking or drinking either if you want an organ transplant, they don't wanna waste organs on someone with a higher chance of dying in the near future.      If you receive an organ transplant, you are on immunosupressants and thus your immune system can't handle covid, but it can handle the vax!(brain fart) So if you don't want to inject the nectar of Gawds!1! into your body, that means your chances of surviving are reduced and thus should be excluded from receiving an organ transplant.   "     So please, sarcasm aside, truly, I ask of you to correct me If I am wrong here reddit or experts, shills not allowed.     * We know that the vaccine doesn't stop you from getting covid, simpler than ever to understand that with the Omicron variant this time of the year... Original Phizer Trial on the Alpha variant, showed 95% efficacy in reducing transmission, but that wasn't the absolute risk reduction, it was the relative risk reduction, so it was laughable from the beginning, to think that these vaccines played a role in reducing transmission. If anything, people were actually asymptomatically spreading the virus this time around with their covid passes, as the virus has pretty much the same viral load on your mouth/nose once you catch it and can easily spread it, without getting severe symptoms to realise you are sick enough to stay home. Bear with me here as I roughly remember the numbers of the top of my head, but absolute risk reduction, was less than 0.1% :  In 3 months 16/20000 vaccinated people cought covid, 160/20000 placeebo/unvaccinated people cought covid from the Phizer Trial. Before the trial was ruined/merged 15 people had died from the vaccinated group, 14 from the unvaccinated group, so it showed no benefit in all-cause-mortality. * The available spike-protein focused vaccines(mRNA or not) provide you exclusively with IGG antibodies(bloodstream antibodies), that are there to reduce the pathogenicity of the virus if it gets into your bloodstream/cells/lower breathing section(lungs). It doesn't provide you with IGA antibodies(nasal/mucosal &  saliva antibodies) that prevent the entrance of the virus in the first place, like natural immunity does. * We now know the efficacy of these vaccines drops to non-existant after 3-4 months and that's for the Alpha variant! It has even less and drops even further for the Delta & Omicron variants still going around. Experts in multiple countries require people to be boosted every \~4 months to have any resemblence of immunity.    * If a person has an organ transplant, they are on immunesupressants, won't they be on them for years, meaning more than 3-4 months, upon which they'll need to receive a booster to have vaccination make a difference? (Don't have the expertise to know exactly how immunosupressants work and answer these genuine questions: Do they stop you from producing new antibodies? Do they reduce the antibodies you make? Do they kill existing antibodies?)     So with those (debatable) facts on the table, to support my side of the arguement. How on earth can anyone rationalize that an organ transplant policy is reasonable/fair/bioethical, if it requires you being vaccinated?     I ask you, If a person is gonna get an organ transplant, regardless of his vaccination status, he's gonna have to isolate like a muthafucka, no matter what, to avoid any disease right? Let alone the easily spread Omicron Variant, that has evaded vaccine immunity?	1643152467.0	scqqvv	/r/conspiracy/comments/scqqvv/is_it_me_or_a_bunch_of_shills_flooded_that_one/	Is it me or a bunch of shills flooded that one post...

But I believe the two projects to be related. Bitcoin in combination of Onion networking however is a great tool for serious Organised Crime to move money about the world and communicate and offer services secretly. It is a fact that organised crime is a not insignificant contributer to the GDP of a lot of western countries and the world economy at large.   This unsavoury fact is acknowledged by the big banks and the US government, but integrating the profits of organises crime into the real economy is of course something the public will not tolerate.   So through the motivation of the big banks to want to handle and profit of the markets generated by serious organised crime which is globalised. And the collusion of the US government and its financial sector, where essentially America is run for their benefit. This project to facilitate this was created. Hence bitcoin and Onion networking became a reality that the global financial sector use to launder money in secret, away from public scrutiny.	1643152618.0	scqsxl	/r/conspiracy/comments/scqsxl/bitcoin_and_onion_networking_was_created_by_the/	Bitcoin and Onion networking was created by the US government to help the global financial sector launder money for organised crime

You can't get anything but the corporate company line of BS from the MSM....even on a local news level. The job of asking tough questions and actually digging into a story and "fact finding" has been handed off to "regular" people outside of the corporate media conglomeration. It's easy to believe this switch has occurred when you think how much easier it is to discredit someone if they are not affiliated with a "trusted" media outlet. For example; look what's happening to Joe Rogan for having guests on his podcast offering information against the vaccine narrative.

9hekknvw	Today I dropped out of Western University in Ontario, Canada. I was a financial economics major, with a minor in criminology.  I have been considering dropping out for many reasons these past few months. I am not happy with higher education in general, and feel it serves little to no value, for me at least.   There are two main reasons for my decision though.   1. The first reason has to do with the quality of the teaching. I literally had 3 professors in the past 2 years that were self proclaimed communists- YES, communists. We all know academia is extremely left leaning, but how in the fuck are these “highly educated” professors commies??? Walking into those classes hurt my brain. I just can’t deal with the extreme left wing bias at school, and the Marxist indoctrination that takes place. I would always get bad grades for expressing my free-market/limited government views, because I would not conform to thinking in their communist ways. Besides the communist stuff, 90% of my profs put in minimal effort at best, I mean, they’re tenured, why would they work?? I think I had 2 or 3 profs that I genuinely thought were really good teachers, and kept their biases out of the classroom.   2. My second reason has to do with the Covid vaccine policy on campus. The university mandated vaccines, and I was/still am unvaxxed. The ONLY exception for unvaxxed students was a religious exemption- which I had to get. With that, you still had to test twice a week to stay on campus. That was a pain because the testing centre isn't even on campus, it's about a 40 minute walk from where my classes are. I was suspended from campus for failing to test twice one week (just a busy week and it completely went over my head). They were constantly on my ass about testing and even had some vaccination indoctrination class I had to attend. At one point they even mandated we all wear lanyards to show who is vaxxed/unvaxxed, luckily they didn't actually follow through with that. They made my life as difficult as possible for not complying, just like our wonderful government.   Anyways, I had it, I'm fed up with this, and I can't do it anymore. The plan is to do real estate now, and continue with my business. I was fired from my job October 31 due to mandates, and I have realize I'm kind of on my own. I'm not going to ever rely on anyone for a paycheque again. I have my business that I will continue to grow, and plan on buying my first investment property within the next few weeks. Higher education is a disease.

p0r1zow	I have heard and read many theories about what the goal of all this is. Mostly ln this great sub. Since i personally think everything is about money, economics and power, the theorie that made the most sense to me was, that the point is to keep control after the biggest economic crash the world has ever seen. Either social control through a social score or economic control through a centralized global new monetary system. I have studied economics in university and so far most lf the macroeconomic models might as well be thrown out of the window. A friend and i speculated, using the economic growth and dept cycle model, that the stock market and economy should be crashing since 2017. It hasnt. While that might sound like a good thing, it is not. It creates a bubble. And all the tools used to fight a recession are out of place. You cant print any more, you cant lower interest any more, you cant go into debt and subsidize businesses any more than you already are. So a new solution is required. When i was in uni a couple of years ago there were no other solutions taught.  On this sub i have read a theory, that that is the point of all this. To me, it seems plausible. What do you think? Everything is in a bubble and its gonna pop eventually. Whats going to happen next? Chaos, death and despair.  Now, at this very moment we are seeing some "coincidences", that are quite scary. The stock market is crashing. So far it has been doing well, miraculously, for no realistic reason. At the same time we see massive protest and something of a turning tide regarding the pandemic. All of a sudden, some countries are opening up, the rethoric seems to be changing and people are waking up and protesting.  The question is, wether this is good or bad. I personally am quite pessimistic anf think this is a false hope. It stand to see wether the coup of national sovereighnty for global goverment is malevolent and used for pop cobtrol etc  or it is actually the only solution to the economic crises we are facing.  I think power generates power; and power always centralizes and just like the top 1% stayed the top 1%(mostly) after the economic revolution and abolishment of the feudal system, it is not going to be any different this time.	1643156718.0	scsb3i	/r/conspiracy/comments/scsb3i/this_might_be_the_endgame/	This might be the endgame

qim598c	I hope this doesn't come off as a pretentious post, but having a thorough discussion regarding what is at stake for us as humans and how we could stand in the face of the imminent global tyranny is a necessity that we shouldn't overlook.  **The powers that be** were/are very successful in locking us in an endless cycle of economic and social stress so we couldn't even think about the possibility of breaking out of it.  We still have the choice to leave aside our religious and political differences and focus for once on what's ahead in the near future if we keep ignoring the damning signs.  Imagine what would happen if we really take our resentment and outrage of what's going on to the next level, from the individualistic phase to the organized action phase.  We must take action, no matter how much impact we want to create, even if it seem to some of us that this action is weak or it does not change anything, however, there is a hope to make a step toward a global **decentralized** movement so it would be hard, if not impossible, to suppress it.  Should we dedicate another sub to these kinds of discussions? or we go on this one? If so, it would be great if the mods pin this post.

73t7sw1u	So the convoy in Canada is making waves. I work at a deli in a grocery store and today we had less than half our stock in the counter and it SHOCKED our customers. But what amazed me was the amount of people piping up with “well it’s crazy but I support the truckers” and i vehemently agreed. Imagine people getting mad that their favourite kind of ham isn’t in stock while simultaneously thinking the truckers who ship it should lose their jobs because they don’t want to take an experimental injection—or because they simply drew their line at bodily autonomy. There’s still some insanity but the amount of times I heard “this is just getting nuts” or “were just done with this now” made me smile. We have a lot of old customers and a lot of liberal customers but we also have a ton of blue collar conservatives and like firemen police, soldiers (everyone comes for my sandwiches this is really just a commercial for my deli) but the general vibe was a complete switch where I saw people speak up proudly against the mandates (in Ontario Canada mind you) and FINALLY I saw little totalitarian losers hold their tongue because for once they felt like the minority opinion and none of those soyboys will actually mouth off to a real man in the real world... i won’t get my hopes up, but at the same time we need to grab onto this momentum and let it ride. We may not get another chance.	1643158539.0	scsydu	/r/conspiracy/comments/scsydu/a_glimmer_of_sanity_emerges_from_its_long/	A glimmer of sanity emerges from its long hibernation in Ontario Canada

4nb0lvia	As I [posted yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/sbw7y5/hypothesis_the_confused_insanity_of_the_last_45/), I think Bush Sr's death stirred up a few pots in the halls of American power.   In the Trump/Clinton election, Bush publicly stated that he voted for Clinton, and that he wasn't a fan of Trump. Which makes sense, since Trump was an 'outsider'. He's no stranger to power and influence, but he's definitely not 'in the club' in Washington. Trump wanted the Republican party to govern more in the traditional Republican capitalist way with strong individual rights (for capitalists). Bush was a well known advocate of the NWO, which is counter to these American ideals and interest.  I don't really doubt that Bush disliked Hillary. She's an unpredictable vengeful psychopathic Karen that thrives on domination and revenge. But, she was the groomed candidate in the election because she's a strong woman in the public eye. ... But somehow, out of the blue, Trump won 'against all odds'.  Could Trump's victory secretly have been Bush's doings to keep Hillary out of office while secretly giving her (a Democrat) a way of getting Trump out of office? Did the envelope she received at Bush Sr's funeral contain the evidence to impeach Trump?	1643159402.0	sct9fv	/r/conspiracy/comments/sct9fv/hypothesis_trumps_impeachment_was_the_clintons/	Hypothesis: Trump's impeachment was the Clinton's payback to the Republican party for Bill's impeachment, based on on info in her envelope from Bush Sr.'s funeral.

43zunv1h	Some kid in high school [had a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/scjd66/teacher_was_very_angry_to_me_after_he_found_out_i/) earlier about trying to explain his vaccination status to his teacher.  Here is a version of my response - maybe it'll help some of you guys.   At this point, anybody who is pressing you to get the vaccines is not really processing information for themselves.  (Even [Bill Maher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bQ2rctogOs&t=110s) has caught on by now.)  That is a difficult truth to admit, particularly if the person giving you a hard time is a close friend or family member.  It's tempting to hit them with a bunch of links and get them to see what's really going on, but it's not gonna work.  You're just gonna damage the relationship further.    If you have to explain why you're unvaccinated, here's what you have to do.  First, do NOT offer sources or data. Two reasons for that:  1. I can tell you from repeated personal experience that people will not believe you. Even if you take them directly to the CDC website and quote their numbers, they will find a reason to keep believing what they want to believe. 2. If this pandemic has taught me anything, it is that I am totally unqualified to evaluate statistics and scientific evidence. I've gotten egg on my face more that once the past couple of years. Read [Beware The Man Of One Study](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/12/beware-the-man-of-one-study/) for more on that.  That said, you really only need to say a couple of things to get people off your back:  **1) The vaccine does not prevent me from transmitting the disease. Therefore it is no longer a public health concern but a personal medical decision.** (If they don't understand what you mean by that, you can elaborate a bit. If vaccination could stop transmission, then we would have a chance at eradicating the disease, which would create a valid argument for mandatory vaccination. Since people will get the disease regardless, vaccination is a personal choice. The vaccinated are presumably protected and have little to worry about. The unvaccinated have made their choice and are willing to live with the results. End of story.)  **2) You are not personally concerned about getting the disease.**  That's it. That's the argument in a nutshell, and all you have to say. If they keep pressing and say 'you should get it just in case' or whatever, you can add a third argument:  **3) There are no long term studies on the effects of these vaccines, so you would prefer to wait and see.**  Say all that in a polite, firm, and reasonable tone - most people will back off.  Stick to those arguments, keep the conversation as short and simple as possible, and maybe you'll have a chance of preserving a cordial relationship with the True Believers.	1643160486.0	sctn0g	/r/conspiracy/comments/sctn0g/the_only_arguments_you_need/	The Only Arguments You Need

And there's still no indication that Portugal's cases have peaked.  &#x200B;  For in case you've forgotten, Portugal was endlessly gushed on in September for getting something like 98% or 99% of its population 12 and older vaccinated.

cqcj7rg4	I remember helicopters each and every night flying over my house, bright flashes of blue light off in the distance with loud bangs and explosions.  This was at the very first start of US lockdown, the first few days.  I had absolutely no idea what was going on - thought we were in a war or something.  It shaked me so badly that I called my Father, left the city, and went and stayed with him for a few weeks. When I returned, we had about 10 new towers in our area - some directly behind my house, right where I saw all of the 'flashing blue lights in the sky' and heard the explosions.      For those wondering how they were installed, most likely they were installed with the helicopters.  So this leads me to ask - does no one find it extremely freaking weird that these towers were installed during lockdown?  Was the lockdown just to keep people off the streets so they could accomplish the installation?    Additionally, I'd like to share this story to see if anyone else experienced any type of psychosis, or saw anything, during lockdown.  A few days before going to my Father's house, I went into a weird panic-type psychosis where I thought it was the end of the world.  I've never shared this anywhere and I've been very hesitant and afraid to mention it.  But I was sitting in the living room and a giant, bright light began shining outside the window, through  the curtains.  It got closer and closer and brighter and brighter, my heart rate must have jumped to at least 150-160 beats and I felt an agonizing pain in my heart.  I clinched my chest, felt like a heart attack.  the light became so bright, almost like the sun behind the curtains.  I screamed to my wife who ran into the room and I screamed about the light.  She went to open the curtains and I screamed, begging her not to open them.  As she opened the curtains, I saw an extremely bright craft, standard UFO shape.  A doorway opened and two glowing beings stepped outside.  I fell to the ground and thought I was dying.  I screamed at the "beings" to go away and pleaded "JESUS IS MY SAVIOR."  It immediately vanished.  My wife looked at me like I was on meth.  I cried so hard that night because she didn't see what I saw.  And it was all chalked up to esentially be some form of psychotic episode (which I've never once had in my life - never done drugs, not on any medications, nothing).  My Father also ended up leaving the house while I was there, after stating he could see God and that he wanted to follow in his footsteps, that he didn't need to own anything anymore.  He literally left the house and started walking down the street.  He then said he wanted to sleep in a hotel and proceeded to stay there, refusing to leave, for three days.  After a few weeks, everything was normal again.  And neither him, nor I, have had any further weird experiences like this.  And my  Dad recognizes what he did was totally insane and occasionally asks me "what happened to us during that time?"  The heck was that?  Did anyone else experience any weird neurological issues during the very start of all this?  Almost makes me wonder if we were ascending and they knew it, panicked, and installed EMF towers to block our ascension process.  Yeah.  That sounds crazy.

What if all of these solar systems that look like atoms are really just creating more life somehow that's way bigger den we could ever imagine.. What if that's really god.. Or what if we're somehow just living in another sort crazy ginormous creature and we're pretty much it's cells.. And Den u could probably zoom out and it would just keep going and vice versa... So you could zoom in infinitely smaller.. What if we really are our own god's and we really are everything at once..

2h0eub2o	Seriously, first you get wrapped up in the conspiracy for awhile, you find all the facts, your own mind is blown, try to share your knowledge, then home life distracts you, you take a step away , catch up here and there. Suddenly it’s almost over, or people who first fought you start coming around. The news starts reporting similar prior beliefs you had. And then the next “ big thing” is on the horizon. Once again you’ll start they cycle over, not for anyone but yourself because you feel afraid, a desperate need to see/ know “the truth” That’s how I feel my last few years have been like. It’s all settling down. I’ll never really know why it got so crazed or what the truth was behind the conspiracy. They’ll move on, I’ll find another and so on. Exhausting- this life is insane.

8hu4ryjv	In the past two weeks the freedom convoy has gained so much momentum and has really awakened the middle class.   Regular every day truckers have been the catalyst for many Canadians to start speaking up against the tyranny, mandates, and the loss of our civil liberties    And this is just the beginning. You can definitely tell that the Canadian establishment; CBC, liberal government, and our soy boy Trudeau, don’t know what to do.  Nothing like this has ever happened in Canada before. Traditionally, Canadians are very complacent and do as they’re told.   After two years of just following the narrative, My fellow brothers and sisters are starting to wake up.  It’s time to bust out the popcorn and get ready for the show. It’s going to be really interesting…	1643170927.0	scx5nn	/r/conspiracy/comments/scx5nn/the_tide_is_turning_here_in_canada/	The tide is turning here in Canada

17ei5s	    Hello All,  Not a true conspiracy theory, just a math riddle here.   I had someone give me the following math dilemma:  First, I had to divide three related numbers by 3 and also divide those same numbers by four.  Second, I had to describe the significance of the numbers as they relate to Covid.   It was made pretty clear that the relevance of divide by three was more significant than divide by four and that there was some kind of demonic/satanic reference in play as well. (WTF?)  **Part One:**  The numbers were 36081, 3681, 381.  Divided by 3 the answers are: 12,027, 1227, 127  Divided by 4 the answers are: 9020.25, 920.25, 95.25  I found the “symmetry” of the results of dividing by three interesting, not sure if there’s a mathematical term for it. Wondering if the “divide by 4” exercise was simply to highlight the symmetry phenomena in play with “the divide by 3” answers that I have no term for.  My wife took a quick look at it and said it was simply a function of where the zero was with the first number. I played along and moved the zero one place right for the first number (36801) and left the other numbers the same.   What you get in this scenario when dividing by 3 are: 12269, 1227, 127. The “symmetry” is gone, so it is not simply a function of where the zero is placed.   For giggles, new answer set when dividing by 4 = 9200.25, 920.25, 95.25  **Part Two:**  No idea. Too tired to even try to impress the internet, but still curious.  I played with this for roughly two hours and have no idea how this possibly relates to Covid.   I’m no longer in anything math-related and never would have given Stephen Hawking’s dirty socks a run for their money.  What bugs me is that this individual might actually be in a position to know something conspiratorial/meaningful about the virus. I’m not into Gematria, cryptography or the occult, so those possible tie-ins escape me. Using the “phone a friend” option hoping someone sees something obvious and cool mathematically or simply sees the math nerd punchline to a bad joke.	1643171276.0	scx9na	/r/conspiracy/comments/scx9na/math_riddle/	Math Riddle

6cvy1uql	I am sure most of us have heard of the case of DJ Ferguson or at least someone like him. He is a man who has been denied a life saving heart transplant due to his refusal to take the COVID jabs. I am done feeling angry, sad, or helpless and I REFUSE to play by their corrupt rules as I know many here are. So now is the time for decisive action.  Tomorrow morning I am calling my local hospital system. I am going to be asking politely but directly if COVID vaccination is a requirement for transplant eligibility. Should they not be able to tell me over the phone I will ask for an email address to send the question to.  Then I will be asking the person on the phone to take a message for the director of the center. If they do require vaccination for transplant eligibility or do not provide an answer within 48 hours my family, friends, and I will be submitting the form to the Department of Motor Vehicles (which is where we register our status where I live, it's on our driver's licenses here) to remove our names from the organ donor list!!! I will be updating my Last Will and Testament, and informing my wife and other medical proxies of my decision.  And then I will email proof to the medical centers I have done so, as well as to any media either mainstream or alternative that I think will take notice!  If they are going to refuse "aNtI-vAxXeRs" organs then they don't need ours, or the organs of those who support medical freedom!!  This is how we make them pay for their decision in a non-violent and legal manner! We don't contribute to systems they seek to exclude us from!

azyv9imc	  Here's an  Idea that I have been playing around with I hope Isn't true and has me assassinated or some shit °nervous laugh°   So what if Covid,  or perhaps The response of Western nations to covid Is a planned attack on China.  A way for the West to stay the best well everyone else is the rest. I'm not going to try to argue that the covid virus was manufactured or released,  It may as well have been A black Swan that the West took full advantage of  In the form of creating artificial scarcity. But when you look at ports across the United States and Europe  that are backed up, this is artificial.  Excuses range from labour shortages to whatever other bullshit can be concocted. If the problem really needed to be solved they would utilise the army corps of engineers to do what they do best. Logistics. But we don't. We haven't. It's almost like we don't want imports from China making their way to market. It seems like we are tightening a noose around their neck. You have that coupled with the real estate bubble in China that just burst, beginning with evergrand, it's starting to look like the Kingdom built on pillars of sand Is about to topple. The amount of wealth lost in the month after evergrand defaulted is the equivalent of every bitcoin falling from 50,000$ to 0. Then continuing to fall to -300,000$. This loss occurred in china over the course of one month. Their fall is inevitable I believe because of policies put in place by the CCP. Chinese citizens have a hard time to own stocks, bonds and are forbidden from owning crypto so their  investment portfolios as a whole account of about 70% property. About 35% of their economic growth is real estate. This bubble bursting will make the 08 housing crash look like you losing your wallet. I think we have orchestrated this in order to push China into a corner where they feel like they need to do something rash in order to appease their huge population: the invasion of Taiwan. I think we want them to invade Taiwan so we have an excuse to take care of them once and for all. Does anyone really think the US would quietly cede its position as the global hegemon to China?

1cqatald	Let’s say the Canadian trucker protest works, and the Covid restrictions are removed, not just at the boarder, but in totality. What will be the next distraction or cause used to take our freedoms?  Will they even need one?  Before Covid, things moved slowly to the left, almost covertly. During Covid, the world  has seen some of the greatest abuses of power from democratic government in modern history. These have been big obvious moves against our freedoms and the scariest part is how many people are ok with or even supportive of them. Many of these had nothing to do with Covid. Just the blatant abuse of emergency powers.   The only reason we may see an end to the restrictions in Canada, is because the government upset a huge mobile industry. All these other countries out protesting are geographically small, and densely populated. Canadians are few, spread across a massive country. This makes it difficult for us to coordinate and unite.   If we are to be successful in this protest and our causes of the future, we will need to step up our game. They won’t be fooled by the same surprise twice. You better believe they will have a few plans in place for the next time we try this. Maybe they will increase efforts in autonomous trucking, or other shipping methods. Maybe they will try to sneak some prevention methods into new legislation. Point is, we need to do a better job at recognizing these issues early on, and addressing them with a united front.

She has me feel guilty for not taking the vaccine because I chose to do my own research from day one and I knew in my soul that it wasn’t for me. Because of her fear of me, I haven’t hugged my mom in two years. She has been resistant to hearing me out and today she finally conceded.

cgmnhao3	Compelling empirical (and anecdotal) investigations have led to compelling conspiracy theories that most food and drink *could* be laced with things like "chemical suppressants" and "estrogenic compounds" which are especially harmful to males.  Some young males decided to isolate and go without food and drink for days in order to confirm what was "wrong" them. Lo and behold, androgen levels began to stabilize and normalize, skin began to clear up and testicles returned to "normal" size or even increase and "estrogenic expression" disappears, so much so that some observers accused these males of "using drugs" or "being on something" - but in fact, it was the complete opposite: they abstained from all food and drink in order to ascertain whether it was indeed food and drink - or secret compounds therein - which was the culprit. When some wondered why some of these males looked "more masculine" on some days - it was not because they had "taken" anything, but rather that they were starving and had had nothing to eat or drink, thereby providing further visible evidence that food and drink - or secret compounds therein - had interfered with androgen production or even decreased it altogether...  It is no secret that many males (many young males especially) in the Western World - and indeed in some parts of the Third World where they receive "food aid" or whatever - are suffering from issues with androgen levels and endocrine destabilization and food and drink may be the main issue - or "estrogenic compounds" therein.	1643184131.0	sd0tx1	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd0tx1/to_what_extent_do_you_think_most_food_and_drink/	To what extent do you think most food and drink in "the Western World" are riddled with "chemical suppressants" or "estrogenic compounds"?

3a00oufe	Guys, if you think WW3 will come from this, I must disappoint you.  You're naive if you think NATO would risk their necks for Ukraine, and you're equally naive if you think that what the West is doing is right. Does that mean Putin is in the right? Of course not, the only ones who could claim that in any capacity are three Ukrainians.  Think about it for a bit. As NATO, would you ever even dare integrate Ukraine into your alliance while Russian troops are literally already on territory that you consider being Ukrainian? The risk is enormous, if anything ever happens you _have_ to stick to your promise and go to war. At the same time, by making the move in that direction you put pressure on Russia, and that's really all that's happening here. The West are dicks like everyone else, if they see an opportunity to fuck over a geopolitical rival, they'll take it, no matter the cost to the pawn that they sacrifice to achieve it, in this case Ukraine.  The _only_ reason the NATO expansion is even considered is because Ukraine desperately needs it for its own safety, the irony of course being that before 2013 Ukraine was fine. It was when they started to make the move towards Western institutions that Russia got active to prevent that. And what happened that time? The West pussed out and legged it. Do you honestly think that anything else will happen this time? Especially the Europeans know they are not ready for a war, especially not a short and sharp one [with limited objectives](https://youtu.be/nR7XAcArAa0) which is looking to be the most likely scenario.  So what will probably happen if conflict does break out is that Russia will roll Ukraine to achieve their objectives, as Ukraine on its own is too weak, while the West will immediately stark bickering about what to do and thus waste time. In the end, what the big guys, i.e. the US, France and Germany and to a lesser degree the UK and Italy want, goes. There will probably be even harsher sanctions, but they won't change much if anything for the Russian leadership. The reason being that Russia diversified its foreign currency reserves away from the dollar last year (Russia holds 16% USD, the average is 60%), and still has enough trade links open otherwise, along with a decent amount of self sufficiency.  The other factor is that Europe actually _increased_ its dependency on Russian gas, which means that any sort of sanctions in really crucial sectors will come to bite them back. And even if the sanctions are somewhat hard, Putin can afford not to care about his population too much as long as they don't actively try to depose him, the West can't. Do you seriously think our societies would be up for a war over some petty reason like Ukraine when they don't even want to die for their own country in a state of crisis or war? All they care about is if they morally look good, and by making it look like we are protecting Ukraine even tho that's just propaganda bs that box is checked and there is no need to do anything else except go on Twitter and complain about Putin like he ever cared.  So in summary, war won't come out of this, and the only one who loses will once again be Ukraine, because that's just the reality of life on the international stage if you're weak.	1643188037.0	sd1r8k	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd1r8k/an_honest_take_on_ukraine_and_ww3/	An honest take on Ukraine and "WW3"
l0cmhdo	Hey everybody,  So I’ve just been talking about this with friends yesterday and it seems really mind boggling to all of us.   Those “totally not Russian” troops who wave Russian flags, speak Russian, brandish Russian passports and Russian weapons have been occupying regions in the east of the country for eight years now. EIGHT.  Barely a beep from western media since 2014.   During this time I have periodically received warnings from the US embassy about “increased movement” of military activity on the borders with Ukraine. Even during the past six months.  No one here was talking about it until about a week ago…but the USA news has been blasting nonstop about it for over a month now. No one has been talking about it, except my american friends and family who are all writing and calling in a panic, wondering what I’m going to do.   What’s more, I have a few friends (two ukrainian, one american) who just spent two and half months in the USA.—from early November until January. They said that the news in the US was constantly talking about Russia and Ukraine the *entire* time they were there. They were very confused…because no one here was talking about it at all until—as i said before—about a week ago.  It’s bizarre, frankly speaking. The USA media is stirring up a frenzy akin to killer bees, razor blades in candy, and shark attacks…and yet here life continues on exactly as usual. I’ll say it again: I’ve heard ten times the fuss from Americans at home than anyone here about this pending ‘invasion’ (which has been ‘pending’ for almost a decade now).  My personal theory is that there are a couple factors at play:   A) The COVID narrative has worn out, and now that the panic has subsided people are going to come face to face with massive inflation and economic hardship caused solely by the incompetence, negligence, and malice of their own government.  B) There needs to be a shift of the blame from the government towards some evil enemy: Russia.  C) A war may serve two functions: it could simultaneously serve as an excuse for economic hardship while also being a means to ‘stimulate’ the economy and pull out of that same hardship (if you’re worried about official narratives making sense, then you haven’t been paying attention for the past six years).   Tl;dr: Nothing has changed here in Ukraine; it’s YOUR media that is kicking up the massive fuss, and they’ll use anything they can to distract the masses.   P.S. Americans are so heavily propagandized that they don’t even realize it. I was having a conversation with an ex-KGB officer (upper-level in Ukraine during his career). “Americans are children” was what he had learned from his time in the special services. Having lived outside of the US for the last fifteen years minus one, I wholeheartedly agree with this observation.	1643189439.0	sd22pm	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd22pm/i_live_in_ukraine_we_have_been_living_under_the/	I live in Ukraine.

20wk0f8l	https://www.solonin.org/en   First time poster, long time truther. Forgive me if I haven’t done this right, I’m not the worlds best computer user. This, I hope will be a long term thread once you guys have had a chance to read some of the stuff free m Mark Solonin’s website, which I hope I have posted above^^. And from it I hope to hear some of your genuine thoughts on the subjects. Maybe some new threads will be generated to discuss the different topics of Marks Essays on the start of Operation Barbarossa, or the Finnish Campaigns from the Soviet perspective.   I post it here because the German “first strike” before the Soviets come under attack is a genuine conspiracy in that we have been fed this since it happened, from our own side and the Soviet side.   A little about Marc Solonin, he is/was an aeronautical engineer who designed MIGs for the USSR post WW2, and has access to the Soviet records regarding WW2 to write his essays. They are not so much stories as much as lists of details, what the Soviets actually had as opposed to what they reported they had. He provides data on the Soviet ground and Air forces as they were on the 22nd June 1942 and for the weeks after. The information he can provide is astounding, and changed my whole way of thinking about what really happened, and at what point the Germans actually lost the war (Dec 1941) He also has Essays on the Soviet/Finnish wars.   Thank you for reading this, and I look forward to some good discussion on the topic of whether it was German aggression, or that if the Germans didn’t attack, Russia would have very soon after.	1643191345.0	sd2jap	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd2jap/something_different_the_preemotive_strike_june_22/	Something different- the pre-emotive strike, June 22 1941
ckatgc2q	The Wall Street Bombing of 1920 was a false flag operation by the United States government/business elites to incapacitate the growing anarchist and labor movement.    Here are my main reasons for this thought, I hope you find it convincing:   #1. Level of sophistication  The bomb planted outside the headquarters of J.P. Morgan was incredibly sophisticated for its time, made up of 45kg of dynamite with 230kg of heavy cast iron weights detonated with a timer. Comparatively, the previous bombs used by anarchists in the USA had barely used 11kg of dynamite, and used far less capable detonation systems. Not only does this point to someone capable and experienced in bomb-making it also points to a group with access to such a degree of expensive materiel, notably the type of sash-weights used which also would have required the assistance of multiple conspirators. Anarchists and the labor movement had neither the experience nor the funds required to make such a sophisticated bomb.   #2 The perpetrator   The suspect many suggest is Mario Buda. Mario Buda hailed from the Romagna region of Italy and had supposedly worked with and been a friend of Sacco and Vanzetti (a pair of Italian anarchists falsely put to death for a robbery earlier). The theory is that he travels to the United States from Mexico with this pair and works with them, spreading propaganda and doing as anarchists do. Let’s fast forward.   The murder case of Sacco and Vanzetti (not yet suspects at the time) tied Buda into its story - the prosecution believed him to be the leader of two robberies prior. Police met and spoke with Buda in late April 1920. Less than a month following Sacco and Vanzetti were arrested just having met Buda at a garage where his car was being repaired. They had not previously been suspects in the investigation.   Fast forward to 1933 where Buda is now back in Italy, and documentedly working with the Italian secret police (fascists if you might remember) specifically the OVRA, and infiltrating communist and anarchist meetings for them. He does so badly in fact that he is publicly branded a traitor and working for the government.   Jumping back to 1920, this is the man supposed to have been so motivated by the indictment of his friends that he singlehandedly bombs Wall Street.    #3 The Location  The wagon holding said bomb was perfectly positioned in order to cause fairly superficial and non-structural damage. Likewise, the number of innocent people killed and shocking lack of anyone who could be called a ‘capitalist’ being dead was very untypical of the anarchist bombings of their time. The NYSE was even open for business the next day, with crews cleaning the area overnight, destroying any physical evidence left after the bombing.   #4 The Flyers  Simply reading ‘Remember, we will not tolerate any longer. Free the political prisoners, or it will be sure death for all of you’ At the bottom was ‘American Anarchist Fighters.’   Let us look at the pink flyers found with the previous bombs of 1919, titled ‘Plain Words’.  “War, Class war, and you were the first to wage it under the cover of the powerful institutions you call order, in the darkness of your laws. There will have to be bloodshed; we will not dodge; there will have to be murder: we will kill, because it is necessary; there will have to be destruction; we will destroy to rid the world of your tyrannical institutions”   Hardly the same style or linguistic capability right?   It should be noted too the ‘AAF’ denoted neither an already existing organization nor one that would ever publicly exist, nor one that had ever or would ever take credit for a piece of violence again.    #5 The Reaction  The precursor to the FBI, the BOI, was expanded including the anew GID, headed by J Edgar Hoover. The NYPD formed a new secret police to monitor “radical elements” in the city. Thousands were interrogated, many radicals, communists or anarchists or labor activists or otherwise, were arrested. The First Red Scare was now in full effect and ‘criminal syndicalism’ laws were eme acted that restricted free speech and provoked aggressive police investigation of anyone even remotely radical. Public support for unionists took a hit as well.	1643191446.0	sd2kb0	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd2kb0/the_wall_street_bombing_of_1920_was_a_false_flag/	The Wall Street Bombing of 1920 was a false flag operation by the United States government/business elites to incapacitate the growing anarchist and labor movement.

Or when famous people take photos with their eye covered.    Well... in Islam there is an entity called Dajjal.   Now Dajjal is what you’d call an anti christ.   It is said he has one eye. That he can do anything and everything, except fix his damaged eye.    Guess which eye is the damaged one? The right one. (At least that’s what I’ve been told growing up and assuming because the celebs only have their right eye always covered)   It also says that Dajjal will make his home in Israel.    I’m not very good at research. I’m more of a creative person than logical.   I think someone should look into it and compare the findings to what’s happening now in the world.	1643195177.0	sd3i7x	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd3i7x/someone_here_should_look_into_dajjal/	Someone here should look into Dajjal

1l516inq	Cyber Polygon is a simulation that the WEF ran where they wargamed scenarios of hackers cyber attacking critical infrastructure and shutting down the internet, energy infrastructure, and financial infrastructure.   https://www.weforum.org/projects/cyber-polygon  There has been a lot of preprogramming to associate hackers with Russia. Lately there have been a lot of articles hypothesizing the ‘Russian hackers’ will attack the power grid and internet infrastructure, which is basically the same as the scenarios in Cyber Polygon.   https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-01-26/what-happens-when-russian-hackers-cyberattack-the-u-s-electric-power-grid  More preprogramming includes the Colonial Pipeline cyberattack   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline_ransomware_attack  This will be the perfect opportunity for the globalists to ‘Build Back Better’.   When the internet is shutdown they can scrub all the information they don’t won’t you to have and leave.   When the energy is shutdown they can start a rationing system and implement carbon taxes as well as a carbon score that rewards people for using less energy.  And lastly while the financial system is shutdown they can reset the failing system, replace the worthless US Dollar with a central bank digital currency and probably some type of UBI. Not to mention that the price of commodities and especially oil/natural gas would skyrocket, meaning that you probably won’t be able to afford anything yourself and you will be a slave to the state for sustenance. Don’t be surprised if certain vaccinations are required to get this UBI.   And voila, that is approximately how the Great Reset will go down. You will have nothing but Klaus Schwab and his buddies will have everything.   Enjoy however long we have left of the old way of life, however corrupt it may be. Once the reset happens, things will get very real very quickly. Use this time to get ready. Get the things that you would get if you knew you couldn’t purchase anything and the lights were about to go out, because that is very likely the scenario we will be facing sometime soon.	1643195511.0	sd3l9h	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd3l9h/the_conflict_with_russia_will_be_used_as_a_cover/	The conflict with Russia will be used as a cover for Cyber Polygon, the World Economic Forum’s plan to shut down the power, the internet, and the financial system

8ij70f3w	TL;DR: 26 year old healthy male working in the NHS (National Health Service) being forced to get the vaccine. I advocate for freedom of choice so find it sad that I will most likely lose my job in a week. Nothing I can do about it and no amount of convincing will make me want to get it.    As you guys are aware , there is a vaccine mandate in place here in the UK which states that all health care workers must be double jabbed by the first of April to continue working on the front lines.  I’ve been trying to not let it get to me but I’m feeling very discriminated against by my peers and management. Everyone is so nice to me and I’m generally a likeable person until the conversation around vaccines is brought up . Soon after no one will come 6ft near me.  I’m a 26 year old (M) with no underlying health conditions and I caught covid in August 2020 (felt shitty for a day) . A recent antibody test showed that I still have the antibodies and I haven’t caught it since (as opposed to my triple jabbed co-workers who are off sick constantly). I work as a mental health link worker and have graduated in psychology. This job gave me the opportunity to do some amazing work with patients who are at rock bottom and it was a super rewarding role.  I just received an email asking me to book in for my first dose before Feb 3rd and no one has made an effort to speak to me about redeployment or anything. Whenever they realise I’m not some tinfoil nutter the cognitive dissonance around me becomes overwhelming and people just don’t want to associate any negative effects with the vaccine and automatically blame COVID as the culprit. My little brother place semi-professional football and I’ve seen first hand the impact it has had on a few of the youngsters (myocarditis?)   Anyways I have a couple of days left until they decide what to do. I just wanted to get my thoughts out of my head and out there. If they fold and “pause” the mandate as rumoured it’s still a loss as many would have been pressured into getting the jab.   I have a baby in the way and if it wasn’t for that I’d be a lot more carefree and pick up odd jobs until I find something stable. But I can’t out my wife (who is super supportive and against the jab too) and unborn child though such hardships and need to get my shit in place ASAP.  3 years of studying at university all for what? A bunch of clowns running the country telling is what is right and all based off bullshit. The sad part is most people got it so they could go out to eat and get drunk or go on holiday, kinda ridiculous.  What makes it worse is I work in a place where I’m the ONLY ONE not vaccinated. Not even one person I know is in my shoes so I couldn’t find solace in other people . I know some trusts they have a few in the same boat so have been able to support and uplift each other.  My parents and vaccinated , as are most my family yet they understand freedom of choice but I wonder how long that will last once i lose my job.  Anyways which you all the best.	1643196334.0	sd3t39	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd3t39/about_to_lose_my_job_in_the_nhs/	About to lose my job in the NHS

dd2h5iea	First and foremost, you have to know that I’m feeling absolutely defeated as I’m writing this. It feels like I am fighting a pointless war that no matter how it ends – it will not satisfy me because it will NEVER be like it was before.  Also, English is not my first language, so as long as you can understand what I’m saying – please be nice!  Vaccines are becoming mandatory in Austria around February/May, whoever doesn’t comply will automatically be fined. Their system won’t be running until April though – so police will be checking citizens outside and see if they are vaccinated.   I do have plenty of reasons for why I don’t want to get the jab, but I do not judge anybody who gets it. Still I get referred to as an right-wing extremist and people treat me like I am the reason why all of this is happening right now.  I’ve never had The Rona, wear my mask whenever I have to and have always kept my distance to other people. I have quickly learned that if you don’t do what the higher-ups say, even your neighbours will call the police on you and the cashier will refuse to sell you underwear, because it apparently isn’t necessary.  Unvaccinated have been under lockdown here for about three months, all we can do here is buy groceries and other basic necessities. And by basic, I mean basic. Stuff like clothing stores, hardware stores etc. refuse you service if you can’t prove you are either vaccinated or have had The Rona in the past 6 months.   The lockdown ends on Monday, but we’re still refused service almost everywhere. At least I can now visit my friends without the fear of getting fined?  Everybody seems to be brainwashed – globally. If you dare to say anything bad about how this whole situation seems a liiiiiittle bit sketchy on social media, people dogpile in the comments.   Politics are fucked up, too. Not trying to get too specific, but after (I think) 3 differents chancellors in a few months, we finally scored one that wants to turn this country into his own twisted little idea of a police controlled state.  Beautiful isn’t it?   The media is corrupted, too. If you dare to go to one of the many anti-vaccine and anti-goverment demonstrations, because your whole existence and mental health is threatened by those constant on and off lockdowns the past 2 years,  you get portrayed as aggressive and national socialist. This is all you see on social media, I’m having a hard time finding news sources that aren’t as corrupt as the goverment.   I can kind of understand why people get brainwashed into this – they WANT to be angry at somebody and second-guessing is quite scary.   I don’t know how this all will go down, but it definitely isn’t going to end well. There is no way back – look at history. It has happened before and while it won’t be completely the same this time, you have the exact same political and social conflicts going on.   It repeats and I am afraid of who will win.	1643198493.0	sd4e5d	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd4e5d/things_are_getting_real_bad_over_here_in_austria/	Things are getting REAL BAD over here in Austria

bfsdrshn	So the new threat is population collapse, not explosion, because an ageing population will require a significant amount of resources from working-age people to sustain the elderly from retirement age ‘till death.  Population collapse is inevitable. It’s happening in all developed countries. Italy’s birth rate is 1.27 births per woman. This will lead to half the population of working age people within 1-2 generations. They cannot sustain the elderly with half the workforce as previous generations. The economy will collapse.  There are two solutions to population collapse: 1) make people have more children or 2) get rid of people past retirement age  Solution 1 is undesirable, because we do want population to decline, just not so rapidly that civilisation collapses. And you can’t really force people to have children.  Solution 2 however is an option, and we have seen this in play partially with the frequent extensions to retirement age. But perhaps this isn’t enough. With advances in medicine people are often living in excess of 30 years past being fit to work. Perhaps the end goal of this all is to reduce this from 30 years to 20, 15 or 10 years. I.e. ensure people die earlier.  This fits the events we have seen take place:  - a synthetic coronavirus is ‘leaked’ from a lab that just so happens to be absolutely fine for children but deadly to the elderly (this is very uncommon in viruses) - treatments for this are systematically suppressed which allow for millions to die - a vaccine is rolled out by governments worldwide in lockstep, using propaganda and coercion to get their people to take it - only developed countries had a large uptake, which is acceptable as only developed countries will experience population collapse   Perhaps both covid and the vaccine are tools in ensuring people die 5-15 years younger than is currently normal. Perhaps we will see a huge decrease in life expectancy over the coming years.  I don’t know about you all, but this explanation *feels* right. Maybe it’s not quite the whole picture but this just fits together well.	1643201481.0	sd59c3	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd59c3/perhaps_their_end_goal_is_to_safely_navigate/	Perhaps their end goal is to safely navigate population collapse

It's natural for corporations to try to expand their power and influence, otherwise they just disappear when the others do it, that's why the world is led by the mad.  But isn't it a perfect way to increase the capabilities of AI to 'understand' humans and be more accurate in what ever prediction they are requested. I doubt they would use it a mega villain way, they probably will use it for studying with their software engineers. We are more suggestible than we imagine, today we laugh when we receive suspiciously specific Ads and how obvious it is.

Two more people in our friend group are showing symptoms, but haven't been tested yet and haven't been pressed for quarantine by the health director of the school.

ifgd00	Given the litany of posts surrounding alternative hygiene practices in regards to hair care and other hygienic practices  in this sub, I thought I'd make a post regarding the sad state of dental health. Many of you, myself included, have had many dreaded visits to the dentist. I myself have had one problem after another. When I was young my teeth were incredibly crooked teeth, I had a severe overbite, and many cavities. This led to three years of braces along with rubber bands to correct my overbite. When I was in my early 20's my wisdom teeth began growing in and I was told they would have to be removed (which I thankfully did not), and several of my back teeth were showing tooth decay that is typically only found in adults much older than myself. I will outlay below the problems that caused these as well as the solutions that fixed almost all my dental problems and why dentists will never advise these practices.  # Brief History of Our Teeth  Have you ever wondered why humans need so much dental care? I mean after all, no other wild animal in the world requires a dentist. Even when we look at every variation of ape, they all have perfectly aligned teeth and almost never have cavities of any sort. This extends to our ancestors as well. Every skull that has been discovered of early Homo Sapiens, Neanderthals, and Denisovans all had perfectly aligned teeth along with near zero cavities.   Link: [https://stanfordpress.typepad.com/blog/2018/05/why-cavemen-needed-no-braces.html](https://stanfordpress.typepad.com/blog/2018/05/why-cavemen-needed-no-braces.html)  # Current Teeth  It wasn't until roughly several hundred years ago that our diets and lifestyles changed enough so that we all of the sudden started seeing a large number of skulls with crooked teeth, jaw deformities, excessive crowding of teeth, early tooth decay, etc. And the problem is getting progressively worse. In the US today, roughly 90% of people have at least one cavity. Most of that 90% have multiple cavities.  Link: [https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/data-statistics/dental-caries/adults](https://www.nidcr.nih.gov/research/data-statistics/dental-caries/adults)  Furthermore, 9 in 10 people have at least slightly crooked or maloccluded teeth. Three quarters of us don't even have enough room for our wisdom teeth. Which especially begs the question, why would we grow wisdom teeth if our mouths don't have room for them? And why is the amount of wisdom teeth people have declining?   &#x200B;  https://preview.redd.it/lkyhy48nu0e81.png?width=1732&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ecfa2e5eae57f849199a7f776a428fd76eedb05  Link: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-have-so-many-problems-with-our-teeth/#:\~:text=Missing%20Stress,not%20fit%20in%20our%20jaws](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-we-have-so-many-problems-with-our-teeth/#:~:text=Missing%20Stress,not%20fit%20in%20our%20jaws)  # Solution to these Problems  The reason why all these problems are occurring is drastic and unhealthy changes to our diet and lifestyle. I'm not advocating that people become hunter gatherers again but rather that we adopt some of the practices they had so as to avoid and fix these problems. What I am outlining below was created by a man named John Mew and involves a science known as orthotropics or "mewing". I should state that these methods work best for children but will work for people of any age as your muscles and bones never stop changing and growing.  **Chew!** This is the biggest and most powerful solution. Early humans would often chew for several hours a day on very hard foods. Modern humans usually eat soft processed foods in a 1-2 hour period in a given day. What I do to help with this is chew large amounts of mastic or falim gum. There are other options as well but be sure to only chew sugar free gum for long periods of time. This serves multiple purposes, it widens your jaw and grows your masseter muscle (jaw muscle), it also causes your mouth to produce large amounts of saliva which significantly reduces plaque in your mouth, it has also been shown to "harden" the enamel and make it tougher against abrasive materials due to the mineralization of your teeth from mastic or falim gum. As your lower jaw widens this will allow more room for your wisdom teeth to grow in AND slowly form your jaw so it is no longer deformed, AND will help align your lower teeth.   **Tongue Posture!** The natural position of your tongue is resting on your entire tongue on your upper palate just behind your front teeth. This is a little tricky as for most people this is no longer natural to them. You should look up how to properly do this and be sure that your whole tongue is resting on the upper palate and also be sure your tongue is not jutting into your front teeth. It's not easy at first and will tire your tongue but if you can force yourself to do it, it will become second nature after a few days and you'll even be doing it in your sleep. Over time this positioning will straighten out your front teeth and force them outwards. It will also push your maxilla up which has a number of benefits including raised cheek bones. Another important point that should be added in that I forgot about is proper body posture in general. Try to sit and stand straight with an aligned spine at all times.  **Throw Away Your Toothpaste!** This tip I should state is not related to John Mew or Mewing at all but in my opinion is still important. Extended use of fluoridated toothpaste has been shown to cause early tooth decay and the weakening of enamel. So why is it recommended? Because it is a very quick fix to get rid of plaque, the problem is it also slowly ruins your teeth in the process. And this is before we get into the LARGE number of health risks associated with fluoride in general. Instead,  I use a combination of bentonite clay and egg shells for my teeth which I only use once every 3 days or so. Outside of that I just use my brush twice a day and floss as well.  # Why are these Solutions Not Common Practice?  The short answer is because Dental Health is a 142 billion dollar industry in the US and is growing every year. Imagine if within a few years the amount of people with cavities and crooked teeth declined 50%? For a dentist/orthodontist that'd be an absolute nightmare. Furthermore, why would any for profit healthcare institution ever study these solutions? There is zero upside and a LOT of downside to doing so. There have been multiple studies, notably in South Korea, showing proper tongue posture can correct crooked teeth. Yet very few dentists in the western world will EVER recommend it. Instead they'd rather keep you sick and struggling so they can make enormous sums of money trying to fix easily preventable conditions. You shouldn't buy into this sham and should focus on the solutions proposed above. They are entirely free and will greatly limit your need to visit a dentist.  As I mentioned earlier, I am someone who has had a LOT of dental issues throughout my life. Yet, the past few months, my dental health has completely changed. Within a year my overbite (which had returned after braces) was greatly reduced, my jaw was far more pronounced, my teeth are much less crowded, I have had zero cavities since, and on top of that my teeth are much whiter than they were prior.	1643202095.0	sd5h3n	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd5h3n/modern_dentistry_is_ruining_our_dental_health/	Modern Dentistry is Ruining Our Dental Health

e8riwtqr	According to my fake news. Canadian power grid could also be at risk this year. Another developing fake news is the government will accept all things the convoy is protesting for before the convoy gets there. the convoy will celebrate victory and be told to turn around and further movement towards the parliament might be considered an attack. Scenario 2 would be the convoy making it to the parliament and there possibly being a small attack just like the one on the capitol. Though that might be unlikely but it is important to remember that the core of this protest isbased on mandates for coming into Canada from the USA. Canadians are one of the best protesters around the world but there will be Americans there that might cause a bit of ruckus. All in all we hope for the safety of all Canadians.

3vf5x46q	Everyone with kids would like to see them do I bit better at least and anyone who's enjoyed any success would like their children to be successful too. we also like to instil in them the sort of morals and values we uphold or, at the very least, the values and morals we'd like THEM to have.   These families that control the banks have been doing what they do for a Very Long, LONG TIME and there is no force on Earth that could get them to do things any differently. Ever.  Seems to me that if these motherfuckers profit NO MATTER WHAT anyone spends on anything ANYWHERE and so fucking much that it drives the entire World Economy... Look at it like the weather. Look outside - that's about what you see going on of the "Economy". But the Earth is HUGE and there is A LOT of weather, right? And some weather is fucking CRAZY with like Monsoons and Hurricanes and Typhoons and Tornados and shit. Like you got different segments of the Economy pushing bucks around like Trade Winds, see? So to get the bucks all over the world to flow "correctly" requires some sort of influence or control (and implies a fault in their system but nevermind that part lol) and as long as they control the flow of money, they control the Economic Weather so to speak.  Let me be perfectly clear: Whenever there has been war, they profited. Whenever there has been a boon, they profited. Whenever there has been a recession, they profited. Whenever anyone bought anything, they profited. Whenever anyone sold anything, they profited. WHENEVER ANYONE IS BORN OR DIES, THEY PROFIT. NO MATTER WHAT, THEY PROFIT. THEY PROFIT.

I picked up:  52 Prepper Projects by David Nash: (8/10) A new project each week. with fun projects.   The Prepper's Cookbook by Tess Pennington: (9/10) Has great recipes that work with most the types of food preppers stock pile.   Teach Like A Prepper by Donald Pierce: (9/10) Shows teachers how to be preppers in their classrooms and the rest of the school.   This last book, Teach Like A Prepper, turned out to be better than I thought. I work in education and it really ave me some great ideas on how to implement some of my prepper skills and practices into the classroom that I didn't think about before. It even had some humor worked into it. I think every teacher should have a copy of the book. It even covers emergency procedures.

5yhznu7x	Dr. Stanley Plotkin is considered one of the “discoverers” of the Rubella vaccine, and a vaccine consultant to BigPharma. He is also a member of the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology, was an Adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Senior Advisor, Global Virus Network, Scientific advisor (and co-founder) of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), etc. Basically, he is a tried and true member of the Cult.  As such, he is of course tied into the Fauci Murder Network and the “AIDS” Program which has blown through hundreds of billions of dollars as stolen from We the People via taxation for a “vaccine” (and money laundering to BigPharma and Fauci’s offshore accounts), and yet over four decades later there is not even a scintilla of progress, but there have been fantastical levels of deaths via ineffective yet deadly drugs like AZT.

The US health agency will now also stop referring to these people as “fully vaccinated,” but instead will call them people who are “up to date” with their vaccinations.  &#x200B;  Walensky said: “What we are really working to do is pivot our language so that everyone is as up to date with their COVID-19 vaccines as they personally could be, should be based on when they got their last vaccine.  &#x200B;  “So, importantly right now we are pivoting our language, we really want to make sure people are up to date.”  &#x200B;  She added: “That means if you recently got your second dose, you’re not eligible for a booster. You’re up to date. If you are eligible for a booster and you haven’t gotten it, you’re not up to date and you need to get your booster in order to be up to date.”"  Read more [here](https://dailyexpose.uk/2022/01/26/cdc-announces-changes-to-the-definition-of-fully-vaccinated/).   &#x200B;  Comply and YOU Die.  &#x200B;  [https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/](https://2ndsmartestguyintheworld.substack.com/)	1643206131.0	sd6sos	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd6sos/cdc_announces_changes_to_the_definition_of_fully/	CDC Announces Changes to the Definition of “Fully Vaccinated”

7nrw3	Sorry trolls and shills, I just won't let this issue die.  It's a simple problem: many of the people who have been parroting "double mask or you'll be LITERALLY DEAD!!!!", "keep the businesses closed forever, unless it's Amazon or Walmart", "3 experimental injections or you're not a citizen".... **these shrill narrative pushing crazies appear in the Podesta WikiLeaks at a level that can't be statistical coincidence.**  8.5 billion people on the planet, only hundreds are in the Podesta WikiLeaks. So why are so many of those people media and three-letter soup pushers of the pandemic narrative?  The overlap is actually extraordinary.  Take your favorite piece of garbage pushing the pandemic over at CNN, for instance. I'll use the name "Jake Tapper" as that's an anchor at CNN who has been towing the line pretty hard the last couple years.  [https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/](https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/)   Just search for his name, and voila.  That man has a relationship with spirit cooking John Podesta.  And Tapper is actually a good example of the weirdness I'm hinting at here, although I advise a very deep dive - search for all these FDA and CDC advisors who have been pushing the narrative. The number of them who dine with John Podesta is eye opening.  Tapper years ago wrote a book, a novel of only fiction he claimed, about a "club" or cult in DC that was literally Satanic - the Hellfire Club, as his book called it. The club took over the media, and three-letter regulatory agencies, and used things like sexual blackmail to keep everyone in line. Just a book! Fiction! Nothing to see here, folks!  Not only is the overlap surprising, the pushback is surprising, too.  Those emails are now 6 years old, incidentally LOL the same age as some of the girls these fucking DC creeps in their 70s were having delivered in the middle of the night "for entertainment."  Circumstantial evidence of literal child trafficking, and everyone else just looked the other way.

elxnmlmx	Just like last summer people are flying around the office asking each other about the "booster" shot.  For some reason people feel like getting the booster is a sort of right of passage, like it shows how brave you are if you go in to get your shot and people "respect" you for that. Like it's just one of those things you HAVE to do with no excuses like being called upon for jury duty or the military.  Have people ever stepped back and thought "If it has terrible side effects why am I signing up for it?". We've got perfectly healthy people playing Russian roulette for no FUCKING reason. Anyway to give you guys a glimpse these are the types of conversations happening in workplaces all over Canada:  *The lead engineer bolted out of his office and asked another guy "You said your wife got sick after the booster? Is she fine now what happened?"*  *He replied "Yeah she's mostly fine and getting better but she's still going through a lot"*   *Then he followed up with "Don't worry about it I got mine and I'm ok so far, which vaccine are you getting?"*  *Manager answers "Oh I've been Team Moderna all through and oh boy, huh, the first two shots took me out, I hope this one won't be as bad"*  Why put yourself through something you DON'T even need when everyone knows how bad the side effects of these crappy vaccines are? People are hurting themselves, women's periods are stopping, men are having heart problems, and clearly the shots aren't that SAFE AND EFFECTIVE are they?  Everyone knows how terrible they are, and all this for basically a harsh cold that can be remedied at home.

After 2 countries do it more countries will want to and feel it is okay to do it.

5y2lsb7t	Sorry reddit sub! Not a conspiracy theory just needed to vent out. Lol!     I'm fazed. Since when has a person's vaccination status ever been a basis of one's skills and quality of work? Is it better than a college degree? Are there any companies left that does not require for their onsite employees to take the jab?  I applied as a General Virtual Assistant here in the Philippines, so I passed the test and final interviews. It is office based; I am running out of options online. There is too much competition for work from home for the General VAs so I tried my luck at a company here and fortunately, I passed. Until they looked for my vaccination card.     Anyway, before I processed everything, I already told the company that I'm unvaccinated so that if they were against it, I wouldn't have wasted a week to go through tests & interviews. *They never said a thing about it. They never mentioned that they WANT all their onsite employees to be vaccinated.*      The company put me on hold for a week, previous reason was the training slots were full. I asked the human resource department this morning for a confirmation on when can I start, they said once the city is no longer on Alert Level 3 - they mentioned about the mayor publishing a mandate that all employees must be vaccinated but there's no such thing. I asked again if it will go down to Alert Level 2, can I start my training then? Then that's when the true reason came out: *They want their on site employees to be vaccinated so they are protected regardless of the alert level status.* I  just said, "Oh okay, just let me know when I can come in then. Thanks."      I'm so pissed because I know can do my tasks as a General VA well.

Then she asked to bring my covid pass but I told her that was not the requirement the time I applied for the internship. She said, since the law has changed [last week] so employers can now ask for covid passes.  I went to the head of the department & she too told me the same thing... So I left the place, changed my clothes and left. I knew they will kick me out so i kicked myself.  Despite feeling miserable I wana say 2 things.   1. Fuck covid, covidiotis & Covid passport. 2. Fuck Finland & Finnish gov is nothing but a slut house of pigs.	1643210876.0	sd8izy	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd8izy/biomedical_engineer_from_finland_here_just_lost/	Biomedical engineer from Finland here & just lost my internship because of Covid passport.

35ky5dqo	On the surface, Russia-NATO contention over Ukraine goes back for over a decade. Russia doesn't want Ukraine to join NATO because that would undermine their geopolitical position (imagine China and Mexico becoming military allies - even if it was purely defensive, Washington would not accept it).   The question is, why are tensions escalating so much *right now*? Yes, there is a degree of warhawk sabre-rattling to distract from domestic problems, but nevertheless Russia really has increased troops deployments on its border with Ukraine and made demands on the US (they want the US to remove some nukes from Europe and they want guarantees that Ukraine will never join NATO).  Two factors: First, [Nordstream 2](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/20/us-ukraine-russia-pipeline-500334) became operational in summer 2021. It brings gas natural straight from Russia to Germany.  The second factor is US inflation and interest rates. US interest rates are rock-bottom, well below inflation. Inflation is higher than it has been in four decades. This means people who buy US government bonds (ie loan money to the US federal government) lose purchasing power, because the interest they get is less than the value lost from inflation.  Washington has said it will sanction the shit out of Russia if it openly invades "Ukraine proper" (the parts not already controlled by Russia or its allied militias). *Maybe that is exactly what Russia wants*. Massive US sanctions on Russia right now would force European countries, especially Germany, to chose between going along or resisting the sanctions. If they go along, they lose Russian gas and their economy is boned. People could literally freeze to death. If Germany - the largest economy in Europe - resists US sanctions, it would create a major wedge between Germany and the US, helping Russia's position.   If Germany was forced by US sanctions on Russia to trade in a system that bypasses the US dollar, already existing US economic sanctions on Russia, and some of its friends like Iran, China, Venezuela, Syria ect., would start to lose their sting. Since inflation is so high in the US and interest rates are so low, it is a *perfect* time for Russia to try to undermine the position of the USD as the global reserve currency. If the USD loses its position, then Washington loses its strongest tool for trying to force other countries to bend to its will. This would benefit Russia enormously in the long run.	1643211001.0	sd8kpi	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd8kpi/theory_the_russian_government_will_openly_attack/	Theory: The Russian government will openly attack Ukraine because they WANT the US to impose drastic economic sanctions
29hhrln	I know this is unpopular amongst many readers here as many of you are fans of Crypto.  In short, the west is going to be releasing their own central bank backed digital-currency, currently dated around 2025 last I heard.  Prior to that there will be a massive push to demonize, and eventually outlaw the use of crypto currency. This move is already being televised if you are paying attention, they run stories about how terrorists use bitcoin or I have recently seen Sweden called to ban it in order to meet carbon goals.  The N-S-A released a 1995 paper on crypto currencies. Could the unified push by the Establishment Media and Anonymous inventor of bitcoin be the preparation for the rug pull to come?	1643211017.0	sd8kxu	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd8kxu/the_wealth_transfer_to_come/	The Wealth Transfer to come

2i5z6l	Had a talk with my girlfriend last night about her upcoming classes & she helped me come up with a theory, to some extent. For context, she is white & I’m half Ethiopian & half white.   Recently, probably last semester at the latest, the small college she attends added an “ethics history course” to her & all students graduation requirements, regardless of their plan to get an associates for transfer or their plan to get the one or two bachelor degrees offered. Mind you, this is a small college that about 10 years ago was a community college.   She checked the syllabus last night as the teacher finally got around to posting it even though the class technically started Monday. A majority of the course material centers around a book that has CRT in the title but jumbled around so you don’t actually read Critical Race Theory in that exact order.   She told me she’s not worried about potentially being forced to read rhetoric that dehumanizes her & all that but she’s more interested in seeing how other students react as she’s taking this course online (per college rules regarding vaxx status) & there may be discussion posts everyone has to take part in. From her perspective, she’s not tripping over the application of CRT nor it’s impact on her place in the classroom.   I, on the other hand, am fully aware of the fact that a majority of the countries with large white populations have the highest vaccination rates in comparison with countries with large populations of non whites with low or no vaccination rates. If we get super dark & assume myocarditis & the slew of other adverse affects truly kill off a lot of the vaccinated, that really makes whites people a minority in a census count in a nation with lax immigration policies.   She’s not as much of a conspiracy theorist, rabbit hole seeking person as I am but she agreed with me last night if we get that dark & run with the assumption that whites will be a noticeable minority in 5-10 years, CRT is the foundation of future segregation & state sponsored racism that will at the very least parallel other oppressive moments in history.   She agreed to let me essentially take the course with her so I can somewhat document the crazy shit the teacher/school peddles; I may or may not return with screenshots of course content.   Is there a way we as individuals can slow or even stop the implementation of CRT? The shit makes me sick to my stomach.	1643211471.0	sd8r2j	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd8r2j/crt_at_a_local_college/	CRT at a local college

29mb46rd	In most countries you have the right to smoke cigarettes and drink booze.  The facts are in.  People who abuse these drugs are more likely to have long term health consequences.  Despite the known health risks countless people decide to do this and abuse their bodies.      Users of those vices pay for this through higher taxes  on those products.  The facts are in.  People who are unvaxed are filling up hospitals and ICUs and sucking up medical capacity.  To deny this is to deny reality.    Therefore it makes sense for Unvaxed folks to pay a fee - especially in countries where COVID care is paid for by the gov.  Its just good governance.    So get vaxed, and do your part to keep the hospitals free for people with emergences.    or  Don't get vaxed and pay for that choice.

sqskn	I'm interested in the huge push for vaccination and coordinated campaign of pressure from world leaders and media moguls. I took a quick look at how the big drug companies stock performed since the pandemic started and saw a huge discrepancy between Moderna and everyone else, so I thought I'd take research a little bit about their key players.     [Moderna: in just over 1.5 years it has gone up 2850%, a 28x increase](https://i.imgur.com/61j8qWY.png)   [Pfizer: took 2 years to hit an all time high, a 70% increase, so 1.7x return](https://i.imgur.com/fnJiLlt.png)   [AstraZeneca: peaked at 30% gain in less than a year, still a 1.3x return](https://i.imgur.com/YujZC93.png)   Moderna gained nearly 3000%, when its competitors didn't even hit 100%? It could be that they're a smaller company, so it takes less to move their share price. Lots of companies that offered quick solutions, such as Zoom, made huge gains in a short period of time. Thing is, how were Moderna even in a position to so quickly capitalise on the pandemic in the first place? So I did some very quick research on the people involved.    &nbsp;  Kenneth Chien, another cofounder of Moderna. Currently a research director at Karolinska Institute, he got involved with Moderna while working at Harvard and also **co-founded the Institute of Molecular Medicine at Beijing's Peking University. His father served in the US Navy and went to Harvard and MIT, eventually becoming a senior scientist at DuPont.**  [Source](https://nwasianweekly.com/2021/09/moderna-co-founder-kenneth-chien-finds-silver-lining/)  &nbsp;  Robert Langer is one of the top individual shareholders and cofounders of Moderna, along with a long list of other biotechnology companies. He has a huge amount of awards and honours and a research lab at MIT. He is one of the worlds most highly cited researchers, with thousands of scientific papers and patents for various technologies. **He served as a member of the FDAs science board and as its chair from 1999 to 2002. A very well respected and connected guy, the perfect person to get quick FDA approval.**   [Source](https://www.investopedia.com/top-moderna-shareholders-5176519)  &nbsp;  Noubar Afeyan is a cofounder and chair of the board for Moderna. A senior lecturer at MIT and founder of numerous other biotechnology companies. **He is chairman of emerging technologies for the World Economic Forum, the guys that have an annual Davos meeting to discuss their "great reset" and "global redesign" initiatives.**  [Source](https://www.insidertrades.com/moderna-inc-stock/noubar-afeyan/)  &nbsp;  The CEO is Stéphane Bancel, a French billionaire that is one of the companies main shareholders. Previously he was sales director at Eli Lilly and Company (well known for Methadone and Prozac), he helped raise billions in private funding for Moderna. This is where it gets quite interesting, he was previously the CEO of a company called bioMérieux; another large biotechnology company headquartered in France. The founder of bioMérieux is a guy called Alain Mérieux, a billionaire doctor and businessman/entrepreneur. In 2018, Mérieux received the "Chinese Reform Friendship Award" for his "commitment to public health in China, particularly the fight against infectious diseases". Mérieux served as Co-President of the Franco-Chinese Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases, alongside the Minister of Health, Professor Chen Zhu. **In this role, Mérieux was instrumental in creating the high-security P4 Laboratory that opened in Wuhan in 2014.**  [Source - Bancel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Bancel)  [Source - Merieux](https://www.fondation-merieux.org/en/news/alain-merieux-receives-the-prestigious-chinese-reform-friendship-award/)  &nbsp;  So it turns out Moderna have some extremely influential scientists, that are well connected to get quick approval for their product. They also have a key member of the WEF. Their CEO joined in 2011 and is largely responsible for generating billions in private capital for the company, has significant ties with Alain Mérieux (one of his companies 'Transgene' also tried to work on mRNA vaccines years ago). The fact that Mérieux has such close ties with China and the creation of the infamous Wuhan lab really caught my attention and I've not seen this link made before. It certainly gets me thinking that something nefarious could be happening here, I think there is a lot more to this story as this was just some quick research.	1643212141.0	sd8zut	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd8zut/i_did_a_little_digging_on_moderna_here_is_some_of/	I did a little digging on Moderna, here is some of what I found

czf53	Is it possible that the deadliness of the virus is not actually what governments around the world are afraid of? Could the virus, a known piece of Chinese technology, be designed instead to infect as many people as possible without killing them or sickening them and those outcomes are actually unwanted? Could the virus instead be a sort of bio-data harvesting tool that would give immense informational power to whoever is receiving that data? Imagine being able to view physiological or biological data of everyone on earth from within their own bodies; the genomes, heart rates, circadian rhythms, blood pressure, skin conductance, or neurological responses (look into “neuromatketing”). Think of the data that Facebook receives on an everyday basis from its users but this data would be much more rich and flawlessly personal. I think governments around the world are terrified of this and do not want to admit that they are vast disadvantage not unlike the disadvantage a non-nuclear state has to a nuclear state.	1643212545.0	sd9552	/r/conspiracy/comments/sd9552/could_it_be_that_the_deadliness_of_the_virus_is/	Could it be that the deadliness of the virus is not what most governments around the world are afraid of?
